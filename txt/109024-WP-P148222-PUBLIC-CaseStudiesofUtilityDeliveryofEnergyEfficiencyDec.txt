Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report, produced for a World Bank project on energy efficiency in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region, includes detailed case studies of policy and regulatory mechanisms
implemented in six countries and regions to enable utilities to assist their customers to use
electricity more efficiently. The case studies were selected to demonstrate the wide range of
different approaches that have been adopted to enable utility delivery of end-use energy
efficiency. The purpose of the report is to provide detailed examples of relevant policy and
regulatory mechanisms that may, with suitable modification, be capable of effective
implementation in the MENA region.
The six case studies in the report describe relevant policy and regulatory mechanisms in the
following countries and regions: California; New South Wales, Australia; South Africa; China;
India; and Brazil.
California
Utility delivery of energy efficiency commenced in California more than 30 years ago and is now
the largest and oldest program of its kind in both the United States and the world. The long-
term California experience in utility delivery of energy efficiency represents close to the
maximum level of energy savings that can be achieved through this approach. The unique
feature in California is the comprehensive set of policy and regulatory mechanisms that has
been developed over many years through a unique collaborative process involving the two
regulatory agencies and the California legislature. This collaboration is the key to California’s
achievements and is the main lesson to be learnt by other jurisdictions seeking to emulate the
California results.
New South Wales, Australia
The New South Wales Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) and its predecessor together comprise the
longest-running energy efficiency certificate scheme in the world. The schemes’ combined
experience of more than 10 years has enabled progressive revision and refinement of scheme
parameters, including definitions of eligible energy efficiency measures, deemed energy savings
values, methodologies for calculating the numbers of certificates that can be created, and
scheme administrative procedures. These changes have established the ESS as an efficient and
cost-effective mechanism for delivering energy savings.
The ESS has successfully demonstrated two unique policy and regulatory mechanisms that assist
in the implementation of utility delivery of energy efficiency: trading of energy efficiency
certificates and the accreditation of third parties to achieve energy savings. Together these two
mechanisms have enabled the establish and development of an energy services industry in New
South Wales and have contributed to a major increase in the quantities of energy savings being
achieved in the state. Jurisdictions looking to establish a new energy services industry or expand
and existing one can learn a great deal from the experience of the NSW Energy Savings Scheme.
South Africa
In South Africa, impacts on system reliability have been a powerful motivator in delivering
capacity savings in the electricity system. In the years since the capacity crisis began, the major
electricity utility, Eskom, has far exceeded the load reduction and energy savings targets set by
the regulator, and in most years, exceeded its own expectations by a wide margin. After almost
a decade without material investment in new supply, Eskom embarked upon an aggressive plan
for price increases over time coupled with time-of-use pricing and inclining block rates that
complemented efforts to promote energy efficiency and DSM initiatives.

                                                                                                  vi
Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

In implementing utility delivery of energy efficiency, South Africa initially pursued pathways that
included heavy reliance on third party providers of energy efficiency services. However, the
ESCO model proved challenging for delivery, and most of the material energy savings achieved
did not rely heavily on ESCOs. The achieved reductions in demand were mostly achieved
through the mass market residential program initiatives targeting lighting and industrial
programs delivered by Eskom.
China
China’s grid company energy efficiency obligation is one of the latest examples worldwide that
uses a government-imposed obligation to ensure that utilities assist their customers to use
electricity efficiently. The implementation of the EEO in China has been particularly difficult
because of the very large size of the grid companies, their ability to influence the political
process, and their complete lack of any experience in delivering energy efficiency. Despite the
reluctance by the grid companies to engage with end-use energy efficiency, in both 2012 and
2013, they achieved their EEO energy savings and demand reduction targets though, given the
size of China, these results were not particularly ambitious. Jurisdictions looking to use a
government-imposed EEO in situations where there is no prior experience with utility delivery of
energy efficiency may learn useful lessons from the China case study.
India
India provides an example of close involvement by the central and state governments in the
development of a policy and regulatory framework to enable utility delivery of end-use energy
efficiency. The Government of India has established a solid foundation of sector reform and a
framework for delivering DSM that has been decades in the making. The framework relies
increasingly on electric distribution utilities, but also on the national government in the form of
the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). Oversight of the electric utilities and the regulations that
give form to the DSM activities are established by the state electricity regulatory authorities.
However, the energy efficiency and DSM industry in India is still at an early stage. Most of the
projects developed and implemented by the distribution utilities are pilot projects that provide a
foundation of experience that reduces uncertainty in achieving energy savings through
successive stages of program delivery.
Brazil
In Brazil, there is extensive involvement in energy efficiency and DSM by both the federal
government and by the electricity industry regulator, ANEEL. The federal government has
funded extensive energy efficiency programs through the majority state-owned national
electricity utility, Eletrobras. The regulator has imposed a progressively more stringent energy
efficiency obligation on electricity distribution utilities that has, in effect, created a public
benefits charge. Brazil is one of only a few developing nations that have created such a charge.
However, the target of only 10 percent cumulative energy savings by 2030 is a modest ambition
for utility energy efficiency programs by international standards. In Brazil, there appears to be
considerable opportunities for energy efficiency investments in buildings and industry and it
should be possible for utility energy efficiency programs to achieve savings in excess of the
target.
Conclusion
Energy utilities can play a key role in delivering end-use energy efficiency improvements.
Governments turn to energy utilities to deliver energy efficiency for several reasons. Utilities
have a strategic position in energy markets, often serving as an intermediary between energy
producers and energy consumers. They are well positioned to overcome the key barriers - lack

of awareness of the best energy efficiency measures, the “hassle factor” of procuring the
measures, and perceived risks in relation to performance and cost – that prevent consumers
from investing in energy efficiency.
The six case studies presented in this report were selected to share the experience of a wide
range of countries and regions located on five different continents, and a range of economies
reflecting a breadth somewhat similar to that found in the MENA region. The six countries and
regions either rely on, or are in the formative stages of developing, energy efficiency programs
that depend on utilities for funding and implementation. Countries and regions with the longest
history of experience in utility delivery of energy efficiency have a record of success that
typically continues to grow. Properly relied upon, utility energy efficiency programs can fit into a
deeper framework of investments in new technologies that includes supporting initiatives, such
as codes, standards, and energy performance labeling, to eventually achieve market
transformation in which energy efficiency becomes the norm.

1.         INTRODUCTION
Energy utilities will play a pivotal role over the coming decades in managing energy demand
growth and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2012, the International Energy Agency
projected, under its Efficient World Scenario, that the majority of the energy savings in the
power sector over the period to 2035 would come from decreased electricity demand rather
than from supply-side energy efficiency measures in the power sector (see Figure 1).




                                                                                                1
    Figure 1. Projections of Energy Savings in Electricity Generation Over the Period to 2035

In many countries, energy utilities play a central role in delivering end-use energy efficiency
improvements. In 2012, electricity and gas utilities in the United States and Canada spent
USD 8.0 billion on energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) programs,
representing a nine percent increase over 2011 expenditures. These programs were estimated
to have saved approximately 27,000 GWh of electricity and 425 million therms of gas in 2012,
which represented 21 million metric tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions. 2 In the United Kingdom,
annual spending by energy retailers under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT)
supplier obligation was about USD 1.6 billion in 2011, while the energy efficiency obligation
placed on energy utilities in Italy accounted for over USD 260 million annually in 2010 and
2011.3 Many other countries and regions including Belgium (Flanders), China, Denmark, France,
Korea, Poland, and three Australian States have introduced energy efficiency obligations
requiring energy utilities to achieve end-use energy savings. 4
Governments turn to energy utilities to deliver energy efficiency for several reasons. Utilities
have a strategic position in energy markets, often serving as an intermediary between energy
producers and energy consumers. Energy utilities have long‐standing commercial relationships
with even the smallest end‐use customers, allowing them to influence energy saving activities in

diffuse markets. Energy utilities have the technical capacity and infrastructure for delivering
services, by virtue of offices and facilities in their area of operations or service territory. Energy
utilities also enjoy name recognition by end‐users, and are often viewed as impartial or
objective sources of information and expertise. Energy utilities also possess detailed information
on the consumption habits of energy consumers, a useful resource when providing energy
savings advice. Finally, energy utilities produce very large revenue streams from selling energy
which can be an alternative to public budgets as a source of energy efficiency funding. 5
In short, energy utilities are well positioned to overcome the key barriers - lack of awareness of
the best energy efficiency measures, the “hassle factor” of procuring the measures, and
perceived risks in relation to performance and cost – that prevent consumers from investing in
energy efficiency.
This report, produced for a World Bank project on energy efficiency in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region, includes detailed case studies of policy and regulatory mechanisms
implemented in six countries and regions to enable utilities to assist their customers to use
electricity more efficiently. The case studies were selected to demonstrate the wide range of
different approaches that have been adopted to enable utility delivery of end-use energy
efficiency. The purpose of the report is to provide detailed examples of relevant policy and
regulatory mechanisms that may, with suitable modification, be capable of effective
implementation in the MENA region.

2.        CALIFORNIA UTILITY ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
2.1       Introduction
In North America, energy utilities began offering “energy conservation” programs during the
energy crises in the 1970s to help customers cope with soaring energy prices. Over time, this led
to the development of an expanded set of customer energy efficiency programs provided by
energy utilities. Since then, in the United States, energy efficiency has become recognized as an
integral and highly valuable element of utility investments and operations. Utility energy
efficiency programs have yielded significant energy and economic benefits to both energy
systems and energy customers. Today, energy efficiency is regarded as an important energy
system resource that can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money for customers, and
generate jobs. 6
In response to both economic concerns and climate change, legislators and regulators in North
America are now supporting the acquisition by utilities of energy efficiency as a energy system
resource at unprecedented levels. In the United States, electricity industry regulators are
instituting Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) that establish specific, long-term targets
for energy savings that utilities or non-utility program administrators must meet through
implementing customer energy efficiency programs. Beginning in about 2007, the United States
saw a substantial increase in the investments made by utilities in energy efficiency
corresponding with the expanding commitments by states to an EERS. Utility investments in
energy efficiency increased from USD 4.0 billion in 2008 to USD 7.2 billion by 2012. 7 By April
2014, 25 US states had enacted long-term (3+ years) EERSs. These 25 states make up nearly 60
percent of electricity sales in the United States. If each of these states maintains its current EERS
target out to 2020, the overall savings would be more than 232,000 GWh by 2020, equivalent to
over six percent of 2011 electricity sales throughout the United States. 8
The main reasons that public authorities in North America encourage energy efficiency resource
acquisition programs are to ensure least-cost resource development by energy utilities, reduce
environmental damage from energy use, enhance energy supply security, and lower the bills of
energy customers. The relative priority of these objectives varies across jurisdictions and these
varying priorities shape how utility energy efficiency programs are developed and implemented
in each jurisdiction. 9
California has long been a leading US state in terms of utility-sector customer energy efficiency
programs. Energy efficiency programs implemented by electricity utilities in California have been
in operation since the mid-1970s and have grown and evolved substantially over four decades.
During this period, per capita electricity consumption in California remained nearly flat, while
per capita consumption in the rest of the United States increased by over 50 percent (see
Figure 2). Although some of the difference between the Californian and national per capita
consumption may be explained by factors that are independent of energy policy, such as
changes in industry composition and average household size, a major contribution has been
made by utility-delivered energy efficiency programs.

There are four IOUs in California – Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison
Company, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, and Southern California Gas Company. These IOUs
administer energy efficiency programs with oversight by the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) which establishes key policies and guidelines, establishes targets for
statewide annual energy efficiency savings and demand reduction, sets program goals, and
approves spending levels. California's approximately 40 POUs, including municipal utilities,
electric cooperatives and irrigation districts, also administer customer energy efficiency
programs with similar oversight by the California Energy Commission (CEC). 12

2.2       Policy Objectives
California has established energy efficiency as its highest priority energy resource for
procurement of new resources. In 2003, the CPUC, in collaboration with the CEC and the
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (no longer in existence) issued the first
Energy Action Plan (EAP), 13 comprising a high‐level, coherent approach to meeting California’s
energy and natural gas needs. 14 The EAP is a “living” document, and there have been two
subsequent plans issued since 2003.
The initial EAP established a “loading order” 15 to define future efforts to meet California’s
energy needs. The loading order stipulated that the state would acquire first all cost-effective
efficiency resources, then cost-effective demand response, then use cost-effective renewable
resources, and only after that, use the more efficient conventional energy sources to meet new
load. 16 The loading order puts energy efficiency first because it is by definition the lowest-cost,
environmentally preferred resource. 17
In September 2008, the CPUC published the California Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic
Plan. 18 The Plan was developed through a collaborative process involving the CPUC’s four
regulated IOUs and over 500 individuals and organizations. The Plan establishes a roadmap for
energy efficiency in California through the year 2020 and beyond. It articulates a long-term
vision and goals for each economic sector and identifies specific near-term, mid-term and long-
term strategies to assist in achieving those goals.
The Plan employs energy efficiency market transformation as its unifying objective. Market
transformation is achieved when all cost-effective energy efficiency is adopted as a matter of
standard practice. 19 The Plan seeks to effect substantial and sustained progress towards more
efficient technologies and practices in each of the customer end use sectors by moving utilities,
the CPUC, and other stakeholders beyond a focus on short-term energy efficiency activities into
a more sustained long-term, market transformation strategic focus. 20

     Although the term “loading order” is often used to describe the dynamic process used by electricity
     system operators to meet demand on a short-term basis, in California the term is applied to the
     process whereby energy utilities acquire resources over the long term.

Additionally, the Plan recognizes that the process of energy efficiency market transformation
cannot, and should not, be driven by ratepayer-funded utility programs alone. While utilities will
play a continued role in stimulating market transformation across sectors, non-utility actors may
well be better positioned to drive the “push” of new technologies to market, or the “pull” for
customers and business to adopt available efficiency technologies or practices. 21
Table 1 shows the five policy tools for market transformation identified in the California Long
Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan.

               Table 1. Policy Tools for Market Transformation in California22
     • Customer Incentives including rebates; innovative or discounted financing;
        and/or non-financial support to consumers are the “carrots” that help pull
        consumers into choosing the efficient option.
     • Codes and Standards which mandate minimum efficiency thresholds for
        buildings, appliances and/or equipment, removing the less efficient choices from
        the marketplace are the “sticks” that push builders and manufacturers to provide
        efficient goods and services.
     • Education and Information through marketing, education and outreach inform
        market actors about energy efficiency opportunities. These programs often
        include labeling; benchmarking; internet-based comparisons; professional and
        trade materials; school curricula; peer-to-peer exchanges; and other resources.
     • Technical Assistance helps to ensure that knowledge barriers on the part of
        customers, installers or retailers are not unnecessarily hampering the progress of
        critical efficiency initiatives.
     • Emerging Technologies rely on research, development, demonstration and/or
        deployment to move energy-efficient products and developments from the
        laboratory into the commercial marketplace.

To guide energy efficiency market transformation in a number of key sectors, the Plan embraces
four specific programmatic goals, known as the “Big Bold” energy efficiency strategies (see Table
2). These goals were selected not only for their potential impact, but also for their easy
comprehension and their ability to galvanize market players. 23

               Table 2. California’s “Big Bold” Energy Efficiency Strategies24
     1. All new residential construction in California will be zero net energy by 2020.
     2. All new commercial construction in California will be zero net energy by 2030.
     3. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning will be transformed to ensure that its
          energy performance is optimal for California’s climate.
     4. All eligible low-income customers will be given the opportunity to participate in
          the low income energy efficiency program by 2020.

2.3       Legal Authority
The energy efficiency and demand response aspects of the loading order policy were codified by
legislation in 2005. 25 The legislation requires the procurement plans developed by each of
California’s four investor-owned utilities to first meet the utility’s unmet resource needs through
all available energy efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost-effective, reliable,
and feasible. In 2006, Californian legislation required both IOUs and POUs to acquire all cost-
effective energy efficiency identified by the CPUC and CEC. 26

2.4       Coverage
Utilities in California implement a broad range of energy efficiency programs directed to
customers across all sectors of the economy: residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural
and covering both electricity and natural gas. Utilities also implement programs advocating and
facilitating the adoption of energy efficiency codes and standards, particularly by supporting the
transition of new energy-efficient products and practices into code-appropriate industry
standards. 27

2.5       Energy Savings Targets
Following California’s 2001 electricity crisis, the main state resource agencies worked together
with the state’s utilities and other key stakeholders to develop energy savings goals for the
state’s IOUs. The CPUC formalized goals in September 2004 that called for cumulative electrical
energy savings by 2013 of 23,000 GWh and cumulative peak electricity demand reductions of
4,900 MW from programs operated over the 2004 to 2013 period. The natural gas goals were
set at annual gas savings of 67 million therms by 2013. 28 These long term savings goals were
developed from analysis of technical and economic potential conducted between 2002 and
2004, and were deliberately set as “stretch goals”. 29
In 2008, the CPUC developed new electric and natural gas goals for years 2012 through 2020,
which call for 16,300 GWh of cumulative gross electrical energy savings, a cumulative electricity
demand reduction of 4,541 MW, and 619 million therms of cumulative gross gas savings over
the nine-year period. 30
In 2013, the CPUC updated energy saving goals for the years 2015 to 2024, and identified
approximately 21,800 GWh of cumulative electrical energy savings, 4,000 MW of cumulative
peak demand reduction, and 550 million therms of cumulative gas savings. 31

2.6       Energy Efficiency Activities
In California, there are four primary customer sectors: residential, commercial, industrial and
agricultural. In designing their energy efficiency programs, the utilities consider energy savings
potentials and design programs to capture savings for these customer sectors. Within the
policies, guidelines and targets set by the CPUC and the CEC, individual utilities determine the
markets in which they will offer energy efficiency programs across all four economic sectors.

Programs are designed to address specific barriers to energy efficiency that have been identified
in each market.
CPUC Decision 09-09-047 approved utility energy efficiency portfolio plans for the period 2010
to 2012 designed to support the Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan. In particular, the
CPUC required the IOUs to administer 12 statewide programs that will be consistent throughout
all the obligated utilities’ service areas as well as some local and pilot programs. 32 The statewide
programs include an array of energy efficiency measures in the following categories: residential;
commercial; industrial; agricultural; new construction; lighting; heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning; codes and standards; DSM integration and coordination; workforce education and
training; marketing, education, and outreach; and emerging technologies.

2.7       Marketing, Education and Outreach
The Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan outlined a vision for Californians “engaged as
partners in the state’s energy efficiency, demand-side management and clean energy effort”.
This led to the launch of the website Engage360.com as part of the 2010 to 2012 energy
efficiency program cycle. 33 Engage360 was intended to coordinate statewide energy efficiency
efforts under one umbrella brand, integrating messaging and access points for target audiences.
In October 2011, the CPUC discontinued funding of the Engage360 brand and ended the
program, finding that the brand was confusing and had failed to gain traction. 34
In May 2012, the CPUC decided to broaden the Energy Upgrade California 35 program, developed
in 2011 by CPUC and CEC staff, to become the statewide “one-stop shop” for whole building
upgrades, demand response, distributed generation, and low income programs. 36
In addition to Energy Upgrade California, there were two types of marketing, education and
outreach (ME&O) activities implemented during the 2010 to 2012 program cycle: (1) IOU “local”
marketing targeting IOU-specific regional audiences and (2) Statewide programs with universal
messaging across California. Under the IOU-specific approach, each individual energy efficiency
program had a marketing budget that was administered either as part of each individual
program, or through an integrated marketing and outreach effort throughout the relevant IOU’s
geographical territory. 37
While a formal evaluation of the ME&O activities implemented during the 2010 to 2012 energy
efficiency program cycle had not been completed as at October 2014, four trends have been
identified 38:
• face-to-face marketing efforts have proven highly effective for the Energy Upgrade California
  program, while advertising has resulted in high awareness of the program statewide;
• the most effective messages for Energy Upgrade California program participants are focused
  on comfort, incentives and lowering energy bills;
• in the 2010 to 2012 program cycle, IOUs began to take an integrated approach to their
  marketing materials, including energy efficiency, demand response, and on-site generation;

• IOUs engaged in segmented marketing to their own ratepayers, producing more materials
  targeting homeowners, business owners, low income residents, industrial customers, and
  other segments.

2.8       Funding
From 1996 to 2011, California's utilities used to collect a public goods charge on customer utility
bills to fund utility energy efficiency programs. The charge represented an electricity system
benefit charge of about USD 0.003/kWh, capped at three per cent of a customer’s bill; a natural
gas DSM charge was also applied to the customer’s bill. The public goods charge was not
reauthorized by the California Legislature in 2011, and Governor Brown directed the CPUC to
pursue continuation of funding for these programs before the charge expires. About one-
quarter of the utility energy efficiency portfolio budgets is funded by the public goods charge;
the remaining majority of the utility energy efficiency programs is funded through utility
resource procurement funds and is unaffected by the expiration of the charge. 39
Utility resource procurement budgets are recovered through rate cases brought before the
CPUC. In September 2009, the CPUC approved a USD 3.1 billion IOU energy efficiency program
budget for 2010 to 2012 – a 42 per cent increase over the previous three-year period. 40 The
publicly-owned utilities budgeted USD 150 million for the fiscal 2008 to 2009 year. Four per cent
of the energy efficiency budget is allocated to evaluation, measurement, and verification
(EM&V) of energy savings.
In addition, from 2010 to 2012, USD 260 million in funding was directed to non-utility
government agencies for local efforts targeting public sector building retrofits and innovative
energy efficiency opportunities, and USD 175 million was earmarked to launch California’s
programs to achieve zero net energy homes and buildings. 41

2.9       Results
The latest results available, as of October 2014, for the energy savings achieved through energy
efficiency programs undertaken by California IOUs are for the years 2010 and 2011. These
results are officially classified as “estimates” because verified results are not yet available. 42
Some independent evaluations carried out after the end of a program cycle result in significant
changes to the energy saving values initially claimed by the IOUs.
Table 3 shows the estimated electricity peak demand reductions, electricity savings, and natural
gas savings based on the IOUs’ reported (but, as yet unverified) results for all IOU energy
efficiency programs from program activity through December 2011. These are first year savings
rather than savings over the lifetime of the energy efficiency measures. The first year electrical
energy saving of 1.81% of retail sales is one of the highest in the world for utility-delivered
energy efficiency.

Figure 4 shows the distribution across customer sectors of the estimated energy savings from
IOU energy efficiency programs, excluding codes and standards programs. Eighty-nine percent
of electrical energy savings achieved through 2011 occurred in the commercial (55 percent) and
residential (34 percent) sectors, with the agricultural and industrial sectors combined making up
the remaining 11 percent of savings. 44 The majority of natural gas savings occurred in the
commercial and industrial sectors. Gas use in the residential sector actually increased during this
period, as shown by the negative value. This was caused by extra gas being used for space
heating when incandescent lights (which generate heat) are replaced.
In addition to these customer-specific interventions, IOU programs oriented to promoting
energy efficiency codes and standards represented approximately 38 percent of total portfolio
energy savings when all customer sectors are combined. 45

Table 4 shows the distribution of energy savings achieved through IOU energy efficiency
programs across different technology applications. The technologies that drive savings vary
across different customer sectors and segments. However, some technologies, such as high
efficiency lighting and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), are prevalent across all
portfolios of IOU energy efficiency programs. Through 2011, the majority of electrical energy
savings were achieved through lighting (59 percent), followed by HVAC (13 percent) and process
improvements (10 percent). Natural gas savings were primarily achieved through process
improvements in the industrial sector, where 47 percent of the savings are generated. 47 In some
technology applications, natural gas use actually increased, which is shown in Table 4 as
negative percentage figures; the positive percentage figures for gas savings have to be adjusted
to take account of the negative figures.

2.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
Because California energy utilities can receive substantial financial payments (incentives) based
on their performance in achieving energy savings, EM&V of utility energy efficiency programs is
taken very seriously.
The Energy Division of the CPUC oversees the energy efficiency portfolios implemented by the
investor-owned utilities. Beginning in 2006, the Commission directed its Energy Division to
conduct evaluations that are specifically tied to the impacts (energy savings, costs and
emissions) of the IOU portfolios. Prior to 2006, the utilities evaluated these programs
themselves with limited Energy Division oversight. 50 The Energy Division organizes evaluations
of all IOU energy efficiency programs plus relevant research studies. Some of the evaluations
and research studies are undertaken by the Energy Division itself; for others the Energy Division
engages independent contractors.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Each IOU submits annual reports to the CPUC on the energy savings they claim to have achieved
through each energy efficiency program. The savings claims are subject to a variety of field
validation and verification to understand what was actually achieved “on the grid.” The field
research is important to validate the actual impacts of the investments and inform future
updates to savings estimates and improvements in program design. Evaluation also includes an
assessment of the program influence in achieving the savings over what would have happened
without the program intervention (i.e., the evaluation studies estimate “net savings” that are
directly achieved by the program intervention as compared to “gross savings” that result from
all factors affecting energy use). This information is used to understand the relative cost-
effectiveness of the programs and transitions in the market. 51
For the 2010 to 2012 program cycle, the CPUC oversaw the implementation of a joint evaluation
plan with the IOUs, 52 that allocated USD 93 million in project funds (net of management costs)
to roughly 80 studies that addressed key research needs. Studies were focused on four core
research areas: 53
• Savings measurement and verification of energy efficiency measures and programs which
  inform core metrics of energy savings against goals, and cost effectiveness, as well as
  developing reliable estimates of load impacts;
• Program evaluation of specific qualitative and quantitative factors of program performance,
  to inform improvements in program design and support forward-looking corrections to utility
  energy efficiency programs and portfolios;
• Market assessments that gauge current market situations that inform savings baselines,
  identify and track appropriate baseline metrics of market change, measure progress toward
  achieving the objectives in the Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan, and inform
  estimates of the remaining potential for energy efficiency; and
• Policy and planning support that includes overarching studies to inform CPUC policy.
Publicly-owned utilities also submit reports on the energy savings they claim to have achieved
through energy efficiency programs. Each POU is required by statute to report annually to its
customers and to the CEC on the results of an independent evaluation that measures and
verifies the energy efficiency savings and reduction in energy demand achieved by its energy
efficiency and demand reduction programs. 54

2.11 Cost-Effectiveness
California legislation requires both IOUs and POUs to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency
identified by the CPUC and CEC. 55 The methodology used for determining the cost-effectiveness
of energy efficiency programs is the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test described in the Standard
Practice Manual 56, which was developed in California for evaluating utility-delivered DSM
programs and is now used in many other jurisdictions in the United States and around the
world.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Utilities in California use the TRC test prior to implementing an energy efficiency program to
check whether the energy savings are likely to be cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of the
energy savings claimed for each IOU energy efficiency program is also calculated ex post using
the TRC test. An overall cost-benefit ratio of 2.02 was calculated for the estimated statewide
energy savings achieved by IOU energy efficiency programs between 2010 and 2011. 57

2.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
To enable utilities to take a large role in implementing energy efficiency programs, California
provides a “shared savings” incentive mechanism for IOUs. The version of shared savings
adopted in 2007, was called the “risk/return incentive mechanism” (RRIM) and was designed to
align ratepayer and shareholder interests by creating a significant reward or penalty for IOUs’
success or failure in meeting the CPUC’s targets for reducing customer demand for electricity
and natural gas. 58
The RRIM was calculated for each investor-owned utility based on how well it met the energy
saving targets and the economic benefits generated from its energy efficiency portfolio. IOUs
were eligible for the RRIM if they achieved 80 to 85 per cent of CPUC energy saving targets and
could earn larger incentives if they exceeded the targets. Penalties might be triggered if savings
were below 65 per cent of the CPUC energy saving targets. For the 2006 to 2008 program cycle,
total potential incentives were capped at USD 450 million (less than one per cent of total sales)
for the four utilities combined. Two interim payments were provided, first after verifying actual
energy efficiency measures installed and program costs, then after evaluation, measurement,
and verification studies document projected per-measure savings. Thirty per cent of the total
incentive was held back pending a final post-installation EM&V “true-up”. 59
There is now a new incentive mechanism, adopted in 2012, called Energy Savings Performance
Incentives (ESPI) which pays out based on units of energy saved, instead of as a percent of goals.
For energy savings achieved, utilities can earn a performance-based award of up to nine percent
of energy efficiency program expenditures (minus codes and standards program expenditures).
ESPI also added some small amount of bonuses for complying with CPUC procedures. 60

2.13 Response to Stress Situations
Utility-delivered energy efficiency was a key resource in responding to the crisis in California’s
energy markets during 2001. In January 2001, the Governor of California, Gray Davis, declared a
state of emergency, announcing that electricity supply shortages would lead to rolling blackouts
in the summer. In April 2001, the North American Electric Reliability Council predicted that
California should expect 260-700 hours of rolling blackouts. Various sources predicted that
electricity shortages would cause major disruptions to California’s economy with estimates of
economic damage ranging from USD 2 billion to over USD 20 billion. Yet, during summer 2001,
rolling blackouts were never implemented. 61
In response to the crisis situation, California’s energy utilities explicitly targeted many of their
2001 energy efficiency programs to provide immediate electricity savings and peak demand
reductions; this involved increased funding for, and redesign of, some programs. The CPUC

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

authorized the IOUs to spend approximately USD 320 million from the public goods charge on
energy efficiency programs during 2001 and established a peak demand savings goal of 250
MW. The utilities also received about USD 105 million of incremental funding from general tax
revenues for energy efficiency programs as part of “emergency” legislation passed by the State
Legislature. An analysis carried out the year after the crisis events concluded that California’s
energy efficiency services delivery infrastructure, which was strengthened by years of ratepayer
and State-funded programs, represented a significant resource that was ramped up quickly to
respond to a short-term energy emergency. 62

2.14 Overall Effectiveness
Utility delivery of energy efficiency commenced in California more than 30 years ago and is now
the largest and oldest program of its kind in both the United States and the world. Various
assessments carried out in the late 2000s concluded that California energy efficiency programs
provided nearly USD 5 billion in net benefits to customers statewide over the preceding decade
and that the programs provided the cheapest, cleanest resource available to meet California’s
energy needs, costing less than USD 0.03/kWh, or less than half the CPUC’s then benchmark for
base load power. 63 Additional programs targeted specifically to help lower-income households
improve their energy efficiency and lower their energy bills reached more than 1.6 million
households over the preceding decade, or more than 40% of all eligible participants. 64
These assessments, together with the high level of energy savings achieved, compared with
other jurisdictions, show that utility-delivered energy efficiency programs in California are highly
effective.

2.15 Lessons Learnt
The long-term California experience in utility delivery of energy efficiency represents close to
the maximum level of energy savings that can be achieved through this approach. The unique
feature in California is the comprehensive set of policy and regulatory mechanisms that has
been developed over many years through a unique collaborative process involving the two
regulatory agencies and the California legislature. This collaboration is the key to California’s
achievements and is the main lesson to be learnt by other jurisdictions seeking to emulate the
California results.

3.        NEW SOUTH WALES ENERGY SAVINGS SCHEME
3.1       Introduction
New South Wales (NSW) is one of three Australian states that have implemented energy
efficiency obligation (EEO) schemes. In January 2003, the NSW Government implemented the
first mandatory greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world, the Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Scheme (GGAS). GGAS included an energy efficiency component that effectively
established an EEO scheme in NSW with targets denominated in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent (tCO2-e) rather than in energy units. 65
Under GGAS, parties obligated to meet specified carbon emissions reduction targets could
create NSW Greenhouse Abatement Certificates (NGACs) by targeting:
• low emission electricity generation;
• demand-side abatement (mostly energy efficiency);
• emissions abatement by large end-users; and
• carbon sequestration through forestry.
Those NGACs created through energy efficiency projects were effectively energy efficiency
certificates 66 and could be traded, thereby establishing the first operating energy efficiency
certificate trading scheme in the world. 67
Despite growth in demand-side abatement activities under GGAS, the NSW Government
recognized that significant barriers to energy efficiency persisted. From 1 July 2009,
demand-side abatement was no longer credited under GGAS and, instead, transitioned into a
separate, expanded EEO scheme called the Energy Savings Scheme (ESS).
The ESS is a standalone energy efficiency certificate trading scheme that requires obligated
parties to meet specified annual energy efficiency targets. The ESS was established to expand
the original demand-side abatement provisions under GGAS and was originally planned to
operate until 2020 unless a national energy efficiency scheme with similar objectives is
implemented in Australia before that time. In November 2014, the NSW Government
announced that it intends to extend the ESS to 2025. 68
Parties obligated under the ESS are known as “Liable Entities”. There are three groups of Liable
Entities, who are also mandatory scheme participants: 69
• all holders of NSW electricity retail licenses (i.e., electricity retailers);
• electricity generators that supply electricity directly to retail customers in NSW; 70 and
• market customers in NSW who purchase their electricity directly from the wholesale
  Australian National Electricity Market.

     Energy efficiency certificates are also known as “white certificates,” “white tags,” “energy savings
     certificates,” and “energy efficiency credits.”
67
     Legislation for the Italian energy efficiency certificate trading scheme was passed in 1999, but the
     scheme did not start operating until January 2005.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Organizations involved in emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries, or carrying out such
activities, may be granted full or partial exemptions from their obligations under the ESS.
Liable Entities must meet individual annual energy savings targets based on their electricity
market share in NSW. Each Liable Entity must calculate its individual energy savings target, and
then meet that target through the surrender of NSW Energy Savings Certificates (ESCs). If a
Liable Entity does not surrender sufficient ESCs to meet its target, it will be liable to pay a
shortfall penalty. 71 Figure 5 explains how the ESS operates by tracking the typical lifecycle of an
ESC.




                                                                                                             72
Figure 5. Lifecycle of an Energy Savings Certificate in the NSW Energy Savings Scheme

Each ESC represents one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) abated by energy
saving activities. The number of ESCs required to meet an individual Liable Entity target is
calculated by multiplying total liable electricity sales 73 in MWh by the state-wide energy saving
target for the year, multiplied by the individual scheme participant’s share of liable electricity
sales, and then multiplied by a Certificate Conversion Factor based on the average emissions
intensity of electricity in New South Wales. 74 The ESS legislation sets the Certificate Conversion
Factor at 0.94 until 2020, but the NSW Governor may amend the Act to change this number on
the advice of the responsible Minister. 75
Under the ESS, organizations with expertise in helping other businesses to reduce electricity use
can apply to become Accredited Certificate Providers (ACPs). ACPs are voluntary participants in
the ESS and are eligible to create and sell ESCs from energy savings projects. The number of ESCs
that can be created depends on the type of project and energy efficiency measures

72
     Sniffin (2012).
73
     To calculate liable electricity sales, sales to exempt industries or activities are subtracted from the
     total electricity sales in NSW.
74
     The Certificate Conversion Factor is a multiplier used in all ESC calculations to convert energy savings,
     in megawatt-hours to tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent. In NSW, for every MWh of electricity
     produced, approximately 0.94 tonnes of carbon-dioxide is released into the atmosphere. As the
     generation mix in NSW changes from primarily coal-based to include more gas and renewables, this
     multiplier will decrease to reflect the lower emissions from electricity generation.

implemented. ACPs are subject to the conditions of their accreditation, which set out their
compliance obligations 76. Liable Entities may apply to be accredited as ACPs.

3.2       Policy Objectives
The legislation under which the ESS was established states that the principle objective of the
scheme is to create a financial incentive to reduce the consumption of electricity by encouraging
energy saving activities. Other objectives are: 77
• to assist households and businesses to reduce electricity consumption and electricity costs;
• to complement any national scheme for carbon pollution reduction by making the reduction
  of greenhouse gas emissions achievable at a lower cost, and
• to reduce the cost of, and the need for, additional energy generation, transmission and
  distribution infrastructure.
In August2013, the NSW Government published the NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP). 78
The EAAP represents a shift to a more open and competitive market-based delivery of energy
efficiency services that provide assistance to customers through their existing service providers.
The EEAP details 30 actions to deliver savings on energy bills and reduce pressure on future
prices.
The EEAP places the ESS at the centre of the NSW Government’s intended actions on energy
efficiency. Of the 30 actions identified, seven relate directly to the ESS. The EEAP includes a
target to assist businesses and households to realise annual energy savings of 16,000 GWh by
2020. Figure 6 shows the expected contribution by various programs, including the ESS, to
achieving this target.

3.3      Legal Authority
The ESS is governed by a combination of legislation and regulation. The Scheme was established
under Part 9 of the Electricity Supply Act 1995 (the Act) 80 and Part 6 of the Electricity Supply
(General) Regulation 2014 (the Regulation). 81 The Scheme Administrator administers the
scheme according to the legislation and the Energy Savings Scheme (Amendment No. 2) Rule
2014 (ESS Rule). 82
The Act sets out the legal and technical framework of the ESS and also sets out the functions and
responsibilities of the Scheme Administrator and Scheme Regulator. The Act is supported by the
Regulation, which describes the core functions of the Scheme Administrator and the Scheme
Regulator. For the Scheme Administrator, the Regulation sets requirements for accrediting and
auditing ACPs, and rules around the creation and transfer of ESCs. For the Scheme Regulator,
the Regulation provides the principles governing compliance with the individual energy savings
targets for Liable Entities. 83
The ESS Rule applies to ACPs and their energy savings projects. It provides detail about eligibility
requirements for ACPs, and calculation methods for determining the number of ESCs that can be
created through different types of projects.
The Act also allows the Minister to grant full or partial exemption from the ESS for any electricity
load used in conjunction with emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries or activities,
including: manganese production; ammonia production; ceramic floor and wall tile production;
magnetite concentrate production; petroleum refining; and ethene production. 84 The exemption
is provided by a Ministerial Order, 85 as gazetted from time to time. The Order lists the exempted
sites, their location, the emissions-intensive trade-exposed activity being carried out, and the
proportion of exemption granted. A further deduction is allowed for network losses. As part of
the Ministerial Order, the Minister also authorizes the Scheme Regulator to make rules about
assessing deductions of exempt loads by Liable Entities.
The NSW Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) carries out the functions of both
the Scheme Administrator and the Scheme Regulator. The NSW Department of Trade and
Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services has responsibility for policy development in
relation to the ESS and ultimate responsibility for any legislative changes introduced to the ESS
and is also responsible for recommending any Rule changes to the Minister for Resources and
Energy. The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage provides policy support and makes
recommendations on further development of the ESS.

3.4      Coverage
As of November 2014, the ESS covers only electricity. Electricity savings from the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors and from all premises and facilities within these sectors are
eligible to contribute to ESS targets. In November 2014, the NSW Government announced that,
during 2015, it intends to expand the ESS to include gas. 86

3.5          Energy Savings Targets
The ESS energy saving targets were established through amendments to the Electricity Supply
Act. Table 6 shows that in 2009, the first year of the ESS, the target was set to 0.4 percent of
total electricity sales in New South Wales, expressed in MWh. This target is calculated on the
basis of the total energy savings achieved over the lifetimes of each energy efficiency measure
implemented. The target increases gradually over time, reaching four percent of total sales in
2014, and continuing at that level through 2020. Targets are specified in Schedule 5 to the Act,
and are subject to amendment by the NSW Governor on the recommendation of the relevant
Minister. Any such regulation must be made at least 12 months in advance.

3.6          Energy Efficiency Activities
Energy savings that are eligible to meet ESS targets are created through energy savings projects
carried out by ACPs. Parties seeking accreditation must submit an application for a particular
energy savings project. There is an AUD 500 fee for a project to become accredited. The purpose
of accreditation is to filter out projects that are unlikely to result in the creation of Energy
Savings Certificates.
The application for accreditation must contain information on the energy saving activities
included in the project for which accreditation is sought, including details of the methodologies
to be applied to calculate the number of ESCs that can be created from each activity. The
application for accreditation must demonstrate that the proposed activities meet the
requirements of the ESS as Recognised Energy Savings Activities (RESAs). 88 Clause 5.3 of the ESS
Rule defines the requirements for an energy saving activity to be eligible for accreditation as a
RESA. A RESA is any activity that increases the efficiency of electricity consumption by: 89

• modifying end-user equipment or the usage of end-user equipment with the result that there
  is a reduction in the consumption of electricity compared to what would have otherwise
  been consumed;
• replacing end-user equipment with other equipment that consumes less electricity;
• installing new end-user equipment that consumes less electricity than other comparable
  equipment of the same type, function, output or service; or
• removing end-user equipment with the result that there is a reduction in the consumption of
  electricity compared to what would have otherwise been consumed, provided that the ACP
  does not refurbish, re-use or resell that equipment.
In addition, a RESA must:
• not result in a reduction in electricity consumption by reducing production or service levels
  (including safety levels);
• be implemented at a site or sites in the state of New South Wales or in a jurisdiction with an
  approved similar scheme to the ESS 90; and
• not be unlawful to carry out.
Before a RESA can be implemented, the ACP must be accredited for the RESA; and the ACP must
be the original Energy Saver or be nominated by the original Energy Saver. The original Energy
Saver is defined by the ESS Rule as: 91
• the purchaser of the upgrade or equipment;
• the person contractually liable to pay for the energy consumption at the site where the
  energy saving activity occurs;
• the retailer for the sale of new appliances;
• the person contracted to remove old appliances; or
• the person on the NABERS Rating Certificate where the National Australian Built Environment
  Rating System (NABERS) is used to calculate the number of ESCs that can be created from a
  project.
The ESS Rule also defines the following activities as specifically excluded from the Scheme: 92
• activities undertaken to comply with any statutory requirement;
• activities that reduce the scope or quantity of production or service from the use of
  electricity, such as closing part of a factory;
• the purchase of Green Power;
• activities that are eligible to create energy savings certificates or Renewable Energy
  Certificates at the point of generation;
• reducing electricity consumption through electricity generation or fuel switching.

• Reactive – sourcing ESCs where possible by working with ACPs and brokers;
• Proactive – getting involved in ACP activity, and looking to improve relationships with their
  customers by undertaking energy efficiency projects and claiming ESCs;
• Paying penalties – in a few cases, retailers simply paid penalties. However, most retailers
  made efforts to avoid paying penalties because of the negative connotations involved.
Consequently, with the exception of proactive retailers, most marketing, education and
outreach (ME&O) activities are implemented by ACPs who identify opportunities for energy
savings projects and then seek to persuade facility owners to allow the projects to be carried out.

3.8      Funding
For Liable Entities, the costs of meeting their ESS targets are implicitly assumed to be costs of
doing business and, where possible, are passed on to customers.
For ACPs, funds to carry out energy savings projects are obtained by selling ESCs. Parties
interested in buying ESCs include: 94
• Liable Entities, who are required to acquire and surrender sufficient ESCs to meet their
  individual ESS targets, or pay a penalty. The number of ESCs required by a Liable Entity
  depends on their compliance obligations;
• intermediary agents who might subsequently sell the ESCs to Liable Entities;
• organizations or individuals interested in voluntarily purchasing ESCs as offsets to manage
  their carbon footprints.
The Scheme Administrator does not get involved in any market transactions or negotiations
involved in buying and selling ESCs but does facilitate the market by managing ACPs and Liable
Entities. The Scheme Administrator also operates a registry, which is a web-based database that
tracks the creation, ownership transfer, and surrender of ESCs. The registry is not a trading
platform. ACPs are authorized by the Scheme Administrator to create a set number of ESCs for
each energy savings project they implement, and they can do this through the registry when a
project has been completed. The registration fee is AUD 0.70 per ESC and the revenue from this
fee covers the majority of the administrative costs of the ESS.
Anyone who owns ESCs can negotiate directly with Liable Entities or other parties to sell their
ESCs. Some Liable Entities require small numbers of certificates to meet their compliance
obligations, and prefer to negotiate with sellers directly to avoid dealing with standard parcel
sizes (typically 5,000 ESCs) traded in wholesale markets. Most ESCs are traded through bilateral
contracts between an ACP and a buyer. 95
As at October 2014, there are no standard contracts for trading ESCs or a recognized trading
exchange, but three types of contracts are commonly used:
• Spot contract – a contract for a physical exchange of a specified quantity of ESCs at an
  agreed price.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

• Forward contract – a contract for the exchange of a specified quantity of ESCs at a
  predetermined price on a fixed date.
• Option contract – the buyer pays the seller a premium to acquire a right, but not the
  obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a quantity of ESCs at a predetermined
  price.
The price of ESCs varies due to supply and demand and can fluctuate considerably depending on
market conditions. There is no obligation to disclose the prices paid for ESCs, though some
brokers provide regular updates on spot market prices for ESCs. Historically, ESCs have traded at
prices around AUD 14.00 to AUD 32.00. 96 Figure 7 shows spot market prices for ESCs from the
commencement of the ESS.

3.9      Results
Table 7 (page 24) shows the number of ESCs created in the ESS between July 2009 and June
2013 by the type of energy savings project. Over this period, a total of 8,826,129 ESCs were
created.
When an energy savings project is completed, the ACP is authorized by the Scheme
Administrator to create set numbers of ESCs over specified time periods relating to the lifetimes
of the energy efficiency measures implemented in the project. Because, in some cases, ESCs may
be created in advance of actual savings, calculating the energy savings achieved under the ESS
requires pro-rating the ESCs created in any year across the forward creation period of the
relevant energy savings measures. The Scheme Administrator estimates that as a result of ESCs
created between 2009 and 2013, the ESS achieved, and will achieve, actual energy savings of: 98
• 1,619,407 MWh during the period 2009-2012;
• 1,206,574 MWh during 2013, and
• 5,500,556 MWh over the period 2014 to 2023.

Table 7 shows that the large majority of ESCs in the ESS were created through energy-efficient
lighting projects. A common occurrence in energy efficiency certificate schemes is that most
certificates are created through the implementation of energy efficiency measures that are low-
cost to implement. This has been observed in the New South Wales and Victorian schemes in
Australia, and in the Italian scheme. 100 Concentrating on installing low-cost measures can result
in higher-cost measures that may save more energy over time being ignored. Also, energy
projects that install only low-cost measures at a site may render financially unviable returning to
the same site at another time to install higher-cost measures. Several schemes have attempted
to resolve these problems by changing the parameters of eligible energy savings activities.
Under the Demand Side Abatement Rule in GGAS, most of the energy savings in the residential
sector were created through projects in which compact fluorescent lamps and water-efficient
showerheads were sold at a discount or given away free of charge to households by firms that
purchased the appliances in bulk and generated a profit by selling the resulting certificates that
were assigned to them by householders. 101
In establishing the ESS, particular attention was paid to minimising the opportunities for large-
scale distribution of low-cost energy-efficient appliances. Compact fluorescent lamps were not
included as a RESA and procedures were established to identify instances in which a large
number of showerheads were replaced at a single address, or in which installations were
claimed by more than one ACP at a single address. Where duplicates were discovered for an
individual address, only the first installation was recognised and all subsequent installations
were deemed as invalid. In 2011, showerhead replacement activities were removed from the
ESS. In 2014, the installation of energy efficient showerheads was reinstated to ESS, but only as
part of a Home Energy Efficiency Retrofit in which a bundle of energy efficiency products and
services is offered as to meet households’ needs and includes multiple eligible energy savings
activities. 102

3.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
The ESS Rule sets out three methodologies used for calculating the numbers of certificates that
can be created from energy savings activities. The methodologies are: 103
• Project Impact Assessment Method;
• Metered Baseline Method; and
• Deemed Energy Savings Method.
3.10.1 Project Impact Assessment Method
The Project Impact Assessment Method calculates savings from one-off energy savings projects.
This method is most appropriate when: 104
• energy savings are small compared to the site’s consumption;
• baseline energy consumption data for the site is unavailable, or
• the variation in the baseline energy consumption due to other factors is high.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

The energy savings can be determined by various means, including by direct measurement or by
an engineering assessment. The Project Impact Assessment Method applies a confidence factor
which reflects the accuracy and/or reliability of the data used to calculate energy savings.
One of the advantages of the Project Impact Assessment Method is that it is possible to make an
up-front assessment of estimated future energy savings (known as forward creation of ESCs).
This is considered to be an incentive where projects achieve small annual savings that might be
insufficient to warrant accreditation under the ESS. The ESS Rule allows the forward creation of
up to five years of certificates from a RESA that has ongoing energy savings as soon as the RESA
is commenced. However, discount factors apply to any forward creation (see Table 8).


                           Table 8. Discount Factors for Calculating
                             Forward Creation of ESCs under the
                              Project Impact Assessment Method
                            in the NSW Energy Savings Scheme105
                                    Year                 Discount Factor
                                      1                         1.0
                                      2                         0.8
                                      3                         0.6
                                      4                         0.5
                                      5                         0.4

The ESS Rule also allows ACPs who use the forward creation provisions to revisit the savings
claimed at the end of the five-year period and to ‘top up’ the savings if a greater level of savings
can be verified. To do this ACPs must maintain adequate records so that any additional savings
claimed can be validated by an independent audit of the project. 106
3.10.2 Metered Baseline Method
The Metered Baseline Method involves measuring the electricity consumption before the RESA
commences to establish a baseline electricity consumption standard for the site, and then
measuring this consumption again after the RESA has commenced to establish new levels of
electricity consumption. The difference between these measurements represents the impact of
the RESA (assuming that the remainder of the site continues to operate as it did before the RESA
commenced). This idea of ‘before’ and ‘after’ measurements is fundamental to the design of the
ESS as the recognition of energy savings is based on being able to confirm savings against a
baseline. 107
The Metered Baseline Method comprises four sub-methods for measuring consumption. Which
of these is most appropriate depends on the nature of the project. These methods comprise:
• the baseline per unit of output method, used where consumption is strongly linked to
  output;

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

• the baseline unaffected by output method, used where energy consumption is not linked to
  output;
• the normalised baseline method, used where the baseline needs to be normalised to
  remove explainable variation from the baseline, such as changes to ambient conditions or
  input characteristics;
• the NABERS method is based on the normalised baseline approach and is used for buildings
  that have a National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) energy rating.
3.10.3 Deemed Energy Savings Method
The Deemed Energy Savings Method is used for the installation of common end-user
equipment, such as refrigerators and energy-efficient lighting. The method comprises four
sub-methods, which provide robust and easy-to-use equations and factors to calculate the
energy savings and number of ESCs that can be claimed for specific energy savings activities. The
method allows ESCs to be claimed at the time of implementation of the energy savings activity,
for the energy savings that will occur over the deemed lifetime for the activity. As part of the
calculation methodology of each sub-method, there are assumed deeming periods for different
activities. The Scheme Administrator also takes account of these deeming periods when
determining actual annual energy savings from accredited RESAs.
Table 9 shows the deeming periods for some of the common energy savings activities.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

The four sub-methods are: 109
• default savings factors, used for projects that involve the installation or supply of particular
  end-user equipment types that are listed in the ESS Rule with their specified default savings
  factors. Energy savings activities covered under this sub-method include: replacement of
  halogen down-lights with energy efficient alternatives; sale or purchase of energy efficient
  clothes washers, dishwashers, fridges or freezers; retirement of old spare fridges and
  freezers; and installation of energy-efficient showerheads as part of a bundle of products and
  services included in a Home Energy Efficiency Retrofit;
• commercial lighting energy savings formula, used for projects that only involve energy
  savings attributable to commercial lighting upgrades. An electronic Commercial Lighting
  Calculation Tool is available on the ESS website for persons to calculate the number of
  certificates they may create from a commercial lighting upgrade. The Tool sets out the
  correct factors and discounts applicable for all eligible types of commercial lighting
  installations. As new technologies become available, both the ESS Rule and this tool will be
  updated to take account of new developments;
• high-efficiency motor energy savings formula, used for projects that only involve energy
  savings attributable to the sale or installation of one or more high efficiency motors. The ESS
  Rule contains an extensive list of default load utilisation factors for high efficiency motors
  where the end-user equipment and end-use are known. The load utilisation factors are
  divided into different categories depending on the end-use industry sector (eg, agriculture,
  mining, construction etc);
• power factor correction energy savings formula, used for projects that only involve energy
  savings attributable to the reduced losses from the installation of power factor correction
  equipment that increases the power factor of a site above 0.9 to a maximum of 0.98.

3.11 Cost-Effectiveness
In 2011 and 2013, the Scheme Administrator engaged consultants to carry out studies of the
cost of participation in the ESS. The 2013 report summarized results from 2009, 2010 and
2013. 110
Table 10 shows the shows the total costs to ACPs of participating in the ESS by creating ESCs. In
Table 10, the costs are presented as a cost per ESC, and the value of each major cost item
(project delivery cost and business cost) is shown. Data are a weighted average of the number of
ESCs generated by the interviewed sample of ACPs, as opposed to an average of the responses
of each ACP, which would not reflect the large differences between the number of ESC’s
generated by each ACP. Because there was substantial variation in delivery costs for ACPs in
2012, a range is presented.

Table 10 shows that the costs to ACPs of participating in the ESS reduced between 2009 and
2012. Moreover, it appears that, on average, it did not become cost-effective for ACPs to
participate in the ESS until 2012. However, there are some uncertainties in the estimates of
delivery cost because the data are based on a small sample, and ACPs had difficulty in
identifying this cost, leading to variability in the data provided.

Purchasing ESCs was the major cost for electricity retailers; after this, the main items in internal
costs were staff costs and auditing costs. Whilst the distribution of internal costs by categories
remained broadly similar over the period, the actual cost levels decreased substantially. Reasons
for this include: 113

• efficiencies in administering participation in the ESS made by the electricity retailers since the
  scheme was established;
• the absence of investment costs in 2012 – costs in 2009 and 2010 included investment in
  systems to administer electricity retailers’ participation in the ESS;
• participating in the ESS, and the costs involved in participation, became progressively more
  embedded into electricity retailers’ operations between 2009 and 2012.
The 2011 study also carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the ESS on a total resource costs basis,
taking into account benefits such as reduced energy bills. In the context of the study, ‘total
resource costs’ means the total net cost or benefit to society as a whole, taking into account the
activities of all ESS stakeholders, and eliminating transfer costs which occur where there is a cost
incurred by one party (e.g., to electricity retailers), that is a benefit elsewhere (e.g., to ACPs).
The cost benefit analysis was calculated on all energy savings activities delivered by the ESS and
the calculations are based on forecast ESS activities over the expected life of the scheme from
2009 to 2020, as estimated by a forecast of ESC creation developed by the Scheme
Administrator. 114
Table 12 shows the total net costs and benefits per ESC over the period 2009-2020. In Table 7,
benefits are shown as positive numbers, and costs as negative numbers in brackets. The major
conclusion from Table 7 is that the total net benefit is AUD24.56 per ESC created under
the ESS.

                     Total net benefit per ESC                    AUD24.56


3.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
There are no incentives provided to Liable Entities that achieve energy savings in excess of their
ESS targets. ESCs that a Liable Entity acquires in excess of its annual target may be used to meet
targets in subsequent years.
All Liable Entities must lodge an Annual Energy Savings Statement with the Scheme Regulator by
30 April each year. These statements must be audited by independent auditors selected from a
panel established by the Scheme Administrator. Failure to submit a statement carries a penalty.
The Scheme Regulator must prepare an annual report to the Minister on the extent to which
scheme participants have complied, or failed to comply, with their individual ESS targets during
the previous year.
If a Liable Entity does not surrender the required number of ESCs in a given year, it must pay a
shortfall penalty. The penalty price acts as a practical maximum price for ESCs. The penalty rate
is normally adjusted in November each year, for the following year, to account for changes in
the Consumer Price Index. For the 2014 compliance year the penalty rate is AUD25.97 per ESC in

shortfall. The penalty is not tax deductible and; once tax impacts are taken into account, the
2014 penalty rate is equivalent to AUD37.10 per ESC. 116
As an alternative to paying the penalty, a Liable Entity may choose to carry forward all or part of
its shortfall to the following compliance period. The maximum shortfall that may be carried
forward in any given year is 10 percent of a Liable Entity’s individual energy savings target, with the
exception of 2009, when up to 50 percent of the target could be carried forward into 2010. Any
shortfall carried forward must be made up in the following year.

3.13 Response to Stress Situations
Energy savings achieved under the ESS and its predecessor GGAS have not been used to respond
to any stress situations. Because of the way the energy savings are achieved, through
closely-defined energy savings activities, it would be difficult to target energy savings achieved
through the ESS to relieve particular stresses on the electricity system.

3.14 Overall Effectiveness
The ESS and its predecessor GGAS together comprise the longest-running energy efficiency
certificate scheme in the world. The schemes’ combined experience of more than 10 years has
enabled progressive revision and refinement of scheme parameters, including definitions of
eligible energy efficiency measures, deemed energy savings values, methodologies for
calculating the numbers of certificates that can be created, and scheme administrative
procedures. These changes have established the ESS as an efficient and cost-effective
mechanism for delivering energy savings.
Energy efficiency certificates are an effective mechanism to provide funding for energy
efficiency activities. This method of funding enables governments, as the initiator of energy
efficiency certificate schemes, to achieve their energy savings objectives without contributing
government funds. Ultimately, the cost of such schemes is paid by end-use energy customers
through increases in energy prices, though downward pressure is maintained on prices when
obligated energy suppliers operate in competitive markets, as do NSW electricity retailers.
Enabling non-obligated third parties to implement energy savings projects and create energy
savings certificates is a unique characteristic of two Australian energy efficiency certificate
schemes: the ESS and the Victorian Energy Efficiency Target scheme. Third party acquisition of
energy savings increases the number of delivery agents involved and arguably also increases
innovation in identifying energy savings opportunities and implementing energy savings
projects.
In NSW, the establishment of ACPs as energy savings delivery agents, together with the funding
available through the sale of ESCs, has resulted in the development and growth of an energy
services industry and the creation of significant numbers of new jobs.
The limitation of the ESS to cover electricity only has not changed since the commencement of
the scheme and its predecessor GGAS. The NSW government has now decided to expand the
coverage of the ESS to gas during 2015, and this will position the scheme to significantly expand
the quantity of energy savings delivered.

3.15 Lessons Learnt
The ESS has successfully demonstrated two unique policy and regulatory mechanisms that assist
in the implementation of utility delivery of energy efficiency: trading of energy efficiency
certificates and the accreditation of third parties to achieve energy savings. Together these two
mechanisms have enabled the establish and development of an energy services industry in New
South Wales and have contributed to a major increase in the quantities of energy savings being
achieved in the state. Jurisdictions looking to establish a new energy services industry or expand
and existing one can learn a great deal from the experience of the NSW Energy Savings Scheme.

4.         SOUTH AFRICA’S UTILITY INTEGRATED DSM PROGRAMS
4.1        Introduction
Electricity is the most important source of energy for end users in South Africa. Electricity is
therefore an appropriate focus for its energy efficiency initiatives. Electricity is central to both
the economy and household needs. The South African economy is driven by mining and related
industries that are energy-intensive. 117 The major export industries, especially non-ferrous metal
exports and mining, rely heavily on electricity. 118 Households are similarly dependent on
electricity. Most households use electricity for all their major needs, including lighting, cooking,
and heating. The penetration of major kitchen appliances and cell phones depend on access to
electricity. 119 Indeed, 40% of the electricity used on the African continent is used by South
Africa. 120
Electricity in South Africa is also important for its environmental footprint. Coal is the primary
fuel for electricity generation, providing 90% of the electricity produced in South Africa. The coal
used by South African generators is increasingly less efficient, lower quality/high ash content
due to exports of higher grade coal. Electricity is consequently a major source of CO2 and toxic
pollutants. South Africa is one of the highest per capita emitters of CO2 among middle income
nations. 121
Extending the reach of electricity throughout the nation remains an important aspiration for a
nation still trying to overcome its legacy of apartheid. South Africa embarked upon, and largely
succeeded in, providing wider access to electricity. The share of households with access to
electricity has improved from 44% in 1994 to 85% in 2014. 122 Nevertheless, issues of poor rural
access and electricity affordability loom large in the country.
The key institutions in the South Africa power system include Eskom, the government-owned
largely vertically-integrated monopoly provider of electricity generation, transmission and
distribution services. Municipal utilities purchase electricity from Eskom, own their own
generation projects, or purchase from independent power producers (IPPs) and distribute
power. Eskom reports to its own Board, but electricity prices are overseen by the National
Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). The prices established by the municipal utilities are
also subject to NERSA oversight.
Eskom is responsible for generating 96 percent of electricity in South Africa, municipalities
generate about 1 percent and independent power about 3 percent. 123 One hundred and eighty
municipalities distribute approximately 41 percent of the electricity to 60 percent of end-use
customers, the remainder is distributed by Eskom. Eskom is also responsible for the delivery of
most energy efficiency programs and services to South Africans. Efforts around energy efficiency
have provided some early success, but further progress may be a victim of a system seemingly in
perpetual transition.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Early successes suggest that Eskom has employed energy efficiency and demand-side
management (DSM) to reduce loads by about 3.6 GW from 2005 through 2012, or roughly 12
percent of system peak load requirements. Energy efficiency efforts also reduced electricity
demands by over 4TWh. 124 Since 2007, South Africa has managed to keep loads flat to declining.
The lack of growth in electricity sales can be attributed, in part, to significant increases in
electricity tariffs from 2008 to the present. 125
Until 2008, South Africa successfully met loads and provided a high quality service at some of
the lowest prices for electricity internationally. In 2008, some underlying failures of the system
began to emerge that resulted in a serious shortage of electric generation capacity, resulting in
load shedding or planned blackouts on a rolling basis.
Many load shedding or rolling blackout events were precipitated by the shortfall in 2008 and
2009. According to one source, the size of “the power shortage was staggering—about
3500 MW or about 10 percent of peak demand, every weekday from 6 am to 10 pm.” The
causes of the shortfall were many but boiled down to Eskom’s owners (the Government of
South Africa) not making the investments identified a decade prior, at least in time for delivery
by 2008. Demand-side solutions, including DSM became an important part of the overall
response. 126
Eskom emerged from this period of shortages in May 2009 with some additional peaking
capacity, but still facing narrow reserve margins. However, commitments to new base load
generation capacity came later with some delays. Following the 2009 shortage, another
shortage in capacity emerged in 2013, forcing appeals to the public and one planned blackout in
March 2014. As at October 2014, the shortfall is expected to continue at least until 2015.
Historically, South Africa has enjoyed low prices for retail power. This began to change in 2007
when South Africa embarked on an effort to raise the price of electricity to reflect the long term
price of power under its framework of regulation that allowed for Multi-year Price
Determinations (MYPD). In FY 2007, the price level approved by NERSA was ZAR 0.179/kWh.
The price level approved for the FY 2015 year is ZAR 0.7075/kWh or nearly four times the levels
that existed in FY 2007. 127,128
NERSA approves electricity tariffs that include a DSM component, which is collected by Eskom
and used in DSM and energy efficiency initiatives. In 2013 Eskom appealed to the regulator for a
successive round of price increases over the next five years of 16 percent annually and was
rebuffed, with the regulator allowing only about half the proposed increases. One of the
apparent casualties of the effort was Eskom’s integrated demand-side management initiatives.
Of the roughly ZAR 13 billion investment proposed, only about 40% (ZAR 5 billion) was approved
by NERSA. 129
This decision followed a period of seeming success in which the combination of rate increases
and demand-side program initiatives (combined with the addition of some peaking capacity)
resulted in stable and declining loads, that helped to address reliability challenges.

4.2        Policy Objectives
In December 1998, the South African Cabinet approved a White Paper on energy policy. In the
White Paper, the government declared that 40 percent of the population was still without
                                                         130
access to electricity, making electrification a priority. Portions of the White Paper recognized
the need to implement energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy in support of
economic development and affordable access. 131
In 2004, NERSA promulgated the Regulatory Policy on Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side
Management for the South African Electricity Industry. 132 This policy made energy efficiency and
DSM planning and implementation a license condition for all major electricity distributors. It also
defined the potential roles of energy services companies (ESCOs) and created an independent
monitoring and verification (M&V) body, accountable to NERSA.
In 2005, a national energy efficiency strategy was published that outlined a vision and goals for
energy efficiency in South Africa (see Figure 8). 133

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

In South Africa, energy efficiency is recognized as a component of a broader planning and
decision-making environment known as integrated resource planning that includes
consideration of both supply-side and demand-side resources. In 2010, the South African
Department of Energy recognized investments in energy efficiency DSM as “no-regret” policies
that have been underfunded. 135 In 2011, South Africa adopted an Integrated Resource Plan
(IRP) 136 that went through a subsequent round of revisions for final release in 2013. 137

4.3       Legal Authority
The Electricity Regulation Act of 2006 introduced a regulatory framework for the power
industry. 138 NERSA established under the National Energy Regulator Act of 2004 serves as the
entity responsible for carrying out the functions included in the 2006 law. 139
Section 15 of the 2006 Act requires every electricity distributor licensee to comply with energy
efficiency standards and demand side management. The Act also creates mechanisms for cost
recovery of energy efficiency investments. The Act authorized NERSA to implement the national
government’s electricity policy through regulations and modifications of license terms. In effect,
NERSA became the institution for implementing the policy framework to deliver energy
efficiency through licensed utility service providers.

4.4       Coverage
In South Africa, energy efficiency and demand-side management initiatives are administered by
the state owned electricity company, Eskom. Because of the capacity shortfalls, the strategy is
especially focused on reducing capacity or demand during peak periods on the electricity system.
Other fuels are addressed through investment tax credits that are administered nationally. All
sectors of the economy are covered by Eskom’s integrated DSM program, although the
cumulative savings have fallen disproportionately on the residential and municipal distribution
company efforts (76 percent); industry cumulative savings is another 19 percent, while
commercial and agricultural savings are roughly 5 percent. 140

4.5       Energy Savings Targets
The National Energy Efficiency Strategy (NEES) established initial targets for energy efficiency
improvement of 12 percent by 2015 as approved by Cabinet in March 2005. Further review
occurred in October 2008 and through the Energy Act of 2008. 141 These targets are aspirational
without practical consequence for either success or failure. Sector specific targets are shown in
Table 13.

By 2013 it was recognized that the NEES electricity savings targets for 2015 were not going to be
achieved. 143 However, the regulatory targets set for the period of the second Multi-year Price
Determinations (MYPD2) for FY 2011, 2012, and 2013 appear to have been met. 144 A
determination by NERSA to reduce funding for energy efficiency and DSM will challenge the
utilities’ ability to deliver in the future.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Eskom’s ESCO program has been in existence for many years. From FY 2005 through FY 2012
and into FY 2013, Eskom reported that they had engaged in approximately 450 ESCO projects
producing 869 MW of demand reductions and 2727 GWh of energy savings. The ESCO program
targeted customers over 500 kW. Despite the successes, there were complaints from both the
ESCO industry and Eskom about difficulties with the program. 146,147
The Eskom standard offer program was analogous to a renewable feed-in tariff program. The
program involved the replacement of inefficient equipment with efficient equipment and
targeted customers between 10 kW and 5 MW. 148 The program proved successful and rapidly
achieved 113.5 MW of demand reductions and 609 GWh of savings in less than two years of
active delivery.
The Standard Product program provided set payments for deemed savings associated with
efficient replacements including lighting, shower heads and heat pumps. The target audience
was commercial customers under 500 kW. This program also proved highly successful and
achieved over 112 MW demand reduction and 493 GWh of savings during the initial two years.
The residential CFL mass roll-out program proved to be Eskom’s most enduring successful
program, although Eskom expect to rely on this program significantly less in the future. Under
the distinct residential mass-rollout initiative, Eskom segmented the residential market into
three housing segments along largely income characteristics. The type of delivery mechanisms
included door-to-door delivery, direct installation, and leveraging retailers offering product
discounts. The most significant share of future demand reductions are expected from this
program. 149

4.7        Marketing, Education and Outreach
Throughout the period from 2008 through 2014, South Africa’s government, and especially
Eskom, have faced major consumer education and public awareness concerns not just with the
delivery of its energy efficiency programs, but also more broadly with a capacity shortfall that
led poor system reliability and a crisis of confidence in Eskom and government.
Adding to the challenges were the significant price increases that were required to recover the
costs of investments in major new power stations. After decades of declining nominal and real
prices of electricity, South Africa experienced annual price increases in excess of 20 percent
annually during the seven-year period from FY 2007 to FY 2014. Eskom engaged in a significant
campaign of public outreach to explain the price increases, and appeal to customers to gain
public cooperation around load shedding (rolling blackouts) and its DSM programs.

4.8        Funding
In 2004, NERSA established the Energy Efficiency and Demand-side Management Fund,
administered by Eskom, and defined the rules for its implementation (see Figure 10).

NERSA sets electricity prices for multi-year periods under its multi-year price determinations
(MYPD). These determinations have become the main instrument for funding energy efficiency
and DSM in South Africa, at least so far as they cover Eskom. Recent price determinations were
for FY 2010 through FY 2013 (MYPD2) 151 and FY 2014 through FY 2018 (MYPD3). 152 NERSA issued
approvals for budgets and prices to allow recovery of DSM investments in both MYPD2 and
MYPD3.
In MYPD2, investment levels for DSM for the period from FY 2010 through FY 2013 were
approved at about 1.5 percent of gross revenues. Table 14 shows budgets and energy efficiency
targets for MYPD 2 implemented by Eskom.

Approximately ZAR 5.2 billion in investments were approved by NERSA in MYPD3, well below
the funding levels proposed by Eskom.
Table 15 shows the approved expenditure levels for Eskom during the period 2014 to 2018,
including the expenditure levels for integrated DSM. In other regions, especially the United
States, funding levels for the most ambitious energy efficiency and DSM programs exceed three
percent of revenues and aggressive programs are between one and three percent. 154 In
comparison, South Africa’s DSM funding for the period 2014 to 2018, at least through Eskom, is
now considerably below one percent of revenues.

4.9        Results
Overall, Eskom claims levels of achievement with respect to capacity reductions that far exceed
the targets set by the regulator. Figure 11 shows the targets set by Eskom and NERSA and the
levels of demand reductions actually achieved. The strongest performance occurred during the
period in which the system was under the greatest stress in 2008 and 2009.

          Energy Efficiency and DSM Programs Compared with Targets, 2005 to 2012

Over the eight years that demand reductions were pursued through integrated DSM and other
initiatives, Eskom claims net savings of 3073 MW from FY 2005 through FY 2012 and savings of
3400 MW through March of 2013. 157

4.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
Monitoring and verification of the results of Eskom’s integrated DSM efforts has received
considerable attention by NERSA and the academic community in South Africa. 158 M&V is
incorporated into energy efficiency and DSM programs and M&V costs are allowed up to eight
percent of the total project costs. 159 During MYPD2, Eskom was allowed ZAR 128 million for the
M&V costs of programs. However, discussions with experts estimate that about 3 percent in
average are spent on M&V. 160
Eskom administers the M&V process and its Energy Audit Division contracts with universities
across South Africa to conduct M&V assessments reflecting some measure of independence
from Eskom.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Standard guidelines for M&V of energy savings are established in the South African Standard
SANS 50010, which was developed based on the International Performance Measurement and
Verification Protocol (IPMVP) documentation. 161 SANS 50010 provides a standard approach to
measurement and verification of energy savings and energy efficiency for use in voluntary and
regulatory process in South Africa. 162 More specific guidelines are also developed for each
program type or for specific energy efficiency measures. South Africa has also an independent
professional body called the Council of Measurement and Verification Professionals of South
Africa (CMVPSA) which offers training and certification of professionals.

4.11 Cost-Effectiveness
Energy efficiency gained in stature with the establishment in 2005 of the National Energy
Efficiency Strategy. At the time, energy efficiency was recognized by Government as one of the
most cost-effective ways of meeting the demands of sustainable development because in excess
of 50 percent of energy efficiency measures were no-cost/low cost with payback periods of less
than three years (see Table 16). 163

4.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
Eskom is responsible for meeting its savings targets over the course of the multi-year
performance plan. In the case of a failure to meet the performance targets, a non-performance
the penalty is imposed. Non-performance in this case means that Eskom does not reach the goal
set in term of savings in MW and GWh. The penalty is calculated as follows: 165
       Penalty(R/MW) = total allowed revenue ÷ proposed MW =R/MW x MW (unsaved MW)
No other provision has been made for removing disincentives associated with reduced sales
growth. 166 However, maintaining system reliability and avoiding the need for load shedding as
occurred in 2008 and 2009 are also believed to be important motivation for effective delivery of
energy efficiency and DSM programs.

4.13 Response to Stress Situations
In its 2005 National Energy Efficiency Strategy, South Africa indicated that:
          “[I]t is estimated that the country’s existing power generation capacity will be
         insufficient to meet the rising national maximum demand by 2007-2012. Energy
         efficiency is integral to Eskom’s Demand Side Management programme, which is
         intended to reduce the level of the load growth by a cumulative value of 4255 MW
         by 2025.” 167
The forecast proved probably more accurate than was realized at the time. The shortfall in
generation capacity was felt acutely by all of South Africa in 2008 and has persisted through
2014. Eskom exceeded even its own ambitions for demand reduction. Since the inception of its
integrated DSM program initiatives, Eskom has achieved verified savings of 3,400 MW. During
the period in which the capacity shortfall was most acute in FY 2009, South Africa saved over
900 MW in a single year.

4.14 Overall Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the early energy efficiency and DSM program initiatives that focused on the
ESCO model for delivery proved to be poor performance years. The achieved reductions in
demand were mostly achieved through the mass market residential program initiatives targeting
lighting and industrial programs delivered by Eskom. Despite the successes of the integrated
DSM program, NERSA has reduced the budgets for these programs over the five years from
2014.

4.15 Lessons Learnt
Impacts on system reliability have been a powerful motivator in delivering capacity savings. In
the years since the capacity crisis began, Eskom has far exceeded the targets set by the regulator,
and in most years, exceeded its own expectations by a wide margin.
After almost a decade without material investment in new supply, Eskom embarked upon an
aggressive plan for price increases over time coupled with time-of-use pricing and inclining block
rates that complemented efforts to promote energy efficiency and DSM initiatives. Price
increases that occurred during the course of the last two multi-year price determination plans
(MYPD2 and MYPD3) had a significant impact on demand levels.
South Africa initially pursued pathways that included heavy reliance on third party providers of
energy efficiency services. However, the ESCO model proved challenging for delivery, and most
of the material energy savings achieved did not rely heavily on ESCOs. The problems that were
cited by Eskom include the following: 168,169
• individual project approvals and long lead times;
• programs not applicable to the mass market;
• inconsistent evaluation criteria;
• cumbersome governance processes; and
• complex and onerous contracts.

5.         CHINA’S GRID COMPANY ENERGY EFFICIENCY OBLIGATION
5.1        Introduction
China’s consumption of primary energy has been growing rapidly for many years, as shown in
Figure 12. While energy consumption is increasing in tandem with the growth in gross domestic
product (GDP), the energy intensity of the Chinese economy has been decreasing steadily since
1980, except for a short-term blip between 2002 and 2005 (Figure 13, page 45). Currently,
energy intensity in China is still higher than in the United States but is continuing to trend
downward, whereas the energy intensity trend in the United States Is essentially flat.




                                                                                       170
           Figure 12. China’s Primary Energy Consumption by Source, 1980 to 2010

The continuing reduction in the energy intensity of the Chinese economy is largely the result of
government policies and programs. In China, development of the country’s broad and
comprehensive energy efficiency programs stems from a realization that, if energy is not used
more efficiently, the country’s economic growth will be compromised by inadequate energy
supply. The main goal of government energy efficiency policy is to uncouple economic growth
from proportionate increases in energy use. Severe environmental consequences of continued
rapid growth in coal consumption also are a key concern. 171
Industry accounts for about 70 percent of final energy use (with electricity accounted at thermal
replacement value) and is the largest single focus of China’s energy efficiency programs, but
programs cover all sectors and are implemented primarily through government agencies.

                        Figure 13. Energy Intensity in China, 1980 to 2010

Demand-side management (DSM) was first introduced in China in the early 1990s when there
was growing recognition of energy and environmental problems resulting from increasing
electricity consumption driven by rapid economic growth. During the early years, DSM in China
was mainly supported by government funding. Targeted load management, rather than energy
efficiency DSM, was seen as a systematic way to balance economic, environmental, and social
development.
After ten years’ experience with DSM, the central government in China realised that energy
utilities can take an important role in achieving energy savings through end-use energy
efficiency measures. In November 2010, the government issued Guidance on Electricity
Demand-Side Management Regulations (关于印发《电力需求侧管理办法》的通知 (发改运行
[2010] 2643)). 173. This guidance document for the first time placed an energy efficiency
obligation (EEO) on the State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Grid Company, the
two large government-owned entities that operate electricity transmission and distribution
networks and sell electricity directly to end-use customers in the majority of China. 174
The obligation requires the grid companies to achieve energy savings of at least 0.3 percent in
sales volumes and demand savings of at least 0.3 percent in maximum load, both compared with
the previous year’s results. The EEO, which went into effect on 1 January 2011, also lays a
foundation for the expansion of demand response programs by requiring the installation of load

monitoring equipment on 70 percent of the peak load, and load control equipment on ten
percent of the peak load, in any locality. 175

5.2        Policy Objectives
Chinese government involvement in energy efficiency commenced in the 1980s with the
establishment at various levels of government of energy efficiency agencies with managerial
functions. 176 Energy engineers and energy administrative bodies were also introduced into large
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and specialized personnel were assigned to manage
energy efficiency. Over 200 Energy Conservation Centers were set up by local governments and
sectoral agencies; their mission was to serve as consultants to government, and to provide
energy efficiency services to end users, including training and information. The Centers were
originally supported with government funds, but later became dependent on revenues from
sales of their services.
In 1997, an Energy Conservation Law was passed by the National People’s Congress. This Law
provided a policy framework that enabled China’s 33 provincial-level governments to
promulgate detailed local bylaws and regulations on energy conservation. In particular, the Law
required all levels of government to arrange funds to implement energy conservation measures
and to set limits, in terms of energy consumption per physical unit of product, for products that
are energy-intensive to produce.
The Law also required local governments to establish a system for discontinuing backward, over
energy-intensive, energy-consuming products and equipment. This led to major programs to
close down old, small-scale, and inefficient energy-intensive industrial capacity, including the
progressive closure of old, emissions-intensive power stations. These programs continue today.
The 1997 Energy Conservation Law identified key energy-using entities as those that had an
annual energy consumption equivalent to more than 10,000 tons of standard coal equivalent
(tce). These entities were required to appoint an energy manager and to submit periodic reports
to the government on energy consumption, energy use efficiency, and the energy conservation
measures they implemented.
The Law also authorized various levels of government to “supervise and manage” energy
conservation work in their jurisdictions. This led to the establishment of Energy Conservation
Supervision Centers by many provincial-level governments, with powers to inspect facilities, to
levy fines on offenders, and even to close down offenders.
In 2004, in response to the short-term increase in energy intensity that commenced in 2002, a
Medium and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan was issued by the National Development and
Reform Commission (NDRC), the central government’s powerful agency responsible for planning
economic and social development in China. The overriding goal of the Plan was to reduce by
2010 national energy intensity by 20 percent from its level in 2005. 177
The Plan specifically defined “Ten Key Energy-Saving Projects,” including: coal-fired industrial
boiler retrofits, residual heat and pressure utilization, petroleum saving and substitution, motor
system energy saving, and energy system optimization. The Plan set energy intensity targets for
the years 2010 and 2020 for individual energy-intensive industries, including cement, steel,

176
      Crossley (2013a).
177
      In the event, this goal was almost achieved with a 19.1 percent reduction in energy intensity over this
      period.


                                                                                                           46
Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

petrochemicals, oil refining, and electricity generation. The Plan also specified raising energy
efficiency standards for major energy-using appliances to international levels by 2010. In 2007,
many of the same targets, objectives, and policies appeared in both the 11th Five-Year Plan and
the China National Climate Change Program. Currently, the 12th Five Year Plan (2011 to 2015)
includes targets to reduce by 2015 energy intensity by 16 percent and carbon intensity by 17
percent from their levels in 2010.
In 2007, the National People’s Congress passed an amended Energy Conservation Law. The 2007
Law includes a provision that the state “will implement a system of accountability for energy
conservation targets and a system for energy evaluation whereby the fulfilment of energy
conservation targets is taken as one part of the evaluation of local people’s governments and
their responsible persons.” The Law therefore makes achievement of energy intensity targets a
component of the performance evaluation of local governments and their officials. Individual
government officials may be subject to sanctions if energy intensity targets in their areas of
responsibility are not met.
The 2007 Law requires reports to government by key energy-using entities to be made annually.
In addition to the requirements under the 1997 Law, these reports must also contain
information about whether the entity’s energy intensity targets were achieved. The Law
authorizes the imposition of penalties on key energy-using entities that fail to achieve targets or
implement energy efficiency measures; this covers more than 15,000 enterprises. The Law also
authorizes the implementation of a system of differential electricity pricing whereby enterprises
that are identified to have certain energy-inefficient production processes and/or equipment
that the government requires to be limited or phased out can be charged higher prices.
The EEO placed on Chinese grid companies in 2011 is a further extension of the government
involvement in energy efficiency that commenced in the 1980s. The EEO guidance document
stated that DSM should be prioritised to meet electricity demand in the tight supply situation
and power shortages that occur in most of China’s central and southern provinces. 178 DSM is
currently considered to be a mechanism that will help to deal with power shortages as well as
long-term sustainability issues, such as:
• achieving end-use energy efficiency at lowest cost;
• reducing greenhouse gas emissions;
• improving environmental quality;
• integrating demand-side resources into energy, social, and economic planning; and
• enhancing grid security and reliability.

5.3       Legal Authority
The guidance document that placed the EEO on the grid companies was issued by six central
government agencies under the auspices of the State Council. The lead agency is NDRC which is
designated as the responsible party for DSM in China. The other five agencies are to carry out
DSM-related work within the scope of their existing general duties and responsibilities. 179
At the central government level, NDRC is the main authority responsible for DSM short-term and
long-term planning, strategic policy design, and electricity pricing regulation. The Ministry of

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

Finance takes responsibility for DSM financing issues, such as funding, budget approval, and
expense supervision. The role of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is to
propose clean products and technologies, set up industrial plans, and promote the
implementation of the EEO in industrial enterprises. The State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission is responsible for overseeing public assets and evaluating the grid
companies’ performance in general. The National Energy Administration ensures that DSM is
included as a resource in power generation, transmission, and distribution development, and
that the grid companies produce good results in reducing electricity consumption and improving
end-use energy efficiency. The National Energy Council is involved in energy policy design and
coordination of the various central government agencies.
At the provincial government level, provinces are responsible for developing detailed
implementation rules. In general, provincial Development and Reform Commissions or Economic
and Information Commissions are responsible for implementing the EEO in their jurisdictions.
Other provincial agencies assist in specific fields, including: DSM planning; setting annual DSM
targets for provincial grid companies and reviewing their DSM implementation plans; and
investigating and analysing the DSM resource potential in their respective provinces.

5.4       Coverage
The EEO placed on the grid companies covers electricity. In addition, energy savings from other
fuel types may be converted to the equivalent electricity saving using standard coefficients
published by the National Statistics Bureau and can then be counted toward the energy savings
target.
The energy savings and demand reduction targets set by the obligation can be met with end-use
energy savings from all economic sectors and from any facility. In addition, reduction of losses in
transmission and distribution networks can also be used to meet part of the targets.

5.5       Energy Savings Targets
The EEO requires the grid companies to produce energy savings equivalent to at least 0.3
percent of electricity sales in the previous year and to reduce load by at least 0.3 percent of
maximum load in the previous year.
The EEO also establishes a sub-target that requires the installation of load monitoring
equipment on 70 percent of the peak load, and load control equipment on ten percent of the
peak load, in any locality.

5.6       Energy Efficiency Activities
In practice, there are five types of activities that grid companies can undertake to produce
eligible energy savings that contribute to meeting their energy savings targets, subject to
constraints specified in a Compliance Evaluation Scheme originally published by NDRC in 2011 as
a trial version, 180 and updated in 2014 181:
• directly implement energy efficiency projects in the grid company’s own premises and in
  their end-use customers’ premises;
• establish an energy services company (ESCO) affiliated with the grid company to implement
  energy efficiency projects;

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

• purchase energy savings by means of business transactions/trading 182 (not to exceed 40
  percent of total eligible energy savings);
• promote energy efficiency to the grid company’s end-use customers (grid companies may
  claim only ten percent of any energy savings made by customers as a result of energy
  efficiency promotions and these savings must not exceed five percent of total eligible energy
  savings); and
• directly carry out grid system upgrades and operational management improvements that
  save energy and reduce losses in transmission and distribution networks.
As a further constraint, grid companies can only claim 100 percent of the value of those energy
savings that are audited by a third party or recorded by online monitoring equipment; otherwise
only 80 percent of the value can be claimed.
Three types of energy savings are identified as not eligible to contribute to meeting EEO
targets: 183
• energy savings from commercially operated renewable energy projects;
• electricity savings that cannot be measured and verified; and
• electricity saved through implementing government policy on the orderly use of electricity. 184
The grid companies also use their claimed eligible energy savings to calculate load reductions
that contribute to meeting their load reduction targets. Eligible load reductions are calculated as
the annual eligible electricity savings (not including energy savings converted from other fuel
types), divided by the average dispatched operation hours of electricity generation units. In
addition, grid companies may achieve eligible load reductions by assisting customers to
rearrange their production schedules, and by using load shifting technologies and installing new
equipment (such as heat pumps or reverse cycle air conditioners) to improve load factors at end-
use customers’ premises.
The EEO guidance document does not include provisions for approving eligible energy efficiency
measures nor for deeming energy saving values for specific measures. The guidance document
does require each province to develop its own implementation rule that will identify provincial
eligible energy efficiency measures based on best practices adapted to local situations. 185
In the Compliance Evaluation Scheme, the NDRC recommends, but does not require,
implementation of the following energy efficiency measures: 186
• energy saving in transmission and distribution system;
• energy efficient electric motors, energy efficient upgrade of boilers, using waste heat and
  pressure, installation of heat pumps;
• energy saving in buildings, green lighting; and electricity thermal (ice) storage and other
  energy management projects.



182
      A grid company may purchase energy savings from customers (or other ESCOs) if the grid company
      does not itself implement energy efficiency projects.

      Orderly use of electricity refers to involuntary supply curtailments that may be imposed by provincial
      governments on selected end-use customers during periods of supply shortages.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

The NDRC also encourages grid companies to reduce transmission line losses at different voltage
levels, to use efficient power transformers, to improve power supply coverage, and to enforce
power factor correction at customers’ premises.

5.7        Marketing, Education and Outreach
The EEO guidance document states that promoting energy efficiency to the grid company’s end-
use customers is an eligible energy efficiency measure. In response, the grid companies have
implemented a range of marketing, education and outreach (ME&O) activities to contribute
towards meeting their EEO targets. 187
State Grid ESCOs have constructed an energy efficiency service platform where experts and
energy users can get together to study energy efficiency policies and technologies and conduct
energy audits. In June 2011, State Grid also launched a campaign to promote end-use energy
efficiency. The campaign broadly disseminates information about energy efficiency and
educates people to change to a high-efficiency and low-carbon lifestyle. 188
Southern Grid provides energy audits to large end-users, and conducts energy efficiency
demonstration projects in steelmaking, chemical, and non-ferrous metal industries. 189 Southern
Grid has also developed an energy savings service platform “Nandudu”. 190

5.8        Funding
The EEO guidance document states that DSM programme implementation, management, and
evaluation costs can be funded in four ways: 191
• through a city utility surcharge (城市公共事业附加费), collected through electricity tariffs: 192
• through revenues from differential electricity prices ( 差 别 电 价 ), mainly through
  implementing differential prices for energy-intensive industries; 193,194
• through DSM special funds created and managed by each provincial government; these
  provincial special funds may provide subsidies for key energy efficiency projects, as well as
  communication, education, and evaluation of energy efficiency programs;

187
      Grid companies may claim only ten percent of any energy savings made by customers as a result of
      energy efficiency promotions and these savings must not exceed five percent of total eligible energy
      savings.

      This surcharge took effect in 1964 to support public utilities. Provincial governments set the surcharge
      amounts for each item (e.g., the industrial power use surcharge is five to ten percent of the electricity
      price). In Ningxia Autonomous Region and Jilin province, the rate for DSM special use is fixed at CNY
      0.001/kWh.
193
      State Council of China (2006).
194
      Differential electricity pricing is applied to energy-intensive enterprises in eight industries (electrolytic
      aluminium, ferroalloy, calcium carbide, caustic soda, cement, steel, yellow phosphorus, and zinc
      smelting). Enterprises are divided into three categories according to resource consumption and
      technology level. The three categories and their applicable prices are: “permit and promote” paying
      the standard provincial industrial power price; “restrict” paying a surcharge of CNY 0.05 to 0.1/kWh;
      and “eliminate” paying a surcharge of CNY 0.2 to 0.3/kWh in addition to the first class power price.
      New pricing mechanisms such as time-of-use prices, inclining block tariffs, seasonal prices, and price
      discounts for interruptible loads, are only applied in some large cities in China.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

• through other fiscal means, for example, an energy saving and emission reduction special
  fund ( 节 能 减 排 专 项 资 金 ) established through the budgets of central and provincial
  governments. 195
The EEO guidance document also states that reasonable DSM expenses incurred by grid
companies can be recovered as part of power supply costs. 196 Currently, grid companies are
recovering their costs by including all DSM expenses under a broad accounting category “power
supply cost”. There is no accounting mechanism that enables grid companies to separately
identify DSM expenditures.
Grid companies that establish ESCO subsidiaries to implement energy efficiency projects may be
eligible for targeted ESCO funding from the central and provincial governments. In June 2010,
the central government’s Ministry of Finance and the NDRC released a new financial incentives
policy for ESCOs carrying out projects under shared savings energy performance contracts
(EPCs) 197. In October 2010, a further regulation 198 stipulated that financial incentives would be
provided for projects involving boiler/furnace retrofitting, waste heat and waste pressure
utilization, motor system energy conservation, energy system optimization, green lighting, and
energy conservation in buildings. This regulation also listed categories of projects that are not
eligible for funding, such as projects with the purpose of increasing production capacity, and
projects involving solar, wind, biomass, and combined heat and power.
To receive the incentives, ESCOs are required to officially register with the NDRC and to have
equipment and statistical systems in place to measure achieved energy savings. Under the
policy, qualified EPC projects receive from the central government CNY240 per ton of standard
coal equivalent (tce) energy saved and at least CNY60/tce from provincial and municipal
governments, with some of these governments opting to pledge more. Grid company ESCOs
that qualify to register with the NDRC are eligible to receive this funding.
Despite the various funding sources available, grid companies in China face significant costs in
acquiring energy and demand savings that are not fully covered by government financial
incentives. In addition, grid company revenues are reduced because they sell less electricity. At
present, the regulatory regime in China does not compensate grid companies for this reduction
in revenue. In common with electricity utilities in other jurisdictions, Chinese grid companies are
concerned about the revenue reduction that results from encouraging customers to use
electricity more efficiently. This is exacerbated in China because the State-Owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission evaluates grid company performance primarily on
the revenue they earn and the profit they make. There are no performance metrics that
recognize grid companies’ achievements in acquiring energy savings. Grid company
management are concerned that the performance of their companies may be downgraded
because of the reduction in profit resulting from their implementation of energy efficiency
projects in compliance with the EEO. 199

195
      The main objective of this fund is to encourage green production and environmental protection
      projects by giving subsidies, interest discounts, or other incentives. Local governments select projects
      based on proposals; the financial requirements and support amount vary among provinces. According
      to energy savings and emission reduction audits in 20 provinces, from 2007 to 2009, up to CNY 124
      billion was allocated to support energy saving projects.

5.9       Results
In both 2012 and 2013, the grid companies achieved their EEO energy savings and demand
reduction targets. In 2013, the total energy savings (on a first-year savings basis) were 16.2 TWh,
and the total load reduction was 3.44 GW. Under the Compliance Evaluation Scheme, all
provincial grid companies, except for Tibet, passed the evaluation, with 17 assessed as Excellent,
12 Good and one Qualified. 200 Table 17 shows detailed performance data by region in 2013.

State Grid Corporation of China
In response to the EEO, State Grid created ESCOs in all 26 provinces within its service territory as
subsidiaries of the State Grid-owned provincial grid companies, plus an additional ESCO at the
corporate level. As of October 2014, all of these ESCOs, except for Tibet, are registered with the
NDRC and the Ministry of Finance. Their main roles are implementing energy efficiency projects,
delivering specialised energy and consultancy services, and helping to organise workshops and
seminars to better engage end-users in energy efficiency programs. State Grid has also built
high-voltage DC transmission lines and reduced line losses. In addition, State Grid also
strengthened its commitment to green procurement, promoting energy efficient products, high-
efficiency electric motors, and other energy efficient equipment. 202
China Southern Grid Company
Southern Grid established a single ESCO at the corporate level that covers all four provinces
within the Southern Grid service territory. In 2007, Southern Grid commenced its “Green
Action” program, which it is now using to meet its EEO targets. Under this program, Southern
Grid has: 203
• increased the efficiency of transmission and distribution networks by optimising grid
  structure, selecting energy efficient transformers, and introducing innovative transmission
  system designs;
• implemented energy saving (environmental) dispatch by giving priority to renewables and
  more efficient coal-fired power plants;
• planned to save 27.2 TWh of electricity from 2010 to 2015 by building efficiency power
  plants 204 fully exploiting the energy efficiency potential in green lighting, high-efficiency
  electrical devices, and residential appliances; and
• emphasised energy services by changing from pure peak load management to end-use
  energy efficiency, and from concentrating on electricity consumption management to
  providing comprehensive energy services through the Southern Grid ESCO subsidiary.

5.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
The Compliance Evaluation Scheme for the grid company EEO was established by the NRDC in
2011 on a trial basis 205 and updated in 2014 206 (see Table 18). Evaluation of grid company
performance in relation to the EEO is based on a scoring system that awards points for both
energy savings achieved and implementation actions completed. The maximum achievable
score is 100 points, with measures related to the EEO target receiving a maximum of 60 points
and DSM implementation receiving a maximum of 40 points. There are four defined

      The efficiency power plant (EPP) concept was first developed in China by the Regulatory
      Assistance Project in 2004, in recognition of the fact that conventional power plants (CPPs)
      have well defined planning and investment frameworks whereas energy efficiency does not.
      An EPP is a carefully selected portfolio of energy efficiency projects that provides a specified
      quantity of load reduction over a particular time period, with a level of reliability similar to
      the output from a CPP.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

The 2014 update of the Compliance Evaluation Scheme was based on the grid companies’
experience in achieving their EEO targets. There were some changes in the allocation of points
to sub-categories, as shown in Table 18. Two new sub-categories were created that assigned
points for grid companies achieving end-use energy savings (as distinct from supply-side savings
such as reducing line losses) and for grid companies’ progress in building data platforms to
monitor energy savings.
Claimed energy savings were originally self-reported by the grid companies using their own
EM&V methodologies, including deemed savings values developed for some energy efficiency
measures by China Electric Power Research Institute, a subsidiary of State Grid. In early 2013,
NDRC circulated a draft procedures manual for measurement, reporting, and verification of
energy savings for trial by the grid companies and provincial governments that was largely based
on EM&V practices in the United States. This methodology was subsequently revised based on
experiences in the trial.
The EEO placed on grid companies also requires the installation of load monitoring equipment
on 70 percent of the peak load. The energy use data being collected from this equipment and
aggregated through data platforms will eventually form a valuable national resource that will
provide a unique insight into how energy is being used in China. 210 These data will also open up
major opportunities for the development and implementation of highly accurate EM&V of
energy efficiency projects and programs.

5.11 Cost-Effectiveness
In China, total resource costs and supply-side benefits are not factored into cost effectiveness
considerations when designing energy efficiency programs. Energy efficiency projects are usually
implemented mainly to meet government energy efficiency targets, such as the grid company
EEO, though cost-effectiveness may be taken into consideration for individual projects. In the
United States, utilities often find that acquiring energy efficiency resources is often cheaper, and
more economically efficient than generating or purchasing electricity. In China, the grid
companies currently do not assess the cost-effectiveness of acquiring energy efficiency
resources as compared with purchasing bulk electricity from generators. It difficult for the grid
companies to carry out this assessment because of the lack of a mechanism to separately
account for DSM expenses. Locating the acquisition of energy efficiency resources in ESCO
subsidiaries outside grid companies’ core businesses also makes cost-effectiveness assessment
difficult. 211

5.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
The Compliance Evaluation Scheme 212 states that the NDRC will reward those grid companies
that achieve an “Excellent” result but there are no further details about how performance
incentives will be provided. At present, no sanction is applied to grid companies that fail to meet
their EEO targets, but details of non-compliance are published by the NDRC.

5.13 Response to Stress Situations
Tight electricity supply situations and power shortages often occur in most of China’s central
and southern provinces, particularly on hot days in summer. Currently, electricity peak load
problems are generally dealt with administratively through a planning and rationing process
known as ”orderly use of electricity”. Plans are prepared each year at provincial and local levels
defining how to ration grid capacity under different degrees of expected shortage. These plans
try to rely first on peak load shifting and peak load avoidance measures, but also provide for
mandatory demand rationing and finally involuntary curtailment of supply, if needed. Some
priority customers are provided with guaranteed (“firm”) supply, while the others are ranked for
involuntary rationing measures, with advanced warning if possible.
Provincial and local government power operation departments (or their counterparts) oversee
the orderly use of electricity process. Individual end-users propose how much load reduction
they can provide, if required. The order in which curtailments will be implemented is decided
through a government-led process in conjunction with grid companies and end-users. When
peak loads exceed available grid capacity and curtailments are necessary, government officials
decide which end-users are going to be shut off at peak times, according to the predetermined
order. Once the order of curtailments is decided, end-users' ability to negotiate whether they
will be curtailed and the timing of actual curtailments is very limited.
While the EEO guidance document states that grid company DSM activities should be prioritised
to meet electricity demand during tight supply situations and power shortages, taking action to
deal with these situations is the responsibility of provincial and local governments rather than
the grid companies.

5.14 Overall Effectiveness
China’s grid company energy efficiency obligation is relatively new and the grid companies have
experienced some difficulties in changing their business models to achieve the EEO energy
savings and load reduction targets. Both grid companies have chosen to establish subsidiary
ESCOs to carry out energy efficiency projects. This use of ESCOs as the main delivery mechanism
locates the acquisition of energy efficiency resources in a separate, subsidiary business unit
outside the grid company core business rather than incorporating energy efficiency into the grid
company business model. 213 This raises questions about the commitment of the grid companies
to achieving the EEO targets and suggests that the EEO mechanism may not continue over the
long term without further policy action by government. In addition, the levels of the two EEO
targets are very low compared with targets for utility delivery of energy efficiency in other
jurisdictions. 214 In 2013, the total energy savings (on a first-year savings basis) were 16.2 TWh,
and the total load reduction was 3.44 GW. These savings may seem large, but in a country the
size of China they are not particularly ambitious. While it is too soon to enable a robust
assessment of the effectiveness of the grid company EEO in China, performance to date has not
been outstanding.

5.15 Lessons Learnt
China’s grid company energy efficiency obligation is one of the latest examples worldwide that
uses a government-imposed obligation to ensure that utilities assist their customers to use
electricity efficiently. The implementation of the EEO in China has been particularly difficult
because of the very large size of the grid companies, their ability to influence the political
process, and their complete lack of any experience in delivering energy efficiency. Despite the
reluctance by the grid companies to engage with end-use energy efficiency, in both 2012 and
2013, the grid companies achieved their EEO energy savings and demand reduction targets
though, given the size of China, these results were not particularly ambitious. Jurisdictions
looking to use a government-imposed EEO in situations where there is no prior experience with
utility delivery of energy efficiency may learn useful lessons from the China case study.

6.         UTILITY DSM PROGRAMS IN INDIA
6.1        Introduction
In 2012, India consumed 940 TWh of electricity, or about 760 kWh per capita, a figure that is
about one-fifth of the world average per capita electricity consumption. 215,216 Nearly 300 million
of the 1.2 billion population remain without access to electricity. 217 Coal provides the majority of
electricity generation, at 68 percent, and is a large part of the 1.9 gigatonnes per year of
greenhouse gas emissions from India, 5.6 percent of the world’s total. 218 India also suffers
chronic nationwide shortages of electricity due in large measure to fuel availability and
costs. 219,220,221 India has a long history of subsidizing the prices of electricity, especially for
agricultural needs and low-end domestic /residential consumers that has contributed to high
demands and confounded efforts to encourage greater conservation and energy efficiency. 222
The government considers DSM, energy efficiency, and conservation to be central to its goal of
delivering “power for all”. 223
From 1985, the Ministry of Power (then the Department of Power) functioned as the nodal point
for the Government of India to facilitate the implementation of a coordinated strategy on
energy conservation. The Ministry also provided funding support for strengthening energy
conservation programs, including outreach programs. In 1989, with the assistance of the World
Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, an Energy Management Center was
established in New Delhi as an autonomous organization to promote energy conservation. The
Centre coordinated energy auditing of consumers’ facilities, energy management systems,
education and training, and energy generation and conservation-based employment and
poverty alleviation programs. 224
Subsequently, decades of interest and work by the Government of India on energy efficiency
and conservation led to the Energy Conservation Act of 2001 225 and state level DSM regulatory
initiatives a decade later. One of the outcomes of the 2001 Act was the establishment of the
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in March 2002. The BEE is a government agency devoted to
the task of promoting energy conservation and efficiency, and is an agency of the Ministry of
Power. The 2001 Act created BEE as a combined regulatory authority and program

      Today, India’s 260 GW of installed electric generating capacity is significantly higher than the roughly
      140 GW of peak demand. Yet blackouts are common. The primary problem is fuel availability and cost.
      Coal generation is somewhat dependent on imported coal and significant price volatility. Discoms that
      buy electricity from plants fired with imported coal face significant and unpredictable upward pressure
      on tariffs, a situation that state utilities as well as state regulators have tried to avoid by simply not
      buying, even in the face of local shortages and rolling blackouts. (Personal communication from Cathie

implementation body. 226 The BEE also functions as an entity that collaborates with electricity
distribution companies (Discoms) in the implementation of nationally-coordinated energy
efficiency and DSM programs. In at least 14 states in India, regulators have established formal
DSM implementation rules and requirements. 227
In India, electricity distribution is owned primarily by government, with some private ownership,
comprising roughly five percent of energy use. Seventy percent of government-owned electricity
utilities in India today have an energy department that operates DSM programs. The utility
programs delivered through these entities are still in the formative stages of development;
awareness and technical expertise in India promise to grow with the capacity building efforts of
BEE. Utilities are being provided with financial aid from the central government, and
international organizations such as the United States Agency for International Development, the
United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, Germany’s Deutsche Gesellschaft
fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the Japan International Cooperation Agency , and the World
Bank provide funds to the central government to indirectly help run these programs. State
regulators have authority to permit recovery of DSM program costs and also provide incentives
for delivery of DSM through electricity prices. 228,229
Private sector utilities have been more active in implementing DSM programs than their
publicly-owned counterparts. Private utilities only function in eight to 10 cities and account for
approximately two percent of India’s end-use electricity consumption. Government-owned and
operated discoms still control some 98 percent of the distribution system by customer share.
The largest private sector utilities, Tata Power and Reliance Energy, have been involved in DSM
programs since 2002 and work in collaboration with the central government and various
manufacturers to provide programs to their customers.
Figure 14 (page 60) shows the power sector and the role of government in each segment of the
electricity industry. The bottom row in Figure 14 shows electricity consumption by customer
class; industry accounts for 46 per cent of electricity consumption followed by the residential
sector (21 percent), agriculture (17 percent), and then the commercial sector (nine percent).
Regulatory oversight of the electricity sector in India is carried out by both the Central Electricity
Regulatory Commission (CEA or CERC) and the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs)
that exist in most states. Figure 15 (page 60) shows that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is
the main Government of India agency responsible for implementing energy efficiency policies
and programs. The BEE figures prominently in the delivery of energy efficiency and conservation
in India. Part of that role involves some coordination of state institutions and utilities
responsible for the delivery of DSM. Indeed the BEE is credited with responsibility for creating
DSM and energy efficiency cells in utilities, encouraging state regulators to allow the recovery of
DSM and energy efficiency expenditures in electricity prices, and creating better tariff designs,
including time-of-use pricing to complement DSM initiatives. 230

India embarked on an innovative energy efficiency initiative in 2012 called Perform, Achieve &
Trade (or “PAT”) to require improvements in energy efficiency performance among some 478
industrial establishments as part of the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency
(NMEEE). While the PAT initiative is distinct from traditional DSM initiatives that rely on utilities
or third parties, it has some common elements; generation has a role as a targeted subsector, as
do large industrial end use customers. In all, the PAT initiative was expected to produce 10 GW
of savings by 2012, and 19 GW by 2014/15. 233

6.2        Policy Objectives
The policy objectives for energy efficiency and DSM in India are largely set out in the Electricity
Act of 2003, the National Electricity Policy and the National Electricity Plan. The Act includes
some sections that emphasize a role for energy efficiency. 234 The National Electricity Policy was
adopted in February 2005. 235 Section 5.9 of the Policy emphasizes the role of efficient pumping
in agriculture, the potential role of ESCOs in delivering energy efficiency services, the need for
an energy awareness campaign, the importance of rate design, particularly time-of-use pricing
to motivate load shifting and better capital utilization. The Policy includes strategies such as
energy performance labeling that encourage voluntary (or market transformational) changes in
electricity use. The Policy further establishes a role for the BEE in estimating the energy
efficiency resource potential and costs. 236 The current National Electricity Plan was adopted by
the Central Electricity Authority in 2012. 237 The Plan established targets and strategies for
implementing and achieving electricity savings equal to approximately 45 TWh.

6.3        Legal Authority
The legal foundation for private utility investment in DSM is included in the Electricity Act of
2003 238 and state level statutes governing the authority of state regulators. State level
regulations governing utility delivery of DSM currently exist in at least 14 states. 239 The legal
authority for the establishment of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the 2001 Energy
Conservation Act. 240 The Electricity Regulatory Commission Act 1998 constituted the Central
Electricity Regulatory Authority (CEA or CERC). 241 The 1998 Act also encouraged the states to
establish their own State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) to regulate retail and
distribution tariffs.

6.4        Coverage
Utility energy efficiency and DSM projects in India target all economic sectors and all premises
and facilities within these sectors.

6.5        Energy Savings Targets
In 2012, the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) proposed electricity
savings targets to be established in the 12th Five Year Plan ending in 2016/17 (see Table 19,
page 62). At current exchange rates, the approximately INR 74.8 billion budget in Table 19 is
equal to USD 1.23 billion, assuming INR 61 per USD. These targets represent ambitions for
electricity savings at the national level through mechanisms to potentially build on or
complement utility DSM initiatives, highlighting the scale of opportunity that exists through
utility programs. This represents a national target that is distinct from the state and utility
targets that are set by state policy makers and utilities that engage in some form of integrated
planning efforts to include DSM.

     The Indian Forum of Regulators has been entrusted with the responsibility to evolve common
     and coordinated approaches to the issues faced by the various state electricity regulatory
     commissions in India. The Forum of Regulators constituted a working group on “DSM and Energy
     Efficiency” to address issues related to the implementation of energy efficiency and DSM
     measures in the electricity distribution sector in India. 243

In India, all economic sectors are targeted for DSM and energy efficiency projects and the
number of projects implemented is increasing. Figure 16 shows the trends for DSM programs by
sector over time.




                                                                                             244

Agriculture
Roughly 50 percent of India’s populations are farmers and 20 percent of the farmers rely on
electric pumps. Lack of perennial rivers has necessitates heavy reliance on ground water tapping
for irrigation in south India and contributed to the increase in consumption of electricity by the
agricultural sector. 245
Water pumping load in the agricultural sector in India is important to utilities for several
reasons. Agricultural pump sets are often at the end of long rural lines. They are costly to build
and maintain and are responsible for large line losses. The electricity supply to pumps is often
unmetered, providing electricity that is essentially free of charge. In such cases there is little
incentive for agricultural customers to use electricity efficiently.
Maharastra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd, a distribution company in the state of
Maharashtra, has implemented an agricultural DSM project pilot with a target replacement of
3,530 existing pumps with energy efficient pumps. 246 The project is noteworthy for the complex
set of variables that combine to influence existing inefficient pumping, including a tariff design
that charges at a price that is independent of energy demand, an unreliable grid that effectively
reinforces pumping during the hours when the grid is up and running, and poor knowledge of
equipment selection and operation for better efficiency. Each pump replacement offers the
potential for electricity savings of up to a 40 percent.
If the program were successful and extended to the roughly 20 million pumps nationally, the
savings from this project alone could reduce demand by 62.1 TWh annually, or roughly 6.5

percent of total energy demand. 247 Depending on the particulars of the program
implementation, which may involve reliance on ESCOs and Clean Development Mechanism
funding, the internal rate of return on the project may be between 19 and 23 percent. 248
Thermal Energy Storage
Thermal energy storage (TES) involves shifting the load of large central air-conditioning plants
from peak to off-peak periods. With TES, the central air-conditioning plants run at night and
convert water to ice. During the day, air-conditioning is switched off and the building is cooled
by the energy stored in ice.
Tata Power offers a pilot TES program that provides users with incentives for shifting their air-
conditioning load to off-peak hours. The pilot program incentivizes the consumers by offering a
special rebate. To carry out EM&V of the energy savings, Tata Power will install metering and
energy monitoring systems on chiller plants using the TES technology. Customers benefit from
the lower energy costs from shifting use under the time-of-use tariffs, from lower demand
charges and from the incentives offered by Tata. The utility benefits from better capacity
utilization from improving load factors, lower generation costs from shifting loads off the most
expensive resources, and from improvements to grid reliability. 249
Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY)
The BEE functions as a coordinator of Discom utility programs including efforts to promote
certain energy efficiency initiatives. A good example of this coordination is the compact
fluorescent light program known as the Bachat Lamp Yojana scheme (BLY).
The objective of the BLY scheme is to promote energy efficient lighting and provide access to
energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) at the same cost as that of incandescent light
bulbs. The cost differential is made up by project implementers through carbon credits earned
which can be traded in the international market under the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. There are no requirements in India requiring the use or purchase
of energy efficient CFLs. All the key players in the BLY scheme, including the BEE and
participating implementer(s), Discoms and households are voluntarily taking part in the scheme.
Perform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT)
The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) was established as a result of the
National Action Plan on Climate Change released by the Prime Minister in June 2008. Among the
principles articulated in that plan was that of “devising efficient and cost-effective strategies for
end-use demand-side measures.” The National Action Plan listed eight missions for achieving
the goals related to climate change, including the National Mission for Enhanced Energy
Efficiency. BEE was tasked by the Ministry of Power with implementing the mission.
Among the four NMEEE initiatives advanced through BEE was the Perform, Achieve, & Trade
(PAT) scheme. PAT is a market-based mechanism designed to make improvements in energy
efficiency in energy-intensive large industries. The targets for energy consumption reduction by
the 478 industrial enterprises obligated under the PAT scheme (including 144 thermal power
units) were established by BEE. The trade component of the scheme allows for some market
flexibility through trading between obligated enterprises to achieve energy savings results cost-

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

effectively. The BEE initiatives also included components related to market transformation,
economic development, and financing of energy efficiency. 250
Because the energy efficiency obligation is placed on end-users, the PAT scheme is not
technically a DSM program implemented by distribution utilities and it is not limited to
electricity. However, it does provide an innovative approach for national governments seeking
similar savings from large industry, employing some measure of market flexibility toward the
achievement of energy savings targets. While BEE is responsible for the program design, setting
targets and accrediting auditors, it is the obligated industrial enterprises that bear the
responsibility of meeting their energy savings targets. The power sector is responsible for
achieving their own savings targets. The CERC has responsibility for addressing regulations
relevant to the implementation of the PAT as it applies to the electric utilities. 251
Joint Venture ESCO Delivery
Growth of energy services companies (ESCOs) has been slow in India and ESCOs have captured
only about five percent of the market for energy efficiency services. However, the potential is
thought to be quite large. The concept of performance contracting by ESCOs is increasingly
considered as a mechanism for implementing large-scale energy efficiency projects. To help
address the low level of ESCO activity, the Ministry of Power set up Energy Efficiency Services
Limited (EESL) as a joint venture of a several companies. EESL has an exclusive charge to deliver
energy efficiency or energy efficiency-related services. 252 These services include the following:
• perform and promote energy efficiency, including the manufacture and supply of energy
  efficiency services and products;
• implement energy efficiency projects for municipal functions, agriculture, public building,
  lighting etc.;
• implement initiatives of central and state governments., Bureau of Energy Efficiency, or any
  other agencies related to energy efficiency;
• partner with other companies to promote energy efficiency;
• provide energy efficiency consultancy services in the field of Clean Development Mechanism
  projects;
• help build sector capacity for relevant stakeholders;
• serve as a resource center in the field of energy efficiency.
EESL has been involved in several street light replacement programs and a large-scale LED
replacement program involving utility customers in two states. An ESCO LED initiative, the DSM
Electric Lighting Program (DELP) responds to the major contribution of domestic electric lighting
to overall demand. According to promotional materials, the replacement of inefficient lighting
with efficient lighting in domestic situations can reduce demand in India by 50 TWh. 253

6.7        Marketing, Education and Outreach
In India, marketing, education and outreach related to energy efficiency broadly occurs through
the BEE. The importance of effective outreach was highlighted in the 2005National Electricity
Policy. 254 BEE serves as the national focal point for all communications, marketing and outreach
that occurs at the national level. The BEE website provides information on ESCO, programs,
projects, and partners. 255
One form of education and outreach is through awards. The Ministry of Power, through BEE,
organizes the annual energy conservation awards on National Energy Conservation Day (each
14th of December). These awards recognize innovation and achievements in energy
conservation by industry and commercial buildings. 256
In India, utility-delivered DSM is still in the early stages of implementation. Funds from the
Shakti Foundation have been used to create a portal for sharing information about DSM pilot
projects in India. Inputs obtained from distribution companies, utilities and regulators and
collaborators map the landscape and technology potential for DSM and present this in the form
of website reports. 257

6.8        Funding
In India, utility DSM programs are provided with financial aid from the central government, and
from international organizations such as the United States Agency for International
Development and the World Bank who provide funds to the central government to indirectly
help implement DSM programs. 258 Although there is funding from different sources, it has not
yet been significant enough to establish utility DSM programs on a large scale. 259
State regulatory commissions are authorized to fund energy conservation and efficiency
initiatives through the tariff approval process. 260 In 2012, the CERC proposed the establishment
of State Energy Conservation Funds in each of the 29 states to include provisions for matching
funds for implementation of programs through state-designated agencies. 261 At least 10 states
have DSM regulations and another three have draft regulations in progress that includes funding
provisions in tariffs. 262,263

6.9        Results
India scores highly on international comparisons among nations with regard to energy efficiency
across all sectors, largely due to its successes with transportation and establishing voluntary
standards for commercial buildings. More than 65 percent of passenger travel relies on some

form of public transportation. 264 The BEE reports that avoided generation capacity of 415 MW
has been achieved by the CFL distribution program during the 11th Five Year plan. These results
are verified by a third party. 265
Indian electricity distribution utilities have demonstrated some success with respect to utility
delivered energy efficiency or DSM through pilots. Results from earlier pilot projects to date are
promising.
Agricultural Pumps -- Noida Power Company Limited (NPCL), which services the Greater Noida
regional of Uttar Pradesh, engaged in a pilot project with 100 customers completed in 2008 to
improve power factors and energy efficiency of hydro pumping for agricultural needs. Results of
the project suggested an average customer peak load reduction of 4.5 kW (from 7.6 kW to 3 kW),
improvements in the power factor of each pump from 0.65 to 0.85, and energy savings of
roughly 7,300 per pump annually (10,800 kWh to 3,510 kWh per year). 266
Efficient Lighting 1 – In 2005, Bangalore Efficient Lighting Program was developed by Bangalore
Electricity Supply Company partnered with the BEE under bilateral funding from USAID. The lack
of quantitative results makes evaluation difficult. Nevertheless, implementation of the program
resulted in reduced electricity bills and increased availability of low cost, high quality CFLs to
customers. The program benefited the utility in peak load reduction and improved customer
relations and to society through reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 267
Efficient Lighting 2 – Also in 2005, Maharastra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd engaged in a
lighting program to bridge the demand/supply gap and to reduce load shedding. The Discom
wanted to implement a State level CFL program by making CFLs available to residential and
small commercial sector consumers at discounted rates. The main objective of the proposed
state level CFL program was to reduce demand during peak hours. Before doing so, it
implemented a pilot in Nashik. About 100,000 residential and commercial customers
participated in the project involving 380,000 CFL bulbs. The project resulted in savings of 12 to
16 megawatt-hours of energy per year and 7 to 9 megawatts of peak load reduction. 268
Street Light Replacement – In 2006, there was an expected demand/supply gap in the Mumbai
region of 250 to 275 MW during peak hours. In 2008, Reliance Infrastructure Limited initiated
and implemented a DSM program that involved replacement of existing lamps with high-
efficiency lamps used for street lighting. The program replaced 36,559 lamps of 80 and 125
watts with 70 watt high-efficiency lamps. Total annual energy savings from the program were
5.4 GWh, with a peak load reduction of 1.33 MW on a project investment of INR 54.8 million. 269

6.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
EM&V is still taking shape in India and it is likely that markets for energy savings will determine
what sort of EM&V is necessary and suitable. In the meantime, Indian organizations are
currently putting a great deal of time and effort into establishing an energy efficiency EM&V
industry.

A member-driven industry association founded in 2008, the Alliance for an Energy Efficient
Economy (AEEE), has been actively involved in developing EM&V regulations, as well as working
with organizations such as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to build EM&V capacity at
regulatory agencies and utilities. AEEE has been the primary Efficiency Valuation Organization
Indian affiliate since 2009. As part of this affiliation, the Alliance has conducted a number of
awareness seminars and training certification programs on the International Performance,
Measurement, and Verification Protocol. Between 2008 and 2011, EM&V training programs run
by AEEE reached out to more than 250 professionals, and 65 were certified eligible to apply
IPMVP standards. AEEE has also sponsored a number of EM&V conferences, including an
international conference in October 2012 on India’s EM&V experiences that mostly
concentrated on the PAT scheme. 270

6.11 Cost-Effectiveness
Estimates suggest that reduction in greenhouse gas emissions totalling about 260 MtCO2e by
2030 can be achieved through negative- or moderate-cost energy efficiency initiatives. 271
Certain DSM programs that improve load factor and improve system reliability offer the
potential for immediate returns to utilities as they improve revenue streams and better manage
their costs of generation and delivery. The calculations based on pilots for agricultural pump
initiatives suggest a quick payback for utilities involved.

6.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
Provision for cost recovery of DSM expenditures occurs through state regulators in the tariff
setting process. The DSM regulations from each of the state regulators contain provisions for
the implementation of penalties and incentives. Model DSM regulations were developed in 2009
for the Forum of Regulators. 272 This model includes provisions for incentives. Similar provisions
have been incorporated in state regulatory authority provisions to date. 273

6.13 Response to Stress Situations
India is somewhat unusual among middle income countries in the persistence of issues around
the energy production capacity of its generation fleet. As the CERC notes, “The gap between
electricity supply and demand in terms of both capacity (i.e. MW) and energy (i.e. MWh) has
been steadily growing in India.” 274 DSM initiatives, especially those that shift loads, such as
thermal energy storage and agricultural pumping, offer promise of improving system reliability.

6.14 Overall Effectiveness
Given the early stage of DSM activities in India, the overall effectiveness of these efforts is still
difficult to gauge. The combined role of the BEE, the state regulators, and electric utilities
appears to offer considerable opportunity to weave together a framework that capitalizes on
the respective strengths of each group. 275 Elements of this complementary relationship are
already evident. The results of the case studies shared on the BEE DSM Information Hub

suggests that the opportunities extend widely and quick paybacks are realized from the
investments in energy efficiency. 276

6.15 Lessons Learnt
India provides an example of close involvement by the central and state governments in the
development of a policy and regulatory framework to enable utility delivery of end-use energy
efficiency. The Government of India has established a solid foundation of sector reform and a
framework for delivering DSM that has been decades in the making. The framework relies
increasingly on electric distribution utilities, but also on the national government in the form of
the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). Oversight of the electric utilities and the regulations that
give form to the DSM activities are established by the state electricity regulatory authorities.
However, the energy efficiency and DSM industry in India is still at an early stage. Most of the
projects developed and implemented by the distribution utilities are pilot projects that reduce
the uncertainty involved in achieving energy savings. 277
The introduction of what amounts to a super-ESCO in Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL)
introduces a promising new way to spur the development of third-party delivery models that
can be coupled with funding from utility customers and the Clean Development Mechanism for
additional opportunities in developing regions.
While not typically a direct part of the DSM delivery system, the BEE is a useful and constructive
complement to a nation with many utilities in different states subject to the jurisdiction of both
state and national electricity regulators. BEE helps provide cohesion among the state activities,
and a centralizing instrument for implementation national government policy around energy
efficiency and DSM. The BEE is also provides a focal point for communications, an instrument for
the sharing of ideas and materials, and for sharing experiences among state level initiatives
around energy efficiency and DSM. The BEE also provides a centralized mechanism for
promoting EM&V capabilities at scale and in a way that consistently high standards.
There is considerable opportunity for the Government of India to move beyond the
demonstration projects around DSM and employ utilities to deliver energy efficiency and DSM.
Tariff design and persistent subsidies in the agricultural sector continue to confound efforts to
promote greater energy efficiency in agricultural pumping.

7.         BRAZIL’S UTILITY ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
7.1        Introduction
Brazil is the fifth largest nation in the world by population and by area and the tenth largest
economy in the world. More than 99 percent of Brazilians have access to electricity and Brazil is
poised to achieve its target of 100 percent electrification in the near term. 278 Sixty percent of the
electricity demand is in the southeast region of the country, including Rio de Janeiro and São
Paulo.
Brazil is somewhat unique in its rich endowment of clean energy resources. Brazil relies
disproportionately on hydro resources and is well positioned to expand the mix of variable
renewable energy resources. It is also rich in natural gas and oil capacity.
Brazil has over 120 GW of generation capacity and 68 percent is hydro-electric. There are nearly
900 hydro-electric facilities on Brazilian rivers, ranging in size from the very large (14 GW) to the
very small. The remaining generation facilities are renewables (primarily wind, solar, and
bioenergy), fossil-fuel thermal plants, and nuclear reactors. Nearly 85 percent of Brazil’s
electricity comes from renewable sources. 279 Figure 17 shows energy production in Brazil and
the predominance of hydro as a source of generation which is the major contributor to the low
carbon footprint of the electricity sector in Brazil. The numerous hydro reservoirs give the
Brazilian electricity system a significant degree of flexibility, making the system an enabler of
variable energy resources such as wind.

                          Figure 18. Power Market Structure in Brazil

The institutions responsible for policy setting for the power sector are the Ministry of Mines and
Energy (MMA) and the Energy Policy National Council (CNPE). ANEEL (Agência Nacional de
Energia Elétrica or National Electricity Regulatory Agency) is the power sector regulator. In
addition to other functions, ANEEL is responsible for establishing energy efficiency targets and
funding DSM. 282 The Energy Planning Authority (ENE) is the research arm of the MMA and is
responsible for guidance to the ministry on the resource potential for energy efficiency and DSM
investments.
The 52 percent state-owned electricity utility Eletrobras is responsible for 38 percent of Brazil’s
generation, most of its transmission (either directly or as part of a consortium) and for six of the
smaller distribution companies.
Brazil has a comparatively low electricity intensity relative to other nations. The average
Brazilian consumed around 2,300 kWh of electricity in 2011, 40 percent below the equivalent
figure for South Africa (even though GDP per capita in the two countries is very similar) and 20
percent below the figure for China (despite Brazil’s higher per capita income). 283
The prices paid for electricity are high by the standards of middle income countries. The
International Energy Agency reported prices paid in 2012 by industry at USD 178 per MWh and
around USD 237 per MWh for residential customers. 284 These price levels are roughly in the
median of OECD nations. Similar to other BRIC nations, like South Africa and China, residential
electricity customers in Brazil have access to an inclining block tariff structure that serves the
dual purpose of providing both a discount for low-usage customers who are also typically lower-
income, and an efficiency signal to higher use customers in the upper tariff blocks. Customers

with monthly consumption less than 30 kWh receive a discount of 65 percent for that initial
block. A 40 percent discount applies to the block from 31 kWh through 100 kWh, and a
10 percent discount applies from 101 kWh to 220 kWh. 285
In Brazil, there is extensive involvement in energy efficiency and DSM by both the federal
government and by the regulator, ANEEL. The federal government has funded extensive energy
efficiency programs through the majority state-owned national electricity utility, Eletrobras. The
regulator, ANEEL, has imposed a progressively more stringent energy efficiency obligation 286 on
electricity distribution utilities that has, in effect, created a public benefits charge. Brazil is one
of only a few developing nations that have created such a charge. 287

7.2        Policy Objectives
Brazil’s emphasis on energy efficiency dates back to the oil crisis of the 1980s and is rooted in its
desire for greater energy independence. The quest for energy independence also accounts for
development of renewable source of energy in Brazil and exploration for domestic sources of
fossil fuels.
Federal government involvement in energy efficiency commenced in 1985 with the
implementation of an electricity conservation policy that resulted in the establishment by the
federal government of the National Electrical Energy Conservation Program known as PROCEL
(Programa Nacional de Conservação de Energia Elétrica). PROCEL has invested in energy
conservation and energy efficiency from 1986 through to the present. Capacity shortfalls that
occurred during the 2001/02 drought contributed to the emphasis on energy efficiency program
initiatives focused on the power sector. 288 Originally, PROCEL was managed within Eletrobras. In
1991, PROCEL was transformed into a government program coordinated by the Ministry of
Mines and Energy but it still depends on resources from both Eletrobras and a federal loan fund,
the Global Revision Reserve. Eletrobras manages the funds from the Global Revision Reserve. 289
A separate initiative, the Energy Efficiency Program (Programa de Eficiência Energética – PEE),
uses funds from the public benefits charge levied under the utility energy efficiency obligation
administered by ANEEL to promote the efficient and rational use of electricity in all sectors of
the economy through projects that demonstrate how to fight waste and improve energy
efficiency in relation to equipment, processes, and energy end-uses.
Concerns associated with climate change came into focus in 2007 when a presidential decree
was issued and created the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (Comitê
Interministerial sobre Mudança do Clima – CIM). The CIM was given the function of preparing
the National Policy on Climate Change and the National Climate Change Plan. The Plan identifies
actions to mitigate climate change, including a plan for the establishment of a National Action
Plan on Energy Efficiency. 290 Brazil has a national carbon reduction target of between 36.1 and
38.9 percent by 2020, compared to a 2005 baseline. 291

7.3        Legal Authority
Brazilian energy policy is set by means of laws (legislation) and decrees (executive or regulatory
authority). Federal government involvement in energy efficiency commenced in 1985 with
Administrative Directive Number 1877 that established the PROCEL energy efficiency program.
ANEEL, established in 1996 by Law No. 9.427, performs the functions that are normally
associated with economic regulation, including price setting, fixing the conditions for accessing
the networks, supervising auctions, granting concessions, approving market rules and grid
codes, and supervising the Market Operator and System Operator. 292,293
Commencing in 1998, the utility energy efficiency obligation established by ANEEL requires that
a proportion of the net revenues of electricity utilities be allocated for energy efficiency. The
obligation was codified in Law Number 9.991 of 24 July, 2000 requiring that one percent of the
net operating revenue of electricity distribution companies was to be invested into research and
development (R&D) and in end-use energy efficiency programs. The ANEEL Energy Efficiency
Program Manual indicates that “net operating revenues” comprises gross revenues less taxes,
training program expenses, contributions to social security, contributions to the Global Revision
Reserve, investments in R&D and energy efficiency, and contributions to an energy development
account. 294
Law Number 9.991 was later modified by Law No. 12.212 of 20 January 2010, clarifying that up
to 31 December 2015, at least 0.5 percent of utility revenue was to be invested in each sector
(R&D and energy efficiency) respectively and that, additionally, 60 percent of the investment in
energy efficiency was to be targeted towards the population which benefit from the ‘Tarifa
Social’ - the social tariff. 295 Distributors whose electricity sales total less than 1,000GWh are
required to invest 0.25% of their net operating revenues in energy efficiency programs,
increasing to 0.5% in 1 January 2016. 296
There are other Brazilian laws (see Table 20, page 74) that relate to energy efficiency in general
and also complement utility DSM efforts. For example, in 2001, an Energy Efficiency Law was
passed by the Brazilian Congress (Law Number 10,295 of 17 October, 2001). This Law provided
for a National Policy for the Conservation and Rational Use of Energy.

7.4        Coverage
PROCEL funds or co-funds a wide range of energy efficiency projects that extend beyond the
electricity sector. Activities are focused mainly on: research, development and demonstration;
education and training; testing, labeling and standards; marketing and promotion; private sector
support; utility DSM programs; and direct implementation of efficiency measures. 298
Electricity distribution utilities use funds from the Energy Efficiency Program (PEE) administered
by ANEEL to invest in public sector projects, residential, commercial and industrial sector
projects, educational projects, community-based projects, and rural energy efficiency
projects. 299

7.5        Energy Savings Targets
In October, 2011, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MMA) approved a National Plan for Energy
Efficiency. The Plan adopted the earlier targets of the National Action Plan on Climate Change
for 109 TWh of cumulative targeted annual electricity savings by 2030. The targets were
adopted by Interministerial Decree No. 6263 on November 21, 2003. 300,301

7.6        Energy Efficiency Activities
The PEE energy efficiency program has invested over BRL 4.6 billion in the municipal, residential,
commercial and industrial sectors, including education projects. Figure 19 (page 76) shows that
over the period 1998/99 to 2001/02, the majority of expenditure on energy efficiency by
Brazilian utilities was on public lighting programs, followed by residential programs, and
industrial sector and commercial sector programs. After 2002, the Brazilian government
increased the minimum cost benefit ratio required for lighting investments.
ESCOs have played an important role in the design of Brazil’s utility energy efficiency programs
and the delivery of energy savings. Some of the largest utilities in the country have outsourced
the design of energy efficiency projects to ESCOs. In these cases, the utilities decide the types of
projects they intend to pursue and ESCOs compete to design and implement the projects. 302

7.7        Marketing, Education and Outreach
A portion of the PROCEL funds goes to education and training and marketing and promotion,
including school education about energy efficiency technologies. Brazil implemented a voluntary
energy performance labeling program through PROCEL in 1993 that became mandatory with the
promulgation of Law No. 10.395, October 17, 2001.
The ANEEL Energy Efficiency Manual allows for up to five percent of administration and
marketing costs to be included in the costs of program delivery. Distribution utility projects may
also use PEE funds to sponsor energy efficiency education program involving schools,
community groups and low income consumers. 303

7.8        Funding
The PEE energy efficiency program began in 1998 using funds from the public benefits charge
levied under the utility energy efficiency obligation. Table 21 shows the investment levels by
Brazilian utilities in energy efficiency under the PEE program.

                             Table 21. Investments by Brazilian Utilities in
                            End-use Energy Efficiency, 1998/99 to 2003/04 305




The energy efficiency obligation increased by several times the level of investment in energy
efficiency historically made by the PROCEL program. PROCEL invested an average of USD 14
million per year during the period 1994-2003; during the period 1998-2004, utility investments
under the PEE program averaged USD 57 million per year.

Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

The level of funding for the PEE program is a function of utility revenues. Utilities designated by
ANEEL must collect a percentage share of their net operating revenues as a public benefits
charge. 306 A share of the collections are allocated to energy efficiency. The allocation of
revenues has changed very significantly since the initial implementation of the charge in 1998,
and the Brazilian Congress has since passed several laws that impact the specifics of the public
benefits charge. While the total obligation has remained at one percent of utility revenue, the
proportion allocated to energy efficiency programs has varied between 0.9 percent and 0.25
percent. A 2007 law passed by the Brazilian Congress reinstated the energy efficiency allocation
to 0.5 percent, half of which must be spent on energy efficiency measures targeted at low-
income households. 307 A small proportion (about 0.1 percent) is also used to support the
activities of EPE.
Some energy efficiency programs implemented in Brazil are self-funding. Energy performance
labeling programs and a ban in incandescent light bulbs required no explicit involvement of
utility DSM program initiatives.

7.9        Results
Currently, ANEEL initiatives under the PEE program using funds from the public benefits charge
levied under the utility energy efficiency obligation are producing energy savings in excess of 8.5
TWh per year and the reduction in peak demand is around 2.5 GWh. The PROCEL program saved
nearly 70 TWh in 2010 with another 100 TWh expected in 2011. 308 As noted previously, the
activities of PROCEL extend well beyond the delivery of utility delivery of DSM or energy
efficiency programs.

7.10 Evaluation, Measurement and Verification
At present, no independent ex-post evaluation of the energy savings achieved by programs
implemented under the PEE energy efficiency program has been carried out, so the impacts in
terms of avoided capacity and energy savings cannot be determined accurately. 309 In contrast, a
thorough accounting audit of program expenses is performed by ANEEL, in order to ensure that
utilities are complying with their one percent system benefit charge obligation. 310 Since 2007,
ANEEL has also required that evaluation plans must be provided for delivered programs, but
these plans do not require independent evaluations. 311
Concern is sometimes expressed that PROCEL lacks adequate authority to ensure that the
deemed savings levels from equipment purchases may not reflect the reality of PROCEL
activities. Concerns also exist with respect to the M&V activities around utility equipment
replacement programs that target lower income households. Stronger EM&V is needed to
ensure the programs that focus on efficient equipment replacement actually result in the
retirement of inefficient equipment. 312

7.11 Cost-Effectiveness
Information regarding the costs and benefits of projects funded under the PEE energy efficiency
program must be posted on a website 313. Starting in 2001, ANEEL required a cost-benefit ratio of
0.85 or less for project approval. 314

7.12 Performance Incentives and Penalties
Penalties are applied to electricity distribution companies that maintain underspent system
benefits charge balances that exceed prior year expenditures on energy efficiency programs. 315

7.13 Response to Stress Situations
Brazil has persistent concerns about adequate electricity generation capacity in the face of
drought conditions. The most recent stress situation was in 2001/2002 season. Brazil confronted
a shortage in capacity during a period in which its hydro capacity was adversely affected by the
drought conditions.
In many ways, the capacity shortfall that occurred paralleled the events that precipitated the
2000/2001 crisis in California, and the 2008/2009 crisis that occurred in South Africa. In each
case, there was a period of uncertainty associated with power sector reform initiatives that
resulted in periods of inadequate investment in new capacity. In the case of South Africa, there
was an actual moratorium placed on investment in new generation plant during a period in
which reserve margins declined. 316 Brazil experienced similar reform initiatives during the 1990s
that were intended to introduce elements of a competitive market. However, what followed
was a period in which investors had difficulty obtaining financing as the regulatory uncertainty
created weak incentives for additional investment. 317 This period led to increasing exposure to
the adverse hydrological conditions that occurred in 2001 and 2001.
The options available to government to respond were limited. Government managed the
shortfall through the implementation of a quota program on all residential, industrial and
commercial customers. A monthly ceiling was set at 80 percent of the previous year. Customers
were penalized for excess consumption. The result was that electricity consumption was
reduced by 20 percent and avoided the rolling blackouts that would otherwise have resulted. 318
The PROCEL investments in energy efficiency leading up to this period contributed to the
solutions. However, activities under the PEE energy efficiency program were only just beginning
to take effect.

7.14 Overall Effectiveness
Overall, the Brazilian planning process has been successful and reasonably transparent, although
it has fallen short of its “lowest cost” objectives by failing to adequately integrate end-use
energy efficiency resources into the process.
There have been some positive interactions between the PEE and PROCEL energy efficiency
programs that have taken effect over time. In 2002, ANEEL started explicitly requiring that all

appliances and equipment considered in utilities’ PEE energy efficiency programs comply with
the PROCEL energy performance labelling or efficiency standards set by PROCEL. 319

7.15 Lessons Learnt
The target of only 10 percent cumulative energy savings by 2030 is a modest ambition for utility
energy efficiency programs by international standards. In Brazil, there appears to be
considerable opportunities for energy efficiency investments in buildings and industry. The
opportunities for energy efficiency improvements appear to be considerable in commercial
buildings alone. 320 Brazil has no mandatory building codes and few equipment suppliers.
Buildings account for roughly half of electricity demand in Brazil. 321
Even with these modest ambitions, there is considerable room for doubt about whether the
energy efficiency targets can be achieved. For example, although Brazil established a legal
framework for the implementation of appliance efficiency standards, the implementation of
those standards has been slow, creating additional opportunities for energy efficiency programs
delivered by utilities. The non-mandatory features of the energy performance labeling program
create additional opportunities for stop-gap utility interventions. 322
There are also questions about utility energy efficiency programs that are aimed at replacement
of older inefficient appliances with new and efficient ones. The focus here is on lower income
households. Strengthening EM&V activities are needed to ensure that the replaced equipment is
indeed retired.
In 2012, ACEEE reviewed the energy efficiency performance of twelve of the largest economies
in the world. Despite the progress in residential buildings and appliance labelling, Brazil scored
in the bottom quarter of the countries listed, just below the US and China, but above Canada
and Russia. 323 Brazil is achieving only a small share of the energy efficiency potential from ESCOs
and is well behind China and the US in developing shared savings contracts for industry.

8.      LESSONS FOR THE MENA REGION FROM THE CASE STUDIES
The six case studies included in this report provide detailed examples of relevant policy and
regulatory mechanisms that may, with suitable modification, be capable of effective
implementation in the MENA region. The case studies were selected to demonstrate the wide
range of different approaches that have been adopted to enable utility delivery of end-use
energy efficiency.
California
Utility delivery of energy efficiency commenced in California more than 30 years ago and is now
the largest and oldest program of its kind in both the United States and the world. The long-
term California experience in utility delivery of energy efficiency represents close to the
maximum level of energy savings that can be achieved through this approach. The unique
feature in California is the comprehensive set of policy and regulatory mechanisms that has
been developed over many years through a unique collaborative process involving the two
regulatory agencies and the California legislature. This collaboration is the key to California’s
achievements and is the main lesson to be learnt by other jurisdictions seeking to emulate the
California results.
New South Wales, Australia
The New South Wales Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) and its predecessor together comprise the
longest-running energy efficiency certificate scheme in the world. The schemes’ combined
experience of more than 10 years has enabled progressive revision and refinement of scheme
parameters, including definitions of eligible energy efficiency measures, deemed energy savings
values, methodologies for calculating the numbers of certificates that can be created, and
scheme administrative procedures. These changes have established the ESS as an efficient and
cost-effective mechanism for delivering energy savings.
The ESS has successfully demonstrated two unique policy and regulatory mechanisms that assist
in the implementation of utility delivery of energy efficiency: trading of energy efficiency
certificates and the accreditation of third parties to achieve energy savings. Together these two
mechanisms have enabled the establish and development of an energy services industry in New
South Wales and have contributed to a major increase in the quantities of energy savings being
achieved in the state. Jurisdictions looking to establish a new energy services industry or expand
and existing one can learn a great deal from the experience of the NSW Energy Savings Scheme.
South Africa
In South Africa, impacts on system reliability have been a powerful motivator in delivering
capacity savings in the electricity system. In the years since the capacity crisis began, the major
electricity utility, Eskom, has far exceeded the load reduction and energy savings targets set by
the regulator, and in most years, exceeded its own expectations by a wide margin. After almost
a decade without material investment in new supply, Eskom embarked upon an aggressive plan
for price increases over time coupled with time-of-use pricing and inclining block rates that
complemented efforts to promote energy efficiency and DSM initiatives.
In implementing utility delivery of energy efficiency, South Africa initially pursued pathways that
included heavy reliance on third party providers of energy efficiency services. However, the
ESCO model proved challenging for delivery, and most of the material energy savings achieved
did not rely heavily on ESCOs. The achieved reductions in demand were mostly achieved
through the mass market residential program initiatives targeting lighting and industrial
programs delivered by Eskom.


                                                                                                 80
Lessons for the MENA Region from Case Studies of Utility Delivery of Energy Efficiency

China
China’s grid company energy efficiency obligation is one of the latest examples worldwide that
uses a government-imposed obligation to ensure that utilities assist their customers to use
electricity efficiently. The implementation of the EEO in China has been particularly difficult
because of the very large size of the grid companies, their ability to influence the political
process, and their complete lack of any experience in delivering energy efficiency. Despite the
reluctance by the grid companies to engage with end-use energy efficiency, in both 2012 and
2013, they achieved their EEO energy savings and demand reduction targets though, given the
size of China, these results were not particularly ambitious. Jurisdictions looking to use a
government-imposed EEO in situations where there is no prior experience with utility delivery of
energy efficiency may learn useful lessons from the China case study.
India
India provides an example of close involvement by the central and state governments in the
development of a policy and regulatory framework to enable utility delivery of end-use energy
efficiency. The Government of India has established a solid foundation of sector reform and a
framework for delivering DSM that has been decades in the making. The framework relies
increasingly on electric distribution utilities, but also on the national government in the form of
the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). Oversight of the electric utilities and the regulations that
give form to the DSM activities are established by the state electricity regulatory authorities.
However, the energy efficiency and DSM industry in India is still at an early stage. Most of the
projects developed and implemented by the distribution utilities are pilot projects that provide a
foundation of experience that reduces uncertainty in achieving energy savings through
successive stages of program delivery.
Brazil
In Brazil, there is extensive involvement in energy efficiency and DSM by both the federal
government and by the electricity industry regulator, ANEEL. The federal government has
funded extensive energy efficiency programs through the majority state-owned national
electricity utility, Eletrobras. The regulator has imposed a progressively more stringent energy
efficiency obligation on electricity distribution utilities that has, in effect, created a public
benefits charge. Brazil is one of only a few developing nations that have created such a charge.
However, the target of only 10 percent cumulative energy savings by 2030 is a modest ambition
for utility energy efficiency programs by international standards. In Brazil, there appears to be
considerable opportunities for energy efficiency investments in buildings and industry and it
should be possible for utility energy efficiency programs to achieve savings in excess of the
target.

9.      CONCLUSION
Energy utilities can play a key role in delivering end-use energy efficiency improvements.
Governments turn to energy utilities to deliver energy efficiency for several reasons. Utilities
have a strategic position in energy markets, often serving as an intermediary between energy
producers and energy consumers. They are well positioned to overcome the key barriers - lack
of awareness of the best energy efficiency measures, the “hassle factor” of procuring the
measures, and perceived risks in relation to performance and cost – that prevent consumers
from investing in energy efficiency.
The six case studies presented in this report were selected to share the experience of a wide
range of countries and regions located on five different continents, and a range of economies
reflecting a breadth somewhat similar to that found in the MENA region. The six countries and
regions either rely on, or are in the formative stages of developing, energy efficiency programs
that depend on utilities for funding and implementation. Countries and regions with the longest
history of experience in utility delivery of energy efficiency have a record of success that
typically continues to grow. Properly relied upon, utility energy efficiency programs can fit into a
deeper framework of investments in new technologies that includes supporting initiatives, such
as codes, standards, and energy performance labeling, to eventually achieve market
transformation in which energy efficiency becomes the norm.
