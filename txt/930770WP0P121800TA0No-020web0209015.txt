This study aimed to understand whether and how information and communica-
tion technology (ICT) could be used to support agro-enterprises run and managed
by women in Kenya and Zambia. The research was conducted in close conjunction
with two World Bank-supported agricultural projects, the Irrigation Development and
Support Project (IDSP), implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
(MAL) in Zambia, and the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project
(KAPAP), implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A new generation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is ﬁnding
a small foothold among poor, small-scale farmers in developing countries. Even so,
many barriers still prevent poor rural people from accessing, using, and beneﬁting
from new ICT tools and platforms, and those barriers are arguably higher for rural
women. The relationship between gender and agriculture has been studied intensively
over the years, and many agricultural interventions now include gender as a cross-
cutting issue or “mainstream” gender throughout their operations. Studies of the rela-
tionship between gender and the use of ICTs in agriculture have started to appear only
quite recently, however.

The Africa Region of the World Bank views ICTs as potentially transformative tech-
nology for rural development and seeks to incorporate the use of ICTs throughout
its portfolio of projects. The present study was designed to examine the feasibility
of integrating ICTs into two large investment programs: the Irrigation Development
and Support Project (IDSP) in Zambia and the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and
Agribusiness Project (KAPAP). The speciﬁc goal was to examine how ICT-based inter-
ventions might be designed to strengthen women’s participation in commodity value
chains under the two projects.

IDSP, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock in Zambia, was
oﬃcially launched in November 2012. During the ﬁeld research for this study, IDSP
was conducting its own feasibility studies, discussing the land consolidation and reset-
tlement process for developing the irrigation schemes, establishing public-private
partnerships related to the schemes, and creating Participatory Site Committees. In
contrast, KAPAP, coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries,
was in its second phase (2010–14) of operation, scheduled to end in December 2014.
IDSP operates at three sites: Mwomboshi (Chibombo District, Central Province);
Lusitu (Chirundu District, Lusaka Province); and Musakashi (Mufulira District, Cop-
perbelt Province). KAPAP operates in 20 counties, where it supports 4,216 Common
Interest Groups (CIGs) in 36 commodity value chains, with the goal of aggregating
those groups into larger farmer cooperatives or societies. This study focuses on three
of those counties: Makueni, Kwale, and Gucha/Kisii.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION

BACKGROUND
Access to information has always been a key necessity for men and women farmers,
regardless of whether they are involved in subsistence farming or large-scale agri-
cultural enterprises. The traditional tools for receiving information on agricultural
production, markets, and research results—demonstrations, farmer ﬁeld days, pam-
phlets, hand-outs, radio, and television—have been joined by a new, constantly shifting
array of information and communication technologies (ICTs) created by the booming
mobile, wireless, and internet industries. These digital tools, particularly mobile (smart)
phones, tablets, and computers, make information more accessible, but the tools them-
selves are not accessible to all. In agriculture, a digital divide persists between small-
scale farmers in the developing world and their counterparts in the developed world;
a similar divide remains between men and women farmers in developing countries.
Although ICTs have found a foothold even on the farms of poor smallholders, many
challenges limit their use, and much of their potential is unrealized—especially among
poor rural women, for reasons that will become clear in this report.

Numerous studies have identiﬁed and documented how access to and control of agri-
cultural productive assets, including access to information and social capital, can vary
in relation to gender. To address men’s and women’s uneven access to assets, most
rural development projects use “gender mainstreaming” or support “gender as a cross-
cutting theme.” Yet studies of the relationships between gender and the use of ICTs
in agriculture, and strategies for addressing such issues within projects, have started to
appear only fairly recently. The ICT in Agriculture E-Sourcebook: Connecting Smallholders to
Knowledge, Networks and Institutions (World Bank 2011) describes key challenges and ena-
blers that practitioners should consider when seeking to use ICT in agriculture, with a
speciﬁc focus on the gender implications (box 1.1).1

GENDER IN AGRICULTURE
IN ZAMBIA AND KENYA
Zambian and Kenyan women—like their counterparts elsewhere in Africa and the
world—contribute signiﬁcantly to the economy, especially through agriculture and the
informal business sector. Zambia’s estimated population of 14.5 million people is largely
rural (61 percent live in rural areas), fairly young, and evenly divided along gender lines
(49 percent male and 51 percent female).2 Because men migrate in signiﬁcant num-
bers to urban areas in search of work and better pay, women constitute an estimated
65 percent of the rural population. Women also provide the bulk of labor in informal
agriculture. A recent study ﬁnds that women provide up to 85 percent of the labor
for small-scale agricultural production and almost all labor for post-harvest activities
(Farnworth, Akamandisa, and Hichaambwa 2011).

Kenya, with an estimated population of 45 million (FAO 2011), has made an eﬀort
to produce gender-disaggregated data; recent statistics show that women make up 75
percent of the labor force in small-scale agriculture and own up to 40 percent of all
small-scale farms in Kenya (World Bank 2007). Women have an especially strong role
in producing tea, coﬀee, various fruits and vegetables, cereals, and poultry.

As in most developing countries, in Zambia and Kenya it is women who produce most
of the food and dominate the ranks of the poor (FAO 2011). Despite recent eﬀorts to
document women’s critical role in agriculture, their participation is not often fully rec-

operate medium- to large-scale irrigation schemes on a sustainable commercial basis
through partnership agreements between the government, communities, and private
sector. The second component delivers public irrigation infrastructure, and the third
supports private and cooperative investment in productive equipment and assets in
and around irrigation schemes, including investment to stimulate the establishment of
small enterprises. The fourth component is dedicated to managing and coordinating
the IDSP.

The project seeks to ensure that these investments have positive impacts for women
and men. It is expected to directly beneﬁt approximately 70,000 individuals, consisting
of households with direct access to irrigated land, households with members employed
on irrigated land, and households that will not be involved in farming but will estab-
lish micro-enterprises. The indirect beneﬁciaries of IDSP include supply and value
chain stakeholders, who are expected to beneﬁt from increased supplies of agricultural
commodities and better business opportunities generated by the irrigation schemes
and supporting infrastructure. Consumers, particularly in urban areas, are also indi-
rect beneﬁciaries; they are expected to beneﬁt from improved supplies of agricultural

INVENTORY OF ICT TOOLS IN AGRICULTURE
IN KENYA AND ZAMBIA

EXPANDING ICT INFRASTRUCTURE
AND INITIATIVES
Investments in ICT infrastructure in the last 10 years in Zambia and Kenya dramati-
cally increased the availability and use of ICTs, especially mobile phones. Both coun-
tries now have nationwide mobile phone networks. For example, by 2012, 86 percent
of Kenya’s population had mobile coverage, while only 35 had access via land lines;
ﬁgures for Zambia are similar. The subscriber base in both countries is above 65 per-
cent and growing fast.17

Expanding mobile phone networks, the growing number of mobile phone users, and
wider access to the internet have lent impetus to new services provided through ICTs.
In Kenya especially, ICT initiatives are booming. The M-PESA mobile banking plat-
form is transforming access to banking and banking transactions to such an extent that
other countries are seeking to replicate the business model.18 The success of Kenya’s
ICT sector has led companies such as IBM to set up dedicated software development
and research centers for the African market.



MOBILE TELEPHONY
Mobile phones are changing the ways that Kenyans and Zambians communicate, do
business, handle payments and banking transactions, and even travel. The impact on
peoples’ daily lives is felt among the rural as well as the urban population. Mobile
phones obviate the need for costly travel to relate information; money can be trans-
ferred at little cost; banking services are available in remote areas for the ﬁrst time. In
agriculture, new ICT products (especially in Kenya) are providing extension services,

CHAPTER FIVE
PILOT DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
IN ZAMBIA

OVERVIEW
The concept for the pilot was based on an understanding of the context and the fea-
tures required in an easily scalable ICT solution that meets the range of information
and networking needs involved in linking stakeholders—particularly women farm-
ers and entrepreneurs—to vegetable value chains. Farmers in the three sites mainly
require information on irrigated crop production and marketing, but the inventory
found no readily available ICT initiatives or tools capable of providing such informa-
tion. Two platforms could potentially be adapted for IDSP farmers, however. Lima
Links operates with vegetable farmers in two of the three pilot sites, Musakashi and
Mwomboshi, and ZNFU 4455 provides market and price information nationwide for
16 commodities—although not vegetables—and is mainly used by farmers on a sea-
sonal basis when they sell their crops.



PILOT CONCEPT
Demand for extension information is high, especially among women, whose access
to information has always been limited. As IDSP introduces new irrigation schemes,
farmers will require more information on irrigated agriculture and opportunities for
related agro-enterprises in the project sites. For that reason, the concept for the pilot is
to facilitate the creation of a network of information exchange among stakeholders, in which groups
of women farmers and entrepreneurs are the central source of demand for the information being shared.
The network will be developed by linking female farmers with one or more providers
of extension information for selected irrigated agriculture value chains of interest to
women. In this case, information from the IDSP indicates that the vegetable value
chain involves numerous female farmers and has the most potential for growth, so the
pilot will focus on that value chain.

CHAPTER SIX
PILOT DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
IN KENYA

OVERVIEW
As in Zambia, the pilot will introduce ICT tools and platforms to women (and youth)
in the KAPAP sites to understand whether their use can enhance women’s agro-
enterprises. Although no suitable tools and platforms are already in use, the needs of
the target communities are better articulated, and the organization and business models
of their farmer groups are more advanced, than those of their counterparts in Zambia.
The concept for the pilot was developed based on an understanding of the needs and
capacities of the target communities and the features they require in an easily scalable
ICT solution, as indicated by the ICT inventory, research with the farmers’ groups,
interviews with the KAPAP teams working at the project sites, and the potential for the
pilot to link with KAPAP’s objectives for the development of the poultry industry.

PILOT CONCEPT
The feasibility study revealed that a tool enhancing the organization and business
model of groups in the poultry value chain would best respond to the needs and capac-
ities within the target communities. Information from KAPAP indicates that poultry
value chains are popular in the KAPAP areas, have high participation of female farm-
ers, and have a short turnover time. In addition, the poultry groups operate on solid
basis with proﬁtable business models. For that reason, the concept for the pilot is to use
ICT tools for supporting individual poultry farmers and their organizations to develop and implement
eﬃcient systems and processes for managing their organizations, production, sales, ﬁnance, and com-
munication.24


COMPONENTS OF THE PILOT
The pilot has three main components: deploying an ICT tool to support farmer orga-
nizations in running organizational and ﬁnancial management systems; deploying an

CONCLUSIONS
Information is vital for improving agricultural productivity and generating better
incomes, yet women often ﬁnd it challenging to obtain such information. Although
is it commonly acknowledged that the extensive use of ICTs in agriculture has
improved the dissemination of information and communication in developing
countries, not everyone has access to ICTs and their beneﬁts. For reasons discussed
previously, including illiteracy, poverty, and unequal decision-making power in the
household, women in the agricultural sector (farmers and entrepreneurs) are often
at a particular disadvantage when it comes to accessing and learning to use these
powerful technologies.

The literature review undertaken for this feasibility study, along with the many ﬁeld
visits and consultations with government oﬃcials, development partners, private sec-
tor, and NGOs, have all provided helpful information for identifying and understand-
ing the main challenges involved in designing and implementing projects using ICTs
for rural women’s economic empowerment. In brief, no ICT tools have been devel-
oped exclusively for women farmers in either Zambia or Kenya, and no data are avail-
able on the impact of existing ICT tools used by rural women. Few commercial ICT
products target small-scale farming. Kenya has a larger number of ICT tools available
for small-scale farmers compared to Zambia, where the number is extremely low, but
most of these tools have been funded by donors, and their viability is uncertain when
donor support comes to an end. At the same time, women farmers and entrepreneurs
in Zambia and Kenya emphatically indicate that they need reliable, timely access to
technical and market information. They fully recognize the advantages of joining and
interacting with other stakeholders in the value chain, because participation will ena-
ble them to obtain knowledge of current requirements on quality and product safety,
gain bargaining power with buyers, and build a relationship with the private sector as
a reliable supplier.

Concepts for two pilots of ICTs among women farmers in Zambia and Kenya were
proposed. In Zambia, where very little entrepreneurship is seen among rural women
at present, but where the development of irrigation under IDSP oﬀers consider-

LESSONS LEARNED

DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS
This study developed two concepts for pilot efforts to learn whether ICT tools can
enable women farmers and entrepreneurs to move from producing almost entirely
for subsistence to producing for a wider commercial market. The research and
the iterative process of designing the pilots confirm that there is no single blue-
print for designing a pilot to achieve this goal. Context matters. The concepts for
the pilots differ in significant ways because of contextual differences in Zambia
and Kenya, especially differences in the availability of tested and successful ICT
tools, in the target populations in the project areas (women in particular, but not
excluding men), and in the needs of women (and men) in relation to specific value
chains.

Diﬀerent categories of female (and male) farmers will diﬀer in their access to and use
of ICT tools, owing to a range of factors. These diﬀerences matter. Two speciﬁc myths
that reduce the potential for ICT applications and other interventions to contribute to
gender-equitable agricultural development are worth emphasizing here.25 First, small-
holder farmers are often considered an undiﬀerentiated group of beneﬁciaries, with
the same needs and same opportunities—but they are not. Second, men and women
are assumed to have the same ability to access, use, and control ICTs—in other words,
ICTs are assumed to be gender neutral—but they are not.

The remainder of this chapter summarizes the speciﬁc lessons learned in developing
the pilots. For additional guidance in overcoming the challenges related to gender and
ICTs in agriculture, see the ICT in Agriculture e-Sourcebook (World Bank 2011a).

APPENDIX B
CRITERIA FOR SITE AND VALUE
CHAIN SELECTION, KENYA

SELECTION OF VALUE CHAIN
AND PROJECT SITES
IDENTIFY 2–3 BROAD-BASED VALUE CHAIN CATEGORIES
The existing value chains were categorized into broad agriculture produce sectors
based on a list provided by KAPAP: fruit trees (mango, pawpaw, passion fruit, and
so on); livestock (dairy milk, livestock meat—cattle, poultry); horticulture (tomatoes,
onion bulbs, and so on); legumes; cereals (maize, wheat, and so on); and commercial
crops (such as aloe vera).


LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF GROUPS AND MEMBERS
IN THE VALUE CHAINS
Higher number of groups and higher number of members will be an advantage when
scaling up the intervention, and if a pilot is scaled up, it will be more attractive for
service providers to serve a larger client base. As an example, the value chains with
over 100 farmer groups and over 5,000 members are: tree fruits (mango, bananas);
potatoes; local poultry; and dairy cows.

However, other criteria (listed below) are also important in the pilot phase:
   » The pilot has to test the hypotheses that the use of ICT tools will help women
     develop their businesses and advance along the value chain.
   » An important part of the pilot is to track capacity development and constantly
     monitor what happens: Is there uptake of the tool/platform? Does its use have
     beneﬁts? Do these beneﬁts translate into better businesses, better livelihoods, or
     some other advantage?
   » The bigger the numbers for the pilot, the more diﬃcult it is to train and build
     capacity, and the more diﬃcult it is to monitor (and evaluate) the results.

ZAMBIA WORKSHOP DISCUSSION
AND RESULTS

Workshop participants divided into three groups, which held discussions on three
topics: design and implementation, implementation and projects, and ﬁnancial sus-
tainability. Results of the discussions, conclusions, and recommendations are listed in
tables C.1, C.2, and C.3. During the discussion, participants were asked to keep two
basic questions in mind, as well as the overall context (ﬁgure C.1) as a guiding prin-
ciple. The two questions were: Can ICT tools be used to empower women or enhance
the economic empowerment of women in agriculture? How can they be used, how
should they be developed, and what approach should or could be taken?

 recommendations                                  • Identify needs of farmer groups.
                                                  • Deﬁne target group and subgroups.
                                                  • Do a value chain analysis and/or describe use case scenarios.
                                                  • Develop concept design.
                                                  • Consult the target group on the concept design(s).
                                                  • Select the platform tool; do an extensive (literature) review of existing tools/platforms
                                                    before developing a new platform or selecting/adapting an existing tool/platform.
                                                  • Develop ﬁnancial plan for the development, promotion, and running of the platform.
                                                  • Develop a plan that ensures the continuity and sustainability of the tool/platform.
                                                  • Organization should be able to sustain the platform in the long run by incorporating
                                                    other organizations, users, and so on.

 » Consider these issues during the discussion • Target group men/women.
                                               • Needs and problems of women, men.
                                               • Timing of the activities.
                                               • Duration of the activities.
                                               • Value chain(s) in agriculture or part of value chains.

                                               • Implementation and management of the ICT tools.
                                               • Use and administration/running of the platform.
                                               • Sustainability.
 Conclusions and                               • An ICT project for the enhancement of women should be fully integrated in the design
    recommendations                              of the project.
                                               • Setting up an ICT tool takes time and should therefore be customized (integrated).
                                               • All key stakeholders should participate fully in the planning, design, and implementation.
                                               • It would be important to target households (not just women;, sensitize men).
 Key questions                                 1. Does the IDSP see a need for the design and use of ICT tools in the project (with a
                                                  gender perspective)? If yes, why and for what? If not, why not?
                                               2. Can the ICT tool designed for the pilot be implemented in the IDSP program, and if so,
                                                  how? If not, why not?
 » Consider these issues during the discussion • Who should be the users of the platform (one site, all sites, women’s groups, youth, and
                                                 so on)?
                                               • Value chain(s) in agriculture or part of value chains.
                                               • At what stage of the IDSP program should it be implemented?
                                               • Who should be running it? IDSP, MAL, external organization, others?
                                               • Current pilot design developed while no irrigation system was in place; need for re-design?
                                               • Sustainability.
 Conclusions and                               1. IDSP should explore further the options for linking up with existing platforms such as
    recommendations                               the iDE (vegetables) and ZNFU.
                                               2. The concept for the pilot has not been tested, so it is diﬃcult to say if it could/should be
                                                  implemented.
                                                  • The tablet as a tool is challenging in terms of sustainability (costs, maintenance).
                                                  • Consider purchasing solar panel with it (was already part of the concept).
                                                  • It would be better for farmers to use a smartphone instead of a tablet, as it would be
                                                    cheaper to use and is portable.
 Points discussed:
 • ICT intervention, just as any other component, should be embedded in the design of a project to guarantee that the costs
   (development and running), human resources, and knowledge needed are considered and included.
 • If an ICT project would be appended, that project should come with the full resources to design and implement it. It cannot be
   expected that staﬀ from the original project will take on extra tasks to implement and run it. They will be overloaded and might
   not have the required skills and knowledge.
 • Training is needed at all levels to be incorporated in the design.
 • It is good to introduce concepts right from the start, prepare for implementation (even if it will not be implemented right from
   the start), but developing tools or linking up takes a lot of time and ﬁnance; training (also literacy) can be provided before.
 • Look at dynamics at the household level, identify needs and gaps for women, but don’t exclude the men. Men will eventually
   accept women’s participation and pull out. Men should be sensitized and have to get on board. Involve youth as well.
 • IDSP has gender as cross-cutting issue, not activities only women. However, it is possible that the majority of participants could
   be women.

                                                 • But ICT can be used to provide information on nutrition, crop diversiﬁcation, value

           RECOMMENDATIONS (Continued )
                                          Group III: Financing and Sustainability
 Points discussed:
 Why is women’s ownership of or access to assets important?
 • In order to improve livelihood—for example, by getting ﬁnance/loan—assets become very important.
 • Access is unequal to that of men.
 • Inequitable access should be redressed by special intervention.
 • Can we change access or provide another opportunity for women?
 • Reach a woman, reach a whole family. For instance, according to the World Bank’s Gender in Agriculture sourcebook, if women
    farmers in Zambia had the same access to capital as men, agricultural productivity would increase by 15 percent.
 • IDSP concentrating on land issue:
    – Women have access but are not decision makers on use and produce of land.
    – There is a causal relationship with women’s rights to productive assets and provision of information.
    – Information is essential.
    – So under IDSP each wife in marriage (including polygamous marriages) should be allocated an irrigation plot in her own
        name and receive relevant information on how to make the land productive, on marketing, and so on.
 Involvement in subsistence farming
 • What information should be provided?
    – Nutrition.
    – Crop diversiﬁcation and diversiﬁcation of diet.
    – Access to water.
    – Weather information.
    – Extension model—selection of crops, production, and so on.
    – Information on sustainability.
    – Diﬀerent categories of subsistence farmers, information will depend on which category—for example, those moving from
        subsistence to emergent/commercial farming will want more information on:
        0 Marketing and productivity rather than nutrition and diet alone.
        0 Increasing yields.
        0 Eﬃcient use of available resources.
 It is important to provide opportunities for farmers to advance along the value chain. ICT is important, but diﬀerent information
     will be required depending on the category of the subsistence farmer.
 Volume/size of target groups
 • Discussion/focus groups of 25–30
 • If more people accept the messages, groups will grow and can be split/segmented further.
 • The ICT platform can be segmented to smaller groups according to what information is provided.
 • The target group size has to be chosen carefully—it can’t be too small because it won’t be sustainable, and it can’t be too large
    because the information will be diluted.
 Cost-beneﬁt analysis (CBA)
 • CBA is worthwhile, but how can it be done when there is no business model?
 • It is possible to do a monitoring exercise at the end of the pilot.
 • Existing platforms (for example, ZNFU) already doing CBA:
   – Costs are very high for the service provider, pay ZICTA, mobile network provider, and so on.
   – Great beneﬁts for target group, aﬀordable and worthwhile for end user.
 • There has to be a very large market (target group) for service provider to make any proﬁt.
 • There is disequilibria in costs between service provider and end user.
 • What can be done to reduce costs?
   – ZICTA, government policy formulation.
 There is no real business model; if there was, the business community would already be involved in a major way.

Is ICT like a start up?
• ICT intervention cannot happen alone.
  – Needs complementary infrastructure to work: good transport network; delivery services; markets; marketing services; agents;
    wholesalers.
Agents: Are they good or bad for women entrepreneurs?
• Help in dealing with buyer intimidation.
• Help with storage for goods.
• Help with transportation of goods.
• Women may have to travel long distances with heavy loads to get to markets; agents can help with this.
• Facilitate bulk buying.
• Most agents work on commission, so they will get highest price possible to maximize commission and income/proﬁt for clients.
• However, some “agents” take advantage of women; they buy cheaply from them and sell at much higher prices, causing losses to
  producers.

APPENDIX D
ZAMBIA PILOT CONCEPT PROPOSAL
An inventory of the use of ICTs in Zambia focused on the availability of ICT tools
that can or have the potential to be used by small-scale agricultural enterprises. The
inventory revealed that although uptake of ICTs has been very strong, especially
uptake of mobile phones, the number of tools available for the agricultural sector is
very limited. The main ﬁndings are:
     » None of the inventoried ICT tools were developed speciﬁcally for women, and
       none addressed women’s speciﬁc needs.
     » Very few tools (developed, implemented, and piloted) targeted small-scale farm-
       ers in Zambia.
     » A number of competing mobile banking platforms operate in Zambia but none
       has taken oﬀ on a large scale.
     » ZNFU’s market information service has been running for six years and delivers
       relevant market information using SMS text messaging, but its use is limited to
       nonperishable crops/products.
     » NAIS and the meteorological department deliver information using various tra-
       ditional methods of communication of which radio has the largest audience.
     » Two services in development have the potential to be used by small-scale farmers
       and traders. Their design seems promising for the cost-eﬀective delivery of rele-
       vant information to farmers. However these two services are still in development:
        – ZNFU E-extension services, providing general extension information.
        – Lima Links, a market information service for vegetable growers.
     » The I-school project is an interactive learning platform of high quality, which
       exposes youths to the world of ICT but has no direct relevance for improving
       women businesses.

WOMEN’S ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
AT THE PROJECT SITES
To develop ICT tools capable of enhancing women’s agro-enterprises in Lusitu,
Mwomboshi, and Musakashi, the team ﬁrst needed to collect information on the
women in these areas: how they are organized, what their economic activities are,

APPENDIX E
KENYA PILOT CONCEPT PROPOSAL
This workplan is a detailed guide for KAPAP to implement the poultry ICT tool that
TechnoServe developed for its poultry farmer groups. The workplan brieﬂy describes
the poultry ICT tool and a detailed plan for implementing the tool; presents a detailed
budget for implementing the tool, training the groups, and providing support for the
groups; and develops a timetable for implementing the tool.

THE ICT TOOL
The poultry business ICT tool is a software package that enables groups engaged in
commercial poultry production to collect business data, create reports, and do the
accounting to manage their business activities. The poultry software has the following
functionality:
    » Electronically captures data on the farmers in the group and presents it at vari-
       ous levels (an individual farmer as a group member, a shareholder, and a sup-
       plier, for example).
    » Electronically captures sales of chickens by registered farmers.
    » Tracks product rejects.
    » Electronically generates supplier receipts for each farmer.
    » Electronically captures the purchase of chickens by registered buyers/traders.
    » Electronically provides ﬁnancial account statements for registered suppliers.
    » Assigns a credit facility to registered suppliers.
    » Generates the supplier payroll and transfers/credits the various payment
       accounts registered by the farmer.
    » Generates various account reports for all business transactions of the poultry
       producer groups.
    » Provides an aﬀordable information messaging platform through an SMS mod-
       ule between the farmers and all stakeholders around the poultry producer
       groups.
    » Consolidates data from all poultry producer groups to give a complete overview
       of all purchases of chickens from farmers and poultry producer groups at any
       time.

DISCUSSION OF THE ENABLERS/
STRATEGIES

  ENABLER 1: CONDUCT A GENDER ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTU-
  NITIES FOR ICTs TO ENHANCE CURRENT PRACTICES

  • To capture what information and services men and women need and how they are cur-
    rently meeting those needs.
  • To assess what ICTs are already in use and the type of access men and women have to
    them.



The initial reviews and surveys for the project found that very little gender-disaggregated
data is available; the majority of background documents for IDSP provide general
information on the socio-economic and cultural situation in the project sites, without
presenting speciﬁc data on women and men, let alone on youth (boys and girls). A
study/training program ﬁnanced by the World Bank Trust Fund for Environmental
and Social Development on gender and social mainstreaming in the IDSP (NIRAS
2011) provided very useful information on gender and social issues but was not a
baseline with gender-disaggregated data. KAPAP collects information through its
monitoring program, which includes gender-disaggregated data, such as data on the
performance of various value chains (mixed interest groups) with a high percentage
of women participants. However, in Kenya as in Zambia, for the purpose of the ICT-
WE project more speciﬁc gender-disaggregated baseline information was needed, in
particular related to the following;
    » What are women (including youth/girls) in the diﬀerent sites involved in, on-
       farm and oﬀ-farm? Do they have any income-generating activities (on- and oﬀ-
       farm)?
    » Marketing activities or any other businesses, bottlenecks, challenges, needs.
    » Future plans and possibilities.
    » Information and communication needs (on what, when, how, from whom).
