Executive	Summary	
	
In	 low	 and	 middle-income	 countries,	 there	 are	 various	 interventions	 that	 can	 be	 used	 to	 improve	
health	 system	 functionality	 and	 priority	 health	 outcomes.	 Results	 Based	 Financing	 (RBF)	 is	 one	
approach	 increasingly	 utilized	 in	 various	 countries	 across	 different	 settings	 and	 levels	 to	 facilitate	
these	improvements.		
	
This	report	reviews	a	comprehensive	impact	evaluation	of	a	RBF	pilot	project	in	Zambia.	 The	main	
objective	of	the	paper	is	to	present	and	analyse	the	IE	results.	While	this	report	touches	on	some	of	
the	broader	policy	implications	of	this	work,	a	separate	brief	has	been	developed	detailing	the	policy	
implications	to	inform	strategy	and	operations	in	Zambia	and	other	countries.		And	while	there	have	
been	a	number	of	impact	evaluations	studies	over	the	past	few	years	measuring	the	effectiveness	of	
RBF	programs,	the	Zambia	study	is	one	of	the	few	with	a	three-arm	evaluation	that	tests	RBF	against	
an	 enhanced	 financing	 arm	 and	 a	 pure	 control.	 As	 such,	 this	 study	 provides	 some	 new	 and	
interesting	insights	on	what	can	be	effective	in	improving	health	systems	and	health	outcomes.			
	
Background	and	Programme	Design	

In	an	attempt	to	strengthen	the	health	system	and	improve	health-service	delivery,	Zambia	has	been	
gradually	introducing	RBF	approaches	to	complement	traditional	input	based	financing	in	some	of	its	
health	 programs	 and	 activities.	 Zambia	 was	 awarded	 a	 US$17	 million	 grant	 in	 2008	 by	 the	 World	
Bank	through	the	Health	Results	Innovation	Trust	Fund	(HRITF)	to	implement	a	RBF	pilot	project	with	
an	accompanying	Impact	Evaluation	(IE)	led	by	the	World	Bank.	Motivated	by	inadequate	progress	to	
achieving	MDGs	4	and	5	targets,	the	primary	objective	of	the	project	was	to	catalyse	the	country’s	
efforts	 to	 reduce	 under-five	 and	 maternal	 mortality	 in	 11	 districts	 in	 nine	 (9)	 of	 Zambia’s	 10	
provinces	(except	Lusaka)	countrywide.		
	
The	 Zambia	 health	 RBF	 (HRBF)	 pilot	 project	 was	 implemented	 by	 the	 Government	 through	 the	
Zambian	 health	 system	 (contracted-in)	 and	 is	 one	 of	 the	 few	 examples	 of	 a	 Lower	 Middle	 Income	
Country	(LMIC)	with	this	type	of	model.	After	a	pre-pilot	phase,	which	lasted	approximately	2	years	
in	 the	 Eastern	 Province	 district	 of	 Katete,	 the	 RBF	 model	 was	 expanded	 to	 ten	 (10)	 additional	
districts	in	April	2012.	By	the	end	of	the	project,	203	health	centres	were	covered	across	the	country.	
This	 represented	 a	 total	 catchment	 population	 of	 about	 1.5	 million	 people	 of	 which	 the	 direct	
beneficiaries	 were	 338,248	 children	 aged	 between	 0-59	 months,	 and	 372,073	 women	 of	 child-
bearing	age.		
	
The	accompanying	IE	comprised	both	quantitative	and	qualitative	approaches.	Quantitative	data	for	
the	 IE	 at	 household	 and	 facility	 level	 was	 collected	 at	 baseline,	 implementation	 stage,	 and	 endline	
from	 10	 RBF	 intervention	 districts;	 10	 Control	 1	 (C1)	 districts;	 and	 10	 Control	 2	 (C2)	 districts.	 The	
method	 of	 selecting	 districts	 for	 the	 IE	 was	 based	 on	 district-matched	 randomization.	 Inputs	 were	
assigned	to	the	three	district	groups	as	follows:	(a)	The	RBF	Intervention	group	to	receive	Emergency	
Obstetric	 and	 Neonatal	 Care	 (EmONC)	 equipment	 and	 RBF	 performance-based	 grants;	 (b)	 The	 C1	
group	 (“enhanced	 financing”	 arm)	 to	 receive	 EmONC	 equipment	 exactly	 as	 in	 the	 RBF	 and	 the	
equivalent	in	money	of	the	average	RBF	performance-related	grants	as	input	financing;	and	(c)	The	


                                                         3	
         	
C2	(“pure	control”	arm)	group	to	receive	nothing.	The	IE	was	designed	to	evaluate	the	impact	of	the	
pilot	to	inform	three	main	policy	questions:		
	
      1) What	 is	 the	 causal	 effect	 of	 the	 Zambian	 HRBF	 on	 the	 population	 health	 indicators	 of	
           interest?	
      2) Do	 higher	 incentive	 payments	 in	 remote	 areas	 result	 in	 increased	 health	 outcomes	 and	
           greater	retention	of	staff?	
      3) How	 does	 the	 likelihood	 of	 audit/external	 verification	 of	 results	 affect	 the	 accuracy	 of	
           reported	data?	
	
The	IE	investigated	the	impact	of	the	RBF	over	a	broad	range	of	targeted	and	non-targeted	indicators	
related	to	maternal	and	child	health	services.	Baseline	household	data	was	collected	over	the	period	
November	 to	 December	 2011.	 Endline	 data	 was	 collected	 between	 November	 2014	 and	 January	
2015,	using	the	same	survey	tools	and	in	the	same	study	areas	and	was	undertaken	in	18	IE	districts	
(all	 of	 the	 study	 districts	 in	 six	 of	 the	 matched	 district	 triplets	 yielding	 information	 from	 6	 RBF	
districts,	6	C1	districts,	and	6	C2	districts).	For	the	health	facility	survey,	baseline	data	was	collected	
between	 October	 and	 November,	 2011	 and	 endline	 data	 was	 collected	 between	 November	 2014	
and	January	2015.	At	baseline,	176	health	facilities	were	surveyed	whereas	210	health	facilities	were	
surveyed	at	endline.		
	
The	household	and	health	facility	surveys	provide	information	on	the	first	two	research	questions.	A	
special	study	known	as	“counter	external	verification”	was	carried	out	to	explore	the	third	research	
question.	 In	 addition,	 the	 IE	 was	 complemented	 by	 a	 Process	 Evaluation	 aimed	 at	 generating	
valuable	information	on	a	continuous	basis	during	the	implementation	period.	Furthermore,	a	cost-
effectiveness	analysis	was	conducted	to	gather	information	on	the	relative	costs	and	effectiveness	of	
the	RBF	programme	from	a	health	system	perspective.		
	
Summary	of	the	Results	

Of	 the	 nine	 indicators	 directly	 targeted	 by	 the	 RBF	 programme	 through	 the	 incentive	 structure,	
seven	were	directly	measured	or	proxied	in	the	population1.	Some	of	the	measures	responded	to	the	
RBF	 programme,	 with	 a	 broadly	 similar	 set	 also	 showing	 improvements	 under	 the	 enhanced	
financing	arm	(C1).	Institutional	deliveries	in	RBF	districts	increased	by	approximately	13	percentage	
points	 relative	 to	 the	 pure	 control	 districts	 (C2).	 However,	 the	 same	 indicator	 rose	 by	 about	 18	
percentage	points	in	C1	districts	relative	to	C2.	Results	for	deliveries	by	skilled	providers	also	show	
improvements	in	both	the	RBF	and	C1	districts	relative	to	C2,	but	the	C1	arm	had	greater	magnitude	
for	this	indicator.	One	of	the	most	important	gains	in	the	RBF	arm	was	the	timing	of	the	first	ANC	
visit	 which	 was	 earlier	 by	 two	 weeks	 as	 compared	 to	 both	 controls.	 This	 is	 an	 important	 gain	 in	
maternal	care	that	is	seldom	observed	in	a	broad-based	primary	care	intervention	such	as	RBF.	On	
the	other	hand,	the	rate	of	change	for	any	PNC	was	more	rapid	in	C1	districts	as	compared	to	RBF	
districts.	 For	 immunization,	 full	 vaccination	 coverage	 declined	 in	 both	 C1	 and	 C2	 districts	 but	
remained	constant	or	slightly	higher	in	RBF	districts,	suggesting	that	the	RBF	programme	could	have	


																																																													
1
 One	of	the	remaining	indicators	involved	special	sub-population	of	HIV	positive	pregnant	women	whose	coverage	was	not	
tracked	by	the	data	collection.	The	other	remaining	indicator	applies	to	all	women	of	reproductive	age	and	not	just	those	

                                                                4	
              	
been	 protective	 with	 respect	 to	 some	 measures	 of	 immunization	 coverage.	 However,	 the	 relative	
protective	effects	are	not	precisely	estimated.	
	
For	 structural	 quality,	 the	 quality	 of	 delivery	 rooms	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 were	 better	 than	 the	 delivery	
rooms	 in	 C1	 and	 C2	 districts.	 On	 process	 quality,	 the	 results	 were	 varied.	 For	 example,	 women	
residing	in	RBF	districts	were	significantly	more	likely	to	list	several	out	of	the	12	danger	signs	during	
pregnancy	as	compared	to	those	residing	in	C1	districts	who	were	not	able	to	list	any.	However,	C1	
districts	 witnessed	 better	 improvements	 in	 blood	 tests	 and	 any	 iron	 taken	 during	 ANC	 as	 well	 as	
higher	immediate	initiation	of	breastfeeding	and	receipt	of	Vitamin	A	after	delivery	as	compared	to	
both	RBF	and	C2.	On	perceived	quality,	health	workers	in	RBF	facilities	spent	significantly	more	time	
during	consultations	with	their	patients	as	compared	to	both	C1	and	C2	health	facilities.		
	
On	 health	 systems,	 results	 suggest	 that	 RBF	 districts	 performed	 better	 than	 C1	 districts	 in	 most	 of	
the	 indicators	 specifically	 availability	 of	 equipment,	 structural	 quality,	 managerial	 autonomy,	
accuracy	 in	 reporting,	 satisfaction	 and	 retention	 of	 health	 workers,	 and	 level	 and	 predictability	 of	
funding.	 A	 key	 salient	 point	 from	 the	 design	 perspective	 is	 that	 disbursement	 of	 funds	 directly	 to	
health	 facilities	 in	 RBF	 districts	 facilitated	 fiscal	 decentralization	 but	 the	 proportion	 of	 RBF	 funds	
which	were	disbursed	to	C1	districts	as	compared	to	the	RBF	districts	was	only	56%.	
	
Results	 from	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 (CEA)	 shows	 that	 the	 RBF	 (vs	 C1)	 provided	 more	 total	
health	benefits	(QALYs	gained)	but	at	a	higher	unit	price.	Nonetheless,	in	comparison	with	the	two	
control	 groups,	 the	 RBF	 programme	 is	 a	 cost-effective	 approach	 in	 improving	 maternal	 and	 child	
health.	When	the	RBF	group	is	compared	with	the	C1	group,	the	mid-point	ICER	is	$1,642	per	QALYs	
gained	(without	quality	adjustment),	and	$1,324	per	QALYs	gained	(with	quality	adjustment).	When	
the	RBF	group	is	compared	with	the	C2	group,	the	mid-point	ICER	is	$999	per	QALYs	gained	(without	
quality	adjustment),	and	$809	per	QALYs	gained	(with	quality	adjustment).	All	these	values	are	less	
than	the	GDP/capita	of	$1,759	in	2013	(mid-year	of	RBF	programme)	in	Zambia2,3.	Since	these	ICERs	
are	less	than	Zambia’s	GDP	per	capita	in	2013,	the	RBF	programme	was	cost-effective	in	comparison	
to	C1	and	C2.	However,	the	input	financing	approach	(C1)	was	also	cost-effective	in	comparison	to	
C2.	 The	 ICERs	 for	 C1	 vs	 C2	 were	 $508	 and	 $413	 per	 QALY	 gained,	 without	 and	 with	 quality	
adjustment,	respectively.	Thus,	depending	on	which	group	is	used	for	comparison,	the	ICER	varies,	
but	the	estimates	point	to	a	cost-effective	impact	of	both	the	RBF	and	C1	groups	than	the	C2	group.	
	
Conclusion	

The	 overarching	 conclusion	 is	 that	 both	 the	 RBF	 and	 C1	 interventions	 contributed	 to	 increased	
utilization	 of	 key	 MNCH	 services	 in	 Zambia.	 However,	 as	 compared	 to	 the	 C1,	 RBF	 had	 a	 more	
positive	effect	on	health	systems	functionality	and	governance.		Internal	and	external	verification	of	
results,	 and	 regular	 support	 supervision	 which	 were	 a	 key	 feature	 in	 the	 RBF	 districts	 was	 also	
helpful	 in	 tracking	 the	 performance	 of	 health	 workers	 and	 the	 programme	 as	 a	 whole.	 Another	
feature	is	that	purchasing	mechanisms	were	enhanced	in	the	RBF	and	this	potentially	contributed	to

greater	efficiency	and	value	for	money.	From	the	CEA	analysis,	we	can	conclude	that	the	RBF	(vs	C1)	
provided	more	total	health	benefits	(QALYs	gained)	but	at	a	higher	unit	price.	However,	both	the	RBF	
and	C1	are	cost-effective	at	improving	maternal	and	child	health	as	compared	to	C2.	

In	 the	 discussion	 section	 of	 the	 main	 report,	 we	 examined	 some	 of	 the	 causal	 and	 behavioural	
mechanisms	 through	 which	 the	 RBF	 and	 C1	 could	 have	 achieved	 and/or	 not	 achieved	 gains	 in	 the	
targeted	indicators.	For	the	enhanced	financing	(C1)	arm,	the	key	question	is	whether	the	gains	were	
as	 a	 result	 of	 increased	 financing,	 earmarking	 of	 funds	 for	 priority	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	
interventions,	 or	 other	 factors.	 A	 corollary	 question	 is	 whether	 greater	 gains	 could	 have	 been	
observed	 in	 the	 C1	 arm	 if	 financial	 flows	 to	 C1	 facilities	 actually	 equalled	 those	 received	 by	 RBF	
facilities.	 We	 observe	 that	 health	 facilities	 in	 C1	 districts	 may	 also	 have	 been	 implementing	 RBF	
initiatives.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 with	 no	 concealed	 investigation,	 the	 study	 units	 were	 aware	 of	 the	
experiment	and	the	C1	districts	could	have	tried	to	out-perform	the	RBF	districts.	For	the	RBF,	the	
key	question	is	whether	the	RBF	districts	could	have	achieved	much	more.	In	exploring	this	question,	
we	noted	that	the	Zambia	RBF	project	was	being	implemented	in	a	health	system	that	already	had	
high	 coverage	 in	 some	 of	 the	 key	 MNCH	 indicators.	 As	 such,	 perhaps	 it	 would	 have	 been	 more	
prudent	to	have	adopted	a	target	or	coverage	based	performance	incentive	framework	rather	than	
fee-for-service.	 Furthermore,	 the	 results	 show	 that	 health	 workers	 received	 about	 10%	 of	 their	
official	 GRZ	 staff	 salaries	 on	 average	 as	 RBF	 staff	 incentives.	 This	 may	 not	 have	 been	 sufficient	 to	
have	induced	change.		
	
Lessons	Learnt	

The	results	from	the	study	shed	light	on	several	grey	areas	which	have	been	under	discussion	with	
regards	to	the	RBF	in	terms	of	the	results,	implementation	and	evaluation	processes:	
	
    (i)   The	 study	 demonstrates	 that	 an	 RBF	 programme	 can	 be	 successfully	 implemented	 to	
          increase	delivery	of	key	health	indicators	through	“contracting-in”	a	capacity	constrained	
          public	health	system.	Many	other	examples	of	successful	public	sector	RBF	programs	occur	
          in	 middle-income	 countries	 (i.e.	 Argentina)	 or	 when	 implemented	 by	 a	 specialist	 third	
          party	 (i.e.	 Zimbabwe).	 Since	 Zambia	 implemented	 the	 RBF	 by	 using	 existing	 government	
          systems,	structures,	and	local	expertise,	it	is	potentially	easier	to	scale-up	a	countrywide	
          RBF	programme.	This	is	because	the	Zambia	RBF	design	allows	for	financial,	institutional,	
          and	impact	sustainability.		
    	
    (ii) It	 is	 important	 to	 have	 a	 routine	 process	 evaluation	 (PE)	 system	 in	 place	 to	continuously	
          monitor	 the	 results	 and	 overall	 implementation	 of	 the	 RBF	 programme.	 The	 Zambia	 RBF	
          pilot	programme	benefited	from	a	PE	system	which	provided	regular	updates	and	insights	
          on	the	implementation	to	allow	for	midcourse	corrections	and	evidence-based	policy	and	
          planning.	
        	

    (iii)       While	 the	 “contracting-in”	 design	 could	 be	 potentially	 more	 institutionally	 sustainable,	
                consistency	 in	 leadership	 is	 a	 critical	 component	 to	 moving	 from	 a	 project	 to	 a	
                programmatic	approach	that	is	fully	embedded	in	the	larger	health	sector.	In	the	case	of	
                Zambia,	there	were	several	exogenous	shocks	(governance	issues,	split	of	ministries,	high	
                staff	turnover	at	all	levels	of	Government	etc)	which	made	it	difficult	to	have	continuous	
                policy	dialogue	on	RBF.	To	help	ensure	integration	of	experiences	and	lessons	of	current	


                                                          6	
            	
               and	future	RBF	programs	into	broader	health	sector	dialogue,	these	programs	should	be	
               firmly	 embedded	 in	 the	 planning	 department	 of	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Health	 (MOH)	 with	 co-
               leadership	 with	 a	 relevant	 technical	 unit	 such	 as	 Mother	 and	 Child	 Health.	 The	
               implementation	 structure	 could	 consist	 of	 a	 mix	 of	 dedicated	 technical	 civil	 service	 staff.		
               In	addition,	an	RBF	coordination	committee	governed	by	the	MOH	should	bring	together	
               interested	donors	together	with	Government	to	discuss	emerging	results,	policy	impacts,	
               and	the	way	forward.		
	
    (iv)       The	 Zambia	 RBF	 project	 demonstrates	 that	 having	 a	 performance	 incentive	 framework	
               (provider	 payment	 mechanism)	 linked	 to	 targets	 and	 production	 capacity	 instead	 of	 a	
               payment	 mechanism	 for	 all	 services	 rendered	 is	 potentially	 better.	 The	 Zambia	 RBF	 was	
               implemented	in	a	health	system	that	already	had	relatively	high	coverage	in	some	of	the	
               key	maternal	and	child	health	indicators.	As	such,	rather	than	fee-for-service,	it	may	have	
               been	 more	 effective	 to	 have	 used	 a	 target	 or	 coverage	 based	 performance	 incentive	
               framework.	
    	
    (v)        The	enhanced	financing	arm	as	part	of	the	evaluation	is	critical	in	order	to	be	certain	that	
               effects	in	the	RBF	arm	are	not	only	due	to	additional	financial	resources.	As	shown	in	the	
               evaluation	 results,	 enhanced	 financing,	 can	 also	 produce	 good	 results.	 	 In	 Zambia,	 these	
               results	 go	 a	 step	 further	 in	 highlighting	 a	 potential	 issue	 in	 the	 current	 health	 system	
               related	 to	 funding	 constraints	 and	 unpredictability.	 Input	 financing	 with	 parameters	
               focused	on	key	interventions	can	work—but	in	the	case	of	Zambia,	there	were	also	issues	
               in	 utilizing	 funds	 in	 Control	 1	 districts	 which	 points	 to	 disbursement	 mechanism	 issues	
               which	were	not	experienced	when	disbursing	RBF	grants	in	the	RBF	arm.		Thus,	effective	
               approaches,	 including	 direct	 disbursement	 of	 funds	 to	 front-line	 service	 delivery	 levels	
               coupled	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 financing	 mechanisms	 can	 have	 a	 positive	 impact	 on	 service	
               delivery	through	improved	budget	performance	(disbursement	and	absorption	of	funds).			
    	
    (vi)       Direct	 disbursement	 of	 funds	 to	 front-line	 service	 delivery	 levels	 and	 use	 of	 an	 effective	
               disbursement	 mechanism	 can	 also	 increase	 predictability	 of	 funding	 and	 managerial	
               autonomy.	 However,	 the	 RBF	 funds	 may	 have	 substituted	 rather	 than	 complemented	
               government	funding	due	to	the	poor	disbursement	of	Government	grants	to	pilot	health	
               facilities	 by	 the	 district	 management	 during	 the	 implementation	 of	 the	 RBF	 project.	 To	
               mitigate	 this	 problem,	 future	 RBF	 programs	 in	 Zambia	 could	 consider	 putting	 in	 place	
               indicators	 linked	 to	 government	 budget	 performance	 at	 national,	 provincial,	 and	 district	
               levels	 to	 ensure	 that	 RBF	 grants	 at	 service	 delivery	 levels	 are	 additional	 to	 government	
               grants.	
           	

    (vii) Adequate	levels	of	incentives	need	be	offered	to	providers	to	trigger	sufficient	behavioural	
          change.	 The	 relatively	 low	 power	 of	 RBF	 staff	 incentives	 in	 relation	 to	 guaranteed	
          individual	staff	salaries	(which	declined	to	10%	over	the	project	period)	may	have	limited	
          some	of	the	possible	achievable	gains	by	RBF.	Furthermore,	higher	incentive	payments	in	
          remote	 areas	 did	 not	 result	 in	 increased	 health	 outcomes	 either	 (Appendix	 1).	 This	
          suggests	 that	 provider	 effort	 may	 be	 relatively	 inelastic	 at	 small	 incentive	 levels.	 This	
          probably	explains	why	the	RBF	had	no	impact	on	the	motivation	of	health	workers	but	had	
          a	 positive	 impact	 on	 health	 worker	 satisfaction,	reduced	 attrition,	 and	responsiveness	 to	
          the	client.	Given	the	high	cost	of	living	in	Zambia,	the	additional	income	from	the	RBF	staff	

                                                            7	
           	
              incentive	 could	 have	 been	 inadequate	 to	 fully	 influence	 personal	 behaviour.	 Future	 RBF	
              programs	should	provide	adequate	but	sustainable	levels	of	RBF	staff	incentives.	
    	
    (viii) When	introducing	the	concept	of	data	verification	in	a	health	system	with	little	previous	
            experience,	 repeated	 outreach	 to	 facility	 management	 combined	 with	 experiential	
            learning	may	be	necessary	for	management	to	internalize	the	reality	of	a	verification	audit.	
            This	 also	 applies	 to	 the	 possible	 ramifications	 for	 mis-reporting.	 The	 audit	 experiment	
            discussed	 in	 Appendix	 2	 demonstrates	 a	 very	 low	 level	 of	 understanding	 of	 the	 audit	
            likelihoods	despite	repeated	announcement	to	the	facility	management,	as	well	as	a	lack	
            of	understanding	over	mis-reporting	thresholds	and	possible	sanctions.	As	such,	the	audit	
            likelihood	 experiment	 largely	 failed	 as	 the	 reporting	 principals	 were	 unaware	 of	 the	
            likelihood	assigned	to	the	facility.	Nevertheless,	despite	discrepancies	in	reporting	found	in	
            RBF	facilities	by	the	external	verifiers,	these	discrepancies	appear	to	be	within	the	bounds	
            of	 normal	 reporting	 error	 as	 they	 are	 not	 significantly	 different	 from	 a	 sample	 of	 C2	
            facilities.	
          	
    (ix) A	 key	 component	 of	 the	 Zambia	 HRBF	 IE	 is	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 (CEA)	 which	
            justified	 the	 value	 of	 the	 RBF	 on	 both	 the	 costs	 and	 effectiveness	 (by	 increasing	 both	
            quality	and	quantity	of	services).	By	adding	a	complementary	cost-effectiveness	study,	the	
            Zambia	HRBF	IE	showed	that	a	number	of	decisions	must	be	made	in	the	health	facilities	
            on	 health	 systems	 inputs	 such	 as	 personnel,	 drugs,	 equipment,	 buildings,	 verification,	
            supportive	 supervision	 and	 so	 forth.	 The	 existence	 of	 both	 fixed	 and	 variable	 costs	 are	
            important	 aspects	 in	 evaluating	 how	 much	 it	 costs	 to	 implement	 a	 RBF	 programme,	 and	
            the	efficacy	of	RBF	programs	as	compared	to	non-RBF	programs.		
	
    (x)       To	 our	knowledge,	 this	 CEA	 study	 is	 among	 the	 few	 to	 incorporate	 the	 quality	 of	 care	 in	
              the	 cost-effectiveness	 modelling,	 and	 the	 study	 innovatively	 uses	 a	 Delphi	 panel	 to	
              generate	 a	 quality	 index	 from	 household	 survey	 based	 results	 and	 to	 convert	 a	 quality	
              index	to	a	health	effect	index.	Given	that	improving	the	quality	of	care	is	one	of	the	major	
              components	 of	 the	 RBF	 programme,	 RBF	 evaluation	 models	 should	 always	 include	 an	
              assessment	 of	 quality	 improvements	 to	 fully	 estimate	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 of	 the	 RBF	
              programme.

1. Background	and	Programme	Design	
	
1. Zambia	is	a	lower-middle-income	country	with	a	GNI	per	capita	of	US$	1,760	(World	Bank,	Atlas	
   method)	in	2014.	Total	population	is	estimated	at	15.02	million	in	2014,	60%	of	which	resides	in	
   the	 rural	 areas.	 Against	 a	 backdrop	 of	 consistent	 market-led	 economic	 policies,	 Zambia	 began	
   recording	consistently	high	economic	growth	of	above	6%	in	2006	which	went	to	7.3%	in	2012	
   after	which	it	reduced	to	6.7%	in	2013,	and	5.6%	in	2014.	Notwithstanding	the	positive	economic	
   developments,	poverty	has	persisted	and	income	inequality	is	still	high.	The	effect	of	economic	
   growth	 on	 overall	 poverty	 reduction	 has	 been	 insignificant	 and	 the	 urban	 centred	 growth	 has	
   not	 generated	 higher	 incomes	 and	 better	 basic	 services	 for	 rural	 residents.	 According	 to	 the	
   Living	Conditions	Monitoring	Survey	(LCMS)	of	2010,	poverty	levels	remain	very	high	with	60.5%	
   of	the	population	living	below	the	poverty	line	and	42.3%	in	extreme	poverty.	While	poverty	in	
   urban	areas	has	declined	from	29.7%	in	2006	to	27.5%	in	2010,	it	is	still	very	high	in	rural	areas	
   (77.9%	in	2010	compared	to	80.3%	in	2006).	The	rural	poverty	rate	at	77.9%	is	more	than	double	
   the	urban	poverty	of	rate	27.5%	and,	over	the	past	decade,	the	Gini	coefficient	increased	from	
   0.47	 to	 0.52	 which	 reflects	 a	 high	 level	 of	 income	 inequality.	 Life	 expectancy	 at	 birth	 is	 51.2	
   years,	 which	 is	 lower	 than	 the	 average	 for	 its	 income	 group	 (65.8	 years)	 and	 the	 sub-Sahara	
   Africa	average	(54.7	years).	
   	
2. In	 the	 health	 sector,	 Zambia	 has	 made	 notable	 progress	 in	 improving	 health	 and	 nutrition	
   outcomes	 in	 the	 last	 decade.	 However,	 progress	 has	 been	 insufficient	 to	 achieve	 some	 of	 the	
   health	and	nutrition	related	MDGs.	While	under-five	mortality	(U5MR)	decreased	from	119	to	75	
   per	1,000	live	births	between	2007	and	2013/14	(CSO	 et	al.	2014),	this	is	still	high	compared	to	
   the	average	for	lower	middle	income	countries	(61	deaths	per	1,000	live	births)	and	insufficient	
   to	achieve	MDG	4.	The	maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR)	also	fell	from	591	to	398	per	100,000	live	
   births	between	2007	and	2013/14	(CSO	 et	al.	2014),	but	this	is	significantly	above	the	average	
   for	 Zambia’s	 income	 group	 (260	 per	 100,000	 live	 births).	 Chronic	 malnutrition	 in	 under-5	
   children	 decreased	 from	 45.4%	 in	 2007	 to	 40.1%	 in	 2013/14	 (CSO	 et	 al.	 2014)	 but	 this	 is	 far	
   below	the	MDG	target	of	23%.		
        	
3. The	 other	 challenge	 is	 low	 coverage	 and	 utilization	 of	 high	 impact	 maternal,	 child	 health	 and	
   nutrition	 services.	 For	 example,	 whereas	 96%	 of	 pregnant	 women	 received	 any	 antenatal	 care	
   from	a	skilled	provider	in	2013/14,	only	67%	of	these	women	deliver	in	a	health	facility,	and	only	
   64%	are	attended	to	by	a	skilled	provider	(CSO	et	al.	2014).	Some	of	the	underlying	causes	of	this	
   are:	 inadequate	 and	 poorly	 motivated	 health	 workers;	 an	 erratic	 supply	 of	 essential	 medicines	
   and	medical	supplies;	limited	autonomy	in	decision-making	at	decentralized	levels	of	the	health	
   system;	 and	 a	 weak	 monitoring	 and	 evaluation	 system.	 Critical	 among	 all	 these	 challenges	is	 a	
   human	resources	for	health	crisis	which	is	evident	from	the	limited	availability	and	mix	of	skilled	
   human	resources,	and	which	has	contributed	to	an	inequitable	mix,	absenteeism,	tardiness,	and	
   poor	 morale	 among	 the	 health	 workers.	 The	 2009	 Health	 Public	 Expenditure	 Review	 observed	
   high	 rates	 of	 absenteeism	 (21	 percent	 self-reported)	 and	 tardiness	 (43	 percent	 self-reported),	
   equivalent	 to	 a	 total	 loss	 of	 4,108	 working	 days	 per	 month.	 Eliminating	 absenteeism	 and	
   tardiness	 would	 translate	 to	 a	 gain	 of	 187	 full-time	 equivalent	 staff,	 enough	 to	 staff	 21	 rural	
   health	centres	in	Zambia.

4. In	 an	 attempt	 to	 strengthen	 the	 health	 system	 and	 improve	 health-service	 delivery,	 Zambia	 is	
   gradually	 introducing	 Results-Based	 Financing	 (RBF)	 approaches	 in	 financing	 some	 of	 its	 health	
   programs	 and	 activities	 to	 complement	 traditional	 input	 based	 financing.	 In	 RBF,	 “a	 principal	
   entity	 provides	 a	 financial	 or	 in-kind	 reward,	 conditional	 on	 the	 recipient	 achieving	 pre-agreed	
   actions	and	performance	goals.”	In	principle,	RBF	can	encompass	various	forms	of	output-based	
   aid,	 provider	 or	 healthcare	 based	 incentives	 for	 performance	 and	 consumer	 incentives	 for	
   behavioural	 change.	 By	 introducing	 incentives	 that	 reward	 results,	 RBF	 promotes	 greater	
   accountability	 of	 service	 providers,	 and	 improves	 management,	 efficiency,	 equity	 of	 service	
   delivery,	and	health	information	systems	with	the	overall	aim	of	strengthening	service	delivery	
   to	improve	development	outcomes.	
   	
5. RBF	has	been	advocated	as	a	key	transformative	approach	to	health	financing	with	potential	to	
   strengthen	health	systems,	and	improve	health	outcomes.	Existing	evidence	shows	that	RBF	can	
   help	 to	 strengthen	 health	 systems	 by	 decreasing	 costs	 of	 service	 provision,	 improving	 staff	
   motivation	and	morale	through	the	provision	of	staff	incentives,	and	empowering	providers	and	
   beneficiaries	 in	 the	 use	 of	 data	 for	 decision	 making,	 and	 decentralisation	 of	 health	 services.	
   Countries	 that	 have	 experienced	 increases	 in	 service	 availability	 and,	 for	 some	 dimensions	 of	
   service	 quality	 include	 Rwanda,	 Argentina,	 and	 Zimbabwe	 (Basinga	 et	 al.	 2011;	 Gertler	 et	 al.	
   2014;	Friedman	et	al.	2015).	However	not	all	attempts	to	experiment	with	RBF	have	resulted	in	
   increased	 population	 coverage	 and	 health	 system	 improvements.	 These	 examples	 include	
   Afghanistan	 and	 DRC	 (Alonge	 et	 al.	 2014;	 Huillery	 et	 al.	 2014).	 In	 these	 latter	 cases,	 often	
   difficulties	in	implementation	appear	to	have	contributed	to	the	limited	effectiveness.	
        	
6. At	design	stage,	the	Zambia	Government	was	particularly	interested	in	testing	a	“Contracting-in	
   model	to	strengthen	aspects	of	the	public	health	system.	This	was	motivated	by	a	long	history	of	
   Performance-Based	Contracting	(1996-2006)	and	the	Government	was	determined	to	apply	RBF	
   within	 the	 public	 structures	 which	 were	 left	 behind	 when	 the	 Central	 Board	 of	 Health	 (the	
   purchasing	 agency	 at	 that	 time)	 was	 abolished	 in	 2006.	 Therefore,	 the	 Zambian	 HRBF	 project	
   was	 implemented	 through	 the	 Zambian	 health	 system	 (contracted-in)	 and	 is	 one	 of	 the	 first	
   examples	using	this	type	of	model	globally.	
   	
	
1.1	Zambia	Health	Results	Based	Financing	(HRBF)	Project	Objectives		
	
7. Zambia	 was	 awarded	 a	 US$17	 million	 grant	 in	 2008	 by	 the	 World	 Bank	 through	 the	 Health	
   Results	Innovation	Trust	Fund	(HRITF)4	to	implement	a	Results	Based	Financing	(RBF)	project	as	
   well	 as	 an	 Impact	 Evaluation.	 The	 prime	 objective	 of	 the	 Zambia	 HRBF	 project	 was	 to	 catalyse	
   the	 country’s	 efforts	 to	 reduce	 under-five	 and	 maternal	 mortality	 in	 11	 districts	 in	 nine	 (9)	
   provinces	 (except	 Lusaka)	 countrywide.	 This	 project	 was	 motivated	 by	 the	 slow	 progress	 in	
   MDGs	4	and	5	targets,	and	particularly:		
	


																																																													
4
 	At	the	time	of	the	Zambia	HRBF	project,	the	HRITF	was	being	funded	by	the	British	and	Norwegian	Governments.		

                                                                10	
              	
   i.    Critical	 human	 resource	 shortages	 both	 in	 terms	 of	 numbers	 and	 skills-mix,	 and	 low	
         productivity;	
  ii.    Poor	 quality	 of	 service	 provision	 and	 inequities	 by	 sex,	 age,	 income,	 education,	 type	 of	
         service	etc;		
 iii.    Varied	 intervention	 coverage,	 and	 supply	 chain	 dysfunctions	 across	 interventions	 and	
         geographical	locations;	and		
  iv.    Poor	 governance	 and	 the	 need	 for	 increased	 value	 for	 money	 i.e.	 strengthening	 the	 link	
         between	financing	and	health	outcomes.	
	
8. The	 anticipation	 was	 that	 the	 Zambia	 HRBF	 project	 would	 contribute	 to	 the	 delivery	 of	 better	
   quality	services	by	increasing	the	productivity	of	the	existing	human	resource	base,	augmenting	
   financial	 resources,	 increasing	 managerial	 autonomy	 and	 decision-making	 of	 the	 implementing	
   health	facilities,	and	improving	transparency	and	accountability	in	the	use	of	funds.	A	pre-pilot	
   project	was	implemented	from	2009	to	2011	in	Katete	District	in	the	Eastern	Province	of	Zambia	
   with	 the	 goal	 of	 developing	 an	 RBF	 operational	 design	 and	 model	 specific	 to	 the	 context	 and	
   prevailing	 situation	 in	 Zambia.	 After	 the	 Katete	 pre-pilot,	 the	 RBF	 model	 was	 expanded	 to	 ten	
   (10)	additional	districts	in	April	2012.	By	the	end	of	the	project,	203	health	centres	countrywide	
   were	covered.	This	represents	a	total	catchment	population	of	about	1.5	million	people	of	which	
   the	direct	beneficiaries	were	338,248	children	aged	between	0-59	months,	and	372,073	women	
   of	child-bearing	age.		
	
1.2	Zambia	RBF	Model	and	Design	
9. The	Zambian	HRBF	project	was	implemented	through	the	Zambian	health	system	(contracted-in)	
    and	is	one	of	the	first	examples	globally	of	this	type	of	model.	The	overall	activities	which	were	
    supported	by	the	project	include:	
        i.   Provision	of	incentive	payments	to	both	district	level	management	and	health	facilities	
             based	on	individual	and	institutional	performance;		
       ii.   Provision	of	a	package	of	reproductive	health	commodities	and	equipment;		
      iii.   Supporting	evidence-based	decision	making	by	improving	the	availability	and	quality	of	
             data	 generated	 through	 the	 Health	 Management	 Information	 System	 (HMIS).	 This	
             includes	data	management,	data	analysis,	reporting,	and	use;	
      iv.    Enhancing	 quality	 in	 the	 provision	 of	 health	 care	 through	 regular	 and	 rigorous	 clinical	
             quality	assessment,	and	perceived	quality	through	periodic	client	tracer	surveys;		
       v.    Capacity	 building	 and	 training	 in	 the	 delivery	 of	 Reproductive	 Health	 services	 -	
             specifically	Emergency	Obstetric	and	Neonatal	Care	(EmONC);	and	
      vi.    Training	in	planning	and	budgeting,	and	financial	and	procurement	management.	
	
10. The	 Zambia	 HRBF	 model	 (Figure	 1)	 adhered	 to	 the	 principle	 of	 “separation	 of	 functions”	 and	
    performance	 was	 rewarded	 based	 on	 nine	 (9)	 facility	 based	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	 output	
    indicators,	 and	 ten	 (10)	 dimensions	 of	 quality.	 Performance-based	 payments	 were	 provided	 to	
    health	 facilities	and	districts	after	the	attainment	of	the	pre-agreed	indicators	on	quantity	and	
    quality.	 The	 indicators	 were:	 i)	 institutional	 deliveries	 by	 a	 skilled	 birth	 attendant;	 ii)	 curative	
    consultation,	 iii)	 ANC	 prenatal	 and	 follow	 up	 visits;	 iv)	 postnatal	 visit;	 v)	 full	 immunization	 of	
    children	 under	 one	 year;	 vi)	 pregnant	 women	 receiving	 3	 doses	 of	 malaria	 IPT;	 vii)	 family	
    planning	 users	 of	 modern	 methods	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 month;	 viii)	 pregnant	 women	counselled

    and	tested	for	HIV;	and	ix)	HIV	pregnant	women	given	Niverapine	and	AZT.	This	is	shown	in	Table	
    1.	The	ten	service	areas	targeted	for	quality	improvements	are	comprised	the	following:	Curative	
    Care,	 Antenatal	 Care,	 Family	 Planning,	 Immunization,	 Delivery	 Room,	 HIV/AIDS,	 Supply	
    Management,	General	Management,	Health	Management	Information	System,	and	Community	
    Participation.	This	is	shown	in	Table	2.	
	
11. In	addition	to	the	Health	Centres,	the	District	Medical	Office	(DMO)	was	rewarded	if	it	fulfilled	a	
    set	 of	 supervision	 and	 management	 functions.	 The	 incentives	 were	 tied	 to	 strengthening	 the	
    DMO’s	role	in	supporting	health	facilities’	efforts	to	increase	the	delivery	of	high-quality	services	
    based	 on	 their	 performance	 on	 management	 and	 supervisory	 functions.	 According	 to	 the	
    stipulated	 roles	 and	 functions,	 Health	 Centres	 were	 the	 frontline	 service	 providers,	 while	 the	
    District	Medical	Offices	and	District	(General)	Hospitals	were	the	quantity	and	quality	assessors,	
    respectively.	Through	internal	and	external	verification	processes,	reported	data	was	extensively	
    audited.	 District	 RBF	 Steering	 Committees	 (D-RBFSC)	 were	 the	 internal	 verifiers,	 Provincial	 RBF	
    Steering	 Committees	 (P-RBFSC)	 were	 purchasers,	 and	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Health	 (MOH)	
    headquarters	was	both	the	fund	holder	and	regulator.	The	steering	committees	at	provincial	and	
    district	 levels	 was	 an	 assembly	 of	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 stakeholders	 from	 other	 Government	
    Ministries	and	Departments,	Civil	Society	Organisations,	NGOs,	and	the	beneficiary	communities.

12. Two	 external	 verification	 exercises	 were	 conducted	 during	 the	 course	 of	 the	 project	 aimed	 at	
    independently	assessing	the	completeness,	accuracy	and	validity	of	self-reported	and	internally	
    verified	 data	 at	 the	 health	 facilities.	 Data	 on	 all	 the	 nine	 (9)	 incentivized	 health	 facility	 output	
    indicators	 were	 verified.	 Key	 sources	 of	 data	 at	 the	 health	 facility	 level	 were	 the	 Health	
    Information	Aggregation	(HIA)	2	forms	in	which	the	facility	summarized	(aggregated)	the	level	of	
    service	provision	per	indicator.	Since	this	data	required	verification,	tally	sheets,	activity	sheets	
    and	registers	were	used	as	these	indicated	the	individual	services	delivered	to	each	client.	This	
    was	 relevant	 in	 that	 it	 provided	 further	 details	 as	 to	 the	 date	 of	 the	 service,	 client	 register	
    number,	 name	 of	 client,	 residential	 address,	 among	 others.	 Qualitative	 aspects	 of	 service	
    delivery	 were	 also	 reviewed	 in	 order	 to	 put	 into	 context	 the	 level	 of	 service	 delivery.	 The	
    external	verification	also	included	client	tracer	surveys	where	clients	were	selected	from	health	
    facility	 records	 (registers)	 for	 tracing	 into	 the	 community	 and	 confirming	 that	 services	 were	
    received	 as	 well	 as	 to	 measure	 perceived	 quality.	 The	 client	 tracer	 surveys	 focused	 on	 two	
    indicators,	namely:	(i)	Deliveries	by	skilled	personnel,	and	(ii)	full	immunization	of	children	below	
    the	age	of	one	(1)	year.	Verbal	responses	on	service-related	questions	were	also	obtained	from	
    clients	during	the	tracer	surveys.	
    	
13. To	 promote	 fiscal	 decentralisation	 and	 support	 autonomy	 of	 resources,	 health	 facilities	 on	 the	
    RBF	received	performance-based	payments	directly	into	their	bank	accounts	after	the	delivery	of	
    the	pre-agreed	indicators	on	quantity	and	quality5.	The	health	facilities	were	authorised	to	use	at	
    least	40%	of	the	money	they	earned	from	the	RBF	for	operational	activities	(both	on	the	supply	
    and	 demand-side)	 to	 increase	 the	 number	 of	 services	 being	 delivered6.	 A	 maximum	 of	 60%	 of	
    the	money	could	be	used	for	staff	motivation	bonuses.	
         	

																																																													
5
 	A	Threshold-Based	Graduated	method	was	being	used	to	calculate	the	final	RBF	payment	due	to	the	health	facility.	The	
health	 facility	 was	 rewarded	 for	 quality	 if	 the	 quality	 score	 was	 61%	 and	 above	 as	 follows:	 (i)	 61%-69%	 (Extra	 15%	 of	
quantity	payment);	(ii)	70%-79%	(Extra	25%	of	quantity	payment);	and	(iii)	80%-100%	(Extra	50%	of	quantity	payment)	
6
 	This	could	include	purchase	of	safe	delivery	kits,	upkeep	of	the	health	facility,	community	outreach,	contracting	of	retired	
nurses	and	midwives,	etc.	

                                                                  13	
              	
14. There	 was	 a	 strong	 focus	 on	 the	 quality	 of	 services	 provided	 as	 quarterly	 assessments	 were	
    conducted	to	enhance	quality	of	service	provision.	DMOs	subcontracted	hospitals	to	undertake	
    these	assessments	based	on	a	comprehensive	quality	checklist	as	outlined	in	Table	2	above.	The	
    quality	 assessment	 checklist	 incorporated	 international	 and	 national	 operating	 standard	
    operating	practices	and	guidelines	in	ten	different	areas	deemed	critical	for	quality	improvement	
    and	assurance.	The	timing	of	the	quarterly	quality	assessments	were	unannounced	to	the	health	
    facility	teams	and	could	take	place	anytime	during	a	particular	quarterly	period.

2. Impact	Evaluation	Design	
	
15. The	 Zambia	 HRBF	 project	 was	 accompanied	 by	 an	 Impact	 Evaluation	 (IE)	 component	 which	
    comprised	 both	 quantitative	 and	 qualitative	 approaches.	 Dedicated	 primary	 quantitative	 data	
    for	the	IE	was	collected	at	baseline,	implementation	stage,	and	at	the	end	of	the	project	from	10	
    RBF	intervention	districts;	10	Control	1	(C1)	districts;	and	10	Control	2	(C2)	districts	as	shown	in	
    Figure	2	and	Table	3.	The	method	of	selecting	districts	for	the	IE	was	based	on	district-matched	
    randomization	 and	 is	 described	 in	 more	 detail	 below.	 For	 the	 Zambia	 IE,	 the	 districts	 were	
    chosen	as	the	unit	of	randomization	and	not	individual	health	facilities	because	the	DMO	plays	a	
    key	 role	 in	 supervision/monitoring	 and	 is	 itself	 incentivized.	 Randomization	 at	 the	 facility	 level	
    wouldn’t	have	been	successful	because	numerous	channels	and	spill	overs	could	have	affected	
    the	IE	design	and	implementation.	Inputs	were	assigned	to	the	three	district	groups	as	follows:	
    (a)	 The	 RBF	 Intervention	 group	 received	 Emergency	 Obstetric	 and	 Neonatal	 Care	 (EmONC)	
    equipment	 and	 RBF	 incentives;	 (b)	 The	 C1	 group	 received	 EmONC	 equipment	 exactly	 as	 in	 the	

                                                                                          14	
              	
    RBF	 and	 the	 intended	 equivalent	 of	 the	 average	 RBF	 incentives	 in	 the	 RBF	 Intervention	 group;	
    and	(c)	The	C2	group	received	nothing.	
	
2.1	Selection	of	districts	for	the	Impact	Evaluation	
16. The	 evaluation	 team,	 in	 consultation	 with	 government,	 decided	 that	 districts	 selected	 for	 the	
    HRBF	 study	 should	 approximate	 the	 median	 population	 health,	 socio-economic	 condition,	 and	
    health	 governance	 capacity	 for	 the	 collection	 of	 districts	 in	 the	 provinces	 in	 which	 they	 are	
    located.	 If	 the	 evaluation	 instead	 focused	 on	 exceptionally	 high	 (or	 exceptionally	 low)	 capacity	
    districts,	 then	 this	 may	 in	 turn	 overstate	 (or	 understate)	 the	 estimated	 gains	 from	 a	 national	
    scale-up	for	the	RBF.	
    	
17. To	 select	 districts	 for	 the	 study,	 district	 level	 information	 was	 gathered	 on	 three	 areas	 of	
    interest:	district	health	administrative	capacity,	district	population	health	service	outcomes,	and	
    levels	 of	 district	 population	 living	 standards.	 The	 administrative	 capacity	 of	 the	 district	 was	
    measured	 as	 an	 index	 derived	 from	 a	 principal	 components	 analysis	 based	 on	 the	 following	
    three	measures:	
        a) Average	facility	level	stock-out	rate	of	key	commodities	over	the	years	2006	and	2007	
        b) Average	supervisory	visit	rate	from	District	medical	Office	(DMO)	to	all	facilities	over	the	
             years	2006	and	2007	
        c) Rate	of	under-5	population	covered	by	immunization	campaigns	in	2006	and	2007	
             	
18. Within	 each	 province	 (except	 for	 Northern	 and	 Southern	 Provinces,	 where	 six	 districts	 were	
    sampled),	 three	 districts	 at	 or	 near	 the	 provincial	 median	 index	 score	 derived	 from	 these	
    measures	were	selected	and	then	randomly	assigned	to	each	of	the	three	arms.	Thus,	there	are	
    a	total	of	30	districts	distributed	equally	among	the	three	study	arms	with	10	districts	in	each.

2.2 Research	Questions	
19. The	 IE	 was	 designed	 to	 inform	 policy	 on	 the	 impact	 of	 the	 project	 based	 on	 three	 key	 policy	
    questions:		
        i.   What	 is	 the	 causal	 effect	 of	 the	 Zambian	 HRBF	 on	 the	 population	 health	 indicators	 of	
             interest?

20. This	 overview	 report	 focuses	 on	 the	 first	 research	 question,	 while	 also	 addressing	 the	 second	
    and	third	research	questions	through	dedicated	annexes.	
	
2.3	Methods	and	Data	–	Impact	Evaluation		
21. Household	 and	 health	 facility	 surveys	 provide	 information	 on	 the	 first	 two	 research	 questions,	
    whereas	a	special	study	known	as	“counter	external	verification”	was	carried	out	to	explore	the	
    third	research	question.	In	addition,	the	IE	was	complemented	by	a	Process	Evaluation	aimed	at	
    generating	valuable	information	on	a	continuous	basis	during	the	implementation	stage,	and	a	
    cost-effectiveness	analysis.		
    	
22. In	terms	of	the	empirical	strategy	adopted	to	estimate	the	causal	impact	of	the	intervention	on	
    the	 priority	 research	 questions,	 the	 first	 question	 is	 addressed	 through	 the	 quasi-experimental	
    evaluation	method	of	district-level	matched	difference-in-differences.	To	select	these	districts	as	
    well	as	comparison	districts	for	study,	three	districts	in	each	rural	province	(except	for	Northern	
    and	Southern	provinces	which	provided	six	districts	each)	were	selected	according	to	a	criterion	
																																																													
7
	Based	on	the	old	administrative	classification	of	districts	and	provinces	
8
	 The	 RBF	 project	 was	 implemented	 in	 11	 districts	 (including	 Katete	 the	 pre-pilot	 district)	 with	 a	 total	 population	 of	 1.5	
million.	Katete	was	not	part	of	the	Impact	Evaluation	(IE)	which	brings	down	the	population	for	the	IE	to	1.2	million


                                                                                  16	
              	
    mentioned	 in	 the	 next	 sub-section.	 Within	 these	 triplets	 of	 districts,	 each	 of	 the	 districts	 was	
    then	 randomly	 assigned	 to	 either	 treatment	 or	 to	 one	 of	 two	 control	 statuses	 (equivalent	
    financing	or	business-as-usual)9.		
        	
23. For	the	second	research	question,	health	facilities	designated	as	remote	in	the	RBF	Intervention	
    arm	were	randomized	in	two	different	groups.	The	remote	designation	is	based	on	Zambia’s	civil	
    service	 classification	 of	 districts	 into	 urban,	 rural,	 or	 remote	 for	 purposes	 of	 determining	 the	
    level	of	hardship	allowances	for	civil	servants.	This	classification	takes	into	account	the	different	
    levels	of	development	within	a	district	by	designating	certain	parts	of	a	district	as	urban	(mostly	
    the	 district	 administration	 centre),	 others	 as	 rural	 (outside	 a	 20KM	 and	 15KM	 radius	 of	 the	
    administrative	 centre	 in	 cities	 and	 municipalities,	 respectively),	 and	 the	 rest	 as	 remote	 (the	
    periphery	of	a	district).	The	total	number	of	remote	and	non-remote	health	facilities	in	the	RBF	
    Intervention	 group	 was	 then	 identified.	 From	 the	 total	 number	 of	 remote	 health	 facilities,	 a	
    smaller	number	of	remote	health	facilities	were	randomly	selected	and	assigned	to	be	receiving	
    additional	incentives.	In	particular,	the	prices	of	all	the	quantity	indicators	for	this	small	group	of	
    remote	 health	 facilities	 were	 pegged	 at	 25%	 more	 than	 the	 normal	 prices	 of	 indicators	 in	 the	
    non-remote	health	facilities	(25%	more	than	the	prices	in	Table	1).	
    	
2.3.1	Health	Facility	Survey		
24. Two	 rounds	 of	 facility	 surveys	 were	 undertaken	 for	 the	 same	 set	 of	 rural	 health	 centres	 and	
    health	 posts,	 i.e.	 baseline	 (October-November,	 2011)	 and	 endline	 (November	 2014	 -	 January	
    2015).	 The	 facility	 survey	 consisted	 of	 a	 facility	 checklist;	 a	 health	 worker	 instrument;	 exit	
    interview	 of	 sick	 children	 and	 antenatal	 women.	 The	 training	 for	 the	 data	 collection	 of	 the	
    enumerators	 included	 a	 classroom	 didactic	 part	 and	 a	 field	 visit.	 The	 instruments	 were	 pre-
    tested	and	modified	appropriately	before	the	actual	survey:		
	
Facility	survey	checklist		
    Health	 facilities	 were	 selected	 by	 a	 simple	 random	 sampling	 technique.	 In	 the	 baseline,	 176	
    health	facilities	were	surveyed	whereas	210	were	surveyed	in	the	endline.	The	facility	checklist	
    was	used	to	collect	information	on	infrastructure,	administration,	availability	of	basic	drugs	and	
    equipment,	governance	and	autonomy.		
	
Health	Worker	Interviews	
   Up	to	two	health	workers	were	selected	for	the	interview	at	each	health	facility.	The	criterion	for	
   selection	 was	 provision	 of	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	 care	 on	 the	 day	 of	 the	 interview.	 Sample	
   sizes	 were	 326	 and	 355	 for	 the	 baseline	 and	 endline	 surveys,	 respectively.	 The	 instrument	
   included	questions	on	remuneration,	knowledge,	job	satisfaction	and	motivation.		
	
Exit	Interviews	
     A	 patient	 exit	 interview	 assessed	 patient	 satisfaction	 and	 quality	 of	 care	 received	 for	 patients	
     exiting	ante-natal	care	and	child	health	consultations.	For	child	consultation,	the	child’s	parent	
																																																													
9
 	The	Zambia	HRBF	was	implemented	in	11	districts.	However,	Katete	district	being	a	pre-pilot	district	was	excluded	from	
the	 IE.	 At	 the	 start	 of	 the	 RBF	 implementation,	 the	 country	 had	 9	 provinces.	 Thus,	 for	 the	 IE,	 the	 old	 administrative	
arrangements	were	maintained.	

                                                                  17	
              	
    or	 caretaker	 was	 interviewed.	 Up	 to	 six	 clients	 were	 selected	 per	 service	 through	 a	 systematic	
    random	sampling	strategy	(based	on	caseload	for	the	same	day	of	previous	week	for	the	facility).	
    Sample	sizes	were	as	follows:	Child	health	(baseline	1,059	and	endline	1,266),	and	antenatal	care	
    (baseline	893	and	endline	1254).		


2.3.2	Household	Survey	
25. The	first	round	of	household	data	was	undertaken	during	November-December	2011,	whereas	
    the	second	round	took	place	around	November	2014	-	January	2015,	using	the	same	tools.	The	
    survey	 was	 undertaken	 in	18	 IE	 districts	 (all	of	the	study	districts	in	 six	 of	 the	matched	 district	
    triplets	yielding	information	from	6	RBF	districts,	6	C1	districts,	and	6	C2	districts).		
    	
26. For	 statistical	 purposes,	 each	 district	 in	 Zambia	 is	 subdivided	 into	 Census	 Supervisory	 Areas	
    (CSAs),	 which	 in	 turn	 nests	 Standard	 Enumeration	 Areas	 (SEAs).	 Thus,	 for	 data	 collection	
    purposes,	 the	 SEA	 is	 the	 smallest	 geographical	 unit	 above	 the	 household	 and	 is	 the	 primary	
    sampling	 unit	 (PSU).	 The	 SEAs	 were	 sampled	 from	 the	 catchment	 areas	 of	 selected	 health	
    facilities.	 The	 sampling	 frame	 of	 SEAs	 in	 each	 treatment	 arm	 was	 arrived	 at	 by	 digitally	
    overlaying	 SEA	 maps	 (obtained	 from	 the	 CSO)	 with	 health	 facility	 catchment	 area	 maps.	 After	
    grouping	 the	 PSUs	 by	 stratum	 (treatment	 vs	 control),	 the	 sample	 was	 then	 selected	 in	 two	
    stages:	 i)	 selection	 of	 PSUs	 in	 the	 first	 stage	 using	 probability	 proportional	 to	 size,	 and	 ii)	
    selection	of	10	eligible	households,	or	secondary	sampling	units	(SSUs),	in	the	second	stage	using	
    systematic	 random	 sampling.	 Prior	 to	 household	 selection,	 a	 full	 PSU	 listing	 of	 eligible	
    households	(households	with	a	pregnancy	related	outcome,	i.e.	live	birth,	stillbirth,	abortion	and	
    miscarriage	within	the	two	years	prior	to	the	survey)	was	undertaken	by	the	survey	team	in	each	
    cluster.	 At	 baseline,	 3,064	 households	 in	 the	 relevant	 districts	 were	 surveyed	 at	 baseline,	 and	
    3,500	households	at	follow	up.	
    	
27. The	household	survey	included	questions	on	coverage	of	ante-natal,	post-partum	and	post-natal	
    care,	 child	 health,	 delivery	 outcomes,	 family	 planning,	 and	 general	 health-seeking	 behaviour,	
    mothers’	knowledge	of	healthcare,	as	well	as	out-of-pocket	expenditure.	
	
2.3.3	Estimation	of	standard	errors	for	highly	clustered	population	level	outcomes	
28. The	 evaluation	 design	 for	 the	 Zambia	 RBF	 pilot	 involved	 pair-matched	 randomization	 at	 the	
    district	level.	Randomization	at	the	district	level	does	come	with	potential	inferential	cost	in	the	
    power	 of	 the	 analysis	 as	 the	 number	 of	 units	 of	 randomization	 is	 limited.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 the	
    Zambia	RBF,	the	RBF	and	C1	interventions	were	each	piloted	in	10	districts	around	the	country	
    However	 due	 to	 budgetary	 limitations,	 population	 data	 was	 only	 able	 to	 be	 collected	 in	 six	
    districts	in	each	study	arm.	The	main	report	estimates	standard	errors	for	impact	estimates	by	
    clustering	at	the	PSU	level.	However,	as	implied	above,	there	may	be	unobserved	influences	at	
    the	 district	 level	 that	 lead	 to	 district-level	 correlations	 in	 impacts	 that	 ideally	 should	 be	
    accounted	for.	However,	this	presents	two	analytic	difficulties.	
    	
29. The	first	difficulty	is	the	fact	of	relatively	few	study	units	for	the	analysis.	Besides	the	challenge	
    to	 inferential	 power	 by	 the	 relatively	 few	 number	 of	 study	 units,	 traditional	 approaches	 to	
    standard	 error	 estimates,	 notably	 the	 cluster-robust	 standard	 error,	 may	 be	 downward	 biased	

                                                       18	
         	
    and	 thus	 over-reject	 the	 null	 hypothesis	 of	 no	 treatment	 effect	 (Cameron	 et	 al.,	 2008).	 To	
    counteract	 this	 potential	 bias,	 the	 precision	 of	 statistical	 tests	 can	 also	 be	 assessed	 through	
    Randomization	Inference	(RI)	which	assumes	all	observed	outcomes	and	covariates	to	be	fixed	
    and	generates	the	reference	distribution	of	test	statistics	by	modelling	the	treatment	assignation	
    as	 the	 sole	 random	 variable	 in	 the	 data	 (Ernst,	 2005).	 RI	 compares	 the	 actual	 point	 estimate	
    observed	 in	 the	 evaluation	 against	 the	 distribution	 of	 all	 conceivable	 point	 estimates	 as	
    determined	 through	 permutation	 methods	 –	 where	 the	 actual	 statistic	 falls	 in	 this	 distribution	
    determines	the	exact	p-value.	This	one-tailed	hypothesis	test	is	considered	an	exact	test	because	
    it	 does	 not	 require	 a	 large-sample	 approximation	 as	 randomization	 itself	 is	 the	 basis	 for	
    inference	and	permutation	methods	have	exhausted	all	possible	treatment	assignations	across	
    districts.	An	exact	test	has	the	added	benefit	that	it	does	not	impose	distributional	assumptions	
    that	are	often	behind	approximations	of	reference	distributions	in	standard	hypothesis	testing.	
	
30. For	 population	 level	 impacts,	 this	 report	 will	 present	 the	 exact	 p-values	 estimated	 through	
    randomization	inference	(as	well	as	compare	them	with	the	asymptotic	p-values	estimated	with	
    clustering	 at	 the	 PSU	 level	 in	 Appendix	 4).	 The	 tables	 show	 that	 indeed	 the	 precision	 of	 the	
    inference	 is	 not	 as	 great	 with	 the	 exact	 p-values.	 Many	 impacts,	 if	 they	 were	 estimated	 with	
    incorrect	 asymptotic	 standard	 errors	 would	 indeed	 be	 found	 to	 be	 precise.	 This	 raises	 the	
    question	 of	 the	 acceptable	 level	 of	 precision	 for	 impacts	 to	 inform	 policy	 when	 an	 evaluation	
    does	 not	 have	 high	 power.	 Given	 the	 that	 the	 first	 pilot	 of	 RBF	 in	 Zambia	 faced	 various	
    implementation	 challenges,	 population	 data	 was	 unable	 to	 be	 collected	 on	 a	 broad	 basis,	 and	
    the	international	evidence	base	for	RBF	mechanisms	comprises	only	a	handful	of	countries,	this	
    report	 argues	 that	 policy	 makers	 should	 consider	 exact	 p-values	 larger	 than	 traditional	 cut-off	
    levels,	 say	 on	 the	 order	 of	 0.15,	 as	 sufficiently	 precise	 to	 inform	 future	 policy	 directions.	 This	
    report	will	denotate	population	impacts	estimated	with	a	p-value	of	0.15	or	less	with	an	asterisk.	
	
3.	Counter	external	verification		
	
31. To	explore	the	effect	of	likelihood	of	audit/external	verification	of	RBF	results	on	the	accuracy	of	
    reported	data	(third	research	question),	a	“counter	external	verification”	was	conducted.	Health	
    facilities	 in	 the	 RBF	 Intervention	 group	 were	 randomized	 into	 three	 groups	 and	 given	 letters	
    notifying	them	a	varying	likelihood	of	performance	audit	at	the	start	of	the	RBF	project.	The	first	
    group	received	a	letter	indicating	a	100%	likelihood	of	audit,	the	second	group	a	30%	likelihood	
    of	audit,	and	the	third	group	a	10%	likelihood	of	audit.	From	each	category	of	likelihood	of	audit,	
    35	facilities	were	randomly	sampled.	Data	on	all	the	nine	(9)	incentivised	health	facility	output	
    indicators	were	verified	for	the	six-month	period	from	July	01,	2013	to	December	31,	2013.	Key	
    sources	 of	 data	 at	 the	 health	 facility	 level	 were	 the	 Health	 Information	 Aggregation	 (HIA)	 2	
    forms,	tally	sheets,	activity	sheets	and	registers.	These	documents	were	used	to	check	for	errors	
    relating	to	summing,	recording	and	data	entry.		
	
	                                    	



                                                         19	
         	
4.	Cost-effectiveness	analysis	
	
32. To	 complement	 the	 Impact	 Evaluation,	 a	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 was	 conducted	 aimed	 at	
    informing	the	Zambian	Government	and	other	development	partners	on	both	the	relative	costs	
    and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 RBF	 programme.	 Given	 that	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 of	 RBF	 is	
    primarily	designed	to	inform	donors,	development	partners,	and	the	Ministry	of	Health	(MOH)	
    about	 the	 future	 implementation	 or	 expansion	 of	 RBF,	 this	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 used	 a	
    health	 system	 perspective.	 This	 perspective	 considers	 aspects	 that	 are	 the	 most	 relevant	 to	
    decision	 makers	 particularly	 the	 costs	 of	 delivering	 services,	 but	 not	 travel	 expenses	 of	
    consumers	nor	the	economic	cost	of	their	time	in	accessing	services.		
	
4.1	Measurement	of	costs	
33. The	analysis	used	financial	costs	rather	than	economic	costs,	as	financiers	and	implementers	are	
    most	interested	in	returns	from	direct	financial	investments.	The	financial	approach	recognizes	
    that	many	decisions	must	be	made	within	a	time-limited	period.	Within	the	relevant	period,	for	
    government	 facilities,	 most	 personnel,	 equipment,	 and	 building	 expenditures	 are	 fixed	 costs,	
    while	 many	 consumables	 are	 variable	 costs.	 Thus	 for	 the	 cost	 analysis,	 we	 included	 RBF	
    programme	costs,	which	include	costs	incurred	by	the	World	Bank	for	designing,	implementing	
    and	monitoring	the	RBF	programme	and	costs	of	consumables	(drugs	and	supplies).	
	
34. Programme	costs,	which	were	primarily	for	administration	of	the	RBF	programme	and	incentive	
    payments,	were	obtained	from	the	World	Bank	Zambia	office.	The	programme	costs	allocated	to	
    both	 the	 RBF	 and	 C1	 groups	 were	 based	 on	 the	 administrative	 records	 of	 the	 Project	
    Management	Unit	(PMU)	at	the	 MOH.	The	World	Bank’s	headquarters	costs	were	allocated	to	
    the	 RBF	 and	 C1	 groups	 in	 proportion	 to	 the	 programme	 costs.	 Costs	 of	 consumables	 such	 as	
    drugs	 and	 supplies,	 were	 obtained	 from	 a	 data	 set	 compiled	 by	 Medical	 Stores	 Limited	 (MSL)	
    from	January	2011	through	June	2014,	with	January	2011	to	March	2012	(5	quarters)	as	pre-RBF	
    period	 and	 April	 2012	 to	 June	 2014	 as	 post-RBF	 period	 (9	 quarters).	 The	 cost	 of	 consumables	
    were	calculated	as	cost	per	population	per	quarter,	and	then	a	difference	in	differences	(DIDs)	
    approach	 was	 used	 to	 determine	 the	 incremental	 costs	 of	 consumables.	 All	 the	 costs	 were	
    measured	in	US	dollars	during	the	project	implementation	period	(April	2012	to	October	2014).	
	

4.2	Measurement	of	effectiveness	
35. To	estimate	effectiveness,	the	IE	team	obtained	the	results	from	both	the	household	and	health	
    facility	surveys	from	the	impact	evaluation,	and	selected	those	related	to	the	RBF	incentives	that	
    appeared	to	have	improved	as	determined	using	a	difference-in-difference	(DID)	approach.	This	
    included	 MCH	 services	 such	 as	 ANC,	 PNC,	 institutional	 delivery,	 IPT,	 family	 planning,	 and	
    immunization.	 Out	 of	 all	 family	 planning	 methods,	 we	 observed	 that	 the	 use	 of	 injectable	
    contraceptives	 had	 improved	 substantially,	 based	 on	 facility	 reported	 data,	 and	 hence	 was	
    included	 in	 the	 analysis.	 We	 converted	 the	 utilization	 of	 injectable	 to	 the	 population	 coverage	
    based	on	the	population	of	reproductive	age	in	the	catchment	area	of	health	facilities	and	the	
    expected	 use	 of	 injectable	 per	 year	 (4	 times	 a	 year).	 The	 calculated	 national	 coverage	 of	
    injectable	was	21.9%	in	2014,	which	is	close	to	the	estimate	of	19.3%	from	the	2013/14	Zambia	


                                                      20	
        	
    Demographic	 and	 Health	 Survey	 (CSO	 et	 al,	 2014).	 Most	 changes	 in	 curative	 services	 and	
    HIV/AIDS	 services,	 as	 reported	 by	 the	 facility,	 were	 not	 statistically	 significant	 and	 thus	 were	
    excluded	from	the	analysis.	
    	
36. The	Lives	Saved	Tool	(LiST)	was	used	to	convert	the	coverage	of	health	services	to	the	number	of	
    lives	saved	(Avenir	Health,	2015).	The	LiST	tool	has	been	widely	applied	in	projecting	the	health	
    impact	 of	 interventions	 and	 is	 advocated	 by	 the	 United	 Nations	 Children’s	 Fund	 (UNICEF)	 for	
    decision	making	(Stenberg	et	al,	2014;	Boschi-Pinto	et	al,	2010;	Singh	et	al,	2014).	To	set	up	the	
    LiST	model	for	all	control	groups,	the	baseline	coverage	for	control	groups	was	adjusted	to	the	
    same	level	as	the	RBF	group,	and	the	endline	coverage	of	services	was	also	adjusted	accordingly	
    to	reflect	the	pure	impact	from	DIDs.	These	baseline	and	endline	coverages	of	selected	services	
    were	used	as	inputs	to	the	LiST	to	estimate	the	number	of	lives	saved.		
         	
37. RBF	is	also	expected	to	improve	quality	of	the	care.	The	quality	of	care	was	assessed	from	two	
    rounds	of	the	health	facility	survey,	which	measured	general	quality,	clinical	process,	availability	
    of	drugs	and	suppliers,	availability	of	equipment,	and	availability	of	qualified	human	resources.	
    The	IE	team	convened	a	Delphi	panel	with	11	experts	with	expertise	of	epidemiology	and	clinical	
    medicine	 in	 Zambia	 in	 November	 2014	 to	 determine	 the	 relative	 importance	 of	 each	 quality	
    component,	and	generated	a	quality	index	(ranging	from	0	to	1)	for	each	service.	We	conducted	
    two	 rounds	 of	 a	 Delphi	 survey	 and	 used	 the	 results	 from	 the	 second	 round	 for	 the	 analysis.	
    Figure	3	shows	the	relative	importance	of	each	quality	component	for	different	services.

38. The	IE	team	used	the	same	expert	panel	to	estimate	the	health	impact	of	the	quality	of	care	to	
    generate	a	health-effect	index	using	a	quadratic	function	(See	Figure	4).	The	quadratic	function	
    was	 used	 because	 of	 its	 flexibility	 to	 accommodate	 concave	 up,	 concave	 down,	 and	 linear	

                                                                           21

                                by	 multiplying	 the	 health-effect	 index	 by	 the	 coverage	 of	 corresponding	 services	 from	 the	
                                household	or	health	facility	survey.	The	result	was	treated	as	quality	adjusted	coverage	to	feed

4.3	Cost-effectiveness	analysis	
39. The	IE	team	used	key	parameters	from	the	Zambia	data	preloaded	in	the	LiST	tool	(e.g.	the	age	
    structure	 of	 the	 population),	 and	 adjusted	 the	 population	 size	 to	 the	 size	 of	 the	 catchment	
    population	in	the	RBF	group.	The	LiST	tool	produced	the	number	of	lives	saved	from	improved	
    intervention.	We	converted	it	into	quality-adjusted	life	years	(QALYs)	employing	the	formula	for	
    fatal	cases	(Sassi,	2006)	using	Zambia’s	life	table	(WHO,	2015a;	2015b).	Due	to	the	difference	of	
    population	sizes	for	costs,	the	IE	team	calculated	incremental	costs	and	effectiveness	per	capita,	
    and	generated	the	incremental	cost-effectiveness	ratio	(ICER).

40. A	bound	analysis	was	also	conducted	based	on	the	lower	and	upper	bound	of	the	effectiveness	
    of	services	in	terms	of	improvement	of	the	coverage	of	services.	The	lower	bound	estimate	of	
    the	 ICER	 used	 all	 lower	 bounds	 of	 the	 impact	 across	 the	 five	 services	 that	 are	 included	 in	 the	
    analysis,	 while	 the	 upper	 bound	 estimate	 used	 all	 upper	 bounds	 of	 the	 same	 five	 services	 as	
    used	in	lower	bound	estimates.

5.	Results	
	
41. This	 main	 section	 of	 this	 report	 provides	 the	 findings	 and	 conclusions	 on	 the	 first	 research	
    question,	while	the	results	for	questions	2	and	3	are	presented	the	in	Annex.		
	
5.1	Healthcare	coverage	
42. This	 section	 evaluates	 the	 effect	 of	 the	 RBF	 intervention	 on	 key	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	
    outcomes,	using	the	results	of	the	household	survey	with	a	focus	on	indicators	targeted	in	the	
    Fee-For-Service	 Package,	 and	 other	 related	 indicators.	 The	 “impact	 estimate”	 given	 is	 the	
    difference	in	the	change	in	the	outcome	for	households	in	RBF	and	control	districts	between	the	
    baseline	 and	 endline	 household	 surveys,	 controlling	 for	 the	 stratification	 indicator	 of	 pair-
    matched	districts.	The	listed	p-value	can	be	interpreted	as	the	probability	that	the	“true”	impact	
    –	 when	 the	 RBF	 intervention	 is	 compared	 to	 either	 C1	 or	 C2	 –	 is	 equal	 to	 zero.	 As	 explained	
    earlier,	the	Fisher	exact	p-values	are	presented,	and	outcomes	with	a	p-value	less	than	0.15	are	
    indicated	with	an	asterisk.	
    	
Institutional	(In–Facility)	deliveries	and	deliveries	by	skilled	providers		
43. Table	4	conveys	the	mean	values	of	key	delivery	related	outcomes	at	both	baseline	and	endline	
     survey	 periods	 for	 the	 three	 study	 areas:	 RBF,	 C1	 (enhanced	 financing),	 and	 C2	 (observational	
     control).	 Alongside	 the	 mean	 values	 are	 the	 impact	 estimates	 for	 the	 RBF	 programme	 vis-à-vis	
     each	 of	 the	 two	 control	 arms.	 These	 delivery	 outcomes,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 following	 tables	 that	
     convey	antenatal	and	postnatal	care	information,	are	based	on	individual	recall	of	the	mothers	
     for	all	births	within	a	two-year	period	before	the	date	of	interview.	In	other	words,	the	baseline	
     data	seeks	health	information	for	the	two	years	before	programme	onset,	while	the	endline	data	
     seeks	 the	 same	 information	 for	 the	 two-year	 period	 of	 complete	 exposure	 to	 the	 RBF	
     programme.	
     	
44. The	 results	 reveal	 that	 the	 in-facility	 delivery	 rate	 and	 the	 in-facility	 delivery	 rate	 by	 a	 skilled	
     provider	 (with	 skilled	 providers	 defined	 as	 doctor,	 clinical	 officer,	 midwife,	 or	 nurse)	 increased	
     between	 the	 baseline	 and	 endline	 in	 almost	 all	 sets	 of	 districts.	 For	 example,	 in	 RBF	 study	
     districts	the	in-facility	delivery	rate	and	deliveries	assisted	by	a	skilled	provider	rose	from	68%	to	
     82%	and	58%	to	72%	of	all	reported	births,	respectively.	However,	the	rate	of	change	for	these	
     outcomes	 was	 not	 substantially	 pronounced	 for	 the	 districts	 exposed	 to	 the	 RBF	 programme	
     when	compared	with	the	enhanced	financing	study	arm	(C1),	suggesting	minimal	impact	of	this	
     programme	 for	 these	 outcomes	 over	 and	 above	 the	 changes	 seen	 in	 C1.	 For	 example,	 a	
     substantial	relative	rise	in	the	in-facility	delivery	rate	by	12.8-percentage	points	in	the	RBF	arm	
     vis-à-vis	 the	 C2	 (observational	 control)	 was	 lower	 than	 the	 relative	 gain	 in	 the	 enhanced	
     financing	 arm	 (C1)	 which	 recorded	 a	 17.5-percentage	 point	 relative	 gain	 vis-à-vis	 the	 C2	
     (observational	control).	The	same	basic	pattern	holds	for	a	facility	delivery	assisted	by	a	skilled	
     provider	–	the	RBF	arm	records	a	10.1	percentage	point	gain	in	this	measure	while	the	C1	arm	
     records	a	14.2	percentage	point	gain.	While	the	gains	in	C1	in	these	two	measures	are	greater	in	
     magnitude	than	they	are	for	the	RBF	arm,	they	are	not	significantly	different	from	the	RBF	arm	
     at	standard	levels.

ANC	Services	
45. Table	5	provides	summary	indicators	related	to	the	receipt	of	antenatal	care	(ANC)	and	related	
    services.	 Any	 ANC	 was	 already	 quite	 high	 at	 baseline	 in	 Zambia	 (96%-98%)	 and	 rises	 to	 near	
    universal	coverage	by	the	endline	study	period	(99%	in	all	three	areas).	As	a	result,	there	are	few	
    observable	 gains	 in	 ANC	 coverage	 for	 RBF	 districts.	 There	 were	 no	 observable	 gains	 in	 the	 C1	
    study	 district	 for	 any	 of	 these	 measures.	 One	 key	 aspect	 of	 ANC	 coverage	 that	 the	 RBF	 pilot	
    improved	was	the	timing	of	the	first	ANC	visit.	At	baseline,	the	mean	timing	of	the	first	ANC	visit	
    occurred	at	the	fourth	month	of	pregnancy	in	all	study	areas.	After	two	years	of	the	RBF	pilot,	
    the	 timing	 for	 women	 in	 RBF	 areas	 improves	 to	 3.8	 months	 in	 RBF	 areas	 while	 increasing	 to	
    around	4.2	months	in	both	the	C1	and	C2	areas.	This	represents	an	improvement	of	almost	two	
    weeks	in	the	timing	of	first	ANC	in	the	RBF	arm	as	compared	to	the	C1	and	C2	arms.

Postnatal	Care	(PNC)	
46. There	 were	 broad-based	 relative	 gains	 in	 PNC	 coverage,	 as	 summarized	 in	 Table	 6,	 most	 likely	
    driven	to	a	large	degree	by	the	gains	in	the	in-facility	delivery	rate.	However,	the	rate	of	change	
    (for	any	PNC)	was	more	rapid	in	C1	vs	C2	(a	13	percentage	point	increase)	as	compared	to	RBF	vs	
    C2.	While	absolute	gains	in	PNC	are	precisely	estimated	for	C1	vs	C2	this	relative	difference	in	
    effectiveness	between	RBF	vs	C1,	and	RBF	vs	C2	is	not	precisely	estimated.

Contraceptive	Use	
47. With	regard	to	increased	use	of	modern	contraceptive	methods	among	women	of	reproductive	
    age,	Table	7	explores	the	programme	effectiveness	among	the	more	restricted	sample	of	women	
    who	 reside	 in	 household	 that	 have	 reported	 a	 birth	 in	 the	 previous	 2	 years	 before	 survey	 (i.e.	
    those	women	targeted	for	interview	in	the	household	surveys).	The	results	show	that	the	use	of	
    modern	or	any	contraceptive	method	remained	relatively	unchanged	at	endline	as	compared	to	
    the	baseline	across	the	3	study	arms,	but	these	results	were	statistically	insignificant.	However,	
    there	were	more	family	planning	(FP)	outreach	services	being	conducted	in	the	RBF	districts	vis-
    à-vis	the	C2	districts	but	even	greater	in	C1	districts	when	compared	to	both	RBF	and	C2	districts.	
    Note	 that	 this	 population	 is	 a	 non-random	 subset	 of	 all	 women	 on	 reproductive	 age	 and	 thus	
    may	not	represent	population	changes	in	family	planning	usage	as	a	result	of	RBF	or	C1	activities.

Immunization	
48. Table	8	shows	immunization	coverage	by	different	vaccines	and	timing	of	the	vaccination	across	
    the	3	study	arms.	The	results	show	that	full	immunization	coverage	across	all	the	3	study	areas	
    declined,	but	to	a	lesser	degree	in	RBF	districts	suggesting	that	RBF	may	have	been	somewhat	
    protective.	 However,	 the	 relative	 protective	 effects	 are	 not	 precisely	 estimated.	 For	 some	
    measures	 of	 immunization	 coverage	 –	 BCG	 and	 DPT	 vaccines	 –	 RBF	 districts	 performed	
    significantly	 better	 than	 the	 C2	 districts.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 C1	 performed	 better	 than	 C2	
    districts	on	any	vaccination	coverage.

5.2	Quality	of	services	
	
5.2.1	Structural	Quality	

50. This	 section	 evaluates	 the	 status	 of	 infrastructure,	 and	 availability	 of	 essential	 drugs	 and	
    equipment	at	health	facilities.	The	data	was	derived	from	the	two	rounds	of	the	facility	survey	
    conducted	in	RBF	and	control	facilities	at	baseline	and	endline.	The	impact	estimate	given	is	the	
    relative	 change	 in	 indicators	 for	 the	 RBF	 facilities	 compared	 with	 the	 C1	 and	 C2	 facilities	
    between	baseline	and	endline	surveys,	controlling	for	district	level	stratification	variables.	
    	
a)	Status	of	Infrastructure	
    The	 status	 of	 infrastructure	 at	 the	 facilities	 was	 assessed	 through	 direct	 observation.	 Relevant	
    dimensions	of	infrastructure	included	availability	of	power,	water,	tele-communication	systems,	
    disinfectants,	 an	 outpatient	 consultation	 room,	 availability	 of	 key	 elements	 in	 the	 outpatient	
    room	for	optimal	service	delivery,	and	provision	of	biomedical	waste	disposal.	An	infrastructure	
    index	 was	 constructed,	 which	 included	 the	 following	 equally-weighted	 items:	 continuous	
    availability	of	power,	water,	communication	and	disinfectants,	provision	of	sharp	disposal,	and	
    basin	 with	 soap	 and	 water	 in	 outpatient	 room.	 As	 shown	 in	 Table	 10,	 within	 the	 individual	
    infrastructure	 measures	 (variables),	 the	 results	 were	 statistically	 insignificant	 but	 the	
    infrastructure	index	showed	higher	gains	in	the	RBF	facilities	as	compared	to	C2.

Table	11	shows	availability	of	tracer	drugs	at	health	facilities	30	days	prior	to	the	day	of	the	survey.	
Tracer	 drugs	 included	 general	 antibiotics,	 analgesics,	 family	 planning,	 anti-malarials,	 anti-
tuberculosis,	 antiretroviral,	 emergency	 obstetric	 care	 (EMOC),	 vaccines,	 diagnostic	 kits,	 fluids,	 and	
electrolytes.	A	drug	availability	index	was	constructed	assigning	equal	weights	to	the	individual	items	
and	was	further	standardized.	The	items	were	–	Tetracycline	eye	ointment,	Amoxicillin,	Paracetamol,	
Cotrimoxazole,	 Iron	 and	 Folic	 acid,	 Vitamin	 A,	 and	 ORS.	 The	 results	 were	 statistically	 insignificant	
except	for	ACT	and	Amocixillin	tablets.	Availability	of	ACT	drugs	increased	by	27	percentage	points	in	
the	RBF	facilities	as	compared	to	the	C2	facilities	but	availability	of	Amocixillin	tablets	decreased	by	
21	percentage	points	in	the	RBF	facilities	as	compared	to	the	C1	facilities.

compared	 to	 C2	 health	 facilities	 as	 observed	 through	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 overall	 equipment	 index.	
Specific	gains	in	the	RBF	facilities	as	compared	to	the	C2	facilities	were	observed	in	the	availability	of	
infant	 weighing	 scales	 (22	 percentage	 points),	 forceps	 (16	 percentage	 points),	 and	 needle	 holders	
(25	percentage	points).	There	was	also	a	higher	availability	of	tape	measures	in	the	RBF	facilities	vs.	
C1	 facilities	 by	 15	 percentage	 points	 but	 no	 overall	 gain	 was	 observed	 in	 the	 medical	 equipment

d)	Mapping	the	quality	checklist	at	health	facilities	
As	 described	 above,	 during	 the	 RBF	 implementation	 period,	 quality	 assessments	 were	 being	
conducted	 by	 district	 hospitals	 at	 all	 health	 facilities	 on	 a	 quarterly	 basis	 using	 a	 standard	 quality	
checklist	 which	 had	 10	 dimensions	 on	 quality	 improvement.	 The	 quality	 checklist	 which	 was	 being	
used	by	the	district	hospitals	and	the	health	facility	survey	instrument	for	this	IE	overlap	on	several	
items.	 These	 common	 items	 were	 extracted	 from	 the	 health	 facility	 survey	 instrument	 and	 the	
weights	from	the	quality	checklist	were	used	to	construct	a	quality	index.	Standardized	indices	were	
constructed	for	each	quality	dimension.	Table	A3	in	Appendix	3	maps	out	the	common	variables	in	
both	instruments.	Table	13	reveals	that	the	quality	of	delivery	rooms	in	RBF	facilities	was	better	than	
the	delivery	rooms	in	C1	and	C2	districts.	In	addition,	the	quality	of	curative	care	in	RBF	facilities	was	
better	than	in	the	C2	facilities.

5.2.2	Process	Quality	
	
51. This	 section	 summarizes	 the	 relative	 impacts	 of	 RBF	 on	 the	 quality	 of	 care	 provided	 for	
    antenatal,	postnatal	and	child	health	care	services.	There	are	a	number	of	sources	for	this	data:	
    direct	clinical	observations	of	consultations,	exit	interviews	administered	to	patients	as	they	are	
    leaving	 their	 consultations	 and	 recall	 data	 of	 procedures	 received	 from	 the	 household	 survey.	
    Based	on	these	interviews,	client	satisfaction	was	also	estimated.		
    	
a)	Knowledge	of	maternal	health	services	
The	 household	 survey	 also	 measured	 mother’s	 knowledge	 of	 danger	 signs	 during	 pregnancy.	 The	
knowledge	 of	 individual	 danger	 signs,	 conveyed	 in	 Table	 14,	 can	 be	 affected	 through	 contact	 with	
the	health	system	either	at	the	communal	or	facility	level,	including	outreach	programs.	In	terms	of	
effectiveness	 of	 such	 programs	 and	 contact,	 at	 least	 with	 regard	 to	 maternal	 knowledge,	 RBF	
districts	 appear	 to	 be	 somewhat	 effective.	 Women	 residing	 in	 RBF	 districts	 are	 significantly	 more	
likely	to	list	three	out	of	the	12	danger	signs	such	as	severe	pain	or	foetal	stillness	when	compared	
with	C1	districts.	Results	when	compared	with	C2	are	similar.

b)	Maternal	care	
Table	 15	 provides	 recall	 information	 from	 the	 household	 survey	 on	 ANC	 processes	 received	 while	
attending	ANC	services.	The	results	show	some	gains	in	process	quality	of	ANC	in	the	RBF	districts	in	


                                                                30	
          	
some	of	the	indicators	assessed.	This	is	for	provision	of	a	tetanus	injection	(vs	C1);	and	any	iron	and	
malaria	drugs	taken	which	exhibited	a	higher	relative	gain	in	RBF	communities	than	C2	communities.	
In	most	of	the	other	indicators,	there	was	a	relative	decline	in	RBF	communities	as	compared	to	C1	
and	C2	communities	which	includes:	receiving	a	urine	test	during	pregnancy,	number	of	days	of	iron	
supplementation	by	pregnant	women,	and	testing	of	blood	(vs	C1).	On	the	other	hand,	blood	testing	
and	 any	 iron	 taken	 shows	 relatively	 higher	 gains	 in	 C1	 communities	 when	 compared	 with	 C2	
communities	(although	any	tetanus	is	lower).

Table	 16	 presents	 similar	 quality	 measures	 for	 ANC,	 but	 measured	 using	 patient	 exit	 interviews	
conducted	as	patients	left	health	facilities	during	the	health	facility	survey.	Participants	were	asked	a	
series	of	questions	as	to	whether	certain	ANC	services	were	performed	during	their	visit.	The	items	
were	summed	to	create	a	composite	score	for	the	number	of	ANC	services	that	were	performed	and	
then	converted	to	z-scores.	Finally,	a	dichotomous	variable	was	created	to	measure	if	all	of	the	ANC	
services	were	completed	for	each	participant.	This	variable	was	standardized	before	use	in	the	final	
analyses.	 The	 results	 show	 that	 more	 women	 reported	 to	 have	 received	 advice	 on	 diet	 (14	
percentage	points)	in	RBF	as	compared	to	C1	facilities.	In	addition,	compared	to	C2	facilities,	more	
women	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 reported	 to	 have	 had	 their	 abdomen	 measured	 (9	 percentage	 points)	 and	
palpated	 (12	 percentage	 points).	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 women	 who	 attended	 C1	 facilities	 received	
explanations	 on	 the	 side	 effects	 of	 iron	 folic	 acid	 tablets	 (15	 percentage	 points)	 as	 compared	 to	
those	who	went	to	RBF	facilities.

Table	17	presents	results	on	the	process	quality	of	postnatal	coverage.	The	RBF	appears	to	have	had	
no	 positive	 effect	 on	 the	 process	 quality	 of	 postnatal	 care,	 except	 that	 rates	 of	 immediate	 breast-
feeding	are	significantly	higher	when	compared	with	C2.	The	results	show	a	relatively	larger	gain	in	
C1	districts	both	in	terms	of	Vitamin	A	given	soon	after	delivery	and	in	the	immediate	initiation	of	
breastfeeding	when	compared	with	RBF	and,	especially,	C2	districts.

c)	Child	health	care	
Quality	 of	 child	 care	 was	 measured	 through	 patient	 exit	 interviews	 (Table	 18).	 Participants	 were	
asked	a	series	of	questions	as	to	whether	certain	child	care	services	were	conducted	during	the	visit.	
The	six	items	were	summed	to	create	a	composite	score	for	the	number	of	child	care	services	that	
were	performed.	Finally,	a	dichotomous	variable	was	created	to	measure	if	all	five	of	the	child	care	
services	were	completed.	This	variable	was	standardized	before	use	in	final	analyses.	The	data	for	all	
the	 variables	 (except	 for	 plotted	 on	 a	 growth	 chart	 –	 RBF	 vs	 C1)	 are	 statistically	 insignificant	
suggesting	 that	 there	 are	 no	 differences	 in	 the	 quality	 of	 child	 health	 care	 as	 determined	 through	
exit	interviews.

d)	Client	satisfaction	
This	 section	 summarizes	 the	 effect	 of	 the	 intervention	 on	 client	 satisfaction	 in	 antenatal	 care	 and	
child	 health	 care	 as	 measured	 through	 patient	 exit	 interviews.	 Participants	 were	 asked	 to	 rate	
whether	the	overall	quality	of	the	services	was	satisfactory	on	a	Likert	scale	(1=strongly	disagree	to	
5=strongly	 agree).	 Table	 19	 shows	 that	 most	 of	 the	 results	 were	 statistically	 insignificant	 but	 RBF	
health	facilities	had	relatively	more	ANC	clients	who	reported	that	health	workers	spent	sufficiently	
more	time	during	consultations	with	patients	as	compared	to	both	C1	and	C2	health	facilities.	There	
was	also	more	trust	in	health	workers	operating	in	RBF	facilities	as	compared	with	C1	for	both	ANC	
and	child	care	services	(Tables	19	and	20).

52. Figure	5	compares	the	proportion	of	the	GRZ	grant11	to	the	RBF	grant	in	the	RBF	health	facilities	
    during	 the	 RBF	 implementation	 period.	 The	 idea	 was	 to	 track	 the	 growth	 of	 the	 RBF	 grant	
    against	the	GRZ	grant	and	to	establish	whether	there	was	any	aid	fungibility12	or	substitution	of	
    financing.	 The	 data	 shows	 that	 in	 proportion	 to	 the	 RBF	 grant,	 the	 GRZ	 grant	 declined	 by	 half	
    from	26%	in	2012	to	13%	in	2014.	The	data	further	shows	that	the	RBF	grant	was	growing	faster	
    than	the	GRZ	grant.	The	RBF	grant	grew	by	230%	between	2012	and	2013,	and	by	34%	between	
    2013	and	2014.	Meanwhile,	the	GRZ	grant	grew	by	171%	between	2012	and	2013,	and	declined	
    by	18%	between	2013	and	2014.

5.3.2	Level	of	RBF	revenue,	RBF	vs	C1	
	
53. The	study	was	designed	to	equalize	total	RBF	financing	between	health	facilities	in	RBF	districts	
    and	C1	districts	to	rule	out	the	“money”	effect.	Actual	RBF	financing	was	tracked	by	the	 study	
    and	 found	 divergences	 between	 intended	 and	 actual	 financing	 received	 in	 the	 C1	 arm.	 These	
    divergences	 were	 largely	 due	 to	 the	 available	 disbursement	 mechanisms	 used	 to	 reach	 C1	
    facilities.	 C1	 districts	 were	 using	 a	 financing	 system	 where	 the	 RBF	 matching	 grant	 was	 being	
    channelled	 through	 the	 District	 Medical	 Office	 (DMO)	 for	 further	 disbursement	 to	 health	
    facilities	under	each	district,	unlike	in	the	RBF	districts	which	did	not	use	the	DMO	as	a	channel.	
    In	 addition,	 money	 disbursed	 to	 the	 health	 facilities	 in	 C1	 districts	 was	 required	 to	 be	 retired	
    before	replenishment.	This	was	contrary	to	health	facilities	in	the	RBF	arm	were	RBF	payments	
    were	disbursed	directly	in	the	health	centre	bank	accounts’	and	no	retirements	were	required.		
    	
54. As	a	consequence,	health	facilities	in	the	C1	districts	did	not	receive	the	same	amounts	as	the	
    RBF	districts	due	to	delayed	retirement	and	low	absorptive	capacity.	As	such,	the	input	financing	
    (C1)	arm	only	received	38%	in	2012,	43%	in	2013,	and	78%	in	2014	as	compared	to	the	RBF	arm.	
    The	overall	disbursement	for	all	C1	districts	was	56%	(from	April	2012	to	October	2014)	and	thus	
    not	at	par	with	the	RBF	arm	as	expected.	This	is	shown	on	Figure	6	below.	This	divergence	from	
    the	 intended	 design	 is	 important	 to	 note	 as	 results	 on	 the	 relative	 effectiveness	 and	 cost-

5.3.3	Allocation	and	use	of	RBF	funds,	RBF	vs	C1	
	
a)	Allocation	and	use	of	the	RBF	performance	grants	in	RBF	Health	Facilities		
In	order	to	help	interpret	the	findings,	it	is	useful	to	review	study	information	on	the	use	of	funds	in	
the	RBF	and	C1	districts	at	health	facility	level.	Health	facilities	in	the	RBF	districts	were	allowed	to	
use	 a	 maximum	 of	 60%	 of	 their	 RBF	 funds	 for	 staff	 incentives,	 and	 a	 minimum	 of	 40%	 for	
investments	 and	 other	 recurrent/operational	 costs	 at	 the	 health	 facilities	 and	 communities.	 In	
reality,	 the	 percentages	 allocated	 varied	 by	 health	 facility,	 both	 across	 districts	 and	 over	 time.	 For	
example,	in	2012,	almost	all	the	health	facilities	didn’t	spend	on	staff	incentives	which	explains	why	
the	proportion	of	RBF	funds	used	for	RBF	staff	incentives	was	only	0.7%,	and	the	proportion	of	RBF	
staff	incentives	to	GRZ	staff	salaries	0.1%	(Figure	7).	Overall,	health	facilities	in	the	RBF	intervention	
group	 allocated	 47%	 of	 the	 total	 RBF	 funds	 for	 staff	 incentives,	 and	 53%	 for	 investments	 between	
April	2012	and	October	2014,	the	full	Zambia	HRBF	implementation	period	(Figure	7).		
	
The	53%	which	was	spent	on	investment	in	the	RBF	districts	was	generally	used	for	the	purchase	of	
medical	 and	 non-medical	 goods	 and	 services.	 This	 included	 RPR	 test	 kits,	 surgical	 gloves,	 BP	
machines,	stethoscope,	digital	thermometers,	urine	sticks,	suction	tubes,	cord	clamps,	and	EDTA	and	
BDTA	 bottles;	 food	 and	 beddings	 for	 in-patients;	 cleaning	 materials;	 maintenance	 of	 buildings,	
bicycles,	and	motorbikes;	transport	for	outreach	activities	and	referrals	(taxi	and	bus	fares,	fuel,	and	
hire/purchase	 of	 new	 motor	 bikes	 and	 bicycles);	 office	 supplies	 and	 furniture;	 kitchen	 utensils;	
meetings;	 construction	 of	 maternity	 shelters;	 uniforms	 and	 dust	 coats;	 hiring	 of	 additional	 labour	
(mostly	 data	 clerks	 but	 also	 nurses	 and	 midwives	 in	 some	 cases);	 humpers/motivational	 packs	 for	
traditional	birth	attendants	(TBAs)	and	mothers;	cash	for	TBAs	and	other	community	members;	and	
electricity/energy	(solar	panels,	batteries,	inventers,	and	power	generators).		
	


                                                                  36	
                       	
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 RBF	 design,	 the	 amount	 which	 was	 received	 by	 each	 member	 of	 staff	 was	
dependent	on	the	individual’s	performance	scores,	actual	RBF	income	realized,	investment	priorities,	
the	number	and	composition	of	staff	at	the	health	facility,	and	individual	salary	levels.	As	such,	RBF	
staff	incentives	(bonuses)	increased	the	total	income	for	all	health	workers	at	the	RBF	health	facility	
albeit	 by	 different	 margins/percentages.	However,	 the	 proportion	 of	 RBF	 staff	 incentives	 to	
government	staff	salaries	was	only	about	10%	during	the	entire	duration	of	the	project	(Figure	7).

b)	Allocation	and	use	of	the	RBF	matching	grant	in	C1	Health	Facilities		
The	 RBF	 matching	 grants	 which	 were	 disbursed	 to	 C1	 districts	 had	 some	 restrictions	 on	 their	
spending	namely:	a)	Resources	could	only	be	used	for	meal	allowances	or	per	diems	according	to	the	
number	 of	 days	 worked,	 and	 b)	 activities	 had	 to	 be	 related	 to	 the	 delivery	 of	 maternal	 and	 child	
health	interventions	at	health	facility	level.	The	manner	in	which	health	facilities	in	C1	districts	used	
the	RBF	matching	grant	was	also	dependant	on	how	much	was	disbursed	to	the	health	facility	by	the	
DMO.	In	some	C1	districts,	part	of	the	RBF	matching	grants	were	used	for	centralized	procurements	
on	behalf	of	the	health	centres	to	cover	the	costs	of	supervision	visits,	and	the	balance	distributed	to	
health	centres	on	a	per	capita	basis	for	expenditure	on	cleaning	materials,	stationary,	medical,	fuel	
and	non-medical	items,	meal	allowances,	and	incentivizing	patients	to	come	to	health	facilities.	This	
money	was	treated	as	imprest,	meaning	that	all	health	centres	in	a	district	had	to	retire	the	money	


                                                       37	
             	
at	the	DMO	before	the	end	of	the	quarter.	This	would	then	allow	the	DMO	to	submit	a	consolidated	
financial	report	to	the	MOH	to	trigger	the	release	of	the	next	allocation.		
	
Due	to	these	parameters	and/or	restrictions,	most	of	the	health	facilities	found	it	difficult	to	use	all	
the	money	which	was	disbursed	to	them,	and	in	turn,	the	DMOs	also	failed	to	submit	consolidated	
financial	 reports	 to	 the	 MOH	 to	 prompt	 the	 replenishment	 of	 funds.	 In	 other	 C1	 districts,	 RBF	
matching	grants	were	not	disbursed	to	health	centres	at	all	and	the	DMOs	decided	what	to	buy	for	
the	 health	 centres	 including	 motor	 cycles,	 mass	 campaigns,	 meal	 allowances	 for	 district	 staff	 and	
volunteers,	health	facility	maintenance,	and	medical	and	non-medical	items.		
	
5.3.4	Governance	and	managerial	autonomy	at	health	facilities	
55. Use	 of	 communities	 in	 the	 management	 and	 delivery	 of	 health	 services	 is	 one	 of	 the	 key	
    strategies	highlighted	in	Zambia’s	National	Health	Strategic	Plan	(2001-2016)	aimed	at	improving	
    accountability	 and	 transparency	 is	 resource	 use	 and	 service	 delivery.	 This	 strategy	 has	 been	 in	
    place	since	1991/2,	and	over	the	years,	representative	structures	(such	as	Neighbourhood	and	
    Health	 Centre	 Committees)	 have	 been	 established	 in	 communities	 and	 are	 linked	 to	 health	
    centres.	 This	 sub-section	 explores	 whether	 the	 RBF	 strengthened	 community	 participation,	
    supervision,	 performance	 assessment,	 and	 managerial	 autonomy	 at	 health	 centre	 levels.	 Table	
    21	 suggests	 that	 health	 centre	 committees	 were	 more	 active	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 (vs.	 C2)	 as	 they	
    reported	a	significantly	higher	number	of	meetings	(1.26	more	meetings	per	year	on	average).	
    And	 in	 comparison	 with	 both	 C1	 and	 C2	 facilities,	 RBF	 facilities	 also	 reported	 more	 frequent	
    assessment	 of	 staff	 performance,	 and	 a	 higher	 number	 of	 performance	 assessment	 at	 health	
    facilities.	District	hospitals	also	conducted	more	supervisory	visits	in	RBF	than	C1	facilities.

56. Another	design	feature	of	the	RBF	programme	was	to	introduce	more	managerial	autonomy	and	
    devolved	decision	making	at	health	facilities.	These	dimensions	of	management	were	tracked	in	
    the	evaluation	as	facilities	were	interviewed	about	the	level	of	autonomy	during	the	follow	up	
    survey.	 The	 questions	 were	 related	 to	 the	 perceived	 autonomy	 of	 the	 facility	 in-charge	 on	
    assigning	 task	 to	 staff,	 allocating	 budget,	 provision	 of	 services,	 and	 obtaining	 resources.	 The	
    responses	 were	 recorded	 on	 a	 Likert	 Scale	 with	 values	 ranging	 from	 1	 (least	 autonomy)	 to	 5	
    (maximum	 autonomy).	 Responses	 were	 then	 converted	 to	 a	 binary	 scale	 where	 higher	 scores	


                                                               39	
          	
     than	 neutral	 (4	 and	5)	 were	 coded	 1	 and	 zero	 otherwise.	An	 autonomy	 index	 was	 constructed	
     utilizing	selected	elements	of	autonomy	such	as	ability	to	allocate	resources	and	tasks	effectively	
     within	 the	 facility.	 The	 index	 was	 further	 standardized.	 As	 shown	 in	 Table	 22,	 apart	 from	 the	
     overall	autonomy	index,	only	two	(2)	of	the	individual	measures	of	autonomy	were	statistically	
     significant.	 RBF	 facilities	 (vs.	 C2)	 reported	 significantly	 higher	 autonomy	 on	 service	 provision,	
     clarity	on	policies	and	procedures	for	doing	things	as	well	as	the	overall	autonomy	index.

5.3.5	Satisfaction	and	motivation	of	the	health	workers		
57. This	section	outlines	key	findings	related	to	human	resources	for	health,	specifically	a	focus	on	
    job	 satisfaction	 and	 motivation	 of	 the	 health	 workers	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 compared	 with	 control	
    facilities.	 For	 each	 outcome,	 the	 impact	 estimate	 given	 is	 the	 difference	 in	 the	 change	 in	 the	
    outcome	for	health	workers	in	RBF	and	control	districts	between	the	baseline	and	endline	facility	
    surveys,	including	facility-level	fixed	effects	as	well	as	linear	controls	for	worker	age,	gender,	and	
    cadre.	
    	
58. Job	 satisfaction	 is	 measured	 using	 a	 method	 based	 on	 two	 existing	 validated	 tools,	 the	
    Minnesota	 Satisfaction	 Questionnaire	 and	 the	 Job	 Satisfaction	 survey.	 This	 contains	 numerous	
    satisfaction-related	 questions	 recorded	 on	 a	 five-point	 Likert	 scale.	 During	 the	 analysis,	
    responses	to	each	question	were	normalized	to	a	100%	scale	and	then	questions	were	grouped	
    by	 thematic	 area,	 including	 relationship	 between	 staff	 and	 outside,	 working	 conditions,	
    compensation,	 recognition	 and	 career	 development.	 Equal	 weights	 were	 assigned	 to	 all	

                                                               40	
          	
    questions	 within	 a	 thematic	 area.	 Motivation	 measures	 were	 constructed	 in	 a	 similar	 way,	 but	
    with	a	different	set	of	items,	relating	to	‘intrinsic	motivation’	and	‘extrinsic	motivation’.	Intrinsic	
    motivation	 includes	 ‘self-concept’,	 namely	 an	 individual’s	 perception	 of	 his	 or	 her	 ability	 to	
    perform,	 and	 ‘well-being’	 which	 is	 often	 motivated	 by	 financial	 gain.	 Extrinsic	 motivation	
    includes	team	work,	autonomy	of	staff,	working	environment,	recognition	of	staff	and	leadership	
    of	facilities.	
         	
59. Table	23	shows	that	the	pilot	RBF	intervention	increases	the	compensation-related	component	
    of	job	satisfaction,	implying	that	workers	were	more	likely	to	feel	adequately	remunerated	for	
    their	work.	This	was	not	true	for	comparisons	between	C1	and	C2.	There	were	also	slight	gains	in	
    satisfaction	 with	 work	 conditions	 and	 opportunities	 when	 RBF	 is	 compared	 with	 C2.	 No	 other	
    differences	were	statistically	significant.	On	Table	24,	all	the	results	related	to	worker	motivation	
    are	 statistically	 insignificant	 except	 for	 well-being	 where	 the	 RBF	 performed	 better	 than	 C2	
    facilities.

63. Table	 26	 shows	 the	 coverage	 and	 quality	 of	 the	 key	 maternal	 health	 services	 at	 baseline	 and	
    endline	 from	 the	 household	 and	 health	 facility	 surveys.	 Comparing	 RBF	 with	 C1,	 there	 was	 a	
    statistically	 significant	 difference	 in	 Hib	 vaccination	 and	 use	 of	 family	 planning,	 where	 the	 RBF	
    districts	had	higher	utilization	than	C1	districts.	In	comparison	to	C2,	the	major	improvement	in	
    the	 RBF	 group	 was	 in	 the	 provision	 of	 institutional	 deliveries	 (12·2%),	 PNC	 (7·8%),	 IPT	 (3.0%),	
    vaccinations	 (BCG,	 DPT,	 and	 HIB)	 ranging	 from	 5.5%	 to	 19·1%)	 and	 family	 planning	 (19·5%).	
    However,	C1	districts	had	a	significantly	greater	improvement	in	institutional	deliveries	(17.6%),	
    PNC	(13.5%),	and	DPT	(6.4%).		
    	
64. With	regards	to	quality	of	key	maternal	health	services,	compared	to	C1	districts,	RBF	showed	a	
    positive	impact	on	the	quality	of	care	in	institutional	delivery	(0·7%),	vaccination	(3·2%)	and	FP	
    (4·9%).	Compared	to	C2	districts,	RBF	showed	the	greatest	improvement	in	the	quality	of	care,	
    by	 3·1%	 for	 institutional	 delivery,	 2·9%	 for	 ANC,	 3·8%	 for	 vaccination,	 and	 9·7%	 for	 family	
    planning.	However,	C1	districts	also	had	an	improvement	in	quality	of	care	in	comparison	with	
    C2	 districts	 but	 at	 a	 much	 lower	 level	 of	 achievement	 than	 RBF	 districts.	 This	 is	 with	 the	
    exception	of	quality	improvement	in	PNC	where	the	C1	districts	achieved	better	results	against	
    the	C2	districts	than	what	the	RBF	districts	achieved	against	C2	districts.

6.	Discussion	and	Conclusion		
	
69. The	 Zambia	 RBF	 pilot	 programme	 was	 designed	 to	 strengthen	 the	 health	 system	 and	 improve	
    the	 coverage	 and	 quality	 of	 MCH	 related	 health	 services.	 A	 prospective	 quantitative	 impact	
    evaluation	 assessed	 the	 effectiveness,	 and	 cost-effectiveness	 of	 the	 RBF	 pilot.	 This	 section	
    summarizes	the	key	results	and	lessons	learnt	from	this	exercise.	Two	additional	policy	questions	
    –	 on	 the	 level	 of	 incentives	 and	 the	 likelihood	 of	 audit,	 which	 were	 also	 part	 of	 the	 overall	
    evaluation,	are	discussed	in	detail	in	the	appendices.		
    	
70. The	 RBF	 was	 designed	 to	 have	 a	 positive	 effect	 on	 the	 quantity	 and	 quality	 of	 targeted	 MCH	
    services,	and	functionality	of	the	health	system.	The	evaluation	investigated	the	impact	over	a	
    broad	 range	 of	 targeted	 and	 non-targeted	 indicators	 related	 to	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	
    services.	 Of	 the	 nine	 indicators	 directly	 targeted	 by	 the	 RBF	 programme	 through	 the	 incentive	
    structure,	seven	were	directly	measured	or	proxied	in	the	population.13	Some	of	the	measures	
    responded	to	the	RBF	intervention,	with	a	broadly	similar	set	also	showing	improvements	under	
    the	enhanced	financing	arm	(C1).	Most	notably,	institutional	deliveries	(in-facility	delivery	rate)	
    in	 RBF	 districts	 increased	 by	 approximately	 13	 percentage	 points	 relative	 to	 the	 pure	 control	
    districts	 (C2).	 The	 same	 indicator	 rose	 by	 18	 percentage	 points	 in	 C1	 districts	 relative	 to	 C2,	
    suggesting	 larger	 gains	 for	 this	 indicator	 in	 the	 enhanced/input	 financing	 arm.	 Results	 for	
    deliveries	by	skilled	providers	also	show	improvements	in	both	the	RBF	and	C1	districts	relative	
    to	 C2,	 but	 the	 C1	 arm	 had	 greater	 magnitude.	 The	 higher	 magnitude	 in	 C1	 districts	 for	
    institutional	deliveries	and	skilled	birth	attendance	suggests	relative	effectiveness	of	C1	districts	
    as	compared	with	the	RBF	programme	for	these	two	measures.		
    	
71. We	 further	 observe	 that	 neither	 RBF	 nor	 C1	 districts	 experienced	 gains	 in	 the	 targeted	 ANC	
    indicator,	perhaps	due	to	the	already	high	rates	of	ANC	coverage	in	the	population.	However,	a	
    few	non-directly	targeted	coverage	indicators	saw	improvements	under	the	RBF	particularly	the	
    timing	of	first	ANC.	The	timing	of	the	first	ANC	visit	improved	by	about	two	weeks	in	the	RBF	arm	
    as	compared	to	both	controls.	This	is	an	important	gain	in	maternal	care	that	is	seldom	observed	
    in	a	broad-based	primary	care	intervention	such	as	RBF.	While	there	were	broad-based	gains	in	
    the	RBF	and	C1	arms	in	postnatal	coverage	(PNC),	the	rate	of	change	for	any	PNC	was	more	rapid	
    in	 C1	 districts	 as	 compared	 to	 RBF	 districts.	 However,	 the	 results	 show	 no	 differences	 in	 the	
    relative	 gains	 in	 the	 provision	 of	 PNC	 at	 a	 facility	 by	 a	 qualified	 provider	 for	 both	 RBF	 and	 C1	
    districts	in	comparison	to	C2	districts.	
         	
72. For	family	planning	(FP)	services,	the	results	show	that	the	use	of	modern	or	any	contraceptive	
    method	 remained	 relatively	 unchanged	 at	 endline	 as	 compared	 to	 the	 baseline	 across	 the	 3	
    study	 arms.	 But	 further	 review	 of	 the	 availability	 of	 FP	 outreach	 services	 shows	 a	 rise	 in	 the	
    provision	of	any	FP	outreach	programme	in	the	RBF	districts	vis-à-vis	the	C2	but	a	greater	rise	in	
    FP	 outreach	 in	 C1	 districts	 when	 compared	 with	 both	 RBF	 and	 C2	 districts.	 For	 immunization	
    services,	 we	 observe	 that	 immunization	 coverage	 in	 the	 surveyed	 areas	 of	 rural	 Zambia	 was	

																																																													
13
  One	 of	 the	 remaining	 indicators	 involved	 special	 sub-population	 of	 HIV	 positive	 pregnant	 women	 whose	 coverage	 was	
not	 tracked	 by	 the	 data	 collection.	 The	 other	 remaining	 indicator	 applies	 to	 all	 women	 of	 reproductive	 age	 and	 not	 just	
those	with	a	recent	birth	and	hence	were	not	sufficiently	represented	in	the	household	survey.	

                                                                   47	
              	
      erratic	 during	 the	 RBF	 implementation	 period.	 In	 the	 household	 survey	 data,	 rates	 of	 full	
      vaccination	declined	in	both	C1	and	C2	districts	but	remained	constant	or	slightly	higher	in	RBF	
      districts.	This	suggests	that	the	RBF	programme	was	protective	with	respect	to	some	measures	
      of	 immunization	 coverage	 –	 any	 immunization	 and	 DPT	 injection	 –	 which	 were	 significantly	
      higher	than	in	RBF	communities	as	compared	to	C2.	However,	these	results	were	not	precisely	
      estimated.	
           	
73.   As	regards	to	structural	quality,	results	on	the	RBF	vs	C1	were	largely	inconclusive	but	the	RBF	
      districts	 performed	 better	 than	 C2	 districts	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 status	 of	 infrastructure	 and	
      availability	of	functional	medical	equipment.	The	quality	of	delivery	rooms	in	RBF	facilities	was	
      better	 than	 the	 delivery	 rooms	 in	 C1	 and	 C2	 districts	 while	 the	 quality	 of	 curative	 care	 in	 RBF	
      facilities	was	better	than	C2	facilities.		
           	
74.   Process	 quality	 during	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	 care	 was	 not	 directly	 targeted	 by	 the	 RBF	
      programme	(with	the	exception	of	the	two	process	measures	tied	to	ANC	–	IPT	and	HIV	testing).	
      The	evaluation	measured	mother’s	knowledge	of	danger	signs	during	pregnancy	which	showed	
      that	 women	 residing	 in	 RBF	 districts	 are	 significantly	 more	 likely	 to	 list	 several	 out	 of	 the	 12	
      danger	signs	as	compared	to	those	residing	in	C1	districts	who	were	not	able	to	list	any.		
           	
75.   Despite	 higher	 knowledge,	 results	 from	 the	 household	 survey	 showed	 minimal	 progress	 on	
      process	quality	of	maternal	health	care	under	the	RBF	programme	except	for	the	provision	of	a	
      tetanus	 injection	 (vs	 C1);	 any	 iron	 tablets	 and	 malaria	 drugs	 were	 higher	 in	 RBF	 communities	
      than	 C2	 communities.	 C1	 districts	 witnessed	 better	 improvements	 in	 blood	 tests	 and	 any	 iron	
      taken	during	ANC	than	the	RBF.	Results	from	patient	recall	showed	that	more	women	reported	
      to	have	received	advice	on	diet	in	RBF	facilities	(vs	C1),	and	having	had	their	abdomen	measured	
      and	 palpated	 (vs	 C2).	 However,	 women	 who	 attended	 C1	 facilities	 reported	 to	 have	 received	
      explanations	on	the	side	effects	of	iron	folic	acid	tablets	as	compared	to	those	who	went	to	RBF	
      facilities.	 The	 results	 also	 showed	 no	 gains	 in	 process	 quality	 for	 postnatal	 care	 in	 RBF	
      communities.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 mothers	 from	 C1	 communities	 reported	 higher	 immediate	
      initiation	of	breastfeeding	and	receipt	of	Vitamin	A	after	delivery	as	compared	to	both	RBF	and	
      C2	communities.		
           	
76.   Clients	 who	 visited	 RBF	 health	 facilities	 were	 more	 satisfied	 with	 the	 time	 that	 the	 health	
      workers	spent	with	them.	The	data	shows	that	health	workers	in	RBF	facilities	spent	sufficiently	
      more	 time	 during	 consultations	 with	 their	 patients	 as	 compared	 to	 both	 C1	 and	 C2	 health	
      facilities.	 There	 was	 also	 more	 trust	 in	 health	 workers	 operating	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 as	 compared	
      with	C1	facilities	for	both	maternal	and	child	health	services.		
           	
77.   When	it	comes	to	understanding	the	causal	and	behavioural	mechanisms	through	which	RBF	and	
      enhanced	financing	(C1)	achieved	these	gains,	the	evaluation	partially	investigates	this	question.	
      The	health	worker	interview	found	that	the	level	of	job	satisfaction	of	health	workers	increased	
      as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 RBF	 and	 health	 worker	 turnover	 was	 lower,	 suggesting	 that	 more	 engaged	
      health	 workers	 with	 more	 experience	 in	 the	 catchment	 area	 played	 a	 role.	 These	 gains	 in	
      satisfaction	and	retention	are	relatively	larger	in	RBF	areas	than	in	C1	areas	indicating	the	likely	
      influence	of	staff	incentive	payments	(which	were	not	present	in	C1).

78. When	 investigating	 the	 role	 of	 staff	 incentives	 in	 determining	 RBF	 effectiveness,	 the	 power	 of	
    the	 incentive	 is	 a	 critical	 aspect	 to	 note—individuals	 in	 general	 exhibit	 a	 greater	 response	 to	
    higher	 monetary	 incentives.	 In	 terms	 of	 the	 relative	 power	 of	 the	 RBF	 incentive,	 the	 amount	
    which	 was	 received	 by	 each	 member	 of	 staff	 was	 dependent	 on	 the	 individual’s	 performance	
    scores,	actual	RBF	income	realized,	investment	priorities,	the	number	and	composition	of	staff	at	
    the	health	facility,	and	individual	salary	levels.	Consequently,	health	workers	received	about	10%	
    of	their	official	staff	salaries	on	average	as	RBF	staff	incentives.	At	the	start	of	the	RBF	project,	
    the	 proportion	 were	 higher	 but	 6	 months	 after	 the	 start	 the	 RBF	 project,	 the	 Zambian	
    Government	increased	staff	salaries	for	all	civil	servants	ranging	from	100%	to	200%.	While	there	
    is	little	empirical	evidence	on	what	constitutes	optimal	incentive	levels	–	either	at	the	facility	or	
    individual	 worker	 level	 –	 to	 foster	 maximal	 effectiveness	 of	 an	 RBF-type	 mechanism,	 evidence	
    shows	that	small	incentives	often	result	in	no	appreciable	gain	in	targeted	outcomes	(Friedman	
    and	Scheffler,	2015).	The	relatively	small	proportion	of	total	health	worker	remuneration	coming	
    from	 the	 RBF	 mechanisms	 suggests	 that	 greater	 gains	 may	 have	 been	 possible	 if	 the	 RBF	
    incentives	were	higher.	
    	
79. Determinants	of	programme	effectiveness	also	include	contextual	and	implementation	factors.	
    Some	of	these	relate	directly	to	the	power	of	the	individual	worker	incentive.	While	the	above	
    staff	 incentive	 arrangement	 was	 designed	 to	 facilitate	 an	 increase	 in	 staff	 incomes,	 several	
    health	 facilities	 agreed	 with	 their	 staff	 members	 to	 give	 up	 whole	 or	 part	 of	 their	
    incentive/bonus	during	a	particular	quarter	in	order	to	make	a	large	investment,	e.g.	purchase	of	
    a	motor	cycle,	water	pump,	etc.	This	could	be	considered	a	sign	of	dedication	to	improving	the	
    welfare	of	the	community,	and/or	altruism.	But	in	most	cases,	such	capital	investments	could	be	
    spread	across	a	number	of	quarters	which	can	affect	staff	motivation.		
          	
80. In	 terms	 of	 non-wage	 resources,	 RBF	 performance	 grants	 at	 the	 health	 facility	 level	
    complemented	 GRZ	 resources	 significantly.	 The	 results	 show	 that	 the	 total	 RBF	 performance	
    grant	was	about	6	times	the	value	of	the	GRZ	grant	over	the	project	period.14	However,	the	RBF	
    grant	was	growing	faster	than	the	GRZ	grant	and	the	latter	actually	declined	between	2013	and	
    2014.	 There	 could	 be	 several	 explanations	 for	 this	 but	 a	 study	 by	 Dusseljee	 et	 al.	 (2014)	
    observed	that	the	district	management	in	the	RBF	health	facilities	were	reducing	the	amount	of	
    the	GRZ	grant	that	was	being	disbursed	to	the	health	facilities.	This	suggests	that	there	may	have	
    been	aid	fungibility15	or	substitution	of	financing	because	the	proportion	of	the	GRZ	grant	to	the	
    RBF	 grant	 decreased	 by	 half	 between	 2012	 and	 2014.	 This	 further	 suggests	 that	 the	 RBF	 grant	
    was	 not	 additional	 to	 the	 existing	 financial	 resources	 at	 the	 RBF	 health	 facilities	 in	 accordance	
    with	 the	 project	 objectives.	 This	 has	 a	 number	 of	 policy	 implications	 on	 aid	 effectiveness	 as	 a	
    whole,	and	efficacy	of	the	RBF	programme.	The	RBF	funds	may	just	have	substituted	rather	than	
    complemented	 GRZ	 spending.	 To	 mitigate	 this	 problem,	 future	 RBF	 programs	 could	 consider	
    putting	 in	 place	 indicators	 linked	 to	 GRZ	 budget	 performance	 at	 national	 and	 district	 levels	 to	
    ensure	that	the	RBF	grants	are	additional	to	GRZ	grants.	
																																																													
14
  	 Over	 the	 project	 period	 (2012-2014),	 the	 total	 GRZ	 operational	 grant	 was	 only	 18%	 the	 total	 value	 of	 the	 RBF	
performance	grant	
15
  Aid	fungibility	is	when	donor	funding	for	health	substitutes	for—rather	than	complements—health	financing	by	recipient	
governments.


                                                                49	
              	
         	
81. Given	the	high	levels	of	RBF	grant	funding,	far	above	the	GRZ	grant,	questions	may	be	raised	on	
    the	future	financial	sustainability	of	the	RBF	programme.	However,	considering	that	only	half	of	
    the	 RBF	 funds	 were	 being	 used	 for	 operational	 activities	 while	 the	 rest	 were	 spent	 on	 staff	
    incentives,	sustainability	may	not	be	an	issue.	The	Zambian	Government	can	easily	absorb	this	
    funding	while	the	loss	in	staff	incentives	might	not	have	a	huge	impact	since	the	proportion	of	
    the	staff	incentives	to	the	staff	salaries	was	only	10%.	It	should	also	be	noted	that	the	GRZ	was	
    responsible	for	staff	salaries	which	were	far	much	higher	than	the	RBF	grants.	
         	
82. Apart	 from	 financial	 sustainability,	 the	 study	 demonstrates	 that	 RBF	 can	 be	 successfully	
    implemented	 through	 a	 “contracting-in”	 public	 health	 system	 using	 the	 existing	 government	
    systems	and	structures	in	Zambia.	In	the	long	run,	this	approach	could	facilitate	institutional	and	
    impact	sustainability.			This	is	highlighted	in	the	Paris	Declaration	on	Aid	Effectiveness,	as	well	as	
    other	 studies	 on	 aid	 effectiveness16,17	 where	 the	 common	 agreement	 is	 that	 using	 a	 country’s	
    own	 institutions	 and	 systems	 to	 implement	 projects	 can	 strengthen	 a	 country’s	 capacity	 to	
    implement	programmes,	and	programmes	being	implemented	can	be	sustained.	
	
83. In	contrast	with	RBF	facilities,	health	facilities	in	C1	districts	could	not	spend	the	matching	grant	
    on	staff	incentives	which	were	about	47%	on	average	in	the	RBF	districts.	The	money	disbursed	
    to	 the	 health	 facilities	 in	 C1	 districts	 was	 required	 to	 be	 retired	 before	 replenishment	 which	
    caused	further	disbursement	delays.	This	was	contrary	to	health	facilities	in	the	RBF	arm	where	
    RBF	payments	were	disbursed	directly	in	the	health	centre	bank	accounts’	and	didn’t	needed	to	
    be	retired.	Additionally,	in	terms	of	autonomy	over	the	use	of	funds,	RBF	health	facilities	were	
    undoubtedly	 better	 than	 C1	 health	 facilities.	 The	 results	 show	 that	 the	 funds	 for	 C1	 health	
    facilities	were	not	being	fully	disbursed	from	the	C1	district	to	the	C1	health	facilities.	Instead,	
    managers	in	several	C1	districts	used	part	of	this	money	(which	was	solely	meant	for	C1	health	
    facilities)	 for	 centralized	 procurements,	 and	 only	 disbursed	 the	 balance	 of	 what	 remained.	 A	
    study	 by	 Dusseljee	 et	 al.	 (2014)	 confirms	 this	 finding.	 On	 the	 contrary,	 in	 the	 RBF	 arm,	 the	
    intended	 quantity	 of	 money	 reached	 the	 health	 facilities	 because	 it	 was	 sent	 directly	 into	 the	
    health	facility	bank	accounts.	This	facilitated	fiscal	decentralization	and	greater	autonomy	over	
    resources	at	facility	level.		
    	
84. To	contextualise	the	discussion	on	managerial	autonomy	at	health	facility	level,	the	study	shows	
    that	RBF	facilities	(vs.	C2)	reported	significantly	higher	autonomy	on	service	provision,	clarity	on	
    policies	and	procedures	for	doing	things	as	well	as	the	overall	autonomy	index.	The	study	further	
    reveals	that	RBF	health	facilities	reported	more	frequent	assessment	of	staff	performance,	and	a	
    higher	 number	 of	 performance	 assessment	 at	 health	 facilities	 in	 comparison	 with	 both	 C1	 and	
    C2	facilities.	District	hospitals	also	conducted	more	supervisory	visits	in	RBF	than	C1	facilities.	In	
    addition,	 health	 centre	 committees	 were	 more	 active	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 (vs.	 C2).	 These	 findings	
    demonstrate	greater	accountability	and	transparency	in	planning,	resource	use,	service	delivery,	
    and	 community	 participation.	 In	 Appendix	 2,	 the	 results	 also	 show	 that	 RBF	 was	 successful	 in	
    improving	the	accuracy	of	reporting	for	some	indicators	(deliveries	and	PMTCT)	as	compared	to	
    C1	and	C2.

85. The	relevant	point	from	the	design	perspective	is	that	disbursement	of	RBF	financing	directly	to	
    health	facilities	facilitated	fiscal	decentralisation.	The	study	was	designed	to	equalize	total	RBF	
    financing	 between	 health	 facilities	 in	 RBF	 districts	 and	 C1	 districts.	 By	 using	 two	 different	
    disbursement	mechanisms,	the	study	was	able	to	measure	the	success	of	each	system	in	terms	
    of	 overall	 level	 of	 RBF	 funding	 being	 utilized.18	 Results	 show	 that	 health	 facilities	 in	 the	 C1	
    districts	 did	 not	 receive	 the	 same	 amounts	 as	 the	 RBF	 districts	 due	 to	 delayed	 retirement	 and	
    low	absorptive	capacity.	By	the	end	of	the	RBF	programme,	the	proportion	of	disbursement	to	
    C1	districts	was	only	56%	of	what	the	RBF	districts	had	received.	Disbursements	to	C1	districts	
    lagged	 behind	 mainly	 due	 to:	 i)	 delays	 in	 disbursing	 the	 funds	 from	 the	 district	 accounts	 to	
    health	 facilities	 as	 an	 imprest,	 and	 ii)	 delayed	 retirement	 by	 health	 facilities	 which	 in	 turn	
    contributed	 to	 delayed	 replenishment	 of	 the	 district	 account.19	 It	 is	 clear	 that	 disbursement	
    mechanisms	affect	both	absorptive	capacity	and	the	level	of	available	funding.		
    	
86. The	study	was	able	to	explore	some	of	the	causal	and	behavioural	mechanisms	through	which	
    the	RBF	and	C1	could	have	achieved	and/or	not	achieved	gains	in	the	targeted	indicators.	For	the	
    enhanced	financing	(C1)	arm,	the	key	question	is	whether	the	gains	were	the	result	of	availability	
    of	 inputs,	 increased	 financing,	 earmarking	 of	 funds	 for	 priority	 maternal	 and	 child	 health	
    interventions,	 or	 other	 factors.	 A	 corollary	 question	 is	 whether	 greater	 gains	 could	 have	 been	
    observed	in	the	C1	arm	if	financial	flows	to	C1	facilities	actually	equalled	those	received	by	RBF	
    facilities.	As	earlier	stated,	the	IE	had	3	districts	in	each	province	(RBF,	C1,	C2)	and	these	districts	
    were	 being	 managed	 by	 the	 same	 Provincial	 Medical	 Office	 (PMO).	 In	 line	 with	 Government	
    guidelines,	all	districts	in	a	province	attend	quarterly	GRZ	implementation	review	meetings	and	
    it	 is	 possible	 that	 during	 these	 meetings	 there	 could	 have	 been	 cross-pollination	 of	 ideas.	
    Consequently,	 health	 facilities	 in	 the	 C1	 districts	 may	 also	 have	 been	 implementing	 RBF	
    initiatives	 and	 could	 have	 behaved	 as	 if	 they	 were	 incentivized.	 For	 example,	 one	 World	 Bank	
    supervision	 mission	 noted	 that	 some	 C1	 districts	 were	 using	 some	 form	 of	 output-based	
    approaches.	With	no	concealed	investigation,	the	study	units	were	aware	of	the	experiment	and	
    the	C1	districts	could	have	tried	to	out-perform	the	RBF	districts.		
	
87. For	 the	 RBF,	 the	 key	 question	 is	 whether	 the	 RBF	 districts	 could	 have	 achieved	 even	 more.	 In	
    exploring	 this	 question,	 we	 noted	 that	 the	 Zambia	 RBF	 project	 was	 being	 implemented	 in	 a	
    health	 system	 that	 already	 had	 high	 coverage	 in	 some	 of	 the	 key	 MNCH	 indicators	 being	
    incentivized.	As	such,	perhaps	it	would	have	been	more	prudent	to	have	implemented	a	target	
    or	 coverage	 based	 performance	 incentive	 framework	 rather	 than	 fee-for-service.	 Furthermore,	
    the	 results	 show	 that	 health	 workers	 received	 about	 10%	 of	 their	 official	 GRZ	 staff	 salaries	 on	
    average	as	RBF	staff	incentives	by	the	end	of	the	pilot	period.	This	may	not	have	been	sufficient	
    to	have	induced	change	as	discussed	above.

88. The	CEA	shows	that	the	RBF	(vs	C1)	provided	more	total	health	benefits	(QALYs	gained)	but	at	a	
    higher	unit	price.	Nonetheless,	in	comparison	with	the	two	control	groups,	the	RBF	programme	
    is	 a	 cost-effective	 approach	 in	 improving	 maternal	 and	 child	 health.	 When	 the	 RBF	 group	 is	
    compared	 with	 the	 C1	 group,	 the	 mid-point	 ICER	 is	 $1,642	 per	 QALYs	 gained	 (without	 quality	
    adjustment),	 and	 $1,324	 per	 QALYs	 gained	 (with	 quality	 adjustment).	 When	 the	 RBF	 group	 is	
    compared	 with	 the	 C2	 group,	 the	 mid-point	 ICER	 is	 $999	 per	 QALYs	 gained	 (without	 quality	
    adjustment),	and	$809	per	QALYs	gained	(with	quality	adjustment).	All	these	values	are	less	than	
    the	GDP/capita	of	$1,759	in	2013	(mid-year	of	RBF	programme)	in	Zambia20,21.	Since	these	ICERs	
    are	 less	 than	 Zambia’s	 GDP	 per	 capita	 in	 2013,	 the	 RBF	 programme	 was	 cost-effective	 in	
    comparison	to	C1	and	C2.	However,	the	input	financing	approach	(C1)	was	also	cost-effective	in	
    comparison	 to	 C2.	 The	 ICERs	 for	 C1	 vs	 C2	 were	 $508	 and	 $413	 per	 QALY	 gained,	 without	 and	
    with	quality	adjustment,	respectively.	Thus,	depending	on	which	group	is	used	for	comparison,	
    the	ICER	varies,	but	the	estimates	point	to	a	cost-effective	impact	of	both	the	RBF	and	C1	groups	
    than	the	C2	group.	
          	
89. For	the	CEA	analysis,	it	should	be	observed	that	health	system	investments	and	gains	that	may	
    have	occurred	only	in	the	RBF	group	weren’t	fully	evaluated.	In	addition,	the	confidence	bounds	
    around	these	estimates	are	not	able	to	definitively	distinguish	the	two	approaches	partially	due	
    to	 the	 uncertainty	 inherent	 in	 CEA	 studies.22	 Nonetheless,	 we	 can	 conclude	 that	 both	 the	 RBF	
    and	C1	are	cost-effective	when	compared	with	Zambia’s	level	of	income	in	2013.23	
          	
90. The	 overarching	 conclusion	 is	 that	 both	 the	 RBF	 and	 C1	 contributed	 to	 increased	 utilisation	 of	
    key	MNCH	services	in	Zambia.	However,	as	compared	to	the	C1,	RBF	had	a	more	positive	effect	
    on	 health	 systems	 governance	 particularly	 availability	 of	 equipment,	 structural	 quality,	
    managerial	 autonomy,	 accuracy	 in	 reporting,	 satisfaction	 and	 retention	 of	 health	 workers,	 and	
    level	 and	 predictability	 of	 funding.	 Internal	 and	 external	 verification	 of	 results,	 and	 regular	
    supportive	supervision	which	were	a	key	feature	in	the	RBF	districts	could	have	contributed	to	
    these	successes.	Another	feature	is	that	purchasing	mechanisms	were	enhanced	in	the	RBF	and	
    this	 potentially	 contributed	 to	 greater	 efficiency	 and	 value	 for	 money.	 	 These	 important	
    elements	could	not	be	achieved	in	the	input	financing	(C1)	arm.

6.1	Lessons	Learnt	
	
91. The	 results	 from	 the	 study	 shed	 light	 on	 several	 areas	 which	 have	 been	 under	 discussion	 as	
    regards	to	the	RBF	in	terms	of	results,	implementation	and	evaluation	processes:	
	
    (i) The	 study	 demonstrates	 that	 an	 RBF	 programme	 can	 be	 successfully	 implemented	 to	
        increase	 delivery	 of	 key	 health	 indicators	 through	 “contracting-in”	 a	 capacity	 constrained	
        public	health	system.	Many	other	examples	of	successful	public	sector	RBF	programs	occur	
        in	middle-income	countries	(i.e.	Argentina)	or	when	implemented	by	a	specialist	third	party	
        (i.e.	Zimbabwe).	Since	Zambia	implemented	the	RBF	by	using	existing	government	systems,	
        structures,	 and	 local	 expertise,	 it	 is	 potentially	 easier	 to	 scale-up	 a	 countrywide	 RBF	
        programme.	 This	 is	 because	 the	 Zambia	 RBF	 design	 allows	 for	 financial,	 institutional,	 and	
        impact	sustainability.		
    	
    (ii) It	 is	 important	 to	 have	 a	 routine	 process	 evaluation	 (PE)	 system	 in	 place	 to	 continuously	
           monitor	 the	 results	 and	 overall	 implementation	 of	 the	 RBF	 programme.	 The	 Zambia	 RBF	
           pilot	programme	benefited	from	a	PE	system	which	provided	regular	updates	and	insights	
           on	the	implementation	to	allow	for	midcourse	corrections	and	evidence-based	policy	and	
           planning.	
        	

    (iii)       While	 the	 “contracting-in”	 design	 could	 be	 potentially	 more	 institutionally	 sustainable,	
                consistency	 in	 leadership	 is	 a	 critical	 component	 to	 moving	 from	 a	 project	 to	 a	
                programmatic	approach	that	is	fully	embedded	in	the	larger	health	sector.	In	the	case	of	
                Zambia,	there	were	several	exogenous	shocks	(governance	issues,	split	of	ministries,	high	
                staff	turnover	at	all	levels	of	Government	etc)	which	made	it	difficult	to	have	continuous	
                policy	dialogue	on	RBF.	To	help	ensure	integration	of	experiences	and	lessons	of	current	
                and	future	RBF	programs	into	broader	health	sector	dialogue,	these	programs	should	be	
                firmly	 embedded	 in	 the	 planning	 department	 of	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Health	 (MOH)	 with	 co-
                leadership	 with	 a	 relevant	 technical	 unit	 such	 as	 Mother	 and	 Child	 Health.	 The	
                implementation	 structure	 could	 consist	 of	 a	 mix	 of	 dedicated	 technical	 civil	 service	 staff.		
                In	addition,	an	RBF	coordination	committee	governed	by	the	MOH	should	bring	together	
                interested	donors	together	with	Government	to	discuss	emerging	results,	policy	impacts,	
                and	the	way	forward.		
	
    (iv)        The	 Zambia	 RBF	 project	 demonstrates	 that	 having	 a	 performance	 incentive	 framework	
                (provider	 payment	 mechanism)	 linked	 to	 targets	 and	 production	 capacity	 instead	 of	 a	
                payment	 mechanism	 for	 all	 services	 rendered	 is	 potentially	 better.	 The	 Zambia	 RBF	 was	
                implemented	in	a	health	system	that	already	had	relatively	high	coverage	in	some	of	the	
                key	maternal	and	child	health	indicators.	As	such,	rather	than	fee-for-service,	it	may	have	
                been	 more	 effective	 to	 have	 used	 a	 target	 or	 coverage	 based	 performance	 incentive	
                framework.	
    	
    (v)         The	enhanced	financing	arm	as	part	of	the	evaluation	is	critical	in	order	to	be	certain	that	
                effects	in	the	RBF	arm	are	not	only	due	to	additional	financial	resources.	As	shown	in	the	
                evaluation	 results,	 enhanced	 financing,	 can	 also	 produce	 good	 results.	 	 In	 Zambia,	 these	
                results	 go	 a	 step	 further	 in	 highlighting	 a	 potential	 issue	 in	 the	 current	 health	 system	


                                                            53	
            	
           related	 to	 funding	 constraints	 and	 unpredictability.	 Input	 financing	 with	 parameters	
           focused	on	key	interventions	can	work—but	in	the	case	of	Zambia,	there	were	also	issues	
           in	 utilizing	 funds	 in	 Control	 1	 districts	 which	 points	 to	 disbursement	 mechanism	 issues	
           which	were	not	experienced	when	disbursing	RBF	grants	in	the	RBF	arm.		Thus,	effective	
           approaches,	 including	 direct	 disbursement	 of	 funds	 to	 front-line	 service	 delivery	 levels	
           coupled	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 financing	 mechanisms	 can	 have	 a	 positive	 impact	 on	 service	
           delivery	through	improved	budget	performance	(disbursement	and	absorption	of	funds).			
	
(vi)       Direct	 disbursement	 of	 funds	 to	 front-line	 service	 delivery	 levels	 and	 use	 of	 an	 effective	
           disbursement	 mechanism	 can	 also	 increase	 predictability	 of	 funding	 and	 managerial	
           autonomy.	 However,	 the	 RBF	 funds	 may	 have	 substituted	 rather	 than	 complemented	
           government	funding	due	to	the	poor	disbursement	of	Government	grants	to	pilot	health	
           facilities	 by	 the	 district	 management	 during	 the	 implementation	 of	 the	 RBF	 project.	 To	
           mitigate	 this	 problem,	 future	 RBF	 programs	 in	 Zambia	 could	 consider	 putting	 in	 place	
           indicators	 linked	 to	 government	 budget	 performance	 at	 national,	 provincial,	 and	 district	
           levels	 to	 ensure	 that	 RBF	 grants	 at	 service	 delivery	 levels	 are	 additional	 to	 government	
           grants.	
       	

(vii) Adequate	levels	of	incentives	need	be	offered	to	providers	to	trigger	sufficient	behavioural	
        change.	 The	 relatively	 low	 power	 of	 RBF	 staff	 incentives	 in	 relation	 to	 guaranteed	
        individual	staff	salaries	(which	declined	to	10%	over	the	project	period)	may	have	limited	
        some	of	the	possible	achievable	gains	by	RBF.	Furthermore,	higher	incentive	payments	in	
        remote	 areas	 did	 not	 result	 in	 increased	 health	 outcomes	 either	 (Appendix	 1).	 This	
        suggests	 that	 provider	 effort	 may	 be	 relatively	 inelastic	 at	 small	 incentive	 levels.	 This	
        probably	explains	why	the	RBF	had	no	impact	on	the	motivation	of	health	workers	but	had	
        a	 positive	 impact	 on	 health	 worker	 satisfaction,	reduced	 attrition,	 and	 responsiveness	 to	
        the	client.	Given	the	high	cost	of	living	in	Zambia,	the	additional	income	from	the	RBF	staff	
        incentive	 could	 have	 been	 inadequate	 to	 fully	 influence	 personal	 behaviour.	 Future	 RBF	
        programs	should	provide	adequate	but	sustainable	levels	of	RBF	staff	incentives.	
	
(viii) When	introducing	the	concept	of	data	verification	in	a	health	system	with	little	previous	
        experience,	 repeated	 outreach	 to	 facility	 management	 combined	 with	 experiential	
        learning	may	be	necessary	for	management	to	internalize	the	reality	of	a	verification	audit.	
        This	 also	 applies	 to	 the	 possible	 ramifications	 for	 mis-reporting.	 The	 audit	 experiment	
        discussed	 in	 Appendix	 2	 demonstrates	 a	 very	 low	 level	 of	 understanding	 of	 the	 audit	
        likelihoods	despite	repeated	announcement	to	the	facility	management,	as	well	as	a	lack	
        of	understanding	over	mis-reporting	thresholds	and	possible	sanctions.	As	such,	the	audit	
        likelihood	 experiment	 largely	 failed	 as	 the	 reporting	 principals	 were	 unaware	 of	 the	
        likelihood	assigned	to	the	facility.	Nevertheless,	despite	discrepancies	in	reporting	found	in	
        RBF	facilities	by	the	external	verifiers,	these	discrepancies	appear	to	be	within	the	bounds	
        of	 normal	 reporting	 error	 as	 they	 are	 not	 significantly	 different	 from	 a	 sample	 of	 C2	
        facilities.	
      	
(ix) A	 key	 component	 of	 the	 Zambia	 HRBF	 IE	 is	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 analysis	 (CEA)	 which	
        justified	 the	 value	 of	 the	 RBF	 on	 both	 the	 costs	 and	 effectiveness	 (by	 increasing	 both	
        quality	and	quantity	of	services).	By	adding	a	complementary	cost-effectiveness	study,	the	
        Zambia	HRBF	IE	showed	that	a	number	of	decisions	must	be	made	in	the	health	facilities	

                                                       54	
       	
              on	 health	 systems	 inputs	 such	 as	 personnel,	 drugs,	 equipment,	 buildings,	 verification,	
              supportive	 supervision	 and	 so	 forth.	 The	 existence	 of	 both	 fixed	 and	 variable	 costs	 are	
              important	 aspects	 in	 evaluating	 how	 much	 it	 costs	 to	 implement	 a	 RBF	 programme,	 and	
              the	efficacy	of	RBF	programs	as	compared	to	non-RBF	programs.		
	
    (x)       To	 our	knowledge,	 this	 CEA	 study	 is	 among	 the	 few	 to	 incorporate	 the	 quality	 of	 care	 in	
              the	 cost-effectiveness	 modelling,	 and	 the	 study	 innovatively	 uses	 a	 Delphi	 panel	 to	
              generate	 a	 quality	 index	 from	 household	 survey	 based	 results	 and	 to	 convert	 a	 quality	
              index	to	a	health	effect	index.	Given	that	improving	the	quality	of	care	is	one	of	the	major	
              components	 of	 the	 RBF	 programme,	 RBF	 evaluation	 models	 should	 always	 include	 an	
              assessment	 of	 quality	 improvements	 to	 fully	 estimate	 the	 cost-effectiveness	 of	 the	 RBF	
              programme.	
    	
	
7.	Limitations	of	the	study	
	

92. Due	to	budgetary	limitations	and	the	high	cost	of	primary	data	collection	in	Zambia,	population	
    based	data	was	only	collected	in	18	of	the	30	study	districts,	leading	to	the	possible	influence	of	
    potential	 unobserved	 confounders	 at	 the	 district	 level	 for	 the	 estimated	 population	 level	
    impacts.	This	limitation	is	discussed	in	the	Methods	Section	and	alternative	p-values,	based	on	
    randomization	inference,	are	presented.	Appendix	4	contrasts	these	Fisher	exact	p-values	with	
    the	more	usual	(but	inapplicable)	asymptotic	p-values	clustered	at	the	survey	enumeration	area	
    level.	
    	
93. Secondly,	contrary	to	study	design,	the	amount	of	funds	available	to	C1	facilities	did	not	equal,	
    as	anticipated,	to	the	mean	amount	earned	by	an	RBF	facility	due	to	differences	in	disbursement	
    mechanisms.	
        	
94. Lastly,	RBF	is	a	comprehensive	intervention	package	including	devolved	autonomy	and	enhanced	
    monitoring,	supervision,	and	data	verification.	The	evaluation	design	was	not	able	to	investigate	
    the	relative	effectiveness	of	each	of	these	RBF	components	on	the	priority	outcomes	but	rather	
    the	summary	effect	of	all.

Appendix	1		
Research	Question	2	–	Do	higher	incentive	payments	in	remote	areas	result	in	
increased	health	outcomes	and	greater	retention	of	staff?	
	
Appendix	 1	 evaluates	 the	 effect	 of	 higher	 RBF	 incentive	 payments	 in	 remote	 health	 facilities	 on	
maternal	 and	 child	 health	 output	 and	 quality	 measures,	 health	 system,	 and	 functionality	 of	 health	
workers.	Data	comes	from	the	two	rounds	of	the	health	facility	survey	conducted	in	RBF	and	control	
facilities	at	baseline	and	endline.	The	impact	estimate	given	is	the	relative	change	in	indicators	for	
the	RBF	facilities	compared	between	health	facilities	where	the	prices	of	indicators	were	pegged	at	
25%	more	than	the	normal	prices	for	the	RBF	indicators	(henceforth	written	as	enhanced	facilities)	
versus	health	facilities	that	were	earning	normal	prices	on	each	RBF	indicator	(written	as	standard	
facilities).	This	is	the	same	difference-in-difference	framework	used	in	the	main	report.	
	
A1.1	Quality	of	services	
	
A1.1.1	Structural	quality	
This	section	evaluates	the	effect	of	the	RBF	intervention	on	facility	infrastructure	and	availability	of	
essential	drugs	and	equipment.	The	status	of	infrastructure	at	the	facilities	was	assessed	with	direct	
observation.	 Relevant	 dimensions	 of	 infrastructure	 were	 availability	 of	 power,	 water,	 tele-
communication	systems,	disinfectants,	an	outpatient	consultation	room,	availability	of	key	elements	
in	the	outpatient	room	for	optimal	service	delivery,	and	provision	of	biomedical	waste	disposal.	An	
infrastructure	 index	 was	 constructed,	 including	 the	 following	 items	 with	 equal	 weight:	 continuous	
availability	of	power,	water,	communication	and	disinfectants,	provision	of	sharp	disposal	and	basin	
with	soap	and	water	in	outpatient	room.	As	shown	in	Table	A1,	there	were	no	significant	differences	
between	elevated	and	standard	facilities	for	all	indicators	except	for	disinfectant	stock-out	that	was	
significantly	higher	in	elevated	facilities	(33%	points	at	10%	significance	level).		
	
Facilities	 were	 asked	 if	 they	 had	 availability	 of	 specific	 drugs	 on	 the	 day	 of	 survey	 and	 for	 the	
previous	30	days.	Drugs	included	general	antibiotics,	analgesics,	family	planning,	anti-malarials,	anti-
tuberculosis,	 antiretroviral,	 emergency	 obstetric	 care	 (EMOC),	 vaccine,	 diagnostic	 kits,	 fluids	 and	
electrolytes.	A	drug	availability	index	was	constructed	assigning	equal	weight	to	the	individual	items	
and	was	further	standardized.	The	items	were	–	Tetracycline	eye	ointment,	Amoxicillin,	Paracetamol,	
Cotrimoxazole,	 Iron	 and	 Folic	 acid,	 Vitamin	 A,	 and	 ORS.	 Table	 A2	 shows	 the	 impact	 of	 RBF	 on	 the	
availability	 of	 select	 drugs.	 In	 elevated	 facilities,	 only	 the	 availability	 of	 oral	 contraceptive	 pills	
increased	by	22	percentage	points,	whereas	there	was	no	significant	relative	change	among	others.

RBF	 facilities	 are	 supervised	 every	 quarter	 by	 the	 district	 hospital,	 which	 monitors	 the	 quality	 of	
services	using	a	quality	checklist.	This	checklist	has	10	dimensions,	each	consisting	of	several	items,	
weighted	accordingly	to	their	perceived	importance	to	service	delivery.	The	quality	checklist	used	by	
the	 district	 hospital	 and	 the	 facility	 survey	 instrument	 used	 during	 data	 collection	 for	 this	 impact	
evaluation	 contain	 a	 few	 common	 items.	 These	 common	 items	 were	 extracted	 from	 the	 facility	
survey	and	the	weights	from	the	quality	checklist	applied,	to	construct	a	quality	index	similar	to	that	
used	by	the	district	hospital.	Standardized	indices	were	constructed	for	each	quality	dimension.	Only	
four	 out	 of	 ten	 quality	 dimensions	 on	 the	 quality	 checklist	 could	 be	 mapped	 to	 the	 health	 facility	
instrument.	 Table	 A4	 summarizes	 the	 results	 of	 the	 quality	 mapping	 exercise.	 Enhanced	 facilities

A1.1.2	Process	quality	
This	 section	 summarizes	 the	 effect	 on	 quality	 of	 care	 provided	 for	 antenatal,	 postnatal	 and	 child	
health	 care	 services.	 There	 are	 two	 main	 sources	 for	 this	 data:	 direct	 clinical	 observations	 of	
consultations	and	exit	interviews	administered	to	patients	as	they	are	leaving	their	consultations.	
	
Maternal	care	
Table	 A5	 presents	 similar	 quality	 measures	 for	 ANC,	 measured	 using	 patient	 exit	 interviews	
conducted	as	patients	left	care	facilities.	Participants	were	asked	a	series	of	questions	as	to	whether	
certain	 ANC	 services	 were	 performed	 during	 their	 visit.	 The	 items	 were	 summed	 to	 create	 a	
composite	 score	 for	 the	 number	 of	 ANC	 services	 that	 were	 performed.	 More	 clients	 reported	 to	
have	had	their	blood	samples	collected	(23	percentage	points)	and	pregnancy	danger	signs	explained	
(23	percentage	points)	in	the	elevated	facilities	as	compared	to	the	standard	facilities.

health	 care	 show	 lower	 proportion	 of	 clients	 who	 reported	 to	 be	 satisfied	 on	 cleanliness	 (22%	
points)	 and	 staff	 attitude	 (18%	 points)	 in	 the	 enhanced	 facilities	 as	 compared	 to	 the	 standard

A1.2	Effect	on	the	health	system	
	
A1.2.1	Facility	governance	and	autonomy		
As	shown	in	Table	A9,	the	health	centre	committees	seemed	to	be	more	active	in	enhanced	facilities	
as	they	reported	significantly	higher	number	of	meetings	(1.2	more	meetings	per	year	on	average)	
and	external	staff	performance	assessment	linked	to	staff	salaries	or	bonuses.	However,	enhanced	
facilities	reported	a	lower	probability	of	supervision	visits	by	DHMT.		
	
Facilities	were	interviewed	about	the	level	of	autonomy	during	the	follow	up	survey.	The	questions	
were	related	to	the	perceived	autonomy	of	the	facility	in-charge	on	assigning	task	to	staff,	allocating	
budget,	 provision	 of	 services,	 and	 obtaining	 resources.	 The	 responses	 were	 recorded	 on	 a	 Likert	
Scale	with	values	ranging	from	1	(least	autonomy)	to	5	(maximum	autonomy).	An	autonomy	index	
was	constructed	utilizing	select	elements	of	autonomy	such	as	ability	to	allocate	resources	and	tasks	
effectively	within	the	facility.	The	index	was	further	standardized.	As	shown	in	Table	A10,	there	were	
no	significant	differences	in	any	of	these	variables.

health	 facilities	 (where	 prices	 of	 RBF	 indicators	 were	 25%	 more	 than	 the	 normal	 prices	 of	 RBF	
indicators)	compared	with	standard	RBF	health	facilities	(those	that	were	earning	normal	prices	on	
RBF	 indicators).	 As	 shown	 in	 table	 A11	 and	 A12,	 there	 is	 no	 significant	 change	 in	 health	 worker

A1.3	Conclusions	and	discussions	
	
While	 RBF	 mechanisms	 have	 demonstrated	 effectiveness	 in	 various	 settings,	 including	 to	 some	
degree	in	Zambia,	there	is	an	open	question	as	to	which	components	of	RBF	are	most	effective.	One	
way	to	test	whether	it	is	the	resource	channel	as	powered	through	higher	incentive	levels	that	can	
be	leveraged	for	even	greater	gains,	the	Zambian	RBF	evaluation	included	a	direct	test	of	elevated	
incentive	 levels	 on	 facility	 outcomes	 by	 randomizing	 a	 subset	 of	 remote	 facilities	 to	 receive	 25%	
higher	incentive	payments.	
	
We	ran	several	statistical	tests	for	service	provision	infrastructure,	quality	measures,	health	system,	
and	 functionality	 of	 health	 workers.	 On	 structural	 quality,	 we	 found	 no	 significant	 differences	
between	 enhanced	 and	 standard	 facilities	 for	 several	 indicators	 of	 structural	 quality	 except	 for	
increased	availability	of	oral	contraceptive	pills	in	the	elevated	health	facilities.	However,	there	was	
a	decrease	in	the	availability	of	disinfectants	and	the	overall	supply	management	index	in	elevated	
facilities	 as	 compared	 to	 standard	 health	 facilities.	 Elevated	 health	 facilities	 performed	 better	 in	
process	quality	for	antenatal	care	services.	More	clients	reported	to	have	had	their	blood	samples	
collected	 and	 pregnancy	 danger	 signs	 explained	 in	 the	 elevated	 facilities	 as	 compared	 to	 the	
standard	 facilities.	 Nonetheless,	 there	 were	 no	 significant	 differences	 in	 the	 variables	 for	 process	
quality	for	child	health	care	services.		
	
Regarding	 governance	 and	 managerial	 autonomy,	 health	 centre	 committees	 in	 elevated	 health	
facilities	were	more	active,	while	external	staff	performance	assessments	linked	to	staff	salaries	or	
bonuses	 were	 conducted	 regularly.	 However,	 elevated	 facilities	 reported	 a	 lower	 probability	 of	
supervision	visits	from	their	DMOs.	Infrequent	supervision	visits	to	remote	health	facilities	could	be	
as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 long	 distances	 and	 bad	 road	 terrain	 between	 the	 DMOs	 and	 remote	 health	
facilities.	However,	one	would	have	expected	the	DMOs	to	have	been	visiting	all	the	health	facilities	
in	their	district	regardless	of	the	facility	being	remote	or	not	because	the	DMOs	were	being	paid	a	
performance	payment	linked	to	supervision.		
	
The	study	examined	perceived	autonomy	of	the	facility	in-charge	on	assigning	task	to	staff,	allocating	
budget,	provision	of	services,	and	obtaining	resources.	The	results	showed	no	significant	differences	

                                                                 66	
          	
in	any	of	these	variables	between	the	elevated	and	standard	health	facilities.	This	could	be	due	to	
the	fact	that	all	of	the	variables	which	were	examined	were	not	affected	by	differentiated	incentive	
payments	 as	 both	 elevated	 and	 standard	 health	 facilities	 were	 receiving	 RBF	payment	 which	 were	
tied	 to	 outputs.	 The	 data	 also	 showed	 no	 significant	 differences	 in	 health	 worker	 motivation	 and	
satisfaction	between	elevated	and	standard	health	facilities.	
	
Based	 on	 the	 results,	 we	 conclude	 that	 higher	 incentive	 payments	 in	 remote	 areas	 has	 a	 positive	
effect	 on	 a	 few	 measures	 from	 many	 considered	 indicators	 for	 process	 quality	 for	 antenatal	 care	
services,	functionality	of	health	centre	committees,	and	external	staff	performance	assessments.	We	
found	 no	 significant	 differences	 between	 elevated	 and	 standard	 facilities	 for	 several	 indicators	 on	
managerial	 autonomy,	 and	 motivation	 and	 satisfaction	 of	 health	 workers.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	
standard	 health	 facilities	 performed	 better	 on	 overall	 supply	 management,	 client	 satisfaction	 for	
child	health	services,	and	a	higher	probability	of	supervision	visits	from	their	DMOs.		
	
Taken	together	we	conclude	that	differences	in	the	prices	of	the	RBF	indicators	by	25%	between	the	
elevated	and	standard	health	facilities	might	not	have	yielded	significant	enough	RBF	payments	and	
personal	 monetary	 incentives	 large	 enough	 to	 influence	 a	 lot	 of	 change.	 An	 alternative	
interpretation	 consistent	 with	 the	 findings	 is	 that	 gains	 under	 RBF	 programs	 are	 not	 particularly	
sensitive	 to	 incentive	 levels	 when	 they	 are	 not	 applied	 differently,	 and	 other	 aspects	 of	 the	
programme	–	the	cognitive	salience	of	the	incentives	(independent	of	amount),	and	monitoring	and	
supervisory	feedback,	are	also	effective	channels	for	achieving	health	gains.	
	
In	 other	 RBF	 programs	 in	 Africa,	 the	 remoteness	 bonus	 was	 pegged	 at	 30%24	 of	 the	 total	 quantity	
amount	 rather	 than	 having	 a	 higher	 price	 for	 each	 indicator.	 We	 also	 observe	 that	 remote	 health	
facilities	 had	 fewer	 members	 of	 staff	 and	 low	 catchment	 populations	 as	 compared	 to	 standard	
health	facilities.	Thus,	despite	the	prices	of	all	the	quantity	indicators	in	the	elevated	health	facilities	
being	 25%	 more	 than	 the	 normal	 prices	 for	 the	 indicators,	 the	 total	 amount	 of	 RBF	 incentive	
payments	 in	 remote	 health	 facilities	 were	 still	 much	 lower	 as	 compared	 to	 the	 standard	 health	
facilities.	Furthermore,	while	we	didn’t	examine	the	income	effect	on	overall	population	health	and	
health	 seeking	 behaviour,	 this	 could	 be	 another	 factor	 which	 can	 determine	 how	 much	 a	 health	
facility	earns.	
	
One	main	recommendation	is	to	make	sure	that	future	RBF	remoteness	bonus	allocation	criterion	go	
beyond	 the	 use	 of	 distance	 between	 the	 DMOs	 and	 health	 facility,	 and	 state	 of	 roads	 to	 include	
other	 factors	 related	 to	 care-seeking:	 the	 average	 distance	 between	 the	 health	 facility	 and	
communities,	access	to	communication,	availability	of	public	transportation,	catchment	population,	
area	of	coverage,	and	population	density.

Research	Question	3	–	How	does	the	likelihood	of	audit/external	verification	of	
results	affect	the	accuracy	of	reported	data?	
	
To	 answer	 the	 above	 question,	 a	 counter	 external	 verification	 exercise	 was	 conducted.	 This	
evaluation	looked	at	the	accuracy	of	data,	and	state	of	record	maintenance	at	health	facilities	in	the	
RBF	 arm.	 Health	 facilities	 in	 the	 RBF	 arm	 were	 randomized	 into	 three	 groups	 and	 each	 group	 was	
given	a	letter	notifying	them	of	a	100%,	30%,	or	10%	likelihood	of	data	audit	at	the	start	of	the	RBF	
project.	The	hypothesis	was	that	health	facility	managers	who	are	absolutely	certain	that	auditors	or	
external	verifiers	will	visit	their	health	facilities	were	more	likely	to	maintain	good	quality	data	and	
accurate	records.		
	
B1.1	Data	requirements,	sources,	and	selection	of	health	facilities	
	
Data	was	collected	for	the	entire	year	(2013)	on	all	the	nine	(9)	incentivized	RBF	indicators.	The	key	
sources	 of	 data	 at	 the	 health	 facilities	 were	 the	 Health	 Information	 Aggregation	 (HIA)	 2	 forms	 in	
which	 health	 facilities	 summarized	 services	 provided	 for	 each	 indicator.	 Since	 this	 data	 required	
verification,	 tally	 sheets,	 activity	 sheets,	 and	 registers	 were	 used	 as	 these	 indicated	 the	 individual	
services	delivered	to	a	single	client.	This	was	also	relevant	in	that	it	provided	further	details	as	to	the	
date	 of	 the	 service,	 client	 register	 number,	 name	 of	 client,	 residential	 address,	 and	 other	
information.	 Hence,	 this	 data	 was	 used	 to	 check	 errors	 relating	 to	 summing,	 recording	 and	 data	
entry.		
	
Since	 the	 overall	 objective	 of	 the	 counter-external	 verification	 exercise	 was	 to	 determine	 whether	
the	 likelihood	 of	 audit	 or	 external	 verification	 affected	 the	 accuracy	 in	 reporting,	 health	 facilities	
were	 grouped	 into	 three	 (3)	 categories	 as	 shown	 in	 table	 B1	 below.	 Based	 on	 the	 list	 of	 health	
facilities	 with	 assigned	 probabilities	 or	 likelihood	 of	 audit,	 the	 counter-external	 verification	 team	
proceeded	 to	 apply	 simple	 random	 sampling	 to	 each	 category	 of	 health	 facilities	 in	 Excel®	 and	
obtained	 thirty-five	 (35)	 from	 each	 subgroup.	 Hence,	 data	 was	 collected	 from	 105	 health	 facilities	
(out	 of	 176	 health	 facilities	 on	 the	 RBF	 IE)	 from	 all	 the	 nine	 (9)	 provinces	 on	 the	 RBF	 project	
(Southern,	Central,	Copperbelt,	Eastern	Western,	North	Western,	Luapula,	Northern	and	Muchinga).

Additional	 data	 was	 collected	 by	 the	 formal	 external	 verification	 exercise	 conducted	 by	 the	
international	 NGO	 Eurohealth	 and	 contracted	 by	 the	 Government	 of	 Zambia.	 This	 audit	 activity	
collected	information	from	72	health	centres	according	to	the	announced	audit	likelihoods.	Similar

facility	tally	sheets	and	the	HIA	forms.	
	
B1.2	Results		
	
The	first	lesson	from	this	experiment	is	that,	when	introducing	the	concept	of	data	verification	in	a	
health	 system	 with	 little	 previous	 experience	 of	 these	 activities,	 repeated	 outreach	 to	 facility	
management	combined	with	experiential	learning	may	be	necessary	to	internalize	the	meaning	of	a	
verification	audit.	This	also	applies	to	the	possible	sanctions	for	mis-reporting	deemed	deliberate.	
	
What	is	clear	from	the	formal	external	verification	is	that	facility	in-charges,	for	the	most	part,	failed	
to	internalize	the	announced	likelihood	audits	–	these	were	announced	at	RBF	training	and	then	in	
two	follow-up	letters	to	each	in-charge.	Table	B2	shows	the	rate	of	understanding	of	audit	likelihood	
among	in-charges	at	time	of	survey.	It	is	strikingly	low	–	both	for	awareness	of	audit	likelihood	(as	
conveyed	in	official	letters)	and	for	discussion	of	audit	likelihood	with	relevant	facility	staff.

Most	 likely	 as	 a	 result	 the	 audit	 likelihoods	 are	 not	 related	 to	 accuracy	 of	 reported	 figures.	 No	
measure	 of	 divergence	 between	 the	 services	 reported	 in	 the	 tally	 and	 activity	 sheets	 and	 the	
services	reported	in	the	HIA	2	form	is	related	to	the	announced	audit	likelihood.	The	third	research	
question	 of	 the	 IE	 was	 not	 able	 to	 answered	 as	 posed,	 as	 the	 announced	 programme	 does	 not	
appear	to	have	been	sufficiently	comprehended	by	the	study	subjects.	
	
However,	 a	 parallel	 question	 relating	 to	 the	 accuracy	 of	 reported	 information	 under	 RBF	 can	 be	
investigated	as	the	counter	external	verification	also	collected	reporting	information	from	a	sample	
of	 C2	 facilities,	 where	 self-reported	 indicators	 of	 service	 provision	 were	 not	 incentivized	 as	 in	 RBF	
districts.	
	
In	the	counter	external	verification,	the	quantitative	analysis	of	internal	consistency	of	facility	data	
was	 done	 facility-by-facility	 and	 indicator-by-indicator,	 on	 all	 monthly	 observations.	 This	 data	 is	
presented	 in	 Table	 B3	 which	 shows	 the	 accuracy	 of	 reporting	 by	 mean	 verification	 factor	 per	
indicator	and	the	associated	p-value.	The	mean	verification	factor	(VF)	was	arrived	at	by	using	the	
following	formula:	
	
                      !"#$%&' !"#$%$"& !"#$ !"##$ !"# !"#$%$#& !ℎ!!"# !"ℎ!" !"#$%&"!%
               !" =                                                                                  	
                                   !"#$%&' !" !"# 2 !"#$% (!"#$!%"& !"#$%&' )

A	 verification	 factor	 greater	 than	 one	 (1)	 implies	 under-reporting	 while	 a	 verification	 factor	 lower	
than	 one	 (1)	 implies	 over-reporting.	 The	 first	 outcome	 investigated	 is	 whether	 the	 facility	 under-
reported	or	over-reported	the	indicator	over	the	2013	calendar	year	as	a	function	of	residing	in	an	
RBF	district.	In	other	words,	the	first	outcome	is	whether	the	VF	is	greater	than	one	or	less	than	or	
equal	to	one,	and	this	outcome	is	regressed	on	a	binary	indicator	for	whether	the	reporting	facility	is	
in	an	RBF	district.

Based	on	counter-verification	audits	for	all	months	in	2013,	140	total	facilities	-	35	in	C2	districts	and	105	in	RBF	districts	
	
The	results	show	that	there	was	under-reporting	in	all	the	nine	(9)	indicators	in	the	control	facilities,	
ranging	from	83%	of	facilities	under-reporting	the	number	of	deliveries	to	55%	under-reporting	for	
modern	 family	 planning	 usage.	 In	 terms	 of	 RBF	 facilities,	 the	 rate	 of	 under-reporting	 was	
indistinguishable	 from	 control	 facilities	 for	 7	 of	 the	 9	 indicators	 assessed.	 For	 two	 indicators	 –	
deliveries	and	PMTCT	–	the	rate	of	underreporting	was	attenuated	at	moderate	levels	of	significance	
(p-values	of	.10	and	.08).	Both	of	these	indicators	were	15	percentage	points	less	likely	to	be	under-
reported.	 In	 sum,	 the	 reporting	 errors	 (which	 were	 negative	 errors	 on	 average)	 were	 largely	 the	
same	 for	 RBF	 and	 non-RBF	 facilities	 indicating	 that	 the	 tendency	 to	 inflate	 service	 counts	 of	
incentivized	 services	 are	 largely	 absent	 in	 the	 Zambia	 RBF.	 For	the	2	indicators	that	are	 marginally	
less	 likely	 to	 be	 underreported	 in	 RBF	 districts	 –	 institutional	 deliveries	 and	 PMTCT	 –	 the	 mean	
reporting	rates	do	not	exceed	the	tally	sheet	total	but	simply	come	closer	to	this	figure.	
	
Besides	 the	 binary	 measure	 for	 under-reporting,	 the	 magnitude	 of	 reporting	 error	 can	 also	 be	
investigated	with	the	data.	This	entails	a	regression	of	the	magnitude	of	the	VF	on	a	binary	indicator	
of	RBF	status	(results	not	shown).	Since	the	VF	is	a	ratio,	the	magnitude	of	under-reporting	and	over-
reporting	errors	are	not	symmetric.	For	this	reason,	separate	regressions	are	run	for	VFs	>	1	and	VFs	
<=	 1.	 In	 terms	 of	 the	 magnitude	 of	 under-reporting	 (VFs	 >1),	 there	 is	 no	 identified	 systematic	
relationship	with	RBF	status.	For	those	facilities	that	over-report	(VFs	<=1),	the	magnitude	of	over-
report	 is	 actually	 significantly	 attenuated	 in	 RBF	 facilities	 for	 four	 indicators	 at	 traditional	 levels	 of	
significance:	 outpatient	 consultations,	 immunizations,	 IPT,	 and	 HIV	 testing	 and	 counselling	 of

behaviours	of	RBF	facilities	differ	from	control	facilities,	it	is	to	bring	reported	services	closers	to	the

B1.3	Conclusions	and	discussion	
	
We	hypothesized	that	the	likelihood	of	audit	or	external	verification	of	results	affects	the	accuracy	of	
reported	 data.	 The	 thinking	 was	 that	 health	 facility	 managers	 who	 are	 absolutely	 certain	 that	
auditors	or	external	verifiers	will	visit	their	health	facilities	were	more	likely	to	have	accurate	data,	
and	 high	 quality	 records.	 To	 test	 our	 hypothesis,	 health	 facilities	 in	 the	 RBF	 arm	 were	 randomized	
into	 three	 groups	 and	 each	 group	 was	 given	 a	 letter	 notifying	 them	 of	 a	 100%,	 30%,	 or	 10%	
likelihood	 of	 data	 audit.	 These	 letters	 were	 issued	 at	 the	 start	 of	 the	 RBF	 project	 and	 a	 counter	
external	verification	exercise	was	conducted	at	the	end	of	the	RBF	project.	Unfortunately,	it	doesn’t	
seem	 that	 this	 audit	 experiment	 resulted	 in	 a	 usable	 analysis	 as	 most	 facility	 in-charges	 were	
unaware	of	the	relative	audit	likelihoods	despite	repeated	outreach	efforts.	
	
However,	 the	 data	 can	 be	 used	 to	 address	 a	 general	 issue	 of	 reporting	 veracity	 under	 an	 RBF	
programme.	One	hypothesis	is	that	the	introduction	of	incentives	may	bring	about	gaming	behaviour	
that	inflates	the	self-reported	service	totals	over	that	which	was	actually	supplied	by	health	clinics.	
Instead	the	data	shows	that	under-reporting	of	services	is	widespread	in	control	facilities	and	that,	if	
anything,	 RBF	 facilities	 report	 more	 accurately,	 at	 least	 with	 respect	 to	 select	 indictors,	 without	
appreciable	over-reporting.	
	
In	 view	 of	 the	 above,	 we	 found	 no	 evidence	 that	 incentive	 introduction	 under	 RBF	 affects	 the	
accuracy	of	reported	data	except	in	so	far	as	to	make	it	more	accurate.	The	precise	explanation	for	
this	was	not	established	but	one	possible	cause	may	be	that	most	facilities	did	not	have	dedicated	
staff	for	managing	the	data	and	so,	not	all	records	were	utilized	in	aggregating	the	primary	entries	
for	reporting.	Therefore,	record	keeping	and	storage	of	files	was	at	best	a	haphazard	affair	in	which	
some	 registers	 were	 not	 considered,	 for	 example,	 the	 large	 number	 of	 beneficiaries	 of	 certain	
services	such	as	curative	consultation	required	more	than	one	register	being	used	within	a	month.	
Although	the	condition	of	records	varied	between	facilities,	it	was	observed	that	those	facilities	that	
had	 designated	 data	 entry	 clerks	 had	 better	 organised	 records	 than	 those	 without.	 Facilities	 with	
poor	 or	 incomplete	 records	 attributed	 their	 inadequacy	 to	 work	 overload	 as	 their	 officers	 did	 not	
have	 adequate	 time	 outside	 their	 normal	 duties	 to	 complete	 records.	 To	 the	 extent	 that	 RBF	
prioritizes	the	use	of	data	in	facility	compensation,	it	actually	promotes	more	accurate	self-reported	
information	systems.

Population	outcomes	and	Fisher-exact	standard	errors	
	
The	evaluation	design	for	the	Zambia	RBF	pilot	involved	pair-matched	randomization	at	the	district	
level.	Randomization	at	the	district	level	does	come	with	potential	inferential	cost	in	the	power	of	
the	analysis	as	the	number	of	units	of	randomization	is	limited.	In	the	case	of	the	Zambia	RBF,	the	
RBF	 and	 C1	 interventions	 were	 each	 piloted	 in	 10	 districts	 around	 the	 country	 However	 due	 to	
budgetary	limitations,	population	data	was	only	able	to	be	collected	in	six	districts	in	each	study	arm.	
The	 main	 report	 estimates	 standard	 errors	 for	 impact	 estimates	 by	 clustering	 at	 the	 PSU	 level.	
However,	 as	 implied	 above,	 there	 may	 be	 unobserved	 influences	 at	 the	 district	 level	 that	 lead	 to	
district-level	correlations	in	impacts	that	ideally	should	be	accounted	for.	However,	this	presents	two	
analytic	difficulties.	
	
The	 first	 difficulty	 is	 relatively	 few	 study	 units	 for	 the	 analysis.	 Besides	 the	 challenge	 to	 inferential	
power	 by	 the	 relatively	 few	 number	 of	 study	 units,	 traditional	 approaches	 to	 standard	 error	
estimates,	notably	the	cluster-robust	standard	error,	may	be	downward	biased	and	thus	over-reject	
the	null	hypothesis	of	no	treatment	effect	(Cameron	et	al.,	2008).	To	counteract	this	potential	bias,	
the	 precision	 of	 statistical	 tests	 can	 also	 be	 assessed	 through	 Randomization	 Inference	 (RI)	 which	
assumes	all	observed	outcomes	and	covariates	to	be	fixed	and	generates	the	reference	distribution	
of	 test	 statistics	 by	 modelling	 the	 treatment	 assignation	 as	 the	 sole	 random	 variable	 in	 the	 data	
(Ernst,	2005).	RI	compares	the	actual	test	statistic	observed	in	the	evaluation	against	the	distribution	
of	 all	 conceivable	 test	 statistics	 as	 determined	 through	 permutation	 methods	 –	 where	 the	 actual	
statistic	 falls	 in	 this	 distribution	 determines	 the	 exact	 p-value.	 This	 one-tailed	 hypothesis	 test	 is	
considered	an	exact	test	because	it	does	not	require	a	large-sample	approximation	as	randomization	
itself	 is	 the	 basis	 for	 inference	 and	 permutation	 methods	 have	 exhausted	 all	 possible	 treatment	
assignations	 across	 districts.	 An	 exact	 test	 has	 the	 added	 benefit	 that	 it	 does	 not	 impose	
distributional	 assumptions	 that	 are	 often	 behind	 approximations	 of	 reference	 distributions	 in	
standard	hypothesis	testing.	
	
This	 appendix	 presents	 the	 population	 level	 impacts	 with	 exact	 p-values	 estimated	 through	
randomization	inference	and	compares	them	with	the	asymptotic	p-values	estimated	with	clustering	
at	 the	 PSU	 level	 and	 that	 were	 reported	 earlier.	 The	 tables	 show	 that	 indeed	 the	 precision	 of	 the	
inference	is	not	as	great	with	the	exact	p-values.	Many	impacts	that	were	estimated	to	be	precisely	
estimated	at	traditional	levels	of	statistical	significance	(with	standard	errors	clustered	at	the	survey	
cluster	 level)	 are	 no	 longer	 such.	 This	 raises	 the	 question	 of	 the	 acceptable	 level	 of	 precision	 for	
impacts	to	inform	policy	when	an	evaluation	does	not	have	high	power.	Given	the	that	the	first	pilot	
of	 RBF	 in	 Zambia	 faced	 various	 implementation	 challenges,	 population	 data	 was	 unable	 to	 be	
collected	on	a	broad	basis,	and	the	international	evidence	base	for	RBF	mechanisms	comprises	only	
a	handful	of	countries,	policy	makers	may	wish	to	consider	exact	p-values	larger	than	traditional	cut-
off	levels,	say	on	the	order	of	0.15,	as	sufficiently	precise	to	inform	future	policy	directions.
