                      Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
Global Outlook
The global economy continues to disappoint, with growth in 2016 projected to remain at last
year’s 2.4 percent, half a percentage point below the January forecast. This year will be the fifth
consecutive year with global growth below its long-term trend of 3.5 percent observed during
2000-07 (Figure 1.1). Many countries are plagued by recession, several others suffer from
terrorist attacks and refugee crises, while some are mired in civil wars together with extremely
uncertain commodity markets, especially oil. The result has been lower potential output and
investment, and weaker demand across the globe. In advanced economies, real growth has
remained uncomfortably low, almost one percentage point below the long term average of 2000
to 2007. Growth in the United States (U.S.), the European Union (EU) and Japan is expected to
stay around 1.7 percent, half a percentage point slower than expected in January. Among them,
growth in the United Kingdom (U.K.), already weak, is expected to fall in 2016 after the historic
referendum of June 23, 2016 in favor of leaving the EU. The “Brexit effect”–likely through
contraction in investment--is expected to hamper growth in the U.K. and EU in the medium term.
Prospects for a rebound are dim, as both services and manufacturing confidence are
deteriorating.

The emerging markets have also been slowing down despite a decade of extremely fast growth.
China’s growth is gradually slowing, projected at 6.7 percent in 2016, down from 7.7 percent in
2013. Brazil and Russia are still in recession. All oil exporters are feeling the brunt of persistently
low oil prices. Nigeria’s and Angola’s growth will fall below 1 percent in 2016 from almost 3
percent a year ago. Among Middle East oil exporters, growth in the GCC countries is expected to
fall sharply with Saudi Arabia’s declining to one percent in 2016 from above 3 percent last year.

The global outlook remains weak with growth expected to stay below the average of 2000-07 for
the seventh year in a row. The World Bank projects it to hover around 2.8 percent in 2017,
nearing 3 percent in 2018. The slight improvement with respect to 2016 is due to the better-
than-expected performance among some advanced economies, particularly the United States
which is expected to grow at 1.9 percent in 2018. Within developing countries, recessions in
Russia and Brazil are expected to bottom out with growth turning positive starting in 2017. Oil
markets are expected to remain over-supplied and, in the absence of a pick-up in demand, prices
could remain around $53-$60 by the end of the decade.

Risks to these projections are mostly on the downside, mainly geopolitical risks that could
increase uncertainty, thus dampening investment and growth. Deceleration in major emerging
market economies and rising private-sector indebtedness could increase vulnerability in some of
these countries. Other major risk factors are a potential slowdown in the EU, particularly the U.K.
in the aftermath of Brexit, and persistently low oil prices that could further destabilize the outlook
for oil-exporting countries.

Developments in the Oil Market
The oil market has entered a new normal of low oil prices. A World Bank study (Devarajan and
Mottaghi, 2016) finds that oil markets are expected to work through their current oversupply and
rebalance in early 2020 at market-clearing prices that are close to the marginal cost of US shale
oil producers. Oil prices are likely to be in the range of $53 - $60 a barrel (Figure 1.2, Left panel)
because global stockpiles are expected to remain well above historical averages; Iran, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq are increasing production; Russia and Saudi Arabia, among
others, are producing at their highest levels since January 2016; and Libya has lifted restrictions
on ports halted a few months ago, unlocking 300,000 barrels a day of supply. In August 2016,
production of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) crude oil increased
by 40,000 barrels per day over July 2016, with Saudi Arabia’s output reaching a record high. To
lift prices, Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to freeze oil output ahead of the September meeting
of OPEC members and Iran agreed to cooperate on any decision that stabilizes the market.
Expectations of a production cap led to a slight rebound of oil prices in early September but failed
to lift prices as there is speculation that a consensus to cut production is hard to reach among
the members. If the potential output cap deal fails, oil prices could fall further. Historical patterns

show that expectations ahead of OPEC meetings lift oil prices for a few weeks, but fail to hold
prices up because members do not keep to their quotas (Figure 1.2, Right panel).

Countries that rely on oil for the lion’s share of their export revenues are facing a major and long-
standing terms of trade shock. In almost all cases, oil prices have remained well below the prices
needed to balance their budgets, resulting in large fiscal and external account deficits. OPEC
members’ net oil export revenues in 2015 was $404 billion, 46 percent lower than in the previous
year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Based on EIA price
forecasts, OPEC revenue is expected to fall to $341 billion in 2016 before rising to $427 billion in
2017.

Among African oil exporters, Nigeria, which relies on oil for 70 percent of its fiscal revenues,
needs a price of $123 a barrel to balance the budget. The situation is even worse for those
countries whose primary market for crude oil exports is the U.S., as the shale oil boom has wiped
out their exports.1 These countries, including Angola, Gabon and Nigeria, are facing a sharp drop
in export revenues in addition to lower oil prices. The twin effect of lower oil prices and dropping
demand from a major importer are reducing their fiscal space. In Latin America, Venezuela and

 Though oil is presumed as a commodity that is traded freely, constraints such as crude grade, structure of refineries
in oil importers and market share could limit a country’s trade prospects with the rest of the world, making them
vulnerable to demand shocks.

Brazil have also been hit hard by the crash in commodity prices, pushing their economies into
their deepest recession. Oil exporters in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are
facing the same problem. Libya and Algeria have been hit by lower oil prices and lower oil demand
from the U.S., their major oil trading partner. Some of them have been drawing down their
reserves and turning to capital markets. Estimates show that Libya lost two-thirds of its reserves
between 2013 and 2016, equivalent to $75 billion. Algeria lost $86 billion, and Iraq $29 billion
during the same period.

MENA Economies
This year appears to be one of the toughest for the region as MENA governments face serious
policy challenges. The biggest for oil exporters is managing their finances and diversification
strategies with oil below $45 a barrel (Figure 1.3). Fiscal consolidation in a difficult sociopolitical
environment and spillovers from conflicts is creating challenges for oil importers as well. Real
GDP growth in MENA for 2016 is projected to fall to its lowest level since 2013, 2.3 percent, lower
than last year’s growth by half a percentage point and about one percentage point lower than
predicted in April 2016.

MENA’s weak growth performance is partially attributed to governments’ taking austerity
measures including cutting capital and current spending to counter lower fiscal revenues in the
wake of cheap oil. For example, more than $20 billion of projects may be canceled in Saudi Arabia
this year. This comes at a time when ongoing conflict and war in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen are
ravaging these economies and the refugee crisis is draining fiscal space in neighboring countries.
Furthermore, private-sector growth, a source of job creation, has been slowing down, making it
difficult to absorb the large of number of unemployed. The latest labor market data show that
the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco and
Tunisia in 2016.

We expect regional growth to improve slightly to 3.1 and 3.5 percent over the next two years, as
governments across the region undertake reforms and diversify their economies away from oil.
The measures include eliminating fuel subsidies, reducing public-sector jobs and the wage bill,
privatizing State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and diversifying fiscal revenues away from oil
through increasing direct and indirect taxes.2 These reforms, if implemented, are expected to
transform at least part of the old social contract and enhance the overall efficiency of their
economies going forward. The regional fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 9.3 percent of GDP
in 2016, up by half a percentage point from last year. The regional fiscal surplus of about $63
billion in 2013 is expected to turn into a deficit of $320 billion in 2016. All three sub-groups (GCC

  Saudi Arabia is planning to privatize its postal system by early 2017 and considering new income taxes on
expatriates. The Kuwaiti government is considering privatization of non-oil production units of Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation.

in 2016 and the next two years but with the prospects of reducing them going forward (Table 1.1

Growth in oil exporters in MENA is expected to remain subdued at 2.3 percent in 2016 due to a
sharp drop in growth in the GCC countries (Table 1.1). If the September meeting of OPEC
members fails to put a cap on production, oil prices will fall even further, worsening the situation.
This time around, governments of oil exporters are treating the oil price decline as largely
permanent and taking tough policy measures such as spending cuts, which have also lowered
growth in the oil and non-oil sectors. Non-oil growth in Algeria and Oman is estimated to fall to
3.7 percent in 2016 compared to 5 and 7 percent respectively a year ago.

                                                        The economy of Saudi Arabia is expected
to grow by 1 percent in 2016, much lower than was expected in April 2016. The fiscal deficit
remains high and is expected to stay elevated in subsequent years. Growth in Qatar, the best
performer in the sub-group, is expected to drop to 2.1 percent in 2016, much lower than
previously forecast and half of the growth rate of last year. Qatar’s fiscal surplus of the past two
decades is expected to turn into deficit estimated at 12.1 percent of GDP in 2016 with the
prospect of remaining high for the projection period (2017 and 18).

In response to low oil prices, all of these countries have tightened fiscal policy, used their foreign
reserves and turned to debt markets to finance their twin deficits. GCC countries have been
issuing about $88 billion in sovereign bonds or government-related enterprise debt to plug the
budget deficits left by falling oil prices. They are also looking into diversifying fiscal revenues away
from oil by introducing a Value Added Tax (VAT) for the first time. The outlook is expected to
improve slightly throughout the projection period (Table 1.1) as reforms and diversification
measures come into effect, but still weak compared to the boom years prior to 2011.

Lower oil revenues and the slowdown in economic activity have lowered financial outflows. Data
from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) showed that remittances outflow fell 19
percent in July 2016 compared to last year, the equivalent of $640 million. Foreign transfers also
declined by 35 percent compared to June 2016, from $4.21 billion to $2.74 billion, their lowest

level since February 2013. The decline in outflows to the rest of the region have seriously affected
MENA oil importers’ economies that receive these inflows.

The outlook is slightly better but remains weak in developing oil importers. Oil importers were
badly hit by terrorist attacks, spillovers from conflict in the region, and lower financial outflows
from the Gulf countries. Growth is expected to fall to 2.6 percent in 2016 (from 3.4 percent last
year) for the subgroup as a whole, before improving slightly to an average of 3.5 percent for the
projection period. Fiscal and external account deficits are expected to remain stubbornly high
throughout the projection period (Table 1.1). Among them, Egypt and Tunisia are facing lower
tourism revenues, remittances and financial inflows together with tighter fiscal and monetary
policy that will result in lower growth and higher inflation this year. The inflation rate in urban
areas in Egypt reached 15.5 percent in August, a surge of nearly two percentage points over the
previous month. There are expectations that the Egyptian pound will be depreciated further as
the country faces a shortage of foreign currency, which could also accelerate inflation. And
Morocco’s economy, which relies heavily on the agriculture sector, will see growth weakening in
2016 to 1.5 percent compared to 4.5 percent last year. The agricultural sector poses the greatest
risk to the Moroccan economy with estimated negative growth of 9.5 percent for this year due
to a drought compared to a positive growth of about 2 percent in the non-agriculture sector.
Growth in Jordan and Lebanon will remain subdued throughout the projection period as they
struggle with the spillovers from the conflicts in neighboring Syria and Iraq and lower remittance
inflows due to a sharp slowdown in GCC countries.

The economies of several developing oil exporters in the region are doubly hit by the slump in oil
prices and civil wars. Average growth for the group of countries is expected to turn to 3.4 percent
in 2016 from less than 1 percent last year, but this is solely due to expectations of Iran and Iraq
producing more oil. These countries are facing major fiscal and external imbalances due to the
high cost of war, low oil prices and a decline in trade. Growth in Iran will accelerate to 4.3 percent
in 2016, four times the rate experienced last year, benefitting from the revival of oil output to
pre-sanctions levels. Oil production in Iran has increased to 3.7 million barrels a day, doubling its
level during the sanctions era.

The rest of the countries in this group (Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen) are mired in conflict and war
with humanitarian and economic consequences. The Syrian war has ravaged the economy,
output has shrunk between 50 to 60 percent, the Syrian Pound has lost 80 percent of value, the
population has fallen by 23 percent, 12.4 million are displaced internally (7.6 million) and
externally (4.8 million) since the start of the conflict, and education is on hold for many of the
children living inside and outside of the country (Figure 1.4). The 18-month civil war in Yemen
has resulted in 10,000 civilians killed, 2.8 million people displaced and most Yemenis suffering
from shortages of food, water, sanitation and healthcare (Figure 1.4). Safety nets in Yemen have

been significantly weakened. It is estimated that more than 85 percent of Yemeni’s are now living
in poverty and the situation is getting worse. In addition to the humanitarian cost of the war, the
World Bank estimates that Yemen’s reconstruction will cost more than $15 billion.

It is clear that the disappointing performance of the MENA economies, and possibly the global
economy, is partly due to the rise of terrorist attacks and spread of violent extremism. In the
next section, we attempt to shed light on the underlying causes of this phenomenon by applying
an economic perspective to the demand for and supply of violent extremists. Looking at a
dataset on Daesh foreign recruits joining Daesh, we find that the factors most strongly associated
with foreign individuals’ joining Daesh have to do with a lack of economic and social inclusion in
their country of residence. Promoting greater inclusion, therefore, could not only bring down
the level of violent extremism, but it could improve economic performance in the MENA region.

        Economic and Social Inclusion to Prevent Violent Extremism

Introduction

Since 2000, the number of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, with a sharp
acceleration starting in 2011 (Figure 2.1). The attacks have also become increasingly
concentrated. In 2014, 57 per cent of all attacks occurred in just five countries: Iraq, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Nigeria and Syria (Global Terrorism Index 2015). These attacks have had devastating
effects not just on the lives of the victims and their families, but on the rest of the country and
the region, as investment and tourism decline and economies fall into a low-growth trap. When
terrorism by radicalized groups turns into violent extremism and full-fledged civil wars, the
humanitarian effects become intolerable and the developmental impact long-lasting.

Bringing an end to civil wars and countering violent extremism are the highest priority for the
MENA region. While much of the effort involves the security sector, an economic perspective
can shed light on the underlying causes of violent extremism. In particular, as we show in this
section, among the factors that lead people to leave their country and join radicalized groups is
the lack of economic and social inclusion in their country of residence. These findings suggest
economic and social policies that can help prevent the spread of violent extremism.

Before proceeding, we need to define terms. Terrorism is defined by Global Terrorism Database
(GTD) as “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain
a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.” On the
other hand, the U.S. State Department defines terrorism as “[p]remeditated, politically

                                                    MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR      OCTOBER 2016     10
motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or
clandestine agents. (As per 22 US Code § 2656f).” While the use of violence and a political
motivation underlying such use are inherent to the term’s definition, what makes a use illegal or
a target a noncombatant is largely left to interpretation, as illustrated in U.S. House of
Representatives (1989). The difficulty in defining the term “terrorism” is epitomized by the
persistence of the cliché “One man’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter.”

Furthermore, since the first suicide attacks in recent history (Lebanon in the early 1980s and Sri
Lanka in the late 1980s) and especially since the 9/11 attacks, the term radicalization has been
closely associated with terrorism. Lewis (2013) argues that among the three factors necessary for
successful suicide attacks, “willing individuals” is one of them alongside “organizations to train
and use them, and a society willing to accept such acts in the name of a greater good.” The
increased number of suicide bombing campaigns and the instrumental role of individual
determination in the success of these campaigns has led to a coalescence of the concepts of
terrorism and radicalization. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for example
defines radicalization as the act of “[a]dvocating, engaging in, preparing or otherwise supporting
ideologically motivated or justified violence to further social, economic and political objectives”
(USAID 2011), hence allowing radicalization to comprise both the expression of extreme views
and the actual exercise of violence. The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)
goes as far as equating radicalization with terrorism by defining the former as “the use of and
facilitation of violence targeted on civilians as a means of rectifying grievances, real or perceived,
which form the basis of increasingly strong exclusive group identities” (DFID 2013). This chapter,
therefore, will henceforth use radicalization, violent extremism, and radicalization into violent
extremism interchangeably (Borum 2011).

An economic perspective on radicalization involves acknowledging that there is demand for and
supply of violent extremists and a marketplace where these two meet. In addition, the premise
of an economic analysis of radicalization is that an individual decides to join a terrorist
organization after weighing costs and benefits. Such costs and benefits are not solely financial;
they could include family ties or loyalty to certain groups, for instance. The academic literature
on personnel economics (see e.g. Lazear and Oyer 2012 for a review) provides two insights that
are helpful in understanding the central role of radicalization in a terrorist group’s “business
model”. First, the provision of non-monetary benefits such as a sense of mission is a substitute
for monetary compensation, which is critical for cash-strapped organizations. Terrorist
organizations rely on multiple sources of funding including donations and illegal activities (CFR
2006). In some cases, evidence shows that operations of terrorist groups are supported by limited
activities such as the selling of counterfeit goods (Naim 2006). During the past few years, after
the strengthening of financial regulations, Al-Qaeda recruits have been known to have to pay for
their own training and supplies (CFR 2010), while commanders spoke of shortages of weapons

                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       OCTOBER 2016      11
and food (Reuters 12 June 2009). Even the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), among the
richest terrorist groups in recent history (NBC 20 March 2015), is found to have relatively limited
resources from what was once believed to be its main revenue source: oil (Do et al. 2016).

The second insight from personnel economics is that when there is little scope for external
incentives (such as pay), workers’ intrinsic motivation is instrumental for firm performance
(Besley and Ghatak 2005; Prendergast 2007).3 Since terrorist organizations require followers to
engage in violent activities characterized by a low probability of survival (let alone suicide attacks)
or support those who will do so, success hinges on individuals’ being intrinsically dedicated to
the organization’s mission.

These observations lead to the following critical question: Given the demand by terrorist
organizations for radicalized individuals, how can this demand be met? The main purpose of the
analysis conducted herein is thus to look at the supply side of this market.

To address this question, we look at a specific organization that is largely associated with the
word “radicalization”, at least in the Western public discourse and media (CNN 7 October 2014,
The Wall Street Journal 26 February 2015): the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL), which we henceforth refer to by its Arabic acronym, Daesh. Admittedly, the
phenomenon of violent extremism goes beyond one single organization and spans all continents
and time periods. From Basque’s Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) in Spain and the Shining Path (SL)
in Peru, to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, violent attacks on civilians
have been perpetrated as a means to achieve political objectives. The focus on Daesh is
nonetheless motivated by the impact of its activities on MENA economies. The analysis
conducted in this report relies on a unique dataset on Daesh foreign recruits, which allows
looking at the factors that could lead people from across the world to leave everything behind
and join a terrorist organization. In particular, for the quantitative analysis conducted in this
report, the multinational nature of Daesh’s labor force uniquely allows us to identify country-
level factors that lead some individuals to join the group. The analysis undertaken below, while
restricted to Daesh, sheds light on the risk factors of radicalization turning into violent extremism
in general, irrespective of the political motive underlying the subsequent use of violence.

To the extent that the choice of violent extremism by joining Daesh involves a cost-benefit
analysis, the analytical framework proposed by Becker (1968) highlights the role of opportunity
cost--what the individual could be earning otherwise--in influencing the decision to join a
terrorist organization. Collier and Hoeffler (2004) adopt a similar framework to the empirical
study of conflicts and alternatively talk about greed and grievance. In this report, we thus follow

 Benabou and Tirole (2003), and Deci, Koestner, and Ryan (1999) theoretically and empirically document how
extrinsic incentives can negatively affect workers’ intrinsic motivation re sulting in poorer performance.

a vast empirical literature on the proximate causes of civil war. However, instead of focusing on
the onset of conflict or its intensity – typically measured by casualty counts— our outcome of
interest relates to enrollment in a terrorist group. We look at whether, and to what extent,
exclusion, broadly defined, is a main risk factor of radicalization. In particular, we investigate
whether the lack of economic and social inclusion in their home country is a factor behind an
individual’s decision to join Daesh. Such an exercise mirrors the analyses of socioeconomic risk
factors of conflict such as Barron, Kaiser, and Pradhan (2009) on Indonesia, Mitra and Ray (2014)
on India, Do and Iyer (2010) and Macours (2011) on Nepal, Abdel-Jelil and Do (2016) on the Syrian
Arab Republic, while Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004), Fearon and Laitin (2003), Montalvo and
Reynal-Querol (2005), Collier and Hoeffler (1998, 2004), Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2009) ,
among others, undertake cross-country comparisons instead (see Blattman and Miguel 2010 for
a review).

To conduct our analyses, we combine a unique dataset on Daesh’s foreign recruits with country-
level data from the recruits’ country of residence4. The Daesh foreign recruits database contains
individual information for a subsample of the organization’s foreign workforce. Age, education,
skills, self-reported knowledge of religious teachings, and country of residence are among the
attributes included in the dataset. The country-level data includes macro indicators like GDP per
capita, the Human Development Index (HDI), unemployment rates, population sizes, political
rights along with subjective opinion data from surveys like the Arab Barometer, the Gallup World
Poll and the World Values Survey.

We find that Daesh did not recruit its foreign workforce among the poor and less educated, but
rather the opposite. Instead, the lack of economic inclusion seems to explain the extent of
radicalization into violent extremism.

Data and Methodology
Data on Daesh Foreign Recruits

The data on Daesh foreign recruits comes from a leaked cache of the organization’s pe rsonnel
records that was recently made available to researchers. The dataset has basic socio-economic
information on 3,803 unique foreign recruits. CTC (2016) speculates that the data covers the
period from early 2013 to late 2014 when Daesh used the name ISIL. The records provide
information on a recruit’s country of residence, citizenship, marital status, skills, education
status, previous jihadist experience, and knowledge of Sharia. A comparison of our data with
comparable sources of information on Daesh foreign recruits finds that information available in
alternative datasets are broadly consistent.

Data from Opinion Surveys and other Controls
To analyze Daesh foreign recruits’ data at the macroeconomic level, we associate country-level
attributes with each recruit’s stated country of residence. We also use country averages from
three nationally representative opinion surveys – Gallup World Poll, World Values Survey and
Arab Barometer. The opinion surveys ask respondents about their basic values and beliefs, state
of the world, current affairs and their opinion on society, religion, country and events. In addition,
we use socio-economic variables such as GDP per capita, the Human Development Index (HDI),
the Gini coefficient, unemployment rates, total population numbers, total Muslim population,
distance to Syria, political rights, ethnic, religious and language fractionalization indices as
controls.

Methodology
As discussed, the main objective of the analysis is to understand the factors that have a bearing
on the supply of Daesh foreign recruits. The country of residence is known for most individuals
in the database, with the exception of 331 cases for which available information did not allow
country-of-residence assignment. We can then look at the factors that explain whether any given
country is the origin of at least one foreign recruit. This exercise will henceforth be referred to as
the extensive margin analysis.

A natural extension is to then look at the intensive margin. In other words, we then consider
countries that supply at least one Daesh recruit and identify the country-level characteristics that
explain the differences between these countries in the number of foreign recruits supplied.

Since we are looking at the influence of many factors simultaneously, we will conduct
multivariate regression analyses. In the main text we report graphically the influence of each
variable of interest separately on either extensive or intensive margins.

Results
Who are Daesh’s Foreign Recruits?

A preliminary step to understanding why some individuals become radicalized is to have an idea
of who they are. The tables and figures in this section describe individuals who travelled to Syria
to join Daesh. Where are they coming from? What segments of a country’s population are more
likely to produce Daesh foreign recruits? Are there systematic socio-economic differences
between foreign recruits coming from one part of the world versus another?

Daesh’s recruits come from all continents across the globe. Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Morocco,
Turkey and Egypt are the top five countries supplying recruits to Daesh. Among the non-Muslim-
majority countries, Russia, France, and Germany supply the largest numbers of Daesh’s foreign
workforce.

Looking at their individual characteristics, we find that the average foreign recruit in our data is
27.4 years old. The youngest recruits are from Libya (23.7 years of age on average) and the oldest
are from Indonesia (33.5 years of age on average). Figure 2.2 shows that the average age of Daesh
foreign recruits is not reflective of the demography in their region of origin: older regions do not
produce older Daesh recruits.

Turning to Daesh recruits’ formal education, figure 2.3 shows that sixty-nine percent of recruits
report at least a secondary education. Only fifteen percent left school before high school and less
than two percent are illiterate. Figure 2.4 compares the reported schooling attainments among
Daesh foreign recruits and the general population for ages 20-35 in each region of origin.
Countries in Europe and in Central Asia, as well as other OECD member countries, produce Daesh
recruits that exhibit similar levels of education to their compatriots. In contrast, foreign recruits
from the Middle East, North Africa and South and East Asia are significantly more educated than
what is typical in their region. We however leave open the possibility that recruits have been
overestimating their education, and thus urge caution when interpreting these differences.

During their interview, of the thirty percent of Daesh recruits who declare their preference, 1.9
percent prefer to work in administrative positions, 17.2 percent as fighters, and 11.7 percent in
suicide operations (Figure 2.5). Figures 2.6 and 2.7 present the characteristics of recruits who
report each specific aspiration, excluding individuals who declared none. Aspiring administrators
are relatively more represented among Sub-Saharan African and South and East Asian countries.
Fighters are most common in Eastern Europe and non-European OECD countries. North Africa,
Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia produce the largest proportions of suicide
fighters.
The proportions of administrators but also of suicide fighters increase with education. Recruits
who reported not working or being in the military before joining Daesh are the most prone to
choosing “suicide fighter” as their preferred option.

These descriptive results shed new light on debates in the literature on the determinants of
violent extremism, but also open new avenues. Existing studies have either resorted to small
samples to study individuals involved in acts of violence (e.g. Hegghammer 2006, Jenkins 2011 ),
or exploited larger, representative samples but then had to focus on expressions of radical
opinions (e.g. Bhatia and Ghanem 2016, Kiendrebeogo and Ianchovichina 2016) rather than
actual commitment to the use of violence. In contrast, we are able to describe a large sample of
individuals who have acted on their radical beliefs. An important finding is that these individuals
are far from being uneducated or illiterate. Most claim to have attended secondary school and a
large fraction have gone on to study at university. Notably, Daesh recruits from Africa, South and
East Asia and the Middle East are significantly more educated than individuals from their cohort

in their region of origin. The vast majority of them declared having an occupation before joining
the organization.

Our data are also unique in showing that Daesh recruits travel to Syria with diverse aspirations:
some of them want to help administer the organization, others are willing, or desire, to end their
life at its service. Others simply want to fight. As shown above, these aspirations correlate with

very different characteristics, which further suggests the heterogeneity of motives that underlies
the concept of radicalization.

The Determinants of Radicalization into Violent Extremism
The first question we address is: What drives the likelihood that a country will be supplying
extremist recruits to Daesh? Can we identify some variables that capture various dimensions of
exclusion --- economic, social, or political --- that affect the propensity of a country to have some
of its citizens join the terrorist group?
Before addressing radicalization per se, we look at demographic and geographic variables that
capture more “mechanical” factors linking country characteristics and Daesh membership. We
expect countries with larger populations, and larger Muslim populations, to be more likely,
ceteris paribus, to have at least one of its residents join the extremist group. Along the same
lines, everything else remaining constant, larger distances to Syria are expected to increase the
cost of travelling there, hence lowering the propensity of radicalized individuals to end up joining
Daesh’s foreign recruits.

Economic development variables, such as a country’s per capita GDP, have an ambiguous
influence on an individual’s propensity to join the radical group. While wealthier people have
more to lose (a higher opportunity cost) by risking their lives, they are also more likely to have
the means to afford their trip to Syria and Iraq. On the other hand, indicators of economic
inclusion or lack thereof ---such as unemployment rates--- should predict higher rates of
radicalization as economic exclusion might both generate more grievances and be associated
with a lower opportunity cost of joining Daesh.

Figure 2.8 panels 1-4 shows the association between determinants of radicalization and the
propensity for that country to supply Daesh recruits. Panels 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 confirm our initial
hypothesis that larger distances make it costlier for would-be Daesh recruits to actually make it
to Syria (panel 2.8.1). Looking at overall economic development, we find that wealthier countries
as measured by their per capita GDP, are more likely to be supplying foreign recruits for the
terrorist group (panel 2.8.3). Similar patterns are found when using the Human Development
Index as a proxy for economic development. This result is consistent with a number of other
studies that come to a similar conclusion: poverty is not a driver of radicalization into violent
extremism (see for example Abadie 2006, Krueger and Maleckova 2003). Looking at measures of
economic inclusion however, panel 2.8.4 shows a strong association between a country’s male
unemployment rate and the propensity of that country to supply Daesh foreign recruits. This
result echoes the findings of Bhatia and Ghanem (2016) who show, using opinion polls for a
sample of eight Arab countries, that unemployment among the educated leads to a greater
probability to hold radical ideas. Similarly, Kiendrebeogo and Ianchovichina (2016) draw on



                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR      OCTOBER 2016      18
information on attitudes toward extreme violence from 27 developing countries around the
world and find an association between radical views and unemployment or economic hardship.

Furthermore, we fail to detect any robust correlation between the propensity to be a supplier of
Daesh recruits and measures of socio-economic diversity such as the Gini coefficient, which
measures income inequality, and various measures of fractionalization that capture a country’s
ethnic, linguistic, or religious diversity.

Economic Determinants




Conclusion
The analysis of Daesh personnel files has allowed shedding some light on radicalization and its
determinants. To the extent that the findings presented here apply more generally, we can draw
a few conclusions. While terrorism is not associated with poverty and low levels of education,
the lack of inclusion seems to be a risk factor of radicalization into violent extremism. Moreover,
unemployment certainly has explanatory power. Policies that promote job creation, therefore,
not only benefit young people seeking jobs, but may help thwart the spread of violent extremism
and its attendant effects on national and regional economic growth.
