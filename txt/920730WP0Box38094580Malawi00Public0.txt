THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Obtain approval of plan from the City Council

        The general procedure for obtaining the approval of the project plan is
        as follows:

        1. BuildCo arranges for a private engineering consultant to complete
        the building plans. The plans must be prepared by licensed architects
        and signed by an engineer. However, the type of engineer is not
        specified, so they do not have to know anything about construction.
        There is an abusive practice of architects / engineers signing plans
        prepared by technicians who worked independently without actually
        reviewing them simply to obtain the payment.

        2. BuildCo completes the “application for permission to develop or to
        subdivide land” and a by-laws form, and submits the forms and the
        plans to the City Council with payment of a fee based on the size of the
        building and the assessed value of the land.
   1                                                                               60 days          MWK 32,734
        3. The plans and application are then forwarded to a technical panel for
        consideration. The panel’s members are representatives from the
        following organizations:

        • Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi
        • Malawi Telecommunications Limited
        • Water Board

                                                                                   complete
      The panel reviews the building plans and application and either
      approves the development or suggests amendments. If the panel
      requires amendments, BuildCo is notified by mail of the changes
      required. BuildCo can also contact the City Council by phone or in
      person to inquire about the status of the application.

      A water connection application is filed along with the site plan. If the
      panel accepts the application, it is forwarded to the Town and Country
      Planning Committee, which meets monthly. The committee notifies
      BuildCo by mail and a notice of decision, a legally binding document,
      and the by-laws form are issued.

      The meeting of the City Planning Committee takes place only once a
      month, and the Technical Panel meets only once every 2 weeks.
      However, companies may choose to opt for a fast-track option which
      allows companies to convene an emergency meeting of the Town and
      Planning Committee at a higher fee charged on top of standard fees.
      The fee for a fast-track option would be MWK 50,000. In this case, the
      meeting will take place within about one week of the payment being
      made. BuildCo will receive an oral decision at the end of the meeting. If
      there is an affirmative decision, construction can begin right away. The
      official document will be issued soon after. In practice however, this
      option is seldom used seldom by companies. Many companies plan
      ahead of the time and have prior consultations with the municipal
      officials.

      Under normal circumstances under Town and Country Planning Act, the
      Planning Committee should either approve the application or inform
      the applicant why it cannot be approved within 60 days of the
      application being submitted. In reality, this does not happen often.
      However, the silence-is-consent rule applies. If after 60 days there is no
      response, construction can begin.

      As of May 1, 2004 the cost according to Blantyre City Council is 0.8% or
      construction cost + MWK 800.00 (local tax) + MWK 100.00 (application
      fee).

      * Submit project brief and obtain certificate of EIA (environmental

      Affairs Department

      Unless a project is likely to have a significant environmental impact,
      project developers can prepare and submit a project brief with little or
      no assistance from environmental specialists. Since projects and their
2     stage in the project cycle vary widely, detailed guidelines for the          15 days      MWK 5,000
      content of a project brief are not possible. However, Section 24 of the
      Environmental Management Act requires that a project brief should at
      least state:

      1. The nature of the project;
      2. The activities that shall be undertaken;
      3. The possible products and by-products anticipated;

      5. The area of land, air or water that may be affected; and
      6. Any other matters as may be prescribed.

      More generally, a project brief should also contain:

      1. A basic description of the project purpose, size, location and
      preliminary design, including any alternatives which are being
      considered (i.e., site, technology, construction and operation
      procedures, handling of waste).
      2. The stage of the project in the project cycle.
      3. A location map of the project site or site alternatives, and a site plan
      as it is currently known. Maps and plans should conform to the
      standards discussed below.
      4. A discussion of which aspects of the project are likely to cause
      environmental concerns and the proposed environmental management
      measures.

      Notify the City Council of the commencement of construction and
      receive inspection

      During the construction phase of an approved project, the City
      Assembly sends out inspectors at various stages of construction.
      Inspectors from the City Assembly’s Departments of Building,
      Environment and Health, and Fire join the national-level Occupational
      Safety, Health, and Welfare Department to inspect the construction site
      approximately five times. These inspectors come as a team, and there is
      no charge for these visits.

3     The Building Department issues six cards that specify when a building         14 days       no charge
      should be inspected. BuildCo notifies the inspectors by sending a card
      at the appropriate stage of construction. The City Assembly inspectors
      come within 2 days to 2 weeks of notification. However in reality many
      do not come due to scarcity of resources. In practice, builders continue
      construction after submitting the notice without waiting for the
      inspection.

       Search for encumbrances at the Lands Registry

       Parties conduct a search at the Deeds Registry to ensure that no
       encumbrances are still pending on the property. The search can be
       conducted either by the title number (faster) or by plot number (slower).
       Malawi still has two systems of land title registration i.e. Title registration
       under the Registered Land Act and Title registration under the Deeds
       Registration Act. The former is simpler and searches are also simpler and
       quicker. If it is just one property search it takes no more than 15 minutes         1 day           MWK 5,000

       in the Title Registry but it may take longer in the Deeds Registry because
       of cross-referencing. For one property it could take on average about an
       hour. An official search certificate may be issued if the parties request
       one. The search certificate details all subsisting entries in the register of
       the property at the date of the search.

       Obtain City rates clearance certificate

       A letter is sent to the City Assembly to obtain a City rates clearance
       certificate. The parties search for unpaid city taxes on the property at the
       Municipality, which is free of charge . The system is computerized and it
       is just a matter of punching in the Rate Payer's details and the account
       comes up on the screen with all outstanding taxes. One can call to obtain         1 - 3 days            MWK 500

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
technology. Lower-income economies often work on                  recorded in Malawi (table 10.1)?
