    • Basic	Prosecutor’s	Offices:	58	web	sites	
    • Higher	Prosecutor’s	Offices:		25	web	sites	
    • Appeal	Prosecutor’s	Office:	4	web	sites	
	
The	analysis	was	conducted	based	on	30	relevant	sources	in	the	period	between	October	27th	
2016	 and	 February	 10th	 2017.	 The	 data	 was	 gathered	 through	 the	 web	 access	 to	 the	
prosecutor’s	office	web	sites,	as	well	as	through	direct	communication	with	the	prosecutor’s	
offices.		
	
The	analysis	covers	the	aspect	of	uniformity	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	sites,	as	well	as	the	
technological-administrative	aspect,	through	the	following	categories:	
	
    • Presence	on	the	internet	
    • Finance	and	development	
    • Availability	on	the	internet	
    • Administrative-technical	presentment	
    • Specific	contents	and	online	services	
    • User	interface		
    • Compatibility	with	mobile	platforms	
    • Design	and	visual	identity	
    • Content	Storage	-	“Web	Hosting”	
    • Content	management

RESULTS	AND	RECOMMENDATIONS	
	
PRESENCE	ON	THE	INTERNET	
       	
1. Prosecutor’s	Offices	in	the	Republic	of	Serbia	have	been	present	on	the	internet	since	
   2007.	The	chart		below	shows	number	of	prosecutor	offices	websites	that	are	developed	
   in	period	2007-2016.

2. A	significant	number	of	prosecutor’s	offices	still	does	not	have	a	web	page.	 It	is	very	
   important	that	all	prosecutor’s	offices	have	their	own	web	sites,	so	as	to	enable	end	users	
   to	access	the	prosecutor’s	offices	services	and	information	on	the	internet.		
	
                     Presence	of	the	prosecutor’s	offices	on	the	internet	




                                            16%

                                     84%

FINANCE	AND	DEVELOPMENT		
	
3. The	development	of	the	majority	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	pages	is	self-financed	and	
   /or	 self-supported.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 individual	 initiatives	 for	 the	 development	 of	
   websites,	content	and	visual	identity	of	the	websites	significantly	differs.		
       	
                       Development	of	the	web	page	is	supported	by	



                                 6%




                                                                      NONE
                                                                      GOVERNMENT

                                      94%




                                                                                	
       	
4. A	significant	number	of	prosecutor’s	offices	participated	in	designing	and	developing	
   their	web	sites.		                                                                                  Comment [MMB1]: Does	it	mean	that	POs	have	IT	experts	who	
                                                                                                       developed	websites?	
	
                                                                                                       Comment [MOU2]: I	wouldn’t	say	expert	but	definitely		person	
                 Creation	and	development	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	sites		                           or	persons	who	developed	the	website.	
                                                                                                       In	phone	conversation	we	agreed	to	consult	Tomo	with	this

                                 88%

AVAILABILITY	ON	THE	INTERNET	
	
5. All	 existing	 prosecutor’s	 office	 web	 site	 system	 services	 and	 structures	 are	 up-	 and	
   running.	Continuous	and	easy	access	to	prosecutor’s	office	web	sites	is	important,	so	end	
   users	can	easily	access	prosecutor’s	office	services	over	the	internet.		
	
ADMINISTRATIVE	–	TECHNICAL	PRESENTMENT	
	
6. Majority	 of	 prosecutor’s	 office	 web	 pages	 are	 registered	 under	 the	 official	 domain	
   (*.jt.rs).	A	few	prosecutor’s	offices	are	registered	different	domains.	It	is	recommended	
   that	 all	 of	 the	 prosecutor’s	 offices	 web	 sites	 are	 registered	 under	 the	 same	 domain	
   (*.jt.rs).	It	is	recommended	that	all	prosecutor’s	offices	remain	unified	under	a	specific	-
   technical	entity,	so	as	to	assure	the	users	to	the	validity	of	content	and	services	of	the	
   web	site.		
        	
                         Presentation	of	prosecutor’s	office	on	the	internet	




                                      14%


                                                                                 Yes    No


                                                86%



                                                                                             	
	
SPECIFIC	CONTENT	
	
7. It	is	evident	that	the	structure,	content	and	services	of	prosecutor’s	offices	web	sites	
   vary	significantly.	It	is	recommended	that	the	structure	of	content	and	electronic	services,	
   be	equalized	through	a	centralized/decentralized	system	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	sites.		
8. Specific	content	is	assessed	through	presence	of	the	following	segments	and	structures	
   on	the	prosecutor’s	office	websites:	
   a. Availability	 of	 the	 forms	 and	 templates,	 so	 that	 the	 end	 users	 can	 access	 the	
        Prosecutor’s	Office	forms	and	templates	directly	through	the	internet.	The	presence	
        of	Forms	and	Templates	on	the	internet	leads	directly	to	the	Prosecutor’s	Office	end	
        service	 improvement	 and	 reduces	 the	 workload	 for	 single	 PO’s	 staff.	 In	 the	 chart	
        below	 it’s	 evident	 that	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 websites	 have	 that	 option	 on	 their	 web	
        locations,	but	significant	number	of	PO’s	web	sites	still	don’t.

                                                  69%                      No




                                                                                            	
	
    b. Availability	of	the	general	information	of	the	single	Prosecutor’s	office,	so	the	end	
       users	 can	 find	 out	 more	 details	 about	 Prosecutor’s	 Office.	 In	 the	 chart	 below	 it’s	
       evident	that	majority	of	the	websites	have	that	option	on	their	web	location.

    c. Availability	 of	 the	 electronic	 contact	 section,	 so	 the	 end	 users	 can	 contact	 the	
       Prosecutor’s	 Office	 directly	 through	 internet.	 In	 the	 chart	 below	 it’s	 evident	 that	
       majority	of	the	websites	have	that	option	on	their	location.	Also	a	certain	number	of	
       Prosecutor’s	 Office	 websites	 developed	 a	 contact	 service	 operating	 through	 a	 web	
       form	that	does	not	require	a	configured	e-mail	client	on	the	end	user’s	device	side.

9. In	 most	 cases	 the	 web	 sites	 are	 updated	 periodically.	 It	 is	 recommended	 that	 the

USER	INTERFACE	
	
10. Unevenness	 of	 structure	 and	 various	 user	 interface	 components	 is	 evident	 through	
    different	usability,	structure	of	components	and	performances	of	the	user	interface,	as	
    well	 as	 the	 W3C	 standard	 compatibility1,	 which	 assures	 access	 on	 all	 devices	 and	
    platforms.	 Equalization	 and	 centralized	 development	 of	 the	 user	 interface	 is	
    recommended	through	the	centralized/decentralized	system	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	
    sites.

COMPATIBILITY	WITH	MOBILE	PLATFORMS		
    	
12. A	significant	number	of	web	sites	does	not	have	mobile	platform	version.	 Due	to	the	
    increasing	number	of	smart	mobile	devices,	it	is	necessary	to	update	the	user	interface	
    for	mobile	platforms	as	well.	Central	development	of	user	interface	(figure	9)	would	be	
    the	main	solution.

STORAGE	OF	CONTENTS	OF	PROSECUTOR’S	OFFICE	WEB	SITES	–	“WEB	HOSTING”		
         	
15. The	content	of	the	majority	of	prosecutor’s	office	web	sites	is	located	on	a	public	web
