Executive Summary




T
         his paper reviews the key findings of a modeling analysis exploring the implications of the
         South African carbon tax. A carbon tax, in conjunction with the recycling of revenues, has
         been designed by the National Treasury as one of the key mitigation instruments in helping
         South Africa meet its international commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG)
         emissions by 42 percent relative to business-as-usual by 2025 and for emissions to follow a
‘peak plateau and then decline’ trajectory. The carbon tax is also expected to support a structural
change in the South African economy and preemptively avoid any risks to the economy that might
arise from its trade partners introducing Border Carbon Adjustments. The modeling work reported
in this paper differs from earlier analyses of the possible impact of a carbon tax in South Africa by
more closely reflecting the actual design features of the tax proposed by the National Treasury.

The analysis suggests that the carbon tax will have a significant impact in reducing the country’s
emissions. The results of the simulations show that the tax policy would lead to an estimated
decrease in emissions of 13 to 14.5 percent by 2025 and 26–33 percent by 2035 compared with
business-as-usual. This suggests that the policy would make an important contribution towards
reaching the 42 percent reduction by 2025 target,1 but would need to be complemented by
additional policies if this target is to be met. Alternatively, a higher carbon tax rate than currently
envisaged could be adopted.

These emissions reductions are delivered while realising sustained growth in the economy. The
carbon tax is expected to lead to a reduction in the annual average growth rate of the economy
of just 0.05–0.15 percentage points compared to business-as-usual. In other words, instead of the
economy growing at 3.5 percent per year, it grows at 3.3–3.4 percent per year. This means that GDP
in 2035 could be between 1 and 3 percent lower than in a situation in which the carbon tax is not
introduced. Sensitivity analysis shows that the carbon tax would have a similar modest impact even
if the economy is expected to grow at a lower medium-term growth rate of 2.4 percent per year.

The carbon tax also has a small impact on other macroeconomic aggregates such as employment,
consumption and real wages. These variables provide some proxy for the distributional impacts
of the tax, which has been a key consideration in the design of the tax. In the ‘focus scenario’,2 the
annual growth rate in household consumption falls by just 0.23 percentage points, from 3.2 percent
to 2.9 percent. Annual growth in the rate of employment falls by just 0.07 percentage points, while
the growth rate in real wages falls from 0.6 to 0.4 percent per year.




1	    It is important to note, however, that the baseline assumptions and model used here differ from those used in other official government
analyses.
2	    The study focuses on a particular tax and recycling combination which closely resembles the design proposed by the National Treasury:
the tax scheme and proposed tax-free allowances are applied to all sectors and removed at a rate of 10 percentage points per annum while
the recycling scheme used is an output-based rebate on all production. While the recycling scheme does not exactly mirror the recycling
option proposed by the National Treasury in November 2015 release (South Africa National Treasury, 2015), it is an approach which recycles
the revenues broadly across many actors in the South African economy as some elements of the proposed November 2015 recycling mea-
sures also do.

       Consistent with the carbon tax’s objective of promoting structural change, there are a number of
       important sectoral winners and losers from the tax. In 2035, the output from the nuclear generation,
       wind generation, hydro generation, other generation, gas generation and solar photovoltaic (PV)
       generation sectors is expected to be more than 200 percent greater than without a carbon tax.
       This reflects the basic intuition that these low—and zero-carbon sources of power become much
       more cost competitive with a carbon tax. At the same time, coal generation becomes much less
       cost-competitive and, as a result, its output is 46 percent lower in 2035 than it would be without the
       tax. Other sectors that see a substantial decline in output relative to the baseline include petroleum
       refining, other manufacturing, coke production and the electricity supply sector. It should, however,
       be stressed that this is a relative decline in output compared with the situation in which there is no
       carbon tax; all of these sectors are projected to grow in absolute terms between 2014 and 2035—
       by between 18 (coal generation) and 105 percent (other manufacturing)—even with a carbon tax.

       But the vast majority of sectors are largely unaffected by the introduction of the tax. In the focus
       scenario in 2035, 33 of the 53 sectors modeled in the study (accounting for around 80 percent of
       the current output of the South African economy) would see a change in output of less than 10 per-
       cent per sector as a result of the carbon tax. These include core sectors such as financial services
       (output increases by 3 percent in 2035 under the carbon tax scenario relative to the baseline); metal
       ores (output is unchanged in the carbon tax scenario relative to the baseline); and agriculture (out-
       put increases by 2 percent in 2035 in the carbon tax scenario relative to the baseline). This reflects
       both the fact that carbon costs are a relatively small cost driver for many sectors of the economy,
       and the benefits that many sectors see as a result of the recycling of revenues.

       The modeling suggests that concerns over the competitiveness impacts of the carbon tax are
       overstated. It suggests that exports in 2035 could be 3.5 percent higher with the introduction of the
       carbon tax. This reflects a combination of the benefits that some sectors get from the recycling of
       tax revenues, plus some sectors reorienting domestic production to international markets. Certain
       sectors are materially affected, however. The sectors projected to see notable declines in exports
       include the coke oven and iron and steel sectors, although in the latter case the sector’s exports
       continue to grow over the period to 2035, just at a lower rate than if there were no carbon tax. The
       challenging export conditions for some sectors should also be seen in the context of the strong
       benefits for other sectors: the transport equipment, electrical machinery, and textiles and footwear
       sectors are all expected to see increases in the annual growth rate of exports of around 7 percent
       as a result of the carbon tax plus revenue recycling, leading to their exports in 2035 being around
       30–40 percent higher than in the baseline.

       By not phasing out the tax-free allowances built into the early phases of the carbon tax design, the
       carbon tax would be substantially less environmentally effective, although it would also mean that
       the already modest impact on the macroeconomy would be even smaller. In the focus scenario
       results discussed above, the tax-free thresholds in the 2016–20 period are gradually phased out
       from 2021. If these tax-free thresholds were to persist between 2021 and 2035 then the emission
       reductions delivered by the carbon tax would fall significantly: from 33 percent below the business-
       as-usual baseline to just 26 percent. At the same time, without the phaseout of tax-free allowances,
       the level of GDP in 2035 is 1 percent lower than in the baseline, compared with 3 percent in the
       case where the tax-free allowances are phased out.

       The method of revenue recycling is also an important driver of the results. In the focus scenario,
       revenues are assumed to be recycled through a broad-based rebate on production for all sectors.
       The modeling shows that if revenues were recycled in a narrow way—in the case modeled, by
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                        ix




providing all revenues as subsidies to the solar industry—then the abatement impact delivered
by tax would be much stronger (emissions in 2035 would be 46 percent lower than the baseline,
compared with 33 percent in the focus scenario). However, the impact on economic performance
would be much greater (the change in annual economic growth would be 2.7 percent rather than
3.3 percent under the focus scenario). The current plans of the National Treasury for recycling reve-
nues combine elements of broad-based recycling (a reduction in the electricity levy) with additional
targeted support for certain sectors that are important for the structural transformation of the South
African economy (a credit for the premium charged for renewable energy).

Introduction

Motivation for and approach to modeling the impact of a
carbon tax




I
    n 2009, at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) in Copenhagen, South Africa made a voluntary
    commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 34 percent in 2020 and 42 percent in
    2025 relative to business-as-usual. This was part of a wider commitment by South Africa to contribute to
    the global effort in mitigating anthropogenic climate change and to transition to a green economy. This
    was reaffirmed in its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) submission to the UNFCCC,
in advance of COP 21 in Paris in 2015, which envisages that emissions will peak by 2025 and plateau
for approximately a decade, before beginning to decline in absolute terms from 2036 (South African
Government, 2015).

The South African government has identified a carbon tax, along with recycling of the revenues raised,
as a key policy instrument for contributing to the country’s GHG emissions reduction goal. In May 2013
the National Treasury published its ‘Carbon Tax Policy Paper: Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and
Facilitating the Transition to a Green Economy’ (South Africa National Treasury, 2013), which outlines the
proposed design for the carbon tax and various revenue recycling options. The tax is designed to provide
a price signal to producers and consumers of carbon intensive products, creating an incentive to invest
in cleaner technology and reduce emissions. It is also intended to facilitate a smooth transition to a low
carbon economy (structural reform) in South Africa, and preempt any possible impacts on trade with
countries that may implement Border Carbon Adjustments.

The design of the carbon tax is intended to balance South Africa’s mitigation goals with the need to reduce
poverty and maintain trade competitiveness. While providing a price signal to encourage the transition to
a low-carbon economy, the proposed policy is also intended to reduce the risk of negative competitiveness
implications and leakage through special provisions for sectors considered to be at risk. In addition, it
is proposed that revenues raised from the tax be recycled back into the economy to help address any
potential negative impacts on the welfare of poorer households.

Specifically, the key features of the proposed tax policy, as laid out in the Carbon Tax Policy Paper 2013 and
subsequent documentation, are the following:

 •	 the tax is to be levied on Scope 1 emissions—these are emissions that result from fuel combustion,
    gasification and nonenergy industrial processes;

 •	 the tax will be levied at R120/tCO2-equiv starting in 2016;

 •	 the tax rate is set to increase by 10 percent per annum over the first five years (to reach R175.69 in
    2020);

 •	 a 60 percent basic tax-free allowance will apply to all sectors during the first five years;
2               M O D E L L I N G T H E I M PA C T O N S O U T H A F R I C A’ S E C O N O M Y O F I N T R O D U C I N G A C A R B O N TA X




         •	 a further tax-free allowance of up to 10 percent is available to firms in ‘trade-exposed’ sectors;

         •	 a further 10 percent tax-free allowance will be provided to firms in sectors where there is a structural or
            technical inability to make reductions (i.e. process emissions);

         •	 firms will be able to use domestic offsets in relation to 5 or 10 percent of their gross tax liability
            (i.e. before the impact of exemptions);

         •	 full exemption during the initial five-year period has been proposed for the agriculture, forestry and
            other land use activities as well as waste management sectors;

         •	 a ‘Z-factor’ will be introduced which will reward firms that have lower emissions relative to others in the
            same sector, with a further tax-free allowance of up to 5 percent;

         •	 an additional 5 percent tax-free allowance will be available to companies participating in the carbon
            budget process (a detailed overview of this is provided below); and

         •	 revenue from the tax will be recycled to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and to protect
            poorer households and vulnerable sectors from the impact of energy price increases.

    In November 2015, the media statement accompanying the Draft Carbon Bill identified more specifically
    how the revenue raised by the carbon tax would be recycled. It outlines the following measures (South
    Africa National Treasury, 2015):

         •	 funding for the energy efficiency tax incentive already being implemented;

         •	 a reduction in the electricity levy;

         •	 additional tax relief for roof top (embedded) solar PV energy as already provided for the in 2015 tax
            legislation;

         •	 a credit for the premium charged for renewable energy (wind, hydro and solar, as per the Integrated
            Resource Plan);

         •	 additional support for free basic electricity to low-income households; and

         •	 additional allocations for public transport.

    It also confirms that measures to encourage the shift of some freight from road to rail will be supported.

    Modeling the impacts of the carbon tax can aid in the decision making process by informing policy
    design and increase understanding of the likely implications for key stakeholders. While modeling studies
    examining the impact of a possible carbon tax study in South Africa have been undertaken in the past
    (Alton et al., 2012; Devarajan, Go, Robinson, & Thierfelder, 2009; Pauw, 2007; van Heerden et al., 2006),
    these have not been closely aligned with the specific design outlined in the National Treasury’s 2013 paper.
    This study aims to address this gap by simulating the effect of the proposed tax design as accurately as
    possible3 and hence provide a stronger evidence base to inform debate and discussion about the policy,
    especially its likely impact on macroeconomic aggregates such as GDP, consumption and exports. It can
    also provide insights into the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to the detailed design
    of the policy, including the method of revenue recycling and the speed at which any tax-free allowances

    3	   It has not been possible to reflect every aspect of the proposed carbon tax design in the modeling approach, but most key design aspects are
    captured.
INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                                        3




are reduced or removed. However, it should be noted that the specification of the model does not allow as
wide a consideration of different revenue recycling options as have been considered in the South African
policy debate.

The carbon tax is only one of a number of instruments being designed to address South Africa’s emissions;
in particular, the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) is also developing ‘company level carbon
budgets’. A carbon budget is envisaged to be a GHG emissions allowance (i.e. cap), against which physical
emissions arising from the operations of a company during a defined time period will be tracked. This
modeling exercise considers only the likely impacts of the carbon tax and does not consider the carbon
budgets.4 In the period before 2020, the carbon budget will not be a compliance instrument, while beyond
2020 the precise way in which they will operate, and their interaction with the carbon tax, is yet to be
defined. As such, the modeling work does not consider what impact the carbon budgets may have on
South Africa’s emissions, or how the carbon tax and carbon budgets will interact.




4	     Subsequent to the modelling analysis being undertaken, a decision was reached that an additional 5 percent tax-free allowance towards a
company’s carbon tax liability is provided to help encourage providing information to inform carbon budgets in the period up to 2020. This is not
reflected in the modelling.

The study uses the University of Pretoria General Equilibrium Model (UPGEM)—a dynamic general equi-
librium model of the South African economy. This model provides a quantitative description of the South
African economy, and is able to account for linkages and interactions between the various sectors and
agents within the economy. The standard UPGEM used in this study was slightly modified in order to be
able to conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of the tax on the electricity generation mix and emissions.
As a result, this model incorporates 53 industry sectors, including renewable power producers.

General equilibrium models such as UPGEM have both advantages and disadvantages in terms of analys-
ing the impacts of policies. Models of this type work (‘close’) by assuming that producers minimise costs
while consumers maximise utility, and that in equilibrium the markets will clear. This framework allows for
an understanding of the whole economy impact of policies while accounting for interactions both between
sectors, and between product markets and factor markets (so-called ‘general equilibrium’ impacts). As such,
it provided a comprehensive methodology for undertaking economy-wide policy analysis The explicit ability
to capture impacts over different time periods and to look at the results for individual sectors is also a useful
feature of this modeling approach. However, due to the data requirements involved, most computable gen-
eral equilibrium (CGE) models, including models like UPGEM, are not able to analyse the detailed compet-
itive interactions that might result from a carbon tax within a particular sector or market—for example, what
types of firm will be more or less affected by the carbon tax.

The modeling analysis relies on a comparison between a baseline scenario and various ‘policy scenarios’.
In order to measure the impacts of introducing the carbon tax on the economy, a business-as-usual, or
baseline scenario is established. The baseline is then compared with the expected evolution of the econ-
omy when a particular form of carbon tax and revenue recycling scheme is introduced. The difference in
the evolution of the economy between the baseline and each policy scenario is informative of the impact of
different tax designs. The subsections below provide more detail on these scenarios.



Baseline scenarios

The baseline scenario is a plausible evolution of the economy without the introduction of the carbon tax,
based on the currently available data; two baselines are used in the analysis to understand whether and
how a change in the baseline affects the expected impact of the tax. The baselines are based on a com-
bination of historical trends plus generally accepted macroeconomic forecasts of South Africa’s economy
from specialists. The main results are presented against a baseline scenario of annual GDP growth of
3.5 percent from 2016 onwards, constant inflation at 5.5 percent, and population growth of 1 percent per
6               M O D E L L I N G T H E I M PA C T O N S O U T H A F R I C A’ S E C O N O M Y O F I N T R O D U C I N G A C A R B O N TA X




    year. This baseline was based on GDP forecasts produced by CEPII,5 inflation within the Treasury’s target
    range, and steady state employment (based on information in 2014). In addition, the analysis explores how
    a more conservative baseline affects the expected impact of the tax. In the alternative baseline (based on
    more recent estimates), the economy grows at a more modest rate of 2.4 percent per year between 2018
    and 2035. The population growth rate is unchanged from the original baseline of 1 percent per year. A table
    of assumptions used in both baselines is provided in the appendix.

    The method of baseline construction means that relatively little attention should be given to what model-
    ing analysis suggests the absolute level of emissions in the South African economy will be, with or without
    a carbon tax; rather, attention should focus on what change in emissions will result from the tax. There are
    two important features of both baseline scenarios.

         •	 No explicit assumptions were made regarding future improvements to efficiency and costs competitive-
            ness of clean technologies relative to fossil fuel based sources in the electricity generation mix. It is also
            assumed that the ratio of each electricity generation technology relative to total electricity generation
            remain fixed in the baseline relative to 2014 values.

         •	 Economy-wide CO2 emissions are assumed to increase in line with GDP. This is different from other
            forward looking projections of emissions in South Africa without a carbon tax. For example, in the
            ‘SO Low’ scenario in the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) Update Report (Department of Energy (South
            Africa), 2013), developed through a different modeling approach, emissions reductions are achieved
            through changing the energy mix in the electricity sector, without the introduction of a carbon tax.
            This implies that, even before considering the impact of a carbon tax, the actual generation mix and
            build programme could be very different than that specified in the baselines for this study. Similarly, the
            Department for Environmental Affairs’ ‘With Existing Measures’ (WEM) scenario (DEA, 2014), excluding
            a carbon tax, identifies an emissions level of 1,000 MTCO2-equiv compared with the 1,220 MTCO2-
            equiv6 in the main baseline scenario used in this study.

    While the modeling approach adopted in this paper provides a valuable perspective that allows under-
    standing of the impact of the tax on the overall economy in isolation, and the associated behavioural
    changes it may lead to, the above features mean that little attention should be given to what the modeling
    analysis suggests will be the absolute level of emissions in the South African economy after the introduction
    of the carbon tax. Any such estimates will be partly determined by expectations of what emissions will be
    without the carbon tax, with other modeling approaches suggesting that this could be significantly lower
    than the baseline used in this analysis. The focus should rather be on what the modeling analysis suggests
    regarding the change in emissions delivered by the carbon tax.

    Neither baseline scenario takes into account any possible negative impacts from climate change and
    unabated emissions (the cost of inaction), or some of the benefits from reducing emissions that would not
    be realised in the baseline. In particular, the fact that air pollution (with its knock on impacts on morbid-
    ity), traffic congestion and road safety will all be worse in the baseline scenario than when a carbon tax is
    introduced, is not taken into account in the model.7 As such, the policy simulation results should not be
    viewed as providing an assessment of the overall impact of introducing a carbon tax; it is plausible that they
    underestimate the benefits of this policy intervention.

    6	   The alternative baseline scenario used in this modeling analysis results in emissions of 954 MTCO2-equiv at 2035, which is comparable to the DEA’s
    WEM scenario.
    7	   For instance, Parry, Veung, & Heine (2015) estimate that these other co-benefits alone, even before considering climate change related objectives,
    would justify a carbon tax in South Africa of around $10/tonne (2010 prices), equating to around R145/tonne at current exchange rates.

Policy scenario design

The modeling analysis considers multiple options of both tax and recycling policies in combination. In
particular, it models four different tax designs in combination with five possible recycling schemes. These
are set out below. The tax scenario and recycling mechanism are always modeled together so as to
represent the complete impact of the policy package.



Tax policy scenarios

The tax policy options vary according to the speed at which the exemptions are removed and the treatment
of emissions from the agriculture sector:

T1	 The tax is initially modeled as closely as possible to reflect the proposed design,8 and with the tax rate
    increasing by 10 percent per annum over the period 2016–21, and thereafter by the assumed inflation
    rate (which is 5.5 percent under the main baseline assumptions). In addition, the tax-free thresholds are
    held constant for the duration of the modeling period 2016–35.

T2	 The carbon tax is applied as in T1, but the tax-free allowances are gradually removed at a rate of 10
    percentage points per annum from 2021 onwards until all the industries are paying the full tax rate on
    all their emissions. The agricultural and waste sector, however, are exempt from the carbon tax at all
    times.

T3	 The tax is applied as per T1, except for the agricultural industries where the exemption is removed at a
    rate of 10 percentage points per annum from 2026.

T4	 This is a combination of T2 and T3: the tax is applied as per the National Treasury’s 2013 Carbon Tax
    policy paper, and tax-free allowances are gradually removed at a rate of 10 percentage points per
    annum, starting in 2021, for all industries except agriculture, for which phasing out begins in 2026.



Revenue recycling schemes

The recycling of revenue from the carbon tax is an integral part of the National Treasury’s proposed policy.
The study considers five recycling schemes, varying from mechanisms that recycle revenues broadly across
the economy, such as a reduction in VAT, to very narrow and focused recycling of revenues such as a subsidy
on renewable energy production. While none of these options perfectly matches the preferred approach
identified by the National Treasury in November 2015 (South Africa National Treasury, 2015), the wide spec-
trum of methodologies provides insights into the effect different recycling approaches might have.

R1	 Recycling of tax revenues is applied through an output-based rebate on all production across all sec-
    tors; thus how much firms receive depends on their own level of production.

R2	 This scenario focuses on consumers; the tax revenue is recycled through a decrease in the VAT rate on
    all the goods that make up household spending.

R3	 This is a combination of R1 and R2.

8	    Some tax relief measures included in the Carbon Tax design by the National Treasury could not be modeled in this study for technical reasons.
These measures are: the proposed Z-factor-based relief of up to 5 percent, a further 5 or 10 percent allowance for the use of offsets, and a possible 5 per-
cent allowance for firms participating in the carbon budget scheme. In addition it should be noted that process emissions are also not modeled here and
thus not accounted for in the scenarios.

    R4	 The recycling of revenue in this scenario is through a subsidy on the production of renewable electricity
        generators. For modeling purposes, the subsidies are directed at the solar PV sector.

    R5	 The tax revenue is used to decrease the VAT rate on the four commodities that make up the largest
        proportion of poor households’ consumption: agricultural goods, food, transport services, and
        beverages and tobacco.9

    In each of these scenarios the full revenue from the tax is recycled such that the government deficit is
    unchanged by the introduction of the tax.




    9	   This is a proxy for the social grants to be given to poor households. We assume that they will spend the funds on the largest items in their
    consumption baskets. Some of the goods in these groups of commodities may already be VAT exempt.

Modeling Results

Interpretation of the results from running the model



Introduction

The model suggests that the policy could be effective at stemming the growth in the country’s GHG
emissions, and hence a useful instrument, among others, in helping the country reach its emissions
reduction goals. The results of the simulations show that the tax policy would lead to an estimated decrease
in emissions of 26–33 percent compared with business-as-usual by 2035. This suggests that the policy would
go some way (13 to 14.5 percent) towards reaching the 42 percent reduction by the 2025 target,10 but,
unless the tax rate was increased to a rate higher than considered in this study, it would not be sufficient on
its own to meet it.

It also suggests that these emissions reductions can be delivered while the country enjoys strong, sustained
economic growth. The estimated effect of the carbon tax on the compound annual growth rate of GDP
is a decrease from 3.49 percent per year to 3.43–3.33 percent per year over the modeling period. This is
equivalent to a difference per year of between 0.5 and 0.16 percent. This means that GDP in 2035 could
be between 1 and 3 percent lower compared with a situation in which the carbon tax is not introduced.
The range of potential impacts arises from the differences in features such as a withdrawal rate of tax-free
allowances across the different tax scenarios used in the study.

These results are consistent with the bulk of international studies reviewing the impacts on other national
economies of carbon pricing with revenue recycling. Box 1 provides more detail of some of these analyses.

These—and other—results are explored further below. The following section explores some of the key
results from the T2R1 scenario—referred to below as the ‘focus’ scenario. In this scenario the tax-free
allowances, as laid out in the proposed design of the scheme, are gradually removed at a rate of 10
percentage points per annum for all sectors (except the agricultural industries), and there is a broad form of
revenue recycling—a rebate to all firms proportional to their output. While this form of recycling does not
mirror the currently proposed measures exactly, it shares with some of these measures a relatively broad
scope, and thus is useful for the purposes of analysis. The sensitivity of results to baseline assumptions is
also analysed in this section. The tax scenario sensitivity analysis section then describes how the results
change depending on the choice of tax scenario; while the recycling options sensitivity analysis section
explores the impact of different revenue recycling approaches. The sensitivity to baseline assumptions
section considers how changes in the baseline alter the results.




10	   In the model used here emissions are reduced by 13–14.5 percent compared with the baseline in 2025. It is important to note, however, that the
baseline assumptions and model in this study are different from those used in other official government analyses.

           BOX 1.  International comparison of tax modeling results

           Carbon tax modelling exercises have been carried out by various institutions and countries in order to better
           understand the impact of these types of policies. In most studies both tax schemes and recycling options
           are modelled to inform the tax design. The recycling options considered are similar to those covered in this
           modelling analysis: spanning VAT decreases, personal income tax reductions, and sector specific rebates.

           These exercises suggest that the impact of carbon taxes (or similar environmental taxation) on GDP is
           largely dependent on the policy design, but is generally found to be small in either direction (Bosquet, 2000;
           Hoerner, 2001; Zhang & Baranzini, 2004). Meta-studies show a range of outcomes for GDP, depending on
           country, model used and scenarios, but results tend to be close to the baseline. In reviewing modelling
           analyses in European countries, Hoerner (2001) finds a GDP impact in the range of –0.5 to +0.5 percent
           compared with baseline in two-thirds of the studies reviewed. Similar conclusions are reached in other, more
           recent reviews (Barker, Qureshi, & Köhler, 2006) (Vivid Economics, 2012).

           The results obtained for CO2 emissions impacts are more varied. Hoerner shows that some studies find emis-
           sions reductions of up to 15 percent compared with baseline. However, the study also finds examples which
           suggest that emissions could increase in cases where revenue recycling stimulates significant additional
           growth that more than offsets the reductions in emissions caused by the carbon tax.

           There are significantly fewer studies that examine the impact of carbon taxes on emerging market econ-
           omies; however, most suggest broadly similar results. For example, studies considering carbon pricing
           in Indonesia (Yusuf & Resosudarmo, 2013), China (Guo, Zhang, Zheng, & Rao, 2014; Wang et al., 2009),
           and Brazil and Mexico (Octaviano, Paltsev, & Gurgel, 2014) conclude that carbon taxes in these countries,
           when combined with revenue recycling, are likely to result in small deviations from baseline GDP, although
           Octaviano, Paltsev, & Gurgel (2014) suggest that there could be deviations in GDP relative to the baseline of
           around 4–11 percent in Mexico. Some of these studies also indicate that carbon pricing coupled with reve-
           nue recycling in developing countries is not necessarily regressive (Yusuf & Resosudarmo, 2013).




     Focus scenario

     Overall impacts

     In the focus scenario, T2R1, there is a significant reduction in emissions relative to the baseline. Emissions
     in 2035 are expected to be 33 percent lower in the T2R1 scenario than in the baseline, as shown in Figure
     1 below. While this suggests that the carbon tax alone would not be sufficient to meet South Africa’s
     intended 42 percent reduction versus business-as-usual by 2025—the emissions reduction relative to the
     baseline in this analysis is 14.5 percent in 202511—it does make a marked contribution to achieving this
     target. This highlights the need to develop a comprehensive suite of policy measures to tackle emissions
     reductions and/or the need for a higher effective carbon tax rate.

     At the same time, the economy continues to grow substantially over the period following the introduction
     of the tax: the average (compound) annual growth rate of the economy in the period to 2035 is only
     0.15 percentage points lower than in the baseline scenario. The carbon tax leads to a reduction in the
     compound annual growth rate of GDP from 3.49 percent to 3.33 percent. This results in GDP being

     11	   It should be noted that the baseline used in this modeling analysis is different from that used in previous modeling where the 42 percent reduction
     is specified.

which GDP is expected to double between 2014 and 2035).

In line with the impact on GDP, other macroeconomic aggregates are only modestly affected. Looking at
household consumption and employment provides useful additional insights into the impact of the policy
on welfare. In line with the small decrease in GDP level, these impacts are also small. The annual growth
rate in household consumption falls by just 0.23 percentage points, from 3.2 percent to 2.9 percent. This
means that the level of household consumption is 4.6 percent lower in T2R1 than in the baseline in 2035

     (in a context in which it has grown by 93 percent over the period between 2014 and 2035 in the baseline
     scenario). This small decrease in household consumption relative to the baseline is driven by the decline in
     real wages experienced as a result of the higher consumer prices that follow the introduction of the tax (see
     below). As economic activity is modestly lower, employment growth also falls by 0.07 percentage points per
     year such that it is estimated to be just 1.4 percent lower than the baseline level in 2035. Figure 3 shows the
     growth paths of employment and household consumption in the focus and baseline scenarios.

     Any distributional impacts arising from the tax are a key issue in the tax design, and minimising any adverse
     effects on the lowest-income brackets is a priority. Some insight can be provided by looking at the impact
     on real wages. Real wages are projected to increase by 13 percent over the period to 2035 under the
     baseline scenario; this translates to an average annual increase of 0.6 percent. The introduction of the tax
     will reduce this rate to 0.4 percent per year.



     Sectoral impacts

     Although the modeling suggests that the overall impact of the carbon tax on the economy is small, it
     does also indicate that there will be some important sectoral winners and losers. This is consistent with the
     objective of the policy to support the structural change to the South African economy, as discussed in the
     introduction to this report.

     Under T2R1 South Africa’s lower carbon energy sector sees significant increases in output. In 2035, output
     from the nuclear generation, wind generation, hydro generation, other generation, gas generation and
     solar PV generation sectors is expected to be more than 200 percent greater than without a carbon tax.
     This reflects the basic intuition that these low—and zero-carbon sources of power become much more
M O D E L I N G R E S U LT S                                                                                                                               13




cost competitive with a carbon tax.12 It is also predicated on all actors in the electricity generation sector
responding to the carbon tax in a commercial manner, so as to reduce costs. The nonelectricity generation
sector which sees the largest increases in output as a result of the carbon tax is the transport equipment
sector.

At the same time, some sectors see significant declines in output compared with the baseline. Coal genera-
tion becomes much less cost competitive and as a result its output is 46 percent lower in 2035 than it would
be without the tax. Other sectors that see substantial declines in output (greater than 15 percent), relative
to the baseline, include petroleum refining, other manufacturing, coke production, electricity supply, iron
and steel production and the transport services sector. The small decrease in output for these sectors is
a result of higher costs which are at least partly passed through to prices and which, in equilibrium, lead
to less production of carbon intensive goods and services and reduced demand. These price increases,
especially for instance in the electricity sector, are likely to stimulate improvements in energy efficiency
which would allow consumers and firms to undertake the same activities as before, while using less electric-
ity. It should also be stressed that all of these declines reflect a relative decline in output compared with the
situation in which there is no carbon tax; all of these eight sectors are projected to grow in absolute terms
between 2014 and 2035—by between 9 (coal generation) and 82 percent (transport services)—even with a
carbon tax.

There are also a large number of sectors for which the carbon tax makes very little difference to their
output. While attention inevitably focuses on sectors most significantly affected (either positively or nega-
tively), there are a large number of sectors for which the carbon tax makes little or no difference to output
level. For 33 of the 53 sectors modeled in the study, the change in output in 2035 as a result of the tax is less
than 10 percent in either direction, as shown in Figure 4 below. These include core sectors such as financial
services (output increases by 3 percent in 2035 relative to the baseline under the carbon tax scenario), metal

     ores (output is unchanged), and agriculture (output increases by 2 percent in 2035 relative to baseline). In
     total, the sectors that see output changes of less than 10 percent by 2035 (in either direction) account for
     81 percent of South Africa’s current economic output13. This suggests that for a large proportion of the
     South African economy the carbon tax is a very small driver of overall output.

     A typical concern of policymakers when considering a carbon pricing instrument is that it may adversely
     affect the international competitiveness of the economy. Such a concern appears misplaced in this case.
     This has already been reflected in the carbon tax design through the additional exemptions available to
     firms judged to be at risk from such a threat. Overall, the modeling analysis suggests that the effect of the
     tax on South Africa’s trade position will be limited—a small increase in the compound annual growth rate
     of exports between 2014 and 2035 from 4 percent to 4.2 percent, such that the level of exports in 2035 is
     3.5 percent higher than in the baseline scenario.

     However, there are likely to be stronger effects on certain sectors. Figure 6 presents the change in exports
     in 2035, relative to the baseline, for some of South Africa’s key export sectors.14 It shows that some of these
     sectors will see significant changes, although the impacts will be both positive and negative. The annual
     growth rate in exports from the coke production sector falls from 3.6 percent to –0.3 percent, and 3.3 per-
     cent to 1.4 percent for iron and steel, leading to a change in exports in 2035 of more than 50 percent rela-
     tive to the baseline in the case of coke, and 30 percent for iron and steel. This is likely to be a result of the
     carbon tax making it more challenging for these sectors to compete internationally. It should be stressed,
     however, that this modeling assumes that no other jurisdictions change their climate policy settings
     between today and 2035, so the analysis may exaggerate the competitiveness impacts experienced by
     these sectors. At the same time, other export sectors will see significant increases, with the transport equip-
     ment, electrical machinery and textiles and footwear sectors all expected to see increases in the annual

growth rate of exports of around 7 percent, leading to exports in 2035 being around 30–40 percent higher
compared with the baseline. This may reflect a combination of the erosion of domestic sales for some of
these products as well as the benefits that some sectors experience as a result of the modeled revenue
recycling measures (especially textiles and footwear). As with sectoral output, there are also some important
export sectors that see very little change in their export position, including ‘other mining’ and ‘metal ores’,
which are expected to experience a 2 percent decrease (other mining) and a 3 percent increase (metal ores)
in exports under the T2 tax scenario compared with baseline estimates.



Tax scenario sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis of results to different tax policy scenarios can help inform policy design. To recap, the
four tax policy scenarios are variations of the design proposed by the National Treasury in its 2013 Carbon
Tax paper—specifically:

T1	 The tax is initially modeled as closely as possible to reflect the proposed design and with the tax rate
    increasing by 10 percent per annum over the period 2016–21, and thereafter by the assumed inflation
    rate (in the main baseline scenario case this would be 5.5 percent). In addition, the tax-free thresholds
    in this scenario are held constant for the duration of the modeling period 2016–35.

T2	 The carbon tax is applied as in T1, but the tax-free allowances are gradually removed at a rate of 10
    percent per annum from 2021 onwards until all the industries are paying the full tax rate on all their
    emissions. The agricultural sector, however, is exempt from the carbon tax at all times.

T3	 The tax is applied as per T1, except for the agricultural industries where the exemption is removed at a
    rate of 10 percent per annum starting in 2026.

T4	 This is a combination of T2 and T3: the tax is applied as per the 2013 policy paper and tax-free
    allowances are gradually removed at a rate of 10 percent per annum, starting in 2021, for all industries
    except agriculture, for which phasing out begins in 2026.

To facilitate comparison, the analysis focuses on the combination of these tax scenarios with the recycling
scheme R1, which is the recycling methodology used in the focus scenario.

The slower removal of tax-free allowances significantly decreases the abatement impact of the tax. In sce-
narios T1 and T3 tax-free allowances are removed later compared with T2 and T4. As would be expected,
this means that scenarios T1 and T3 deliver a smaller reduction in emissions than T2 and T4: a reduction of
26 percent for T1 and T3 in 2035, compared with the 33 percent reduction achieved in scenarios T2 and T4
(all relative to the baseline). A stronger price signal leads to a greater reduction in emissions. The inclusion
or otherwise of the agriculture sector within the carbon tax has a negligible impact on the overall emissions
reductions realised.

Retaining the tax-free allowances results in slightly higher GDP. Specifically, in scenarios T1 and T3, average
GDP growth rate in the period up to 2035 is about 1.6 percent lower than in the baseline, compared with
a 4.3 percent deviation in growth rate in scenarios T2 and T4. However, as Figure 7 illustrates, these effects
are small in the context of the expected growth in the economy over the period as a whole. In addition,
the negligible difference in GDP impact between scenarios T2 and T4 and between T1 and T3 indicates
that the inclusion or otherwise of the agricultural sector within the carbon tax policy will have practically no
impact on the overall GDP change resulting from the carbon tax.

     Although the inclusion or exclusion of the agricultural sector has little overall effect on the impact of the
     tax on GDP, the different tax scenarios do have a varying impact on the projected output of the sector. The
     overall magnitude of the impact of the tax on the sector is small, but its exact size depends on the rate
     and timing of removal of tax-free allowances, both from the agriculture sector itself and from other sectors.
     Unsurprisingly, the timing of sector specific tax-free allowances removal is the biggest driver of agricultural
     output change: in scenarios where agricultural exemptions are left in place for longer than for the other

sectors (T2 and T4), agricultural output in 2035 is between 1.7 and 1.9 percent higher than the baseline.
However, even when tax-free allowances are removed earlier (T3) or not removed for any sectors (T1),
output remains 1.0 and 1.2 percent above the baseline, reflecting the benefit that the sector obtains from
the increase in economic activity created by the recycling of revenues.



Recycling options sensitivity analysis

The recycling of revenues, to address welfare concerns arising from the introduction of the tax, is an integral
part of the carbon tax design. The recycling scheme proposed at the time that the draft bill was published
for public comment in November 2015 aims to shield those most vulnerable to the impacts of the carbon
price (for instance through a reduction in the electricity levy), while further stimulating structural change in
the South African economy (for example through a credit for the premium charged for renewable energy
through the IPPs).

For the purposes of this modeling analysis, possible revenue recycling measures can be considered as
either broad—the revenue is allocated to a wide range of producer groups and consumers—or narrow—
purposefully directed towards certain producer or consumer groups. While the actual recycling measures
proposed by the National Treasury contain a combination of both broad (reduction in electricity levy) and
narrow (targeted support to renewable energy technologies) measures, analysing these differences helps to
illustrate important distinctions and trade-offs associated with various recycling measures. To facilitate this,
the analysis below focuses on the difference between R1, a broad-based recycling approach where reve-
nues are recycled through a rebate to all sectors based on production (the size of the rebate is determined
by the size of the output), and R4, a narrow-based recycling option where revenues are all recycled to the
solar PV sector (this is used to represent a narrow, clean energy oriented recycling scheme). This compari-
son is undertaken using the tax schedule T2.

The modeling results indicate that a broader recycling scheme will have a more positive impact on South
Africa’s GDP than a narrower, more focused scheme. Under revenue recycling scheme R1, the compound
annual growth rate of GDP falls from 3.5 percent per year under the baseline to 3.3 percent, while under
the narrower recycling scheme (R4), the growth rate falls by 0.8 percentage points per year to 2.7 percent
per year. This leads to GDP under the narrow recycling scheme being 15 percent lower than the baseline in
2035, compared with 3 percent under the broader recycling scheme—a difference of 12 percentage points.
This result is illustrated in Figure 8 below. This effect arises because narrow recycling measures, which
allocate all of the revenues to a small number of sectors, significantly distort relative prices and encourage
activity that, without the subsidy, may not generate value-added15 (GDP). By contrast, broader recycling
measures better preserve relative prices across the economy and avoid this problem.

At the same time, the modeling results suggest that a broader recycling of revenues results in a smaller
reduction in emissions than a narrower recycling approach focused on the renewable electricity sector
alone. This confirms the intuition that focusing support on the renewable electricity sector alone will
increase its competitiveness with respect to the other energy production technologies, and increase the
rate of structural transformation and thus emissions reductions. By contrast, broader recycling measures
lead to a reinjection of revenues into all productive sectors, including a number of heavily polluting sectors.
By choosing a narrower recycling scheme aimed at renewable energy, emissions reductions in 2035 could

15	    Revenue in excess of the costs of production. Each sector’s gross value added (GVA) represents, broadly speaking, its contribution to GDP. These
results are also driven by the assumption that the recycling of revenues to the solar industry does not result in any additional efficiency/cost improvements
in this sector, due to the difficulty in calibrating the magnitude of this impact. If there were efficiency improvements within the solar sector, as seems
plausible, the negative impact of this recycling approach would be smaller.

     be lowered by as much as 46 percent relative to the baseline, compared with the 33 percent reduction
     achieved under a broader distribution. Figure 9 illustrates this impact.

     The analysis also suggests important differences between recycling measures aimed at producers
     compared with those focused on consumers. In general, producer focused rebates and subsidies, such
     as R1 and R3, tend to result in a stronger positive impact on GDP than consumer centric ones such as R2
     and R5. Notably, the recycling measures proposed by the National Treasury span both consumers and
     producers.

Sensitivity to baseline assumptions

The final sensitivity analysis focuses on whether changes in the baseline assumptions lead to any significant
differences in the main findings of the study. As discussed in the focus scenario section, the original base-
line developed for the modeling analysis represents a relatively optimistic set of assumptions for the South
African economy. The alternative baseline scenario uses more conservative projections, in line with more
recent forecasts. Specifically, under this alternative baseline, economic growth slows to 0.9 percent in 2016
before increasing to 2.4 percent for the period between 2018 and 2035. This compares with the 3.5 percent
growth rate for the period 2016–35 used in the results above.16 As stressed above, the insights from the
modeling analysis are provided by comparing the policy scenarios with the baseline (the deviations); this
sensitivity analysis checks whether this comparison is affected by the choice of the baseline.

The results of the analysis show that changes to the baseline have very little impact on the change in GDP
expected from the carbon tax. Figure 10 below shows the two ‘families’ of trajectories for GDP: the base-
line, T2R1 and T2R4, with both optimistic (original) and conservative (alternative) baseline assumptions.
While the level of GDP is clearly different across the two families, the impact of the carbon tax is very similar.
In both families, T2R1 has a very small impact on GDP: the compound annual growth rate falls by only
0.15–0.18 percentage points per year in each family. Similarly, in each family, T2R4 has a more significant
impact on GDP growth, reducing the compound annual growth rate in GDP by 0.62–0.8 percentage points.

As with GDP, the deviations from the baseline of CO2 emissions are not significantly impacted by changes
to the baseline. Under the alternative baseline, T2R1 and T2R4 result in emissions levels that are 40–50 per-
cent lower, respectively, than the baseline in 2035, compared with 33–46 percent under the original baseline
assumptions. Although the deviations are greater under the revised baseline, the relative impact of the
different scenarios is very similar, as shown in Figure 11 below.

Summary




T
       he results of the simulation suggest that the introduction of a carbon tax will contribute significantly
       to South Africa’s GHG emissions reduction goals. The analysis shows estimated reductions of
       26–33 percent by 2035 compared with business-as-usual. This suggests that the policy will go
       some way towards reaching the 42 percent reduction by 2025 target,17 but would need to be
       complemented by additional policies if this target is to be met. Alternatively, the carbon tax rate
would have to be higher than considered in this analysis.

The economy will continue to grow whilst emissions are reduced. The modeling results estimate that a
carbon tax will dampen the economy’s average annual growth rate by just 0.05–0.15 percentage points. This
is to say that GDP will grow at an average 3.3–3.4 percent per year instead of the 3.5 percent growth rate
assumed in a scenario without a carbon tax. This reduction in the growth rate would lead to GDP in 2035
that could be between 1 and 3 percent lower than in a situation in which the carbon tax is not introduced.
Sensitivity analysis carried out on the assumptions underlying the baseline case shows that the carbon tax
would have a similar modest impact even if the economy is expected to grow at less than 3.5 percent per
year.

Consistent with the carbon tax’s objective of promoting structural change, there are a number of important
sectoral winners and losers from the tax. In 2035, the output from the nuclear generation, wind generation,
hydro generation, other generation, gas generation and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation sectors is
expected to be more than 200 percent greater than without a carbon tax. This reflects the basic intuition
that these low- and zero-carbon sources of power become much more cost-competitive with a carbon
tax. At the same time, coal generation becomes much less cost competitive and, as a result, its output is
46 percent lower in 2035 than it would be without the tax. Other sectors that see a substantial decline in
output relative to the baseline include petroleum refining, other manufacturing, coke production and the
electricity supply sector. It should, however, be stressed that this is a relative decline in output compared
with the situation in which there is no carbon tax; all of these sectors are projected to grow in absolute
terms between 2014 and 2035—by between 18 (coal generation) and 105 (other manufacturing) percent—
even with a carbon tax.

But the vast majority of sectors are largely unaffected by the introduction of the tax. In the focus scenario, in
2035, 33 of the 53 sectors modeled in the study—accounting for around 80 percent of the current output of
the South African economy—would see a change in output of less than 10 percent as a result of the carbon
tax. These include core sectors such as financial services (output increases by 3 percent in 2035 under the
carbon tax scenario); metal ores (output is unchanged); and agriculture (output increases by 2 percent in
2035 relative to the baseline). This reflects both the fact that carbon costs are a relatively small cost driver
for many sectors of the economy, and the benefits that many sectors see as a result of the recycling of
revenues.




17	   In the model used here emissions are reduced by 13–14.5 percent compared with the baseline in 2025. It is important to note, however, that the
baseline assumptions and model used here differ from those used in other official government analyses.

     The modeling suggests that concerns over the competitiveness impacts of the carbon tax are overstated.
     It suggests that exports in 2035 could be 3.5 percent higher with the introduction of the carbon tax. Certain
     sectors are materially affected, however. The sectors projected to see notable declines in exports include
     the coke oven and iron and steel sectors, although in the latter case the sector’s exports continue to grow
     over the period to 2035, just at a lower rate than if there were no carbon tax. The challenging export
     conditions for some sectors should also be seen in the context of the strong benefits for other sectors:
     the transport equipment, electrical machinery, and textiles and footwear sectors are all expected to see
     increases in the annual growth rate of exports of around 7 percent as a result of the carbon tax plus revenue
     recycling, leading to their exports in 2035 being around 30–40 percent higher than in the baseline.

     The magnitude of the emissions and GDP impact from the tax depends on the policy and revenue
     recycling scheme designs. The analysis shows that a tax policy with persistent tax-free allowances will yield
     substantially lower emissions reductions, but also have a slightly less negative impact on GDP growth. The
     type of recycling scheme applied also impacts both emissions and GDP: with broad, producer focused
     rebates yielding smaller GDP downside impacts but also less significant emissions reductions, whilst a
     narrow, clean energy focused rebate will lead to substantial decreases in emissions but a lower growth rate
     for the economy.

UPGEM

UPGEM is a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the South African
economy. It is similar to Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS)-style CGE models, such as MONASH or
USAGE, which are widely used in Australia to analyse the potential impacts of changes in economic
policy, especially changes in taxes, tariffs, environmental regulations and competition policy.18
UPGEM is a flexible model that can be configured to run in either comparative static, year-on-year
dynamic or long-run decomposition dynamic modes. The theoretical specification of UPGEM is
based on the MONASH model of Australia described in Dixon and Rimmer (Dixon & Rimmer,
2002). A complete exposition of the model code adopted in the core UPGEM is presented in Dixon
and Rimmer’s 2005 paper (Dixon & Rimmer, 2005).

The version of UPGEM used in this study contains several important enhancements compared
with the standard version. The motivation for these changes is to enable a more accurate and
detailed analysis of the energy sector in South Africa, in particular with regard to changes in the
electricity generation mix and measurement of carbon emissions in the economy. The changes
made to UPGEM include: i) the inclusion of an energy and gas emissions accounting module, which
accounts explicitly for each industry recognised in the model; ii) equations that allow for inter-fuel
substitution in electricity generation; and iii) mechanisms that allow for the endogenous take-up of
various abatement measures in response to GHG policy measures.

In UPGEM, emissions derived from the combustion of fuels are modeled as being directly
proportional to fuel usage. No allowance is made for the type of technological innovation that
would allow coal fired electricity producers to emit less GHG per tonne of coal combusted. On the
other hand, it does allow for input saving technological progress.

The model’s base year data, or initial solution, is for 2011 and based on the supply-use tables
published in Statistics South Africa (StatsSA, 2014). The UPGEM database used in this study
distinguishes 45 core industries and commodities, with the electricity sector then disaggregated
into eight generating sectors and one electricity distributor, to produce the final 53 sector aggre-
gation used for this study. The database, in combination with the model’s theoretical specification,
describes the main inter-linkages in the South African economy. The model is implemented and
solved using the GEMPACK suite of programs (Harrison & Pearson, 1996).



The core theory

The general equilibrium core of UPGEM is made up of a linearised system of equations describ-
ing the theory underlying the behaviour of participants in the economy. It contains core equations

     describing: the nature of markets; demands for inputs to be used in the production of commodi-
     ties; household demands; demands for inputs to capital creation and the determination of invest-
     ment; government demands for commodities; and foreign demand for exported goods.

     The specifications in UPGEM recognise each industry as producing one or multiple commodities,
     using combinations of domestic and imported commodities as inputs, different types of labour,
     capital and land. This nested production structure reduces the number of estimated parameters
     required by the model. Optimising equations determining the commodity composition of industry
     output are derived subject to a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function, while functions
     determining industry inputs are determined by a series of nests. At the top level, intermediate
     commodity composites and a primary factor composite are combined using a Leontief or fixed
     proportions production function. Each commodity composite is a constant elasticity of substitu-
     tion (CES) function of a domestic good and its imported equivalent. This incorporates Armington’s
     assumption of imperfect substitutability for goods by place of production (Armington, 1969). The
     primary factor composite is a CES aggregate of composite labour, capital and land, with composite
     labour itself a CES aggregate of different labour types. In UPGEM, all industries share this common
     production structure, but input proportions and behavioural parameters vary between industries
     based on available data and econometric estimates.

Demand and supply equations for industries and households are derived from the solutions to
the optimisation problems, which are assumed to underlie the behaviour of private sector agents
in conventional microeconomics. Each industry minimises cost subject to given input prices and
a constant returns to scale production function. Households maximise a Klein-Rubin utility func-
tion subject to their budget constraints. Units of new industry specific capital are determined as
cost minimising combinations of domestic and imported commodities. Imperfect substitutability
between sources of commodities is modeled using the Armington CES assumptions. The export
demand for any local commodity is inversely related to its foreign currency price. The price of
imports is exogenous, consistent with the assumption of South Africa being a small open economy.
Government consumption and the details of direct and indirect taxation are also recognised in the
model. Markets are assumed to be competitive, which implies that the basic price and marginal
cost of goods will be equal. The model also distinguishes trade and transport margin costs, which
are included in the purchaser’s price, but not in the basic price of goods and services.

The dynamic elements of UPGEM allow for intertemporal links describing: physical capital accu-
mulation; lagged adjustment processes for labour; and government fiscal accounts. Capital accu-
mulation is specified separately for each industry, and linked to industry specific net investment
in the preceding period. Investment in each industry is positively related to its expected rate of
return on capital. A similar mechanism for financial asset/liability accumulation is specified for the
government’s fiscal accounts. Adjustments to the national net foreign liability position of house-
holds are related to the annual investment/savings imbalance, revaluations of assets and liabilities,
and remittance flows during the year. Changes in the public sector debt are related to the public
sector deficit incurred during the year. In policy simulations, the labour market follows a lagged
adjustment path where wage rates are allowed to respond over time to gaps between demand and
supply for labour.



Model closures

For detailed CGE models such as UPGEM, the number of variables (n) will always exceed the
number of equations (m). To close the model and compute a solution, (n – m) variables must
therefore be treated as exogenous. The selection of the (n – m) exogenous variables is largely
user determined, but should be chosen to best describe the economic environment for which the
simulation is run.

With dynamic CoPS-style CGE models, the idea of flexible closures was fully extended with the
development of four functional closure categories: long-run decomposition, historical, forecasting,
and policy (Dixon & Rimmer, 2002). In dynamic CGE applications, the forecast and policy closures
are the most widely used, while the baseline forecast closure is used to produce a believable busi-
ness-as-usual picture of the future evolution of the economy.

The baseline forecast closure involves setting as exogenous a selection of variables such as the
components of GDP, the consumer price index, or population growth, based on the availability of
reliable macroeconomic forecast data, with little regard to causation. The policy closure can then
be used to evaluate the impact of an exogenous shock to the economy relative to the unperturbed
baseline scenario. The impact on macro variables, such as the components of GDP, is usually of
particular interest to policymakers and must therefore be allowed to respond to the policy change
or shock under consideration and set as endogenous again. Variables deemed to be determined

     independently of the policy scenario are set as exogenous, allowing no deviation between the
     policy and forecast simulation values for these variables. Deviations from the business-as-usual are
     typically reported as percentage point changes.



     Baseline forecast closure

     This application of the UPGEM baseline forecast uses three distinct time periods. The first is the
     historical period between the base year of 2011 and the present day, for which data already exists.
     This can inform the model in terms of what has happened over this historical period to effectively
     update the database. The second period is the baseline forecast period in the near term for which
     reliable projections exist. For UPGEM, this period usually corresponds to around 3–5 years into the
     future using macro forecasts from agencies such as the National Treasury or International Monetary
     Fund (IMF). Forecasts for the components of GDP from the income and expenditure side typically
     feature population growth and various macro price indices. The third period contains the long-
     run projections for the economy and is typically restricted to average forecast values for only a
     few main macro variables such as real GDP, population growth and inflation. The specific values
     imposed for the UPGEM baseline forecast are shown in Table 1 below.



     Policy closure

     The policy closure typically used for CoPS-style models such as UPGEM can be described as
     natural to the system of equations. That is, the variable for which the equation was written to
     explain is set as the endogenous variable. In this application of the UPGEM policy closure, specific
     changes are applied based on the design of the particular policy simulation under consideration.
     For example, to impose a carbon tax but hold the government’s budget deficit or surplus posi-
     tion unchanged relative to the baseline projection requires another variable to be endogenised.
     The choice of endogenous variables will be dictated by the policy design. For the standard policy
     closure, all variables of interest are made endogenous, while variables held fixed relative to their
     baseline projection would typically include technical changes, positions of foreign demand curves,
     and various taste and preference variables.
