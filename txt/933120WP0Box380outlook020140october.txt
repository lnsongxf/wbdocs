The World Bank’s energy price index plunged in 2014Q3
by 6 percent from a quarter before due to an across-the-
board decrease in energy prices. Crude oil reversed
course sharply (down 5.6 percent for the quarter) while
coal and natural gas prices followed suit with declines of
6.6 and 11.6 percent, respectively. Such declines followed
a period during which crude oil prices fluctuated within a
remarkably tight band around $105/bbl, which was also
within OPEC’s “desired range” (Figure 3). In fact, 2011-
13 has been one of the least volatile 3-year periods of the
recent history of the oil market.

Recent developments
For the last three years, rapid expansion of unconventional
oil production in North America (shale and tar sands) offset
supply disruptions in the Middle East almost barrel for bar-
rel (Figure 4). These developments have kept the global oil
market broadly in balance and prices within the $100-110/
bbl range. However, during 2014Q3, oil that was considered
to be off the market began returning, especially from Libya
and Iraq, which managed keep their output growing amid
internal strife. The U.S. also continued its steady growth by
adding of 1 million barrels per day (mb/d) to global output.         Source: World Bank, International Energy Agency.

its Official Selling Price in early October, to be followed
shortly by Iran and Iraq, in turn signaling the willingness of
these OPEC’s members to tolerate lower oil prices in favor
of maintaining market shares.

Increasing U.S. shale production, coupled with the grow-
ing Canadian tar sands output, contributed to a build-up of
crude oil inventories at a time when U.S. oil consumption
is moderating and natural gas supplies are increasing rapid-
ly. The stock build-up caused West Texas Intermediate

Outlook and risks
                                                                  Figure 9        Global crude oil consumption
Nominal oil prices are expected to average $102/bbl in
2014, $2/bbl lower than 2013 (Table 1). This forecast is
$4/bbl lower than the July edition of the Outlook and for
the most part reflects the easing of geopolitical tensions,
ample supplies, moderating demand, and the strengthen-
ing of the US dollar on the macro side. Oil prices are
expected to ease to $96/bbl in 2015. In the longer term,
real prices are expected to fall due to growing supplies of
unconventional oil, efficiency gains, and (less so) substi-
tution away from oil. The key assumption behind these
projections reflects the upper-end cost of developing
additional oil capacity from Canadian oil sands, currently
estimated at $90/bbl in constant 2014 dollars.

World demand for crude oil is expected to grow at less            Source: International Energy Agency.
than 1.5 percent annually over the projection period, with
all the growth coming from non-OECD countries, as has
been the case in recent years (Figure 9). Consumption             Figure 10       Energy prices
growth in OECD economies will continue to be subdued
by slow economic growth and efficiency improvements
in vehicle transport induced by high prices of the past
few years—including a switch to hybrid, natural gas, and
electrically powered transport. Pressure to reduce emis-
sions due to environmental concerns is expected to
dampen demand growth at the global level as well.

On the supply side, non-OPEC production is expected
to continue its upward climb, as high prices in the past
have prompted increased use of innovative exploration
techniques (including deep-water offshore drilling and
shale liquids) and the implementation of new extractive
technologies to increase the output from existing wells.
                                                                  Source: World Bank.
Furthermore, prices of natural gas (in the U.S.) and coal
are expected to remain low relative to crude oil and Eu-
ropean and Japanese natural gas prices as has been the            Figure 11       Natural gas prices
case during the past few years (Figures 10 & 11). Some
convergence in prices may take place but its speed (which
is expected to be slow) will depend on several factors,
including the development of unconventional oil supplies
outside the U.S., the construction of LNG export facili-
ties and gas pipelines, relocation of energy intensive in-
dustries to the U.S., substitution by coal, and policies.

Short term risks in the oil market are currently on the
downside, reflecting the diminished impact of geopoliti-
cal risks, OPEC’s reluctance to take action, and anemic
growth in emerging economies. However, geopolitical
risks may play a role in the medium term as Iraq is ex-
pected to account for half of OEPC’s growth in the next
5 years, while current (relatively) low prices may reduce         Source: World Bank.

producers in the U.S. and in South America. Weak im-
ports of edible oils, especially by China and India, has
played a role as well.

The beverage price index, which was relatively stable
during the quarter, is 28 percent higher than a year ago,
mostly aided by a rally in coffee (Arabica) prices (Figure
20). Because of drought in Brazil, the world’s largest cof-
fee supplier, the global coffee market will experience a
deficit of almost 2 million bags. Coffee (Robusta) and tea

to cocoa producers in West Africa—the region accounts              Figure 19      Edible oil prices

The raw material price index declined nearly 10 per-
cent in 2014Q3, led by a sharp decline in natural rub-
ber prices, 11 percent down in September alone, and
almost 40 percent lower than a year ago (Figure 21).
The decline reflects mostly weak demand, especially
from the automotive sector (most natural rubber goes
for tire manufacturing.) Cotton prices declined sharply
as well, 17 percent down for the quarter, as the global
cotton market entered the fifth consecutive season in
which production exceeds consumption. The S/U
ratio for cotton is expected to reach 83 percent in
2014/15 and 88 percent next season, the highest of
the sector’s history. Most cotton stocks have been                 Source: World Bank.

Agricultural commodity prices are expected to experience
