OVERVIEW OF THE SECURITIES MARKET

Introduction: General Condition of the Securities Market
The Mozambique Stock Exchange (“BMV”) opened in 1999 but is still in a very early stage of
development. The market capitalization is only 7.81% of the GDP. Due to recent gas fields that have
been discovered and “mega” development projects, there are expectations that it will increase in size fairly
rapidly in the next several years.

Most listings on the BVM are debt instruments, with only 4 equity issues currently traded.
Market participants have indicated that there is a general lack of financial literacy, not only among the
potential investing public, but also among the businesses and companies that would be likely candidates
for using the stock market as a means of raising capital. Along with the general concern about disclosing
internal business finances and activities, this lack of literacy has resulted in a limited use of the exchange.
The BVM has been concentrating a lot of its efforts in the area of financial literacy in providing information
to companies to encourage them to list on the exchange.

The retail market for securities is virtually non-existent. Several privatizations resulted in employees
receiving shares – approximately 1000 each. Many of these people are hard for brokers to contact and are
not active traders. The lack of financial literacy is a significant problem. Brokers and their services are only
known by 7% of the population.1 According to some industry people interviewed, some retail customers
make a purchase, but they often do not understand the investment and think it is a term deposit resulting
in confusion due to market fluctuations and varying dividend payouts.2 The lack of investment funds, which
are the most common retail securities product, has also contributed to the low retail participation.
There appears to be considerable demand for financial products resulting from the increasing
development of the economy. All of the recent debt offerings have been oversubscribed indicating that
there is a demand for securities products from institutional investors and some foreign investors which will
likely increase in the future due to the development of the gas fields and development of the megaprojects
in Mozambique. The BVM and market participants are also putting considerable effort into the development
of new investment products which will be important for the future development of the economy.

    SECTION A           INVESTOR PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS

    Good Practice A.1   Consumer Protection Regime
                        The law should provide for clear rules on investor protection in the area
                        of securities markets products and services, and there should be
                        adequate institutional arrangements for the implementation and
                        enforcement of investor protection rules.
                            a. There should be specific legal provisions that create an effective
                               regime for the protection of investors in securities.
                            b. There should be a governmental agency responsible for data
                               collection and analysis (including complaints, disputes and
                               inquiries) and for the oversight and enforcement of investor
                               protection laws and regulations.
    Description         The laws and subsidiary regulations are drafted in general terms and provide for
                        general obligations of financial intermediaries and investment fund managers in
                        regards to their dealings with customers/investors. However they do not contain
                        prescriptive, detailed rules for the interaction of these entities with their customers
                        as contemplated by this Good Practice. Although this is not a serious concern at
                        present, it is likely to become one as the securities market develops and retail
                        investors are attracted into it.
                        Paragraph (a)
                        General consumer protection is provided for in Article 100 of the Constitution of
                        Mozambique, as well as via the CP Law. The CP Law does not specifically mention
                        the securities sector. However it applies to all activities concerning the production,
                        distribution or commercialization of consumer services that require a payment.
                        Although the CP Law contains comprehensive protections for consumers, it does
                        not appear to have been implemented or enforced (as also noted in the 2012 CPFL
                        Diagnostic). The consumer rights3 covered include rights (in summary) to
                        education; information (and there are specific provisions in relation to credit
                        contracts); a 7 day cooling off period in certain circumstances4; substantive
                        fairness; clear and legible print in contracts; and rights to the protection of
                        economic interests and the legal protection and accessible justice. Further there
                        are prohibitions against misleading advertising and abusive clauses, and provision
                        for the establishment of consumer arbitration centers. There is also provision for
                        the establishment of a Consumer Institute designed to promote consumer
                        protection policies. The Law also recognizes consumer associations and provides
                        them with rights in relation to (amongst other things) social partner status in
                        matters concerning consumers and to State funding. However, notwithstanding
                        the broad scope of this law, it does not appear to have been implemented or
                        enforced to date, though implementing regulations are being prepared and are
                        expected to be approved early in 2015, with the establishment of the Consumer
                        Institute to follow.

The CP Law also stipulates that state and local municipalities are responsible for
developing initiatives and adopting measures directed at :
    •   informing consumers;
    •   creating municipal consumer information services;
    •   establishing municipal consumer councils, and
    •   creating various databases and digital archives on consumer rights.
More specifically, the regime for the protection of investors is governed by several
primary laws and decrees that establish a general framework for investor
protection. The CIFC Law provides the basic regulation for the participants in the
securities market. As of 2009, the Securities Code provides for market conduct
rules applicable to the securities market and further regulation for financial
intermediaries. The Cabinet of Ministers Decree No. 35/07 of 30 October Internal
Regulation of the BVM provides for the internal structure and regulation of the
stock exchange. Council of Ministers Decree No. 54/99 of 8 September Investment
Fund Decree provides the framework for the regulation of investment funds
although as of the date of this report, no funds have been created.
The primary laws and decrees are elaborated in the RAI and the CIFC Regulation.
The laws and subsidiary legislation are drafted in general terms and provide for
general obligations of financial intermediaries and investment fund managers in
regards to their dealings with customer/investors. However they do not contain a
series of prescriptive, detailed rules for the interaction of these entities with their
customers.
See also the discussion of the CP Law in Insurance Good Practice A.1.
Paragraph (b)
The regulation and supervision of investor protection in Mozambique is complex
and divided between several different government and quasi-governmental
entities. Article 5 of the Securities Code and Article 54 of the CIFC Law give BdM
the responsibility of supervising financial intermediaries in addition to the operation
of the securities market in general. Article 5 of the CIFC Law and Articles 26 and
27 of the Investment Funds Decree set out the responsibility of the BdM to
supervise and regulate CIS, depositories and management companies.
Nonetheless, the BVM carries out annual audits of the financial intermediaries who
are members of the exchange. The Ministry of Finance under Article 1(A) of the
CIFC Law has the competency to oversee the securities market and to intervene
in the market if there is any “disturbance”. In addition, under Article 4.1 of the
Securities Code, the Ministry of Finance also retains a residual right to handle any
duties specifically given to it, which includes approval for issuing certain types of
securities and authorizing activities of the stock exchange. This regulatory structure
is adequate at the current time due to the limited number of participants – there
are only 9 banks authorized as a financial intermediary to conduct securities
business and there are no investment funds. However, if there is a significant
development of the securities market, this regulatory structure will prove too
cumbersome to efficiently regulate the market.
BdM Notice 4/GBM/2009 provides for the creation of a complaint system at each
bank and requires that all complaints and decisions be sent to the BdM. In addition,

                                                               FINANCE & MARKETS | 9

                 there is a complaint system at the BdM to deal with issues not resolved at the level
                 of the financial institution (See Section E for more details).
                 It should be noted that the market for retail securities is currently quite small, with
                 most capital markets transactions taking place between large institutions.
                 Consequently, it is unlikely there will be many such complaints related to securities
                 matters and the BdM has stated that there have been no complaints in the
                 securities markets area.
                 Article 7 of BdM Notice 4 provides that the BdM should make available on its
                 website statistical data on the complaints made against credit institutions and
                 financial companies. Although there is a section for making complaints on the
                 website, there does not appear as of yet to be any statistics related to individual
                 financial institutions.

Recommendation   In order to simplify regulation if the market grows significantly, the government
                 should create a single, well-staffed, independent unit in BdM which has adequate
                 financial and human resources and capacity. . The BVM should come under the
                 regulation of that independent supervisor and the Central Securities Depository
                 should be established as an independent entity separate from the BVM. In the
                 longer term a separate independent regulator for the securities market might be
                 considered.
                 The legal structure should be elaborated and centralized in a detailed securities
                 market law which incorporates licensing under the CIFC law and also includes
                 provisions for collective investments. Implementing regulations could be prepared
                 by the new securities regulator. A more centralized regulatory regime will be
                 needed for a more robust market.

Good Practice A.2   Code of Conduct for Securities Intermediaries, Investment Advisers and
                    Collective Investment Undertakings
                        a. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           have a voluntary code of conduct.
                        b. If such a code of conduct exists, securities intermediaries,
                           investment advisers and CIUs should publicize the code to the
                           general public through appropriate means.
                        c. Securities Intermediaries, Investment Advisers and CIUs should
                           comply with the code and an appropriate mechanism should be
                           in place to provide incentives to comply with the code.
Description         There are no voluntary, industry based Codes of Conduct as contemplated by this
                    Good Practice. There are legislative “codes of conduct” but they are very general
                    and vague in their requirements.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is no voluntary Code of Conduct for financial intermediaries, funds and
                    investment fund managers but there is an ethical code in Article 5 of the Securities
                    Code and RAI Chapter V Articles 32-41. In addition, Chapter VI of the CIFC Law
                    contains a set of rules for good conduct. These legislative codes are mandatory for
                    market participants, but are very general and vague in and vague in their
                    requirements.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    There is no requirement that financial intermediaries, funds or investment fund
                    managers publicize the ethical codes in the law to the general public. However,
                    the BVM publicizes both laws on its website, while the BdM publishes only the CIFC
                    law.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    Enforcing compliance with the ethical Codes incorporated the law is part of the
                    regulatory compliance responsibilities of the BdM.

Recommendation      Encourage development of detailed industry codes of conduct for financial
                    intermediaries, funds, investment fund managers and other participants in the
                    securities industry as the market develops and gains sufficient size to support
                    industry associations. The Codes should create and reflect a consensus in the
                    relevant industry as to good practice and provide a basis for an enforceable
                    disciplinary regime by the associations. A Code should be widely disseminated
                    (including through websites) and clients of the relevant entity should be referred
                    to them in relevant contracts and in the case of complaints. Further, the regulator
                    should closely monitor compliance with Codes and consider enforcement action for
                    any relevant breach of the law if there is a breach.

Good Practice A.3   Other Institutional Arrangements
                        a. The judicial system should provide an efficient and trusted venue
                           for the enforcement of laws and regulations on investor
                           protection.
                        b. The media should play an active role in promoting investor
                           protection.
                        c. The private sector, including voluntary investor protection
                           organizations, industry associations and, where permitted, self-
                           regulatory organizations should play an active role in promoting
                           investor protection.
Description         The judicial system is not used by retail financial consumers because it is not
                    efficient for small cases, due to the fact that it is too expensive and time
                    consuming. The media and consumer NGOs have not been active in the securities
                    area due to the lack of a retail securities market.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Section 5(1) (g) of the CP Law provides that consumers have the right to “legal
                    protection and accessible justice.” Section 4(c) of the CP Law provides that the
                    State and municipalities are responsible for ensuring that consumers have access
                    to justice and the courts as appropriate under the circumstances of the matter at
                    issue. However, the judicial system is not generally used by the general citizenry
                    for small retail financial disputes. It is not considered efficient for small cases, due
                    to cost and time delay considerations and the distance of some of the complainants
                    to the court. There are also concerns about the expertise of the judiciary in relation
                    to the financial sector.
                    The CP Law also makes provision for the establishment of arbitration centers for
                    consumers, although they are not yet operational (see Good Practice E.2 below for
                    further details).
                    Paragraph (b)
                    The media covers consumer protection in the financial area, particularly in relation
                    to financial literacy. This is discussed more fully below (see Section G). However,
                    there are only a limited number of venues for such information to be distributed.
                    Radio programs are frequently used to reach people in rural areas.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    There are two potentially relevant financial consumer protection associations –
                    DECOM and PROCONSUMERS. The value of private associations is recognized in
                    Articles 35 and 19 of the CP Law which, amongst other things, require BdM and
                    other regulators to consult with them on consumer protection issues. However,
                    due to the lack of a retail securities market, as well as limited resources and
                    expertise, the associations are not very much involved in investor protection issues.




                                                                                   FINANCE & MARKETS | 12

Recommendation      As the demand for retail investment products and advice grows the media should
                    pay more attention to the issue. A literacy program for journalists should be
                    considered as the retail securities market develops.
                    Consideration should be given to providing funding and capacity building support
                    to consumer protection associations that meet specified criteria and to promoting
                    their participation in consultations concerning the development of relevant laws,
                    regulations and regulatory Notices. This will become especially important as the
                    retail securities market develops.
                    See also Good Practice E.2 concerning formal dispute resolution schemes.

Good Practice A.4   Licensing
                        a. All legal entities or physical persons that, for the purpose of
                           investment in financial instruments, solicit funds from the public
                           should be obliged to obtain a license from the supervisory
                           authority.
                        b. Legal entities or physical persons that give investment advice and
                           hold customer assets should be licensed by the securities
                           supervisory authority.
                        c. If a jurisdiction does not require licensing for legal entities or
                           physical persons that give only investment advice, such persons
                           should be supervised by an industry association or self-regulatory
                           organization and the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws or
                           other consumer laws should apply to the activity of such persons.
Description         All significant corporate market participants in the securities sector are required to
                    be licensed by the BdM. However, sales people that solicit funds are not required to
                    be licensed.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    The basic licensing law is the CIFC Law. All credit institutions and financial companies
                    as defined in the law must be licensed, including securities market participants, such
                    as financial intermediaries, funds and investment fund managers (see Chapter III of
                    the CIFC Regulation). In addition, Securities Code Articles 3(1)(d) and 153(1)(a) and
                    RAI Article 4 provide that only a legal entity can be a financial intermediary and that
                    it must obtain prior authorization before it acts as an intermediary.
                    Article 12 of the Investment Funds Decree requires that all funds be authorized by
                    the BdM upon application by their managing entity. Further, Article 74 of CIFC
                    Regulations provides that all investment management entities must be licensed by
                    the BdM. So far no fund has been created and no investment fund manager license
                    has been granted.
                    Although the BdM handles the registration of a stock exchange, it shares authority
                    for supervision of the stock exchange with the Ministry of Finance since it is
                    considered a public institution which falls under the Ministry of Finance. Nonetheless,
                    the actual registration and supervision of the stock exchange is done by the BdM.
                    Notwithstanding the comprehensive licensing regime for companies engaged in
                    securities markets activities, there is no requirement that employees who interact
                    with the public or solicit funds from the public be licensed by the BdM.


                                                                                 FINANCE & MARKETS | 13

                    Paragraph (b)
                    Financial Intermediaries can be authorized to give advice pursuant to RAI Articles
                    2(1) (b) and (4). The law does not provide for separate authorized entities that give
                    only investment advice.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    Not applicable

Recommendation      The staff of all securities intermediaries, funds and investment fund managers or
                    other entities that solicit funds from and deal with the public regarding securities
                    should be licensed.

SECTION B           DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES

Good Practice B.1   General Practices
                    There should be disclosure principles that cover an investor’s relationship
                    with a person offering to buy or sell securities, buying or selling securities,
                    or providing investment advice, in all three stages of such relationship:
                    pre-sale, point of sale, and post-sale.
                        a. The information available and provided to an investor should inform
                           the investor of:
                              (i)    the choice of accounts, products and services;
                              (ii) the characteristics of each type of account, product or
                                   service;
                              (iii) the risks and consequences of purchasing each type of
                                    account, product or service;
                              (iv) the risks and consequences of using leverage, often called
                                   margin, in purchasing or selling securities or other financial
                                   products; and
                              (v) the specific risks of investing in derivative products, such as
                                  options and futures.
                        b. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should be
                           legally responsible for all statements made in marketing and sales
                           materials related to its products.
                        c. A natural or legal person acting as the representative or tied-agent
                           of a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose to an investor whether the person is licensed to act as such
                           a representative and who licenses the person.
                        d. If a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU delegates or
                           outsources any of its functions or activities to another legal entity
                           or physical person, such delegation or outsourcing should be fully
                           disclosed to the investor, including whether the person to whom
                           such function or activity is delegated is licensed to act in such
                           capacity and who licenses the person.

                                SECURITIES SECTOR


Description   The legal framework for the securities sector does not contain specific requirements
              for disclosures for point of sale documents, regarding risks, terms and conditions
              related to the sale.
              Paragraph (a)
              (i) Article 39 (f) of the RAI provides that financial intermediaries must ”Provide
              information and explanations to their customers in order for them to make a
              reasoned decision on the investment or transaction they wish to conduct” and also
              provide advice about special risks. Further Article 39 (a) of the RAI provides that
              financial intermediaries must inform “customers of the nature of the services
              provided, their conditions and their costs.” Although these provisions do not
              require the financial intermediaries to disclose the terms of all of the types of
              accounts offered, they do require that the financial intermediary inform customers
              of the general nature of the services that they have available and the related risks.
              (ii) See (i) above.
              (iii) Article 39 (a) of the RAI provides that financial intermediaries must clarify to
              customers “transactions that by their nature or conditions involve special risks,
              about the existence and content of such risks and the financial consequences that
              their eventual realization shall entail.”
              (iv) Nothing specific about this Good Practice in the legal or regulatory framework.
              (v) Nothing specific about this Good Practice in the legal or regulatory framework.
              There are no retail derivatives instruments in Mozambique.

              Article 153 of the Securities Code makes it a misdemeanor to engage in misleading
              advertising. It also provides for sanctions for violations of the Securities Code in
              general, including warnings, temporary suspensions and complete suspensions of
              activities as well as monetary fines.
              In addition, Articles 33-36 of the Advertising Code provide for liability and sanctions
              for misleading advertising. Article 20 of CP Law bans misleading advertising and
              Article 18 provides for liability for providers of false or misleading services. Article 33
              provides for sanctions for violations of the CP Law’s provisions. However, the liability
              and sanctions articles in the law go to the business entity providing the services and
              do not create sanctions for individual sales people who are selling securities to the

Recommendation      The legal framework should contain specific requirements for disclosures for point of
                    sale documents regarding: risks, terms and conditions and fees, charges and
                    commissions related to the sale. More specificity in the laws, decrees and regulations
                    are needed to provide for uniformity and clarity in the sales activity across all financial
                    service providers.
                    Legal liability for sales materials and related selling activities needs to be more clearly
                    set out in the applicable laws, decrees and regulations.
                    The legal framework for the securities sector needs to be modified to provide for the
                    disclosure of professional relationships resulting from outsourcing and the disclosure
                    of the registration status of sales people at the point of sale.

Good Practice B.2   Terms and Conditions
                       a. Before commencing a relationship with an investor, a securities
                          intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should provide the
                          investor with a copy of its general terms and conditions, as well as
                          any terms and conditions that apply to the particular account.
                       b. The terms and conditions should always be in a font size and
                          spacing that facilitates easy reading.
                       c. The terms and conditions should disclose:
                                (i) details of the general charges;
                                (ii) the complaints procedure;
                                (iii) information about any compensation scheme that the
                                     securities intermediary or CIU is a member of, and an outline
                                     of the action and remedies which the investor may take in
                                     the event of default by the securities intermediary or CIU;
                                (iv)the methods of computing interest rates paid or charged;
                                (v) any relevant non-interest charges or fees related to the
                                    product;
                                (vi)any service charges;
                                (vii)the details of the terms of any leverage or margin being
                                    offered to the client and how the leverage functions;
                                (viii)         any restrictions on account transfers; and
                                (ix) the procedures for closing an account.
Description         The legal regime needs to be elaborated further with more specificity regarding
                    disclosure during account opening beyond a general obligation to inform customers
                    of the nature of services provided, their conditions and costs.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is a general obligation in Article 39(f) of the RAI to “inform customers of the
                    nature of services provided, their conditions and costs”. This would not however
                    require a financial intermediary to inform a potential customer as to the terms and
                    conditions of his contract.
                    Paragraph (b)

                    (i)-(iv) There is nothing in the law or regulations or decrees regarding the detailed
                    elements in this Good Practice.
                    (v) Although Notice 5/GBM/2009 of the BdM requires disclosure of fees and it applies
                    only to deposit accounts at credit institutions (i.e. it does not apply to securities
                    accounts).
                    (vi)-(ix) There is nothing in law or regulations or decrees regarding the detailed
                    elements in this Good Practice.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector needs to be amended to require that
                    terms and conditions and fees, charges and commissions be disclosed to clients.
                    As the market for retail investors becomes more developed the need to develop the
                    investors’ trust in the market will become essential; requiring disclosures of the type
                    proposed will be especially important at this stage.

Good Practice B.3   Professional Competence
                    Regulators should establish and administer minimum competency
                    requirements for the sales staff of securities intermediaries, investment
                    advisers and CIUs, and collaborate with industry associations where
                    appropriate.

Description         There is no requirement regarding an obligation that the regulator administers a
                    minimum competency standard or test for sales staff. In fact, RAI Art 34(2) (a)
                    places this responsibility on a financial intermediary and requires it to train staff and
                    ensure the competency of its staff.

Recommendation      An exam should be prepared by the regulator (BdM in the case of Mozambique) and
                    all sales staff should be required to pass it, as well as their supervisors. In countries
                    where there is a well-developed and respected Association of Brokers, Association
                    of Asset Managers or authorized service providers, such as in the United States or
                    South Africa, the regulator has delegated the testing to the Association or service
                    provider under the oversight of the regulator. In other countries, such as Poland,
                    the regulator has retained the authority to prepare and administer the exam itself.

Good Practice B.4   Know Your Customer (KYC)
                    Before providing a product or service to an investor, a securities
                    intermediary, adviser or CIU should obtain, record and retain sufficient
                    information to enable it to form a professional view of the investor’s
                    background, financial condition, investment experience and attitude
                    toward risk in order to enable it to provide a recommendation, product or
                    service appropriate to that investor.

Description         RAI Articles 34(2) (c) and (d) explicitly require a financial intermediary to know a
                    customer’s objects, experience and financial ability. There is no such requirement
                    for investment fund managers.
Recommendation      The abovementioned “Know Your Customer” requirements should be extended to
                    investment fund clients.

Good Practice B.5   Suitability
                    A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should ensure that,
                    taking into account the facts disclosed by the investor and other relevant
                    facts about that investor of which it is aware, any recommendation,
                    product or service offered to the investor is suitable to that investor.

Description         Although the law contains a suitability evaluation, it does not clearly state the actions
                    that should be taken when an investor wants to invest in an unsuitable product.
                    Article 5(2) of the Code provides that a financial intermediary in regards to the
                    securities market should refrain “…from conducting or engaging in any transactions
                    or actions likely to jeopardize the orderly functioning, transparency and market
                    credibility.” In furtherance of that requirement, Article 5(3) requires a financial
                    intermediary to “take into account on one hand, the level of knowledge, experience
                    and professionalism of customers regarding the securities market, and on the other
                    hand, their financial condition and reflections that they may have, depending on
                    their degree of risk, ordered operations or services to be provided.”
                    Taken together, these provisions imply that a financial intermediary should not
                    engage in transactions for clients that are not suitable given their experience,
                    financial condition and objectives. However, it is not explicit whether the financial
                    intermediary should refrain from unsuitable transactions or merely advise the client
                    as to whether the transaction is unsuitable and give the client more extensive advice
                    and a choice as to further action.
                    RAI Article 39 (d) provides that a financial intermediary must provide a client with
                    its own objective expertise in the event that the client lacks the experience or
                    knowledge regarding a particular transaction, particularly if the client requests it.
                    This implies that the financial intermediary only needs to advise as to suitability, but
                    not refrain from making the transaction.

Recommendation      The obligation of a financial intermediary, funds and investment fund manager to
                    determine the suitability of a financial instrument for a client should be set out in
                    the legal framework for the securities sector more directly, in addition to the actions
                    that should be taken if the relevant product or service is not considered suitable for
                    the client.

Good Practice B.6   Sales Practices
                        a. Legislation and regulations should contain clear rules on improper
                           sales practices in the solicitation, sale and purchase of securities.
                           Thus, securities intermediaries, investment advisers, CIUs and
                           their sales representatives should:
                            (i) Not use high-pressure sales tactics;
                            (ii) Not engage in misrepresentations and half truths as to products
                                 being sold;
                            (iii)    Fully disclose the risks of investing in a financial product
                                 being sold;
                            (iv)Not discount or disparage warnings or cautionary statements in
                                written sales literature;
                            (v) Not exclude or restrict, or seek to exclude or restrict, any legal
                                liability or duty of care to an investor, except where permitted
                                by applicable legislation.
                        b. Legislation and regulations should provide sanctions for improper
                           sales practices.
                        c. The securities supervisory agency should have broad powers to
                           investigate fraudulent schemes.
Description         The legal provisions related to fraud in securities transactions need to be more
                    specific and contain stronger sanctions.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Securities Code Article 4(1) provides a general obligation to act ethically. It provides
                    that “financial intermediaries shall serve their customers with the utmost diligence,
                    loyalty, neutrality and discretion, and with absolute respect for their interests.” It
                    then lists several common fraudulent acts that a financial intermediary can commit
                    vis-à-vis a customer, such as churning. However, it does not discuss sales tactics.
                    Similarly, RAI Article 33 provides that financial intermediary’s conduct should be
                    guided by strict standards of integrity and honesty and that they should in particular:
                    “Ensure that their activities in connection with any activity carried out, are
                    characterized by greater trustworthiness, rigor and absolute transparency of
                    processes, refraining from adopting behaviours that affect the credibility of any
                    market in which they operate…” This section also does not discuss sales tactics
                    and/or fraud in the marketing of securities.
                    (i) There is no provision specifically dealing with high pressure sales tactics.
                    (ii) Article 153 of the Securities Code makes it a misdemeanor to use false and
                    misleading advertising. The general ethical requirements stated above would also
                    be applicable here (See Good Practice B.7 below for misrepresentations in
                    advertising).
                    (iii) RAI Article 39 (a) provides that a financial intermediary must explain the risks
                    of investing in a particular product.
                    (iv) There is no specific provision regarding this Good Practice.
                    (v) Article 22(1) (a) of CP Law would appear to make such an exclusion clause an
                    abusive practice.

Paragraph (b)
Chapter IX of the CIFC Law provides for liability and criminal sanctions for violations
of the law. Article 107(k) of the CIFC Law provides that it is a grave contravention
to provide incomplete and misleading information. Section V of CIFC Regulations
provides for contraventions and sanctions for violations of the law and regulations.
Article 153(1) (a) (e) of the Securities Code makes it a misdemeanor to engage in
misleading advertising in the offer or purchase of securities. In addition, Article
153(1) provides that violations of the Code and regulations issued thereunder are
misdemeanors. RAI Article 41 provides that “financial intermediaries must comply in
all advertising … with the strict principles of lawfulness, truthfulness, objectivity,
adequacy, timeliness and clarity”. Consequently, the violation of RAI Article 41 is
also a misdemeanor. The sanctions for these violations include warnings, temporary
suspensions and complete suspensions of activities and monetary fines.
Articles 33-36 of the Advertising Code also provides for liability and sanctions for
misleading advertising, including advertising for securities.
Taken together, the sanctions for these violations include warnings, temporary
suspensions of activities, complete suspensions of activities and monetary fines.
Paragraph (c)
Article 72 of the CIFC Law provides that the BdM has authority to supervise finance
companies and monitor their conduct. Article 4 of the Securities Code provides that
“supervision, regulation and promotion of the securities market are carried out by
the Bank of Mozambique”. This includes the supervision and regulation of financial
intermediaries, funds and investment fund managers among others.
Article 74 gives the BdM the right to request information from registered entities and
to inspect their premises and examine records on-site, but does not provide any
details as to the means and scope of such an inspection. Similarly, the powers given
in the Securities Code are to supervise and conduct inspections but there is no detail
in the Code as to the specific methods, techniques and actions that the BdM can use
to conduct an investigation or the scope of the investigation. Article 26 of the Fund
Decree also gives the BdM the authority to supervise funds but also does not provide
details as to the extent of its powers to do so.
Article 52 of the Internal Regulations of the BVM gives the Board of Directors the
authority to inspect and examine the activities of financial intermediaries who are
stock exchange operators that are authorized to conduct exchange transactions.
Once again, there is no detail as the extent of this authority. Meetings with the
market participants indicated that the BVM does not take a heavy hand in regulation
and its main concern at this time is market development.

Recommendation   The legal framework for the securities sector regarding fraudulent sales and
                 purchases of securities should be strengthened to include specific types of fraud,
                 including false and misleading written and oral statements, false financial
                 statements, misuse of customer assets, and high pressure sales tactics, among
                 others.
                 Specifically, there could be provisions:
                     •   defining fraud in the context of Mozambique legislation. In other
                         jurisdictions, it commonly includes the intentional statement of a false fact
                         to induce an investor to buy or sell securities;
                     •   prohibiting making a statement which is a half-truth i.e. that is misleading
                         in light of all the fact;
                     •   stating that the omission to state a material fact is fraudulent;
                     •   regarding high pressure sales tactics, particularly sales contacts made by
                         phone, fax or email (including requirements that solicitation by phone should
                         be limited to specific hours during the day; that consumers can opt out of
                         telephone sales by joining a national no call list and tactics such as
                         expressing extreme urgency; the need for immediate payment; and “cherry-
                         picked” time frames for market activity showing unrealistic profits should be
                         prohibited);
                     •   requiring that e-mail solicitations be registered with and approved by the
                         BdM.
                 Further, any such prohibitions should clearly apply to employees and agents of
                 intermediaries.
                 The sanctions provisions need to be strengthened if they are to provide an effective
                 deterrent for fraudulent behavior, for example securities violations should be a
                 felony (a mere misdemeanor for serious contraventions is not adequate).
                 The authority and powers of the regulator regarding inspections and investigations
                 need to be set out in more detail. This is currently not so important since the financial
                 intermediaries are all banks that are subject to bank examination, but it will be
                 important when stand-alone intermediaries and fund managers develop their
                 operations.

Good Practice B.7   Advertising and Sales Materials
                        a. All marketing and sales materials should be in plain language and
                           understandable by the average investor.
                        b. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers, CIUs and their
                           sales representatives should ensure their advertising and sales
                           materials and procedures do not mislead the customers.
                        c. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           disclose in all advertising, including print, television and radio, the
                           fact that they are regulated and by whom.
Description         The prohibition against misleading advertising is comprehensive, but basic provisions
                    such as the need for clear language should be included in the advertising regulatory
                    framework.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is no general requirement in the law, regulations or decrees regarding the
                    need for all marketing and sales materials to be in plain, understandable language.
                    There is a special requirement for domiciliary advertising send to the home of the
                    recipient in section 21 of the Advertising Code, but it does not have general
                    application.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Article 153 (1) provides that violations of the Securities Code and regulations issued
                    thereunder are misdemeanors. Specifically, Article 153(1) (a) (e) of the Securities
                    Code makes it a misdemeanor to engage in misleading advertising in the offer or
                    purchase of securities. In addition, RAI Article 41 provides that “financial
                    intermediaries must comply in all advertising … with the strict principles of
                    lawfulness, truthfulness, objectivity, adequacy, timeliness and clarity.”
                    Consequently, the violation of RAI Article 41 is also a misdemeanor. The sanctions
                    for these violations include warnings, temporary suspensions and complete
                    suspensions of activities and monetary fines.
                    Other related laws also ban misleading advertising. Article 9 of the Advertising Code
                    provides that advertising should not be misleading. Article 20 of the CPL also bans
                    misleading or abusive advertising and Article 5(1)(i) provides that protection against
                    such advertising is a consumer right.
                    The Constitution Article 92 also requires that the law should prohibit misleading
                    advertising.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    There is nothing in the law, regulations or decrees regarding the disclosure of
                    regulatory status.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector should explicitly provide that marketing
                    and sales material and other disclosures should be in clear and understandable
                    language.
                    The legal framework for the securities sector should also provide that sales material
                    and representatives should disclose their regulatory status.

Good Practice B.8   Relationships and Conflicts
                        a. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose to its clients all relationships that it has which impact on
                           the client’s account, such as banks, custodians, advisers or
                           intermediaries which are used to maintain and manage the
                           account.
                        b. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           disclose all conflicts of interest that it has with the client and the
                           manner in which the conflict is being managed.
Description         The law should be amended so that conflict of interests would be better explained
                    to clients.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    RAI Article 42(2) requires that a financial intermediary disclose to the BVM all
                    relationships with third parties that might create a conflict. However this does not
                    extend to disclosure to clients of the financial intermediary.
                    Paragraph (b)
                     RAI Article 42(1) provides that the financial intermediary must get consent from a
                    client before engaging in activities that could create a conflict. This implies that the
                    financial intermediary has disclosed potential conflicts to the client.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector needs to be amended to clearly state
                    that a financial intermediary’s, funds and investment fund manager’s relationships
                    that constitute a conflict of interest or which have an impact on the client must be
                    disclosed by the financial intermediary, funds and investment fund manager to the
                    client. In addition, the financial intermediary, funds and investment fund manager
                    should disclose how the conflict is being handled before requesting permission to
                    engage in the activity.

Good Practice B.9   Specific Disclosures by CIUs
                        •   CIUs should disclose to prospective and existing investors:
                              (i) the CIU’s policies with regard to frequent trading and the
                                   risks to investors from such policies;
                              (ii) any inducements that it receives to use particular
                                   intermediaries or other financial firms, such as “soft-money”
                                   arrangements; and
                              (iii) a fair and honest description of the performance of the
                                   CIU’s investments over several different periods of time that
                                   accurately reflect the CIU’s performance.
                        •   In addition, a CIU should provide a Key Facts Statement for each
                            fund that it is offering to the client that succinctly explains the fund
                            in clear language. Such document is in addition to any other
                            disclosure documents required by law.




                                                                                 FINANCE & MARKETS | 23

Description          Requirements for the use of a Key Facts Statement (KFS) for disclosure should be
                     added to the law.
                     Paragraph (a)
                     There is no provision in the regulatory framework regarding the details that the CIU
                     should disclose to prospective and existing investors.
                     Paragraph (b)
                     Article 23 of the Fund Decree provides that all funds must have a prospectus and all
                     advertising must refer to the existence and means of obtaining the prospectus.
                     There is not, however, any requirement to provide a KFS.

Recommendation       When an investment fund industry develops, a more detailed regulatory structure
                     for investment funds should be put in place.
                     The legal framework for the securities sector should require that a short form
                     (one/two pages), clearly expressed KFS for investment fund products be given to an
                     investor prior to the sale of the product.

Good Practice B.10   Specific Disclosures by Investment Advisers
                     a. Investment advisers should disclose to prospective and existing
                        clients:
                         (i)  whether the investment adviser is also registered in another
                              capacity and whether the adviser deals with the client’s account
                              in the second registered capacity; and
                         (ii) whether the financial instruments that the investment adviser is
                              recommending are held in the adviser’s own inventory or the
                              inventory of a legal or natural person related to the adviser and
                              will be bought from or sold to its own inventory or the inventory
                              of a related party.
                     b. An investment adviser should provide prospective and existing clients
                        with a Key Facts Statement for each product or service that is being
                        offered or sold to the client that succinctly explains the product or
                        service in clear language.
Description          There are no independent investment advisors in Mozambique.
                     The law does not provide for a separate registration as an investment advisor.
                     Financial intermediaries can be authorized to give advice pursuant to RAI Articles
                     2(1)(b) and (4).

                    Funds of investors should be segregated from the funds of all other market
                    participants.

Description         The law provides for the segregation of funds in the securities sector.
                    Article 7 of the Investment Fund Decree provides all investment fund assets to be
                    held by a Depository, which can be an authorized Mozambican bank. Article 9
                    provides that investment fund managers and depositories must be separate entities
                    and shall act independently of each other and in the best interests of the investors.
                    RAI Article 17(1) provides that “financial intermediaries should account separately
                    from their own securities belonging to clients or held on their behalf…” The rules of
                    accounting shall be determined by the BdM under Article 16. The Central Depository,
                    which is only recently established, advised the mission team that they plan to have
                    a separate account for each customer of an investment funds and that title to their
                    securities will be held in the customer’s name.

Recommendation      No recommendation.

Good Practice C.2   Contract Note
                        a. Investors should receive a detailed contract note from a securities
                           intermediary or CIU confirming and containing the characteristics
                           of each trade executed with them, or on their behalf.
                        b. The contract note should disclose the commission received by the
                           securities intermediary, CIU and their sales representatives, as
                           well as the total expense ratio (expressed as total expenses as a
                           percentage of total assets purchased).
                        c. In addition, the contract note should indicate the trading venue
                           where the transaction took place and whether (i) the intermediary
                           for the transaction acted as a broker in the trade, (ii) the
                           intermediary or CIU acted as the counterparty to its customer in
                           the trade, or (iii) the trade was conducted internally in the
                           intermediary between its clients.
Description         The legal framework for the securities sector does not contain detailed legal
                    requirements for contract notes.
                    Paragraph (a), (b) and (c)
                    Article 26(1) of the Securities Code and Article 39(e) of RAI require a financial
                    intermediary to promptly inform the client of execution of order or any difficulties in
                    doing so, but provide no specifics as to the content of the notification.

                    e. The trading venue where the transaction takes place and the role of the financial

Good Practice C.3   Statements
                        a. An investor should receive periodic, streamlined statements for
                           each account with a securities intermediary or CIU, providing the
                           complete details of account activity in an easy-to-read format.
                            (i) Timely delivery of periodic securities and CIU statements
                                pertaining to the accounts should be made.
                            (ii) Investors should have a means to dispute the accuracy of the
                                 transactions recorded in the statement within a stipulated
                                 period.
                            (iii)   When an investor signs up for paperless statements, such
                                 statements should also be in an easy-to-read and readily
                                 understandable format.
                        b. If a legal or natural person who provides only investment advice
                           to customers also holds client assets, the client statements should
                           be prepared by and sent from the custodian for the assets and not
                           from the investment adviser.
Description         The legal framework for the securities sector does not contain detailed legal
                    requirements for periodic statements to investors.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    There is no provision in the regulatory framework regarding the requirement for a
                    statement to be sent to a client of a financial intermediary on a periodic basis,
                    although a client can request one pursuant to Article 26(2) of the Securities Code.
                    This is also no requirement in the Investment Funds Decree.

                    of funds on the closing or transfer of a brokerage account.
                    There is nothing in law or regulations or decrees regarding the detailed elements in
                    this Good Practice.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector needs to provide for prompt payments
                    of funds on the closing or transfer of a brokerage account. This time period can vary
                    depending on the type of transactions and market conditions, but in no event should
                    it be more than several days after the settlement of the last transaction in the
                    account.

Good Practice C.5   Investor Records
                        a. A securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           maintain up-to-date investor records containing at least the
                           following:
                            (i)   a copy of all documents required for investor identification
                                  and profile;
                            (ii) the investor’s contact details;
                            (iii) all contract notices and periodic statements provided to the
                                  investor;
                            (iv) details of advice, products and services provided to the
                                 investor;
                            (v) details of all information provided to the investor in relation
                                to the advice, products and services provided to the investor;
                            (vi) all correspondence with the investor;
                            (vii) all documents or applications completed or signed by the
                                  investor;
                            (viii) copies of all original documents submitted by the investor
                                  in support of an application for the provision of advice,
                                  products or services;
                            (ix) all other information concerning the investor which the
                                 securities intermediary or CIU is required to keep by law;
                            (x) all other information which the securities intermediary or CIU
                                obtains regarding the investor.
                        b. Details of individual transactions should be retained for a
                           reasonable number of years after the date of the transaction. All
                           other records required under a. to j. above should be retained for
                           a reasonable number of years from the date the relationship with
                           the investor ends. Investor records should be complete and readily
                           accessible.

Description         The legal framework for the securities sector should contain detailed legal
                    requirements for the records to be kept by market participants.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    RAI Article 43(1)(e) provides that an financial intermediary has as one of its
                    responsibilities the “organizing and maintaining proper records of transactions and
                    records kept on file for a period of five years, these records and all other documents
                    relating to the same transactions.” There is no detail as to what constitutes proper
                    records and the records are limited to records related to transactions.
                    (i)-(x) There is nothing in law or regulations or decrees regarding the detailed
                    elements in this Good Practice.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    RAI Article 43 provides that records related to customer transactions must be kept
                    for 5 years.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector should contain detailed legal
                    requirements for the records to be kept by financial intermediaries, funds and
                    investment fund managers. The record keeping system is the core of the supervisory
                    activity and there should be uniform and comprehensive rules on records that must
                    be maintained by financial intermediaries, funds and investment fund managers.

SECTION D           PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

Good Practice D.1   Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                    Investors of a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU have a
                    right to expect that their financial activities will remain private and not
                    subject to unwarranted private and governmental scrutiny. The law
                    should require that securities intermediaries, investment advisers and
                    CIUs take sufficient steps to protect the confidentiality and security of a
                    customer’s information against any anticipated threats or hazards to the
                    security or integrity of such information, and against unauthorized access
                    to, or use of, customer information.

Description         The legal framework for the securities sector does not contain specific rules for the
                    safekeeping of customer data.
                    Data protection is included in the Constitution of the Republic of Mozambique. Article
                    71(4) of the Constitution provides that access to data bases containing personal data
                    and the transfer of such data is prohibited except where provided for by law or
                    judicial decision
                    Article 6(1) of the Securities Code provides that “financial intermediaries, members
                    of their governing bodies as well as their employees, agents, committed and other
                    persons who render services on a permanent or occasional basis, are subject to
                    professional secrecy on all matters pertaining to transactions and services to their
                    customers…” RAI Article 43(2) repeats and reinforces this privacy requirement.
                    Article 48 of the CIFC Law also provides for the confidentiality of customer



                                                                                FINANCE & MARKETS | 28

                    information and, Article 49, that it cannot be disclosed except by provision of law,
                    judicial decision or consent of the customer.
                    There are no technical requirements as to the actions that financial intermediaries,
                    funds and investment fund managers should take to protect customer data, hard
                    copy and digital, held by them.

Recommendation      The legal framework for the securities sector should contain specific rules for the
                    safekeeping of customer data. In regards to digital data, there should be inter alia
                    rules regarding the encryption of data, double authentication of website passwords,
                    limitations on access by institutional employees and programs for virus protection.
                    As to physical data, for example, some security techniques would be securely locked
                    storage facilities for data, and vaults for valuable physical items, such as stocks,
                    bonds, physical gold and other metals. In addition, the physical assets should be
                    segregated by account in separate boxes and file drawers. This could be done in the
                    form of a new Data Protection Law as set forth in more detail in Section D.1 of the
                    Banking Sector Good Practices (See Good Practice D.1 Banking Sector, 2012 CPFL
                    Diagnostic).

Good Practice D.2   Sharing Customer’s Information
                    Securities intermediaries and CIUs should:
                        (i) inform an investor of third-party dealings in which they are
                            required to share information regarding the investor’s account,
                            such as legal enquiries by a credit bureau, unless the law provides
                            otherwise;
                        (ii) explain how      they    use   and    share    an    investor’s    personal
                             information;
                        (iii) allow an investor to stop or "opt out" of certain information
                              sharing, such as selling or sharing account or personal information
                              to outside companies that are not affiliated with them, for the
                              purpose of telemarketing or direct mail marketing, and inform the
                              investor of this option.
Description         The legal framework does not provide for the means and procedures for sharing
                    information.
                    The law specifically prohibits the sharing of information without the customers
                    consent. Consequently, the CIFC Law and Regulation, Securities Code and RAI do
                    not deal with possibility of or procedure for sharing information between commercial
                    entities.

Recommendation      The legal framework should provide for the means and procedures for sharing
                    information, particularly within financial groups such as the banks in Mozambique.
                    If the decision is made to allow disclosure of information of a customer to a related
                    party by the financial institution, the customer should be allowed to opt out of that
                    sharing/disclosure.

Good Practice D.3   Permitted Disclosures
                        a. If there are to be any specific procedures and exceptions
                           concerning the release of customer financial records to
                           government authorities, these procedures and exceptions should
                           be stated in the law.
                        b. The law should provide for penalties for breach of investor
                           confidentiality.
Description         The law provides for specific exemptions from the prohibition against the release of
                    financial information.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Article 6(2) of the Securities Market Code provides when financial intermediaries can
                    disclose their client’s confidential information - to the Bank of Mozambique, stock
                    exchange or to a judicial authority.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Article 6(3) of the Securities Code provides that violation of the privacy provisions is
                    punishable by law. Article 153(1) (b) provides that any violation of any duties set
                    out in the Securities Code is a misdemeanor punishable by warnings, temporary
                    suspensions, permanent revocations and fines.

Recommendation      No recommendation.

SECTION E           DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS

Good Practice E.1   Internal Dispute Settlement
                        a. An internal avenue for claim and dispute resolution practices
                           within a securities intermediary, investment adviser or CIU should
                           be required by the securities supervisory agency.
                        b. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           provide designated employees available to investors for inquiries
                           and complaints.
                        c. Securities intermediaries, investment advisers and CIUs should
                           inform their investors of the internal procedures on dispute
                           resolution.
                        d. The securities supervisory agency should provide oversight on
                           whether securities intermediaries, registered investment advisers
                           and CIUs comply with their internal procedures on investor
                           protection rules.
Description         The BdM has mandated a procedure for the internal handling of customer
                    complaints.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    RAI Article 38(2) (d) provides that “financial intermediaries should still take within
                    their organization and internal functioning, the necessary measures to…. institute
                    internal mechanisms to make a fair assessment of customer complaints.” Notice
                    4/GBM/2009 of the BdM provides that financial companies must set up an internal
                    complaints procedure and sets forth the processes for during this. The complainants


                                                                                 FINANCE & MARKETS | 30
                                     SECURITIES SECTOR


                    can appeal to the BdM if they are unsatisfied with the finance companies treatment
                    of their complaint.
                    Paragraphs (b) and (c)
                    Notice 4/GBM/2009 of the BdM requires “that all Credit Institutions and Financial
                    Corporations should have a complaint, data request and suggestions service counter
                    for the public.” Such a counter should have people specifically tasked with the
                    purpose of handling complaints. According to industry members interviewed, these
                    counters are plainly visible in the lobby of the headquarters building of banks.
                    However, it’s not clear if this is communicated to customers who use branch banks
                    throughout Mozambique, or if such branch banks also have such a kiosk.
                    Paragraph (d)
                    The review of the complaint procedure is done as part of the annual audit of the
                    bank by the BdM.

Recommendation      Financial intermediaries should establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that all
                    customers are aware of the complaints procedure and have access to it, in addition
                    to the requirement in BdM Notice 4/GBM/2009 that all complaints and decisions be
                    sent to the BdM. The BdM consumer protection function should be reorganized and
                    the staff more fully trained in dealing with customer complaints. Further complaints
                    statistics should be reported to BdM who should maintain a consolidated database
                    of complaints that could help the regulator in identifying vulnerabilities as follows:
                    (i) the medium of complaints; (ii) the institution that received the complaint; (iii)
                    breakdown of complaints by types of institutions ,industry and province; (iv) the
                    time taken to resolve the complaints; (v) the issues complained about; (vi) the time
                    taken to resolve; (vi) number of complaints that were not resolved; (vii) policy
                    changes based on complaints ; and (viii) literacy efforts directly related to analysis
                    of complaints.

Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                    There should be an independent dispute resolution system for resolving
                    disputes that investors have with their securities intermediaries,
                    investment advisers and CIUs.
                        a. A system should be in place to allow investors to seek third-party
                           recourse, such as an ombudsman or arbitration court, in the event
                           the complaint with their securities intermediary, investment
                           adviser or CIU is not resolved to their satisfaction in accordance
                           with internal procedure, and it should be made known to the
                           public.
                        b. The independent dispute resolution system should be impartial
                           and independent from the appointing authority and the industry.
                        c. The decisions of the independent dispute resolution system should
                           be binding on the securities intermediaries and CIUs. The
                           mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of these decisions should
                           be established and publicized.

                                SECURITIES SECTOR


Description   There is no formal external dispute resolution scheme (such as a financial services
              ombudsman) in Mozambique for consumers. However the BdM has authority to deal
              with investor complaints under Notice 4/GBM/2009, although at the time of the CPFL
              Review no complaints has been received, no doubt due to the small size of the retail
              market. Their resources to deal with such complaints are also doubtful. The CP Law
              provides for the establishment of consumer arbitration centers (which are intended
              to be free to consumers) but no action has to date been taken to establish such
              centers. There is also a Center for Arbitration Mediation and Conciliation (CAMC) but
              it is not used for consumer disputes.
               Courts are similarly not accessible to consumers: the reasons explained in the 2012
              Volume II CPFL Report (Good Practice E.2 for the Banking Sector) apply equally to
              the securities sector.
              Paragraph (a)
              Article 18 of the CP Law provides for the creation of Arbitration Centers to handle
              consumer disputes. The Centers will be overseen by the Consumer Institute - which
              is provided for in Article 38 of the CP Law - when the Institute is established. Until
              that time, the CP Law will be administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade,
              Markets and Agricultural Marketing Department. The implementing regulations for
              the law are still in discussion, but near completion for establishing the Institute. After
              it is created, it is expected that the Consumer Arbitration Centers will be established.
              However, financing will remain a problem. Article 18 provides that the Centers will
              be free of charge for consumers, but does not provide for a means of paying for the
              Centers. This funding will probably need to come from the government budget,
              which may limit the operation of the Centers.
              The Law on Arbitration, Conciliation and Mediation, Law No. 11/99 if 8 July (Law on
              Arbitration) also provides a mechanism whereby parties may voluntarily submit their
              disputes to an arbitral tribunal or a mediator. A Center for Arbitration Mediation and
              Conciliation (CAMC) was established twelve years ago to handle arbitration matters
              pursuant to the provisions of Article 69 of the Law on Arbitration as a private
              institutional arbitration center. However the CAMC is unlikely to be accessible to
              consumers as formal arbitration proceedings are normally used for large scale
              commercial disputes.
              Paragraph (b)
              The Consumer Institute is considered a public authority, so the Consumer Arbitration
              Centers will not necessarily be independent of the appointing authority. However
              this will depend on the terms of the final regulations.
              Paragraph (c)
              Article 23 of the Law on Arbitration states an arbitration award is enforceable the
              same as a judgment from a court, subject to review by judicial system set forth in
              Articles 44-48 of Law on Arbitration.

Recommendation      It is suggested that Mozambique considers options for the development of an
                    independent third party external dispute resolution scheme, which would apply to
                    the securities sector as well as other parts of the financial sector.
                    Consideration could, for example, be given to the establishment of a financial
                    ombudsman service. The recommendations 2012 Volume II CPFL Report (see Good
                    Practice E.2 Banking Section) discuss the legal foundations, possible ways to
                    establish and fund such a service, governance and corresponding international
                    standards.
                    Another option which might be considered is the establishment of the Consumer
                    Arbitration Centers provided for in the CP Law.

SECTION F           GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND INSOLVENCY

Good Practice F.1   Investor Protection
                        a. There should be clear provisions in the law to ensure that the
                           regulatory authority can take prompt corrective action on a timely
                           basis in the event of distress at a securities intermediary,
                           investment adviser or CIU.
                        b. The law on the investors’ guarantee fund, if there is one, should be
                           clear on the funds and financial instruments that are covered under
                           the law.
                        c. There should be an effective mechanism in place for the pay-out of
                           funds and transfer of financial instruments by the guarantee fund
                           or insolvency trustee in a timely manner.
                        d. The legal provisions on the insolvency of securities intermediaries,
                           investment advisers and CIUs should provide for expeditious, cost-
                           effective and equitable provisions to enable the timely payment of
                           funds and transfer of financial instruments to investors by the
                           insolvency trustee of a securities intermediary or CIU.
Description         While there are separate, unique provisions for the insolvency of a financial
                    institution, there are no separate provisions for the speedy payout of funds to
                    investors.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    Chapter III Articles 81 et seq. of the CIFC Law give the BdM the right to take
                    extraordinary reorganization measures with an financial intermediary and
                    investment fund manager. Article 89 provides for liquidation in the event that the
                    reorganization fails.
                    Investment Fund Decree Article 17(3) provides that the BdM can provide for the
                    compulsory liquidation of a fund in the event of illegality or acts of management
                    where the interests of the investors are undermined. Article 22 also gives the BdM
                    the authority to suspend redemptions in time of distress.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    There is no investors guarantee fund in Mozambique.




                                                                             FINANCE & MARKETS | 33
                                      SECURITIES SECTOR


                    Paragraph (c)
                    Article 17 of the Investment Fund Decree provides for liquidation of an investment
                    fund and payout to unit holders. The BdM can determine the time period to do this.
                    The liquidation of a financial intermediary will take place according to common rules
                    of liquidation.
                    Paragraph (d)
                    There are no special provisions for payouts by a bankruptcy trustee during the
                    liquidation of a financial intermediary. The efficiency will be the same as for any
                    other commercial entity.

Recommendation      Due to the fact that the reorganization scheme for credit institutions and financial
                    companies is different from the rules for other commercial entities, there should also
                    be special provisions for payouts for the investors. Due to the segregated character
                    of their assets, the fact that the assets are not part of the institution’s assets for
                    creditors and the identification of the assets by account number, payment during
                    the course of the bankruptcy proceeding should be done quickly.

SECTION G           CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT

Good Practice G.1   Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                        a. A broadly based program of financial education and information
                           should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                           population.
                        b. A range of organizations–including government, state agencies and
                           non-governmental organizations–should be involved in developing
                           and implementing the financial capability program.
                        c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                           bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the
                           development and implementation of the national financial
                           capability program.

Description         Paragraph (a)
                    There are a number of strategic initiatives currently addressing financial education in
                    Mozambique. The government’s Financial Sector Development Strategy 2013–2022
                    includes activities to promote financial literacy, such as financial education campaigns
                    to be disseminated through media and financial education material to be used in
                    schools. It documents the government’s commitment to financial inclusion as
                    signaled by the signing of the Maya Declaration in 2012. It is understood that financial
                    literacy will also be covered by Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy which is in
                    the process of development with the support of the World Banks’ FISF Program. The
                    FISF program includes the promotion of financial literacy among its objectives.
                    At present, it is not entirely clear how the various initiatives are coordinated, nor who
                    is responsible to lead and coordinate their implementation.
                    There is no broadly based program for financial literacy specific to the securities
                    sector. Nonetheless, the BVM is conducting a significant educational program which
                    includes both investors and issuers of securities. They are meeting with schools and

                                                                                 FINANCE & MARKETS | 34
                                      SECURITIES SECTOR


                    universities to provide a formal education in securities markets in the hopes that it
                    will increase investor awareness and literacy and increase the number of securities
                    market professionals. Other organizations such as the CACM have conducted literacy
                    programs in the past, but are not doing so at the current time.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    In the securities markets area, the two main actors promoting financial literacy are
                    the BVM and BdM. Other institutions, such as the consumer protection associations
                    are not allocating resources to it, since the securities market is not considered to be
                    a market in which the middle class and poor consumers are active.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    Although there has not been a formal appointment, the BVM is clearly leading the
                    development and implementation of financial literacy in the securities sector.

Recommendation      One the primary impediments to the development of the securities market, according
                    to market participants, is the lack of awareness and financial literacy regarding the
                    securities sector. It would benefit the capital markets in Mozambique if the
                    government developed a broad based financial literacy initiative which included
                    education in the securities markets.
                    There should also be consultation and coordination between relevant stakeholders in
                    developing and implementing Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy, including
                    aspects related to financial literacy.

Good Practice G.2   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                        a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken to improve people's
                           financial capability.
                        b. This should include encouraging the mass media to provide
                           financial education, information and guidance.
Description         The range of initiatives for financial literacy in the securities sector is limited to
                    outreach programs of the BVM. TVM is used for financial literacy in general but does
                    not cover the securities sector at this time.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    The BVM uses meetings, seminars and presentations to students, labor unions, and
                    issuers as its primary methods of improving financial capability. This is currently the
                    main initiative in the securities sector.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    The BdM has used TVM as a means of providing financial education, currently in the
                    form of a call-in show hosted by a securities expert. TVM has stated that they are
                    currently developing more programs with the BdM, although the program that will
                    soon start consisting of 15 daily programs will concentrate on banking issues, not
                    securities issues. According to TVM, the BdM will finance the first program and the
                    different subsectors of the financial sector will pay for the rest of the shows that deal
                    with their specific subsector. Radio programs, critical to the rural areas, have already
                    begun.

Recommendation      The broad based financial literacy initiative should use a wide range of channels. To
                    a certain extent this is already done, but more effort regarding the securities market
                    should be put into certain channels, such as TV and radio.

                                                                                 FINANCE & MARKETS | 35

Good Practice G.3   Unbiased Information for Investors
                        a. Financial regulators should provide, via the internet and printed
                             publications, independent information on the key features, benefits
                             and risks—and where practicable the costs— of the main types of
                             financial products and services.
                        b. Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to provide
                             consumer awareness programs to the public regarding financial
                             products and services.
Description         The primary means of communicating key features of securities products is currently
                    through the BVMs financial literacy outreach program. Consumer activity in the
                    financial sector is too small to warrant significant allocation of resources of the
                    relevant NGOs.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    The BdM and BVM do not provide key features of the main types of securities
                    products and services to the public on their websites. The primary means of
                    communicating such information is currently through the BVMs financial literacy
                    outreach program. The BdM does have a section of its website dedicated to a
                    procedure for filing consumer complaints.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Discussions with consumer protection NGOs indicate that due to limited resources
                    they do not spend time on financial literacy for securities customers, but they do
                    provide programs for banking and insurance.

Recommendation      The BdM and BVM should put more information on their websites regarding the
                    characteristics of available investments in order to assist investors in evaluating the
                    securities markets. Due to the small nature of the securities market at the current
                    time, this does not appear to be important but it will be necessary in order to provide
                    a basis for developing a strong retail investor base.

Good Practice G.4   Measuring the Impact of Financial Capability Initiatives
                        a. The financial capability of consumers should be measured through
                           a broad-based household survey that is repeated from time to time.
                        b. The effectiveness of key financial capability initiatives should be
                           evaluated.
Description         A recent household survey was conducted by the World Bank. No evaluation
                    programs are currently underway.
                    Paragraph (a)
                    A recent survey was conducted regarding the financial capability of consumers in
                    Mozambique. See footnote one. The main message the survey had for securities
                    markets is that most consumers do not know or understand the markets or the roles
                    of brokers.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    There is no such evaluation currently underway.

Recommendation      None

                   II. GOOD PRACTICES: INSURANCE SECTOR
OVERVIEW OF THE INSURANCE MARKET

Insurance is not very developed in Mozambique, as compared to neighbors in the region (See Table 3).
Table 3: Regional Comparison of the Insurance Sector




Source: AXCO Insurance Reports – WB Africa is made up of Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon,
Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Ivory Coast data from 2011 and 2012.
Its development has not kept up with GDP growth recently (See Table 4).
Table 4: Mozambique GDP growth vs. Insurance Sector Growth




Source: AXCO Insurance Reports and own calculations


Insurance in Mozambique is predominantly focused on commercial insurance (fire, theft, natural disasters
property insurance), mandatory insurance (most notably motor third party liability and workers’ compensation,
which together account for 42% of all premium), and insurance required to obtain a loan. More than half of the
business is transacted by brokers – the mission team were told that the largest firm accounts for a quarter of
the broker market, and 95% of its business is commercial. Insurance companies make little effort to target
individuals, and advertise little. This is reportedly because of the large scale required to profitably underwrite
the relatively low value insurance policies held by individuals, households and small enterprises coupled with the
apparently limited retail market potential for growth.

Source: presentation from ISSM in December 2013
In the last five years, five new insurance companies have entered the market; in fact, the insurance market in
Mozambique is now composed of 392 operators, including 16 insurance companies, 55 insurance brokers, 4
insurance agents operating as commercial companies, 21 insurance agents operating as natural persons, 295
insurance promoters, and one reinsurance company.5
Insurance was a state monopoly between 1977 and 1991, and the market remains rather concentrated, as
measured for example by the Herfindahl Index6 where high values indicate low levels of competition.7 For
instance, in the non-life sector the four largest providers (Global Alliance, SIM, EMOSE and Hollard) control more
than 85% of the market and most significantly in the life sector the same providers control more than 98% of
the market, with SIM having 41% of the market shares.8.
The legal framework makes provision for microinsurance but most interviewed insurers have no plans to engage
in this segment and implementing regulations are still outstanding. However, a first micro insurance underwriter
was licensed in December 2014.

                                               INSURANCE SECTOR

The legal and regulatory framework for insurance in Mozambique is determined by the Decreto-Lei No. 1/2010.
This law created the Mozambique Insurance Supervisory Institute (Instituto de Supervisão de Seguros de
Moçambique (ISSM) and stipulates the legal framework for insurance in two sections (called “books”). The first
section regulates insurance activity and is referred to as the Insurance Law going forward. The second section
regulates insurance contracts and is referred to as Insurance Contracts Law (ICL) going forward. The Insurance
Law leaves details to be specified by subsequent regulation, for example in respect of the application for an
insurance license or in respect of reserve requirements. These details are specified in Decreto No. 30/2011
(Insurance Regulation). Not all aspects of insurance are conclusively regulated in Decreto No. 30/2011: for
example microinsurance regulations are being prepared.


     SECTION A           CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS

     Good Practice A.1   Consumer Protection Regime
                         The law should provide for clear rules on consumer protection in all matters
                         of insurance and there should be adequate institutional arrangements for
                         implementation and enforcement of consumer protection rules.
                             a. There should be specific provisions in the law, which create an
                                effective regime for the protection of retail consumers of insurance.
                             b. The rules should prioritize a role for the private sector, including
                                voluntary    consumer      organizations     and     self-regulatory
                                organizations.
     Description         Paragraph (a)
                         General consumer protection is provided for in Article 100 of the Constitution of
                         Mozambique, as well as via the CP Law. The CP Law does not specifically mention
                         insurance. However it applies to all activities concerning the production, distribution
                         or commercialization of consumer services that require a payment. Although the CP
                         Law contains comprehensive protections for consumers, it does not appear to have
                         been implemented or enforced (as also noted in the 2012 CPFL Diagnostic). The
                         consumer rights9 covered include rights (in summary) to education; information (and
                         there are specific provisions in relation to credit contracts); a 7 day cooling off period
                         in certain circumstances10; substantive fairness; clear and legible print in contracts;
                         and rights to the protection of economic interests and the legal protection and
                         accessible justice. Further there are prohibitions against misleading advertising and
                         abusive clauses, and provision for the establishment of consumer arbitration centers.
                         There is also provision for the establishment of a Consumer Institute designed to
                         promote consumer protection policies. The Law also recognizes consumer associations
                         and provides them with rights in relation to (amongst other things) social partner
                         status in matters concerning consumers and to State funding. However,
                         notwithstanding the broad scope of this law, it does not appear to have been
                         implemented or enforced to date, though implementing regulations are being prepared
                         and are expected to be approved early in 2015, with the establishment of the
                         Consumer Institute to follow.
                         The CP Law also stipulates that state and local municipalities are responsible for
                         developing initiatives and adopting measures directed at :
                             •   informing consumers;
                             •   creating municipal consumer information services;
                             •   establishing municipal consumer councils, and
                             •   creating various databases and digital archives on consumer rights.

                                                           INSURANCE SECTOR

                                    More specifically, the protection of insurance consumers is provided for in the 2010
                                    insurance legal framework provided for by Decreto-Lei No. 1/2010. It provides a
                                    modern supervisory regime aimed at financial stability and suitable conduct of business
                                    of insurers who will not fail on their liabilities and their intermediaries who will provide
                                    suitable advice. It is designed to provide legal certainty and fair treatment to
                                    consumers in relation to insurance contracts, with numerous articles addressing the
                                    asymmetry of information between insurance providers and clients, and stipulating the
                                    information has to be provided to customers as well as related timing and format
                                    requirements (including reminders of renewal and premium due dates). It contains
                                    rules aimed to protect the customer value of insurance products, for example by
                                    stipulating their entitlement to mathematical reserves on termination of a contract11;
                                    and it regulates bundling12, data protection13 and arbitration14 amongst other topics.
                                    In addition to the insurers licensed and supervised by ISSM, foreign companies that
                                    are not supervised by it offer health insurance in Mozambique, primarily to expatriates
                                    but potentially also to Mozambican nationals (who would have to make complaints in
                                    England for example). This may give rise to potentially detrimental regulatory arbitrage
                                    and prevents ISSM from effectively protecting consumers who buy such products.
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    The CP Law recognizes consumer associations and cooperatives and endows them
                                    with a social partner status in consumer policy matters, so that they can appoint
                                    representatives to the corresponding consultative or cooperative bodies and represent
                                    consumers during the decision-making process. The CP Law also gives them a right to
                                    airtime on radio and television that comes with the social partner status (despite the
                                    law, no airtime seems to be available for CP unless paid for). These associations and
                                    cooperatives are non-profit legal entities and can be considered part of the private
                                    sector.
                                    The responsibility of state and local municipalities for the information of consumers
                                    includes support to information initiatives promoted by consumer associations and
                                    cooperatives.
                                    Two existing consumer associations have been identified in Mozambique:
                                    •     DECOM
                                    •     PROCONSUMERS
                                    Neither is widely known, impressively resourced, or equipped with insurance specific
                                    expertise. Neither has a website, for example. DECOM displays simple print material
                                    on limited financial topics, including adaptations of "The ABC of insurance" produced
                                    by GIZ in Ghana in 2008. They also claim to have accompanied one insurance claimant
                                    through a court process.
                                    Although the Consumer Protection Regime in Mozambique defines the role for private
                                    sector consumer organizations, the ones that exist currently are not adequately
                                    resourced so as to be able to contribute significantly to the protection of insurance
                                    consumers. That is understandable given their broad focus and given the absence of
                                    a substantial retail insurance market.
     Recommendation                 Overall, the scope of the consumer protection regime in general, and for insurance in
                                    particular, appears comprehensive. However there is an urgent and early need for
                                    implementation of the relevant laws, as well as finalization of the required regulations.
                                    There is also a need to consider whether the broad ranging CP Law should cover
                                    consumer protection issues relevant to the insurance sector (as opposed to insurance

                                             sector specific laws). Similarly, it is not clear that the Consumer Institute should have
                                             responsibility for the insurance sector, in preference to ISSM.
                                             Although the insurance industry today is largely limited to commercial / industrial lines,
                                             with retail insurance being focused in a limited range of products, once the market for
                                             retail voluntary insurance to households and SMEs grows and diversifies, these
                                             recommendations will become more urgent.
                                             Additionally, ISSM should clarify the regulatory status of providers of health insurance
                                             that are not currently subject to ISSM regulation, finding a solution that protects
                                             consumers and provides a level playing field for the insurance industry.
     Good Practice A.2                       Contracts
                                             There should be a specialized insurance contracts section in the general
                                             insurance or contracts law, or ideally a separate Insurance Contracts Act.
                                             This should specify the information exchange and disclosure requirements
                                             specific to the insurance sector, the basic rights and obligations of the
                                             insurer and the retail policyholder and allow for any asymmetries of
                                             negotiating power or access to information.
     Description                             The Insurance Law provides a modern regulatory regime for insurance contracts,
                                             addressing also asymmetries of negotiating power and access to information. It
                                             specifies in detail how an insurance contract comes about, and what obligations both
                                             parties have before and during the contract. Article 91 further specifies an extensive
                                             list of information that customers must receive in writing in the Portuguese language
                                             before adherence to the insurance contract, including mention of the possibility of
                                             addressing complaints to the supervisor (notwithstanding the right to legal recourse).
                                             Other Articles specify that the insurance proposal has to document that all mandatory
                                             information has been provided to the policyholder, and that the supervisor may issue
                                             further norms and guidelines in respect of the information duties15. Violation of this
                                             information duty allows the customer to rescind from the contract within 30 days of
                                             having received the policy; the same rescission right applies if the policy conditions do
                                             not correspond to the information provided before inception of the contract16.
                                             The information content of the insurance policy is also specified in the Insurance
                                             Contract Law, requiring “clear and perfectly understandable” Portuguese language of
                                             legible font for general, special and particular conditions. Minimum contents are
                                             specified both in general (including for example “arbitration rules if applicable”) and
                                             specifically for every line of business (including stipulation of the policyholder’s
                                             duties)17. Exclusions have to be highlighted in a different font, otherwise they will be
                                             considered to be unknown to the policyholder18.
                                             The policy has to be handed over or submitted to the policyholder within 30 days of
                                             inception of the contract19. The insurance contract is established if the insurance
                                             company remains silent during the 15 days after it received the insurance proposal (or
                                             additional information it may have requested) from the customer20. This is considered
                                             as acceptance of the proposal, and the insurance contract comes into force at mid-
                                             night of the day following the insurer’s acceptance21. However, the insurance inception
                                             date has to be stated in the insurance conditions22. The insurance cover generally

                                    is the date that the insurance contract comes into force23.
                                    Article 63 of the Insurance Law requires that intermediaries comply with rules of
                                    conduct specifically established via regulatory provisions, but these provisions seem to
                                    be outstanding at the time of the CPFL Review.
     Recommendation                 Given the scope of the ICL, and ISSM’s ability to issue subordinate regulations, norms
                                    and guidance, there is not a specific recommendation in relation to this Good Practice
                                    other than to note that the regulations contemplated by Article 63 of the Insurance
                                    Law should be developed. Comments on individual issues are in specific Good Practices
                                    below.
                                    Further, some aspects of the ICL may need to be re-considered for the purposes of
                                    new forms of insurance policies, for example index insurance which is being piloted in
                                    Mozambique. Some articles of the ICL may present obstacles to this particular form of
                                    insurance, for example the requirement that the insurance claims payment be
                                    equivalent in value to the damage effectively verified; the obligation of the insurer to
                                    return the unearned premium if the policyholder cancels the insurance; or the
                                    stipulation that no property insurance shall enrich the insured. The Global Index
                                    Insurance Facility has offered the regulator support in respect of the regulation and
                                    supervision of index insurance and ISSM may wish to take up this offer. There is also
                                    a need to finalize the draft microinsurance regulations. However these are not specific
                                    issues for the purposes of these Good Practices.
                                    For example, policy information has to be provided in Portuguese language under the
                                    Insurance Contracts Law24, but large parts of the Mozambican population (especially
                                    in rural areas) don’t use that language; if this can be addressed with Key Fact
                                    Statements in the vernacular languages (as proposed in Good Practice B.5), changing
                                    the ICL may not be imperative.
     Good Practice A.3              Codes of Conduct for Insurers
                                          a. There should be a principles-based code of conduct for insurers that
                                             is devised in consultation with the insurance industry and with
                                             relevant consumer associations, and that is monitored and enforced
                                             by a statutory agency or an effective self-regulatory agency.
                                          b. If a principles-based code of conduct exists, insurers should
                                             publicize and disseminate it to the general public through
                                             appropriate means.
                                          c. The principles-based code should be augmented by voluntary codes
                                             for insurers on such matters specific to insurance products or
                                             channels.
                                          d. Every such voluntary code should likewise be publicized and
                                             disseminated.
     Description                    Paragraphs (a) to (d)
                                    There is no industry wide code of conduct for insurers in Mozambique.
                                    Insurers and brokers that are part of international firms have in place internal codes
                                    of conduct covering issues such as complaints handling which are not published.
                                    The Insurance Association was formed in 2002 but has been inactive until a few years
                                    ago. Only 8 of the current 14 insurers are members of the Association (but these 8
                                    represent more than 90% of gross written premium25). The goals of the Association

                                      include to negotiate and conclude collective agreements on behalf of members and to
                                      undertake any other initiatives that are of interest to members or to insurance in
                                      general. These goals might be relied on to develop an industry code of conduct, but it
                                      is understood there are no immediate plans to do so. This may be due to the very
                                      small size of the retail insurance market.
     Recommendation                   The development and agreement of, and adherence to, a code of conduct for the
                                      insurance industry should be encouraged. Although such codes cannot be considered
                                      to be a substitute for well framed laws, they can represent a consensus in the industry
                                      as to good practice and provide a mechanism for the industry to police itself and,
                                      importantly, build consumer confidence in the industry. This is especially important in
                                      a country such as Mozambique with low levels of financial inclusion. A code of conduct
                                      could be particularly useful for the insurance industry in that it could be used to
                                      indicate that insurers are interested in retail consumers beyond mandatory bundled
                                      insurance, and are equipped to serve them with high standards of quality.26 However,
                                      to be effective, it would be important that all insurers operating in Mozambique agree
                                      to be bound by the Code, compliance is supervised and enforced, and consumers are
                                      made aware of their rights under the Code through an effective public awareness
                                      campaign. Further, ISSM should closely monitor compliance with Codes and consider
                                      enforcement action for any relevant breach of the law if there is a breach.
     Good Practice A.4                Other Institutional Arrangements
                                          a. Prudential supervision and consumer protection can be placed in
                                             separate agencies or lodged in a single institution, but allocation of
                                             resources between prudential supervision and consumer protection
                                             should be adequate to enable the effective implementation of
                                             consumer protection rules.
                                          b. The judicial system should provide credibility to the enforcement of
                                             the rules on financial consumer protection.
                                          c. The media and consumer associations should play an active role in
                                             promoting consumer protection in the area of insurance.
     Description                      Paragraph (a)
                                      According to the ICL, ISSM can intervene in dispute resolution between insurers and
                                      their customers27. That is the only explicit mention of ISSM’s role in relation to
                                      consumer protection (which is probably implicit function of every insurance
                                      supervisor). ISSM does not have a separate division or clearly allocated resources for
                                      consumer protection. There is no staff trained specifically for consumer protection,
                                      and the few (less than 10 per year) complaints are handled on an ad-hoc basis by
                                      varying staff without standard operating procedures. Given the low number of cases,
                                      ISSM has not found it necessary so far to single out individuals in charge primarily of
                                      complaints handling and to allocate specific budgets to this task.
                                      While checking compliance of insurers’ advertising with the corresponding regulations
                                      is also a responsibility of ISSM28, there does not seem to be a clearly established
                                      process of how to achieve that, and interventions so far have been triggered when
                                      staff saw questionable TV advertising.
                                      Paragraph (b)
                                      Section 5(1) (g) of the CP Law provides that consumers have the right to “legal
                                      protection and accessible justice.”. Section 4(c) of the CP Law provides that the State
                                      and municipalities are responsible for ensuring that consumers have access to justice

                                   and the courts as appropriate under the circumstances of the matter at issue.
                                   However, the judicial system is not generally used by the general citizenry for small
                                   retail financial disputes. It is not considered efficient for small cases, due to cost and
                                   time delay considerations and the distance of some of the complainants to the court.
                                   These conclusions are consistent with the findings of the 2012 CPFL Diagnostic.29
                                   The CP Law also makes provision for the establishment of arbitration centers for
                                   consumers, although they are not yet operational (see Good Practice E.2 below for
                                   further details).
                                   Paragraph (c)
                                   The CP Law makes provision for media and consumer associations to play an active
                                   role in promoting consumer protection not excluding insurance. Article 9 of the CP Law
                                   states that “Public radio and television networks shall reserve airtime under the terms
                                   to be defined by the law, for promoting consumer rights and interests.” Article 35
                                   states that “Consumer associations are entitled to the following rights: … b)
                                   Airtime on radio and television under the same terms as associations that have social
                                   partner status”. So far, however, this is not widely practiced, particularly for insurance
                                   services, and no airtime is likely to be made available (either on radio or on TV) unless
                                   paid for, and no budgets are known to have been allocated.
                                   There are two potentially relevant financial consumer protection associations – DECOM
                                   and PROCONSUMERS. The value of private associations is recognized in Articles 35
                                   and 19 of the CP Law which, amongst other things, require BdM and other regulators
                                   to consult with them on consumer protection issues. However, due to the lack of a
                                   retail insurance market, as well as limited resources and expertise, the associations
                                   are not very much involved in investor protection issues.
                                   As with many aspects of consumer protection in the insurance sector, the situation
                                   today is characterized by the general absence of consumers of voluntary retail
                                   insurance. It is understandable that there has been no sense of urgency to strengthen
                                   consumer protection for insurance. Nevertheless, ISSM is developing a module on
                                   insurance capacity building to be delivered to journalists to contribute to conducive
                                   media coverage.
     Recommendation                The capacity of ISSM should be strengthened so that it can effectively monitor and
                                   enforce any law requiring standards of business conduct to be met by insurers and
                                   their intermediaries in their dealings with consumers. Consideration might be given,
                                   for example, to establishing a new financial consumer protection unit within ISSM in
                                   charge of monitoring, supervising and enforcing consumer protection provisions as
                                   well as the handling of complaints. The unit should be separate from prudential
                                   supervision in order to ensure that adequate attention is given to market conduct
                                   issues.
                                   At a minimum, it is recommended that ISSM strengthen the capacity of relevant staff
                                   to supervise compliance with the consumer protection laws that exist. A clear focus on
                                   consumer protection is also likely to increase consumer confidence in the industry and
                                   strengthen the effectiveness of the various initiatives ISSM is developing in respect of
                                   insurance awareness and literacy (for example, the plans to establish consumer
                                   outreach “balcãos” i.e. counters).
                                   Consideration should also be given to providing funding and capacity building support
                                   to consumer protection associations that meet specified criteria and to promoting their
                                   participation in consultations concerning the development of relevant laws, regulations
                                   and regulatory Notices. This will become especially important as the retail securities
                                   market develops.

 Good Practice A.5                Bundling and Tying Clauses
                                  Whenever an insurer contracts with a merchant or credit grantor (including
                                  banks and leasing companies) as a distribution channel for its contracts, no
                                  bundling (including enforcing adhesion to what is legally a single contract),
                                  tying or other exclusionary dealings should take place without the
                                  consumer being advised and able to opt out
 Description                      While it is common practice that consumers are required to procure credit – related
                                  insurance if they want to avail a loan, Article 119 of the ICL appears to be to the effect
                                  that the policy holder has a choice of insurer and they should be informed of that right.
                                  However this could be made clearer.30 The insurers interviewed advised that they
                                  inform customers of that right, but acknowledge that they have group insurance
                                  arrangements in place and it is usually more convenient for the customer to accept
                                  coverage under such a policy. This credit – related insurance and mandatory car
                                  insurance, constitutes the bulk of households’ retail insurance to date.
                                  Article 149 of ICL requires that the group insurance policy holder informs the insured
                                  persons about the coverage and their rights and obligations in case of claim; the
                                  insurance contract may, however, specify that this insurance is provided by the insurer,
                                  who in any case has to provide all the information necessary to ensure a proper
                                  understanding of the insurance upon request of the insured. It is not however clear if
                                  the scope of information to be provided to people insured under a group insurance
                                  contract is the same as that to be provided to policyholders like individuals who insure
                                  themselves on their own account.
                                  No figures are available to provide detail of what insurance covers - in addition to the
                                  usual life insurance -are demanded from lenders.
 Recommendation                   Formal standards of practice in relation to the bundling of credit and insurance
                                  products should be established. At a minimum, in the short term, there should be
                                  requirements to clearly inform the prospective policy holder of the key terms,
                                  exclusions and premiums for the insurance policy and related commission before the
                                  policy is taken up. This should be in addition to obligations to give the consumer a
                                  choice of insurer and to prohibit any requirement to take out insurance with a
                                  particular insurer.
                                   Further, in the longer term, consideration should be given to whether there should be
                                  prohibition on insurance forcing practices. The ‘insurance forcing’ prohibition could
                                  apply to a requirement to acquire insurance as a condition of providing a banking
                                  service (such as a loan). However there could be an exception to such a prohibition in
                                  certain cases – for example, where the requirement is for insurance over mortgaged
                                  property or where insurance is required by law. It is also acknowledged that careful
                                  consideration will need to be given as to the extent to which such a prohibition may
                                  limit access to credit.
                                  Further, where there is a tied insurance contract, credit providers should be required
                                  to give a proportionate refund of the applicable premium if the consumer pays out a
                                  loan early. It is further recommended to introduce a requirement for disclosure of
                                  insurance commissions and premiums, as well as other key terms of the policy. Finally,
                                  there should be a requirement for at least three insurers on the list presented to the
                                  consumer when there is a tying and bundling situation.In the mid-term, ISSM together
                                  with relevant industry associations, should investigate the level of bundling and tying

   Our understanding of Article 119 Paragraph 1 of Decreto-Lei No. 1/2010 is that when an insurance contract is established to secure a loan, the borrower
can instead take another insurance contract with another insurance company; the lender cannot object as long as the cover remains the same. The wording
seems ambiguous, since it refers to the policyholder (“tomador do seguro”), which in case of group insurance policies (that are often used to secure loans)
could mean the lender. But as the lender is referred is referred to as “credor”, it may be assumed that this paragraph does not consider the lender to also be
the policyholder. The assessment of a Portuguese language legal expert might clarify.

                                                                                                                                FINANCE & MARKETS | 45
                                                                INSURANCE SECTOR

                                   practices and should establish formal standards of practice in this regard. It is
                                   suggested that ISSM documents how consumers are informed of their right to choose
                                   other insurance than the one arranged by the lender, and if there are unjustified and
                                   unfair obstacles to exercise that choice. It should also investigate what information is
                                   provided to customers at what time, and assess if that is consistent with ISSM’s
                                   understanding of the ICL and fair treatment to customers. To be most insightful, this
                                   exercise should go beyond consultation with insurance companies and intermediaries
                                   (especially banks) and also include mystery shopping.
                                   Further, ISSM should monitor the quality of all insurance required to be taken out by
                                   consumers, especially insurance required to obtain credit (but also auto insurance – it
                                   is very encouraging that ISSM is already doing that).31 Key performance indicators to
                                   be monitored include claims ratio, commission ratio, claims rejection ratio and claims
                                   turnaround time. Establishing a baseline for such indicators will allow to assess the
                                   current client value of these insurances, and decide on target levels and ways to
                                   achieve them.

     SECTION B                     DISCLOSURE & SALES PRACTICES

     Good Practice B.1             Sales Practices
                                        a. Insurers should be held responsible for product-related information
                                           provided to consumers by their agents (i.e. those intermediaries
                                           acting for the insurer).
                                        b. Consumers should be informed whether the intermediary selling
                                           them an insurance contract (known as a policy) is acting for them or
                                           for the insurer (i.e. in the latter case the intermediary has an agency
                                           agreement with the insurer).
                                        c. If the intermediary is a broker (i.e. acting on behalf of the consumer)
                                           then the consumer should be advised at the time of initial contact
                                           with the intermediary if a commission will be paid to the
                                           intermediary by the underwriting insurer. The consumer should have
                                           the right to require disclosure of the commission and other costs
                                           paid to an intermediary for long-term savings contracts. The
                                           consumer should always be advised of the amount of any
                                           commission and other expenses paid on any single premium
                                           investment contract.
                                        d. An intermediary should be prohibited from identically filling
                                           brokering and agency roles for a given general class of insurance (i.e.
                                           life and disability, health, general insurance, credit insurance).
                                        e. When a bank is the intermediary, the sales process should ensure
                                           that the consumer understands at all times that he or she is not
                                           purchasing a bank product or a product guaranteed by the bank.
                                        f.    Sanctions, including meaningful fines and, in the case of
                                              intermediaries, loss of license, should apply for breach of any of the
                                              above provisions.
     Description                   Paragraph (a)
                                   The responsibility of insurers – or brokers – for any acts of insurance agents or
                                   promoters in the course of insurance intermediation is established in Article 64 of the
                                   Insurance Law.32

                                                             INSURANCE SECTOR

                                       Further, Article 64 also requires professional liability insurance for all brokers and
                                       agents authorized to collect premiums. But the wording seems ambiguous as to
                                       whether the required insurance covers wrongdoings only in respect of premium
                                       collection, or also in respect of matters such as the product information provided to
                                       consumers. The 2011 Insurance Regulation requires that intermediaries need to be
                                       authorized by an insurer, and have the necessary professional liability insurance,33 in
                                       order to conclude contracts in the name of, and on behalf of, the insurer.34 The exact
                                       scope of cover of the mandatory liability insurance for intermediaries is not specified,
                                       so it is possible that some intermediaries have public liability insurance35 instead
                                       unlikely to cover negligence, misrepresentation, miss-selling, bad faith and inaccurate
                                       advice. The specification provided by the Insurance Regulation36 addresses primarily
                                       the level of cover in relation to the expected annual premium collection, implying that
                                       the primary purpose of this insurance was meant to address premium
                                       misappropriations. Apart from the fact that the required cover levels seem low,
                                       conflicts of interest can result from that fact that insurance companies cover premium
                                       amounts embezzled by insurance intermediaries.
                                       The ICL requires the insurance proposal to document that the mandatory information
                                       has been provided to the customer (ISSM may issue further norms and guidelines in
                                       respect of information duties). Violation of this information duty allows the customer
                                       to rescind from the contract within 30 days of having received the policy; the same
                                       rescission right applies if the policy conditions do not correspond to the information
                                       provided before inception of the contract.
                                       Paragraph (b)
                                       There are no clear regulatory requirements for such a disclosure.
                                       Paragraph (c)
                                       The Insurance Regulation requires brokers to disclose commissions upon request of
                                       the client (and prohibits charging any additional administrative or other fees).37 It is
                                       understood that retail customers rarely ask for commission details even when they
                                       chose a broker instead of another type of intermediary.
                                       Paragraph (d)
                                       There is no express provision to this effect. However all intermediaries have to be
                                       licensed by ISSM (except for microinsurance intermediaries that are not brokers,
                                       agents or promoters: they simply have to be advised to ISSM) and it may be that ISSM
                                       could introduce procedures to detect if a person was acting as both an agent and a
                                       broker.
                                       Paragraph (e)
                                       There is no express provision to this effect. However insurance agents acting for banks
                                       have to be registered by ISSM and the name of the insurer has to be advised in writing.
                                       However it is not clear if this information needs to be provided to every person insured
                                       under a group contract, or only to the policyholder of such a group contract, i.e. the
                                       bank. In any event the express requirements of this Good Practice do not appear to
                                       be satisfied.

                                    Paragraph (f)
                                    There are no clearly defined provisions that would allow ISSM to penalize infractions.
                                    An intermediary’s license may be withdrawn when the relevant qualifying criteria no
                                    longer apply, but not in other circumstances.
     Recommendation                 The sales practices covered by this Good Practice should clearly be provided for by the
                                    insurance laws. This could be done through the intermediary rules of conduct provided
                                    for by Article 63 of the Insurance Law.
                                    Further, consideration should be given to the potential confusion for consumers
                                    created by the current variety of intermediaries - brokers, corporate agents, individual
                                    agents, promoters, and going forward microinsurance intermediaries. This range of
                                    titles (and possibly responsibilities) makes it difficult for emerging insurance customers
                                    to know whether the intermediary selling them an insurance is acting for them or for
                                    the insurer. It is recommended that ISSM discusses with the insurance industry the
                                    reason for having so many different types of intermediaries, and if intermediation could
                                    be required to be simplified to brokers and agents. There should, in any event, be
                                    active enforcement of any requirement that only licensed brokers can use the term
                                    “broker”38. While this discussion is ongoing, ISSM should explain the differences
                                    between the various types of intermediaries more thoroughly, in its “ABC of insurance
                                    contracts” and other suitable media.
                                    To strengthen consumers’ protection against misleading product-related information
                                    and against the risk of premium mishandling, ISSM should also clarify the scope of the
                                    required mandatory professional liability insurance for insurance intermediaries.
     Good Practice B.2              Advertising and Sales Materials
                                          a. Insurers should ensure their advertising and sales materials and
                                             procedures do not mislead customers. Regulatory limits should be
                                             placed on investment returns used in life insurance value
                                             projections.
                                          b. Insurers should be legally responsible for all statements made in
                                             marketing and sales materials they produce related to their
                                             products.
                                          c. All marketing and sales materials should be easily readable and
                                             understandable by the general public.
     Description                    Paragraph (a)
                                    Various legal provisions deal with misleading advertising and sales material. The
                                    Constitution of Mozambique prohibits “all forms of hidden, indirect and misleading
                                    advertising.”39
                                    The Civil Code stipulates indemnification for damages caused by negligence or the
                                    intention to harm of those who have a legal duty to advise or inform.40 The Advertising
                                    Code, in summary, defines misleading advertising as the rendering of any information
                                    that leads – or is liable to lead –_its receivers into error or that may prejudice a
                                    competitor.41 The competent authority - the Ministry of Trade and Industry - can order
                                    cautionary measures of cessation, suspension or prohibition of misleading advertising,
                                    irrespective of the proof of a loss or real prejudice42. The CP Law bans all misleading
                                    or abusive advertising, which it defines as “any kind of information or communication
                                    bearing advertising characteristics, which is totally or partially false, or that for any

                                      other reason even by omission, might lead consumers to error with respect to the
                                      nature, characteristics, quality, quantity, attributes, origin, price and any other data
                                      about the products and services”. The same law adds that advertisements are
                                      misleading when they fail to provide the essential data about a product or service, or
                                      when they indicate qualities that the product does not have43.
                                      The Insurance Regulation empowers ISSM to issue norms relating to consumer
                                      protection in advertising, and to check compliance with these norms, ordering if
                                      necessary the suspension or immediate publication of an adequate rectification44. But
                                      so far, no such norms have been issued, and there is no process for ISSM to
                                      systematically review insurance advertising before it is launched. Insurers don’t
                                      advertise much in Mozambique so far, and those who do rely on the corresponding
                                      agency to check compliance with the relevant laws. Insurers that are part of
                                      multinational groups often have group wide internal codes of conduct to protect their
                                      brand, including rules for communication and advertising.
                                      The volume of long term life insurance with asset accumulation is small so far, and
                                      value projections in use could not be obtained. The 2011 Regulation requires that the
                                      technical interest rate used to calculate actuarial reserve for life insurance (which may
                                      not be lower than the surrender value at any time) be prudently established, but no
                                      more specific guidance is provided.
                                      As insurance is bought rather than sold, spending on advertising makes limited
                                      business sense for insurers. That is expected to change as competition increases with
                                      the advent of new entrants, but so far their market shares grow slowly. The little
                                      advertising observed to date – mostly banners and billboards – is easily readable and
                                      understandable by the general public.
                                      Paragraph (b)
                                      There does not seem to be legal certainty in respect of insurers’ responsibility for
                                      statements made in marketing and sales materials related to their products.
                                      The Advertising Code states that under the general law, advertisers, advertising agents
                                      and advertising media share civil liability for the prejudice caused to third parties as a
                                      result of the dissemination of unlawful advertising messages45. It does not define
                                      unlawful advertising other than saying that use of advertising productions without
                                      authorizations of the holders of the respective rights is unlawful.
                                      Paragraph (c)
                                      While the ICL requires that both the insurance policy46 and the information that has to
                                      be provided to the customer before issuance of the policy47 have to be clearly
                                      understandable, there is no provision for similar clarity of other marketing and sales
                                      materials under the insurance regulatory framework.
     Recommendation                   While various legal provisions ban misleading advertising, there are no clear norms for
                                      the clarity and understandability of insurance communication material, which – given
                                      the complex nature of insurance – requires more attention than in other lines of retail
                                      business that the lawmakers may have had in mind. This should be a particular focus
                                      by ISSM, both in its supervisory approach and in any norms ISSM may wish to issue
                                      concerning the advertising of insurers.
                                      ISSM should also consider inspecting any advertising by insurance companies before
                                      it is launched to the public, so that any concerns can be addressed before they reach
                                      consumers. However it is appreciated that this may be difficult given ISSM’s limited

                                      resources. At a minimum, ISSM should actively monitor advertising by insurers on an
                                      ongoing basis.
                                      ISSM should also consider issuing norms and guidance concerning projections,
                                      especially when long term life insurance with asset accumulation develops more
                                      significantly.
     Good Practice B.3                Understanding Customers’ Needs
                                      The sales intermediary or officer should be required to obtain sufficient
                                      information about the consumer to ensure an appropriate product is
                                      offered. Formal ȸfact finds࠱ should be specified for long-term savings and
                                      investment products and they should be retained and be available for
                                      inspection for a reasonable number of years.
     Description                      The Insurance Regulation requires all intermediaries to present to the policyholder
                                      “the type or kind of contract that in their view is best suited to their particular case”48.
                                      However there is no guidance on how this should be done or documented; formal fact
                                      finding is not mentioned.
                                      The Insurance Law does not require that all insurance is sold through licensed
                                      insurance intermediaries; in fact, it allows customers to forgo intermediation49, and
                                      interviews with insurers revealed that customers do come into insurance company
                                      branches to buy insurance. There is no indication in the legal framework of whether
                                      the requirements for intermediaries – for example to propose appropriate products –
                                      also apply in this case.
                                      The interviewed insurers generally assess their prospective customers’ needs, but with
                                      the primary objective to avoid “bad customers” and to detect possible under-insurance
                                      and cross selling opportunity. One example given was that when a client asks for
                                      business interruption insurance but not for fire insurance, that omission is pointed out.
                                      There are very few long term savings or investment insurance products in
                                      Mozambique.
     Recommendation                   For the requirement to offer the appropriate product to customers to be truly effective
                                      and enforceable, additional guidance is recommended, including for cases where
                                      customers forgo intermediation. ISSM should issue norms about the degree of fact
                                      finding and establish procedures to inspect compliance with them. In view of ISSM’s
                                      intention to contribute to the development of the insurance market, it may want to
                                      systematically analyze the results of retail clients’ fact findings, as they are likely to
                                      shed light on what insurance consumers need and want – even if such insurance is
                                      not available today, such as long term life insurance with asset accumulation. Insights
                                      like these will guide diversification of insurance product supply.
                                      As the retail market for voluntary insurance develops, and especially as microinsurance
                                      develops, ISSM should monitor the appropriateness of insurance offered to emerging
                                      customers. It should assess products submitted for registration – including the
                                      corresponding processes such as distribution and customer service – in respect of
                                      customer needs, it should analyze complaints to see if they reflect mismatch of product
                                      and need, and it should consider to eventually conduct investigations among
                                      policyholders for more insights on how well insurance products consider and match
                                      their needs – both those that are generally available on the market and those that
                                      were offered to them by insurance intermediaries. Suitably qualified and resourced
                                      consumer protection agencies can be valuable allies for this task. Depending on the
                                      findings, norms and guidance may be issued to mandate product suitability
                                      assessments.

     Good Practice B.4           Cooling-off Period
                                 There should be a reasonable cooling-off period associated with any
                                 traditional investment or long-term life savings contract, after the policy
                                 information is delivered, to deal with possible high pressure selling and mis-
                                 selling.
     Description                 The CP Law provides a general 7 day cooling off period in cases of lacking, insufficient,
                                 illegible, or ambiguous information that may compromise the proper usage of the
                                 services50. The same cooling off period applies whenever services are provided outside
                                 of a commercial establishment, via correspondence or similar means51. This does not
                                 address insurance specifically, and it is unclear what “contracting services outside of
                                 a commercial establishment” means for insurance purchases.
                                 The legal and regulatory framework for insurance does not contemplate any cooling
                                 off period. There are few long-term life savings contracts, and little sales of voluntary
                                 insurance to individuals. The ICL does allow both parties to revoke the insurance
                                 contract by mutual consent at any time, upon which unearned premium shall be
                                 returned to the policyholder – unless otherwise specified. It is not clear what happens
                                 if the insurer does not consent. ISSM’s “ABC” states that insurance contracts can also
                                 be cancelled by either party having a “just cause”, and interviewed insurers say they
                                 agree to consumers’ request to end a contract “if there are good reasons”.
     Recommendation              To comply with this Good Practice, ISSM should issue a regulation to provide for a
                                 cooling off period for at least long term insurance products. Long-term life savings
                                 contracts may be absent in the retail market today, but will one day constitute a pillar
                                 of financial stability to the Mozambican economy and its households.
                                 ISSM should also clarify the conditions under which insured can revoke or cancel an
                                 insurance contract even without the consent of the insurer, what the difference
                                 between “revogaçao” and “resoluçao” is, and what rights the insurer has – or should
                                 have – to unilaterally end insurance contracts. ISSM should assess if the consequences
                                 of premature contract termination to consumers are fair, for example in respect of
                                 premium refunds, or if additional norms and guidance are required. This should ideally
                                 be addressed before microinsurance starts to grow, because microinsurance
                                 customers will be more exposed to make insurance purchases without proper
                                 understanding, and given the substantial volumes required for microinsurance to be
                                 sustainable, sales pressure can be expected to increase.

Good Practice B.5   Key Facts Statement
                    A Key Facts Statement should be attached to all sales and contractual
                    documents, disclosing the key factors of the insurance product or service in
                    large print.
Description         There is no provision for a Key Fact Statement to be given to prospective insurance
                    consumers under the current legal and regulatory framework in Mozambique. The ICL
                    specifies what information has to be given to consumers at the “pre-contractual
                    phase”, emphasizing understandability. However there is no common template
                    prescribed for used by all insurers that would help consumers to compare products
                    and encourage competition between suppliers.
Recommendation      To complement, standardize and make comparable the information required to be
                    disclosed to customers before contracting insurance, the development of standard
                    easy to understand Key Fact Statements should be required for commonly held types
                    of insurance products (e.g. motor vehicle insurance). The required form should be
                    developed by ISSM in cooperation with the industry through the insurance association
                    and engaging other stakeholders such as consumer protection agencies.
                    One idea that might be considered is that ISSM could call for a competition where all
                    insurers independently develop their version and ISSM or another accepted jury
                    chooses the winner whose template is then used for the whole market. Suitable
                    communication of this process could be the first of an Annual Award for Insurance
                    Excellence to be publicly given by ISSM to an insurer for outstanding customer
                    orientation; this could attract attention of potential retail insurance customers to the
                    industry and increase their trust and familiarity with ISSM and its consumer protection
                    role.
                    With a view to the future development of microinsurance, the Key Facts Statement (to
                    be provided to customers before insurance inception) should be available not only in
                    Portuguese but also in local languages as needed, and be provided not only in paper
                    version but also in an electronic version provided the customer consents and the Key
                    Facts Statement is provided in a form that the customer can keep.
Good Practice B.6   Professional Competence
                        a. Sales personnel and intermediaries selling and advising on insurance
                           contracts should have sufficient qualifications, depending on the
                           complexities of the products they sell.
                        b. Educational requirements for intermediaries selling long-term
                           savings and investment insurance products should be specified, or
                           at least approved, by the regulator or supervisor.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    Insurance intermediation can only be exercised by those registered with ISSM
                    pursuant to the 2011 regulations. Brokers need to have at least one manager or
                    administrator who has been registered as an individual insurance agent for at least 5
                    years or who has proven professional experience in technical and commercial
                    insurance for the same period of time. Individual agents have to receive basic
                    insurance training from the insurer who proposes them to be registered by ISSM, and
                    ISSM may test the applicants unless they can prove 5 years of professional insurance
                    experience. There is no standard syllabus of what the basic insurance training needs
                    to cover, nor has ISSM test been elaborated yet. Corporate agents, on the other hand,
                    only need to have at least one full time employee with insurance knowledge. Insurance
                    promoters also need to receive insurance training from the insurers they shall work
                    for, and the content of that training is to be defined by ISSM; it is unclear whether it
                    has been defined already. Microinsurance can also be distributed by intermediaries

                                                                                       FINANCE & MARKETS | 52

                                   that are not brokers, agents or promoters; the (micro) insurer has to provide them
                                   with technical training to confer the necessary capacity for the exercise of their activity,
                                   and inform ISSM of who they are and what line of business they were trained in.
                                   Paragraph (b)
                                   There are few long-term savings and investment insurance products in Mozambique,
                                   but little is known about their distribution. Specific educational requirements for
                                   intermediaries of such products have not been found.
     Recommendation                If not yet done, ISSM should develop and disseminate the standard syllabus of what
                                   the basic insurance training needs to cover, as well as the test it plans to use to assess
                                   suitable competencies of intermediary candidates; ideally, this should be done in
                                   cooperation with the insurance industry (see also the recommendation for Good
                                   Practice B.1).
                                   ISSM should also inspect the training contents and formats used by insurers, and
                                   develop a procedure to assess the capacities of intermediaries achieved by the
                                   mandatory training, to see whether the different qualification requirements are
                                   justified and whether they may or not compromise the quality of advice and service
                                   given to consumers.
     Good Practice B.7             Regulatory Status Disclosure
                                         a. In all of its advertising, whether by print, television, radio or
                                            otherwise, an insurer should disclose: (i) that it is regulated, and (ii)
                                            the name and address of the regulator.
                                         b. All insurance intermediaries should be licensed and proof of
                                            licensing should be readily available to the general public, including
                                            through the internet.
     Description                   Paragraph (a)
                                   Regulatory Status Disclosure is not a requirement for insures in Mozambique today,
                                   and it is not practiced.
                                   Paragraph (b)
                                   With the exception of microinsurance (which has not started), all insurance
                                   intermediaries have to be licensed in Mozambique. ISSM website52 lists the licensed
                                   brokers and corporate agents. Insurance promoters have to present to clients the
                                   identification document issued by the insurer containing the promoter’s registration
                                   number. Other ways for the general public to obtain proof of an intermediary’s license
                                   status are not known.
     Recommendation                Require all insurers and intermediaries to disclose the fact that they are regulated and
                                   by whom (e.g. in sales materials and on the Internet).
                                   ISSM may also want to also publish the names of individual agents and insurance
                                   promoters on its website eventually.53

     Good Practice B.8            Disclosure of Financial Situation
                                       a. The regulator or supervisor should publish annual public reports on
                                          the development, health, strength and penetration of the insurance
                                          sector either as a special report or as part of the disclosure and
                                          accountability requirements under the law governing it.
                                       b. Insurers should be required to disclose their financial information to
                                          enable the general public to form an opinion with regards to the
                                          financial viability of the institution.
                                       c. If credible claims paying ability         ratings are not available, the
                                          regulator or supervisor should            periodically publish sufficient
                                          information on each insurer for            an informed commentator or
                                          intermediary to form a view of            the insurer’s relative financial
                                          strength.
     Description                  Paragraphs (a) – (c)
                                   ISSM published one annual report on the development and status of the insurance
                                  sector in 2012 on its website, where it also published quarterly reports for Q1 and
                                  Q2/2014 (however they have now been removed from the website).54 While the annual
                                  report provides consolidated figures on premium, assets, liabilities and other key
                                  figures for the industry (and a comparison with other markets in the region), it provides
                                  no company-specific information beyond their respective market shares in life and non-
                                  life insurance. The quarterly reports provide more detailed information for every
                                  insurer, including claims payments and reinsurance cessions, although no information
                                  is provided on the insurers’ relative financial strength.
                                  There is no legal requirement for ISSM to publish information allowing the public to
                                  assess each insurer’s relative financial strength. It only has to publish in national
                                  newspaper actions taken in relation to an insurer’s insufficiency of financial guarantees
                                  if they might affect the rights of third parties.
                                  Every insurance company, however, has to publish a range of information in national
                                  newspapers, including profit and loss accounts and balance sheets as well as the
                                  auditor’s opinion.
                                  A possible impediment to ISSM publishing quarterly reports (or a summary) is Article
                                  135 of Decreto No. 30/2011 which is to the effect that ISSM’s staff may not
                                  communicate any confidential information received in the line of work to any person
                                  or authority, except in summary or aggregate and in such a way that insurers and
                                  intermediaries cannot be individually identified. This provision should be clarified with
                                  a view to allowing ISSM to provide more information and transparency.

                                    While not urgent for today’s market, it is recommended that ISSM consider, in
                                    consultation with the insurance industry and other stakeholders such as consumer
                                    protection agencies, how to measure, monitor and publish information about every
                                    insurer’s financial viability, so that customers will be supported in making well informed
                                    purchase decisions once the retail market for voluntary insurance develops. Interesting
                                    examples are provided by Brazil55, Peru56 and Colombia57.
                                    But other information is just as important for consumers to make well informed
                                    choices, for example regarding claims rejection rates, claims ratios, claims turnaround
                                    time, and commission ratio (see recommendation to Good Practice A.5).

     SECTION C                      CUSTOMER ACCOUNT HANDLING AND MAINTENANCE

     Good Practice C.1              Customer Account Handling
                                          a. Customers should receive periodic statements of the value of their
                                             policy in the case of insurance savings and investment contracts. For
                                             traditional savings contracts, this should be provided at least yearly,
                                             however more frequent statements should be produced for
                                             investment-linked contracts.
                                          b. Customers should have a means to dispute the accuracy of the
                                             transactions recorded in the statement within a stipulated period.
                                          c. Insurers should be required to disclose the cash value of a traditional
                                             savings or investment contract upon demand and within a
                                             reasonable time. In addition, a table showing projected cash values
                                             should be provided at the time of delivery of the initial contract and
                                             at the time of any subsequent adjustments.
                                          d. Customers should be provided with renewal notices a reasonable
                                             number of days before the renewal date for non-life policies. If an
                                             insurer does not wish to renew a contract it should also provide a
                                             reasonable notice period.
                                          e. Claims should not be deniable or adjustable if non-disclosure is
                                             discovered at the time of the claim but is immaterial to the proximate
                                             cause of the claim. In such cases, the claim may be adjusted for any
                                             premium shortfall or inability to recover reinsurance.
                                          f.    Insurers should have the right to cancel a policy at any time (other
                                                than after a claim has occurred – see above) if material non-
                                                disclosure can be established.
     Description                    Paragraph (a)
                                    The ICL requires that policyholders of life insurance receive annual statements about
                                    their entitlement to profit sharing. For certain types of life insurance such as unit linked
                                    contracts, customers also have to be informed of changes to the surrender values
                                    when they no longer correspond to initial projections, but the law does not specify

                                                                    INSURANCE SECTOR

                                             how frequently this needs to be done. Insurance companies who do not comply with
                                             this will be held “responsible for losses”58.
                                             Paragraph (b)
                                             There is no provision in the law for contestability or customer disputes concerning
                                             these statements.
                                             Paragraph (c)
                                             For life insurance, insurers are required to provide, prior to inception, projections of
                                             surrender values (including surrender penalties), assumptions used for projections of
                                             contracts with variable sums such as unit linked insurance, guaranteed minimum yields
                                             including disclosure of guaranteed interest rates and duration of such guarantees59. It
                                             has to be documented that the policyholder took notice of this information. The policy
                                             conditions also have to contain information about guarantees and projected cash
                                             values60. Furthermore, the law requires that insurers have to provide policyholders
                                             with all additional information that they require and that proves necessary for the
                                             effective understanding of the contract61.
                                             The ICL also requires that guaranteed minimum interest rates, surrender values and
                                             surrender penalties are provided as appropriate before a life insurance contract can
                                             begin, but it does not provide guidance on how these values can be calculated.
                                             Paragraph (d)
                                             The ICL stipulates that, unless otherwise agreed, insurance contracts have a duration
                                             of one year62, and that insurance contracts with duration of one year are automatically
                                             renewed by subsequent one year periods63, subject to the payment of the
                                             corresponding premium (this has to be explained in the insurance policy). It also
                                             requires insurers to remind customers of due premium payments at least 30 days in
                                             advance64. If an insurer cannot prove this reminder has been sent in time, the provider
                                             cannot contest subsequent claims on the basis of non-payment of claims. There is no
                                             obligation to provide other renewal notices beyond what is described in Paragraphs
                                             (a) to (c).
                                             Paragraph (e)
                                             If non-disclosure due to negligence is detected, the insurance company has to propose
                                             a corresponding contract alteration to the policyholder, or prove that the risk would
                                             not have been accepted if full disclosure had been made. If a claim occurs before the
                                             policyholder has accepted the amended contract, the claims payment is reduced in the
                                             same proportion that the premium paid falls short of the premium that would have
                                             been charged under full disclosure (unless the insurer proves that the risk would not
                                             have been accepted if full disclosure had been made)65. Intentional initial non-
                                             disclosure voids the insurance contract66, but the law does not specify what happens
                                             if immaterial non-disclosure is discovered after a claim.
                                             Paragraph (f)
                                             Article 96 of the ICL allows insurers to declare an insurance contract void if the
                                             policyholder has deliberately violated his duties of disclosure; the insurer is entitled to
                                             keep the premium in these cases. The law does not differentiate if the non-disclosure
                                             is material or not to the insured risk.

     Recommendation                   ISSM should work towards further specification of non-disclosure rules in the law or
                                      through subordinate norms or guidance. For example, non-disclosure of immaterial
                                      facts should be addressed more specifically than in Article 95 of the ICL(which prevents
                                      the insurer to contest cover based on missing, imprecise or contradictory answers to
                                      underwriting questions unless they reflect bad faith).
                                      ISSM should also provide clarification of how prospective insurance customers have to
                                      be informed of their duty to disclose all relevant information and of the consequences
                                      if they fail to comply, for example by requiring suitable standard wording to be used
                                      by all insurers.
                                      Guidance should be provided in respect of possibilities customers have to dispute the
                                      accuracy of their periodic policy statements (for example concerning surrender
                                      values). Further clarification is also required for the automatic renewability of annual
                                      contracts and for customers’ ability to unilaterally cancel multi-year contracts.

     SECTION D                        PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION

     Good Practice D.1                Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                                      Customers have a right to expect that their financial transactions are kept
                                      confidential. Insurers should protect the confidentiality and security of
                                      personal data, against any anticipated threats, or hazards to the security or
                                      integrity of such information, and against unauthorized access.
     Description                      The ICL mandates that insurers (including all their agencies, personnel and
                                      intermediaries) observe the confidentiality of any information it has received in relation
                                      to an insurance contract, before, during and after the duration of the contract and also
                                      if the contract does not materialize. It is very clear about this67, and insurers
                                      interviewed were in no doubt about their obligations. In addition, the confidentiality
                                      of customer data is often also addressed in the international codes of conduct of
                                      insurers or brokers belonging to multinational groups, and audited through group-wide
                                      internal mechanisms. The Insurance Regulation further requires that all intermediaries
                                      observe professional confidentiality, in relation to third parties, concerning any
                                      information disclosed to them in their function as insurance intermediaries68. However,
                                      there is no general data protection law in Mozambique that would clearly define liability
                                      for misuse of personal data.
     Recommendation                   While the regulation concerning confidentiality of insurance customer data is good,
                                      and it should be left primarily to internal and external auditors to assess the
                                      mechanisms put in place by every insurer and intermediary to protect customer
                                      information, ISSM should also review them during on-site inspections. That is
                                      consistent with ISSM’s role as supervisor, and the corresponding expertise and
                                      procedures should be developed. If such inspection (or any other source of
                                      information) casts doubts upon the efficacy of data protection, ISSM has to intervene.
                                      When Mozambique enacts a Personal Data Protection Law (see recommendation in
                                      Good Practice D.1 Banking Sector, CPFL Diagnostic 2012 Comparison with Good
                                      Practices), the particularities of insurance should be taken into consideration with due
                                      consultations with the industry, ISSM and consumer protection agencies.

     Good Practice E.1               Internal Dispute Settlement
                                           a. Insurers should provide an internal avenue for claim and dispute
                                              resolution to policyholders.
                                           b. Insurers should designate employees to handle retail policyholder
                                              complaints.
                                           c. Insurers should inform their customers of the internal procedures on
                                              dispute resolution.
                                           d. The regulator or supervisor should investigate whether insurers
                                              comply with their internal procedures regarding consumer
                                              protection.
     Description                     Paragraph (a)
                                     The ICL requires that insurers inform prospective clients of avenues to make
                                     complaints, but the wording is rather unspecific. One possible translation of
                                     “apreciação das reclamações feitas no âmbito do contrato” is “consideration of
                                     complaints filed under the contract”, and this interpretation is supported by the second
                                     half of the sentence which translates without ambiguity as “including reference to the
                                     possible intervention of the insurance supervisor”69. The policy conditions furthermore
                                     have to mention the applicable law, arbitration conditions and the competent forum
                                     to settle any disputes70. There is no requirement that insurers provide an internal
                                     avenue for claim and dispute resolution. In practice, however, insurance companies
                                     follow their internal procedures for complaints handling, which are not documented in
                                     writing in most cases and not disclosed to customers.
                                     Given that the numbers of complains have been low and the nature of complaints
                                     often harmless (examples discussed include delays in transacting applications or
                                     issuing documents), ISSM has not yet investigated insurers’ CP procedures and the
                                     adherence to them.
                                     Paragraph (b)
                                     Insurers don’t usually rely on particular employees designated to handle retail
                                     policyholder complaints, as the number of complaints has been too low to motivate
                                     greater specialization. The majority of complaints is said to relate to administrative
                                     aspects like delays in transacting applications or issuing documents, which are handled
                                     by the corresponding department within the insurer.
                                     Brokers and agents constitute the first line of recourse to address differences of
                                     opinion. Customers have to be informed that they can direct their complaints to ISSM,
                                     but they rarely do.
                                     Paragraph (c)
                                     Insurers currently do not inform their customers of the internal procedures on dispute
                                     resolution. As brokers and agents constitute the first line of recourse to address
                                     differences of opinion, customers generally turn to them first.

                                                                 INSURANCE SECTOR

                                    Paragraph (d)
                                    It is unknown whether ISSM has already developed procedures and standards to
                                    investigate whether insurers comply with their internal procedures regarding consumer
                                    protection. Since the law and regulations so far do not require insurers to provide an
                                    internal avenue for claim and dispute resolution, designate employees to handle
                                    complaints or inform their customers of the internal procedures on dispute resolution,
                                    ISSM currently does not have a regulatory basis to enforce this.
     Recommendation                 For Mozambique to comply with this Good Practice, ISSM should implement a suitable
                                    regulation requiring insurers to provide an internal avenue for claim and dispute
                                    resolution, designate employees to handle complaints, and inform their customers of
                                    the internal procedures on dispute resolution. Once implemented, ISSM should
                                    supervise its effectiveness and develop procedures and standards to monitor its
                                    compliance.
                                    A good first step would be for ISSM to become familiar with every insurer’s internal
                                    procedures regarding consumer protection, and start supervising compliance with
                                    them. This could lead to the emergence of country specific best practices to take into
                                    consideration when drafting and discussing the corresponding regulation, and such an
                                    approach may find better support from the industry.
                                    Meanwhile, ISSM may want to investigate the reasons for the low number of
                                    complaints, by compiling appropriate statistics with data to be provided by the
                                    insurers, and by discussing with insurers and brokers but also contacting customers
                                    who had disputes. The findings should be put into a report suited to inform both the
                                    industry and the public, and disseminated accordingly. If it finds that there are few
                                    reasons for disputes because for example the ICL pre-empts many sources of conflict
                                    or because insurers in Mozambique have high standards of customer orientation,
                                    disseminating that finding will contribute to the public’s trust in the industry. If, on the
                                    other hand, weaknesses are found, they should be addressed – this proactive approach
                                    will also grow the public’s confidence in ISSM.
                                    Furthermore, ISSM should start collecting meaningful complaints statistics (by cause,
                                    by outcome etc.) on a regular basis71. It should develop a procedure to analyze them
                                    and monitor progress towards the desired benchmarks, and establish procedures to
                                    disseminate with the industry and eventually with the public.
                                     In the longer term ISSM should who should maintain a consolidated database of
                                    complaints that could help the regulator in identifying vulnerabilities as follows: (i) the
                                    medium of complaints; (ii) the institution that received the complaint; (iii) breakdown
                                    of complaints by types of institutions ,industry and province; (iv) the time taken to
                                    resolve the complaints; (v) the issues complained about; (vi) the time taken to
                                    resolve; (vi) number of complaints that were not resolved; (vii) policy changes based
                                    on complaints ; and (viii) literacy efforts directly related to analysis of complaints.
                                    In any case, clear information about available complaints handling procedures should
                                    be included in the Key Facts Statement (see Good Practice B.5).

Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                        a. A system should be in place that allows consumers to seek affordable
                           and efficient third-party recourse, which could be an ombudsman or
                           tribunal, in the event the complaint with the insurer cannot be
                           resolved to the consumer’s satisfaction in accordance with internal
                           procedures.
                        b. The role of an ombudsman or equivalent institution vis-à-vis
                           consumer disputes should be made known to the public.
                        c. The ombudsman or equivalent institution should be impartial and act
                           independently from the appointing authority and the industry.
                        d. The decisions of the ombudsman or equivalent institution should be
                           binding upon the insurers. The mechanisms to ensure the
                           enforcement of these decisions should be established and
                           publicized.
Description         Paragraphs (a) – (d)
                    There is no financial services ombudsman in Mozambique today. Insurance policy
                    conditions inform customers (in varying degrees of detail in respect of composition,
                    duration and incontestability for example) that arbitration can be used to resolve
                    grievances. Customers are also in theory able to approach consumer protection
                    agencies or ISSM for support; however this rarely happens. No more than 10
                    customers per year have addressed their complaints to ISSM directly. The number of
                    cases that have been taken to the courts is similarly limited; the reasons explained in
                    the 2012 Volume II CPFL Report (Good Practice E.2 for the Banking Sector) apply
                    equally to insurance customers.
                    The CP Law provides for the establishment of consumer arbitration centers (which are
                    intended to be free to consumers) but no action has to date been taken to establish
                    such centers. There is also a Center for Arbitration Mediation and Conciliation (CAMC)
                    but it is not used for consumer disputes. See Securities Sector Good Practice E.2 for
                    further details.
Recommendation      In the shorter term, it is recommended that there be established within ISSM dedicated
                    resources for considering consumer complaints and that ISSM analyze and publish
                    complaints statistics. Relevant staff should be appropriately trained and of a number
                    which is built up over time as the market for insurance and private pensions develops.
                    ISSM could provide further guidance on dispute resolution mechanisms, obliging
                    financial institutions to proactively inform consumers of the right to complain and how
                    to proceed in the case of a dispute, particularly if retail market develops.
                    ISSM should also require the entities they supervise to report complaints statistics to
                    ISSM, who should in turn analyze the statistics for systemic issues (as well as checking
                    compliance with regulatory requirements).
                    In the longer term, it is suggested that Mozambique considers options for the
                    development of an independent third party external dispute resolution scheme, which
                    would apply to all parts of the financial sector.
                    Consideration could, for example, be given to the establishment of a financial
                    ombudsman service. The recommendations 2012 Volume II CPFL Report (see Good
                    Practice E.2 Banking Section) discuss the legal foundations, possible ways to establish
                    and fund such a service, governance and corresponding international standards.
                    Another option which might be considered is the establishment of the Consumer
                    Arbitration Centers provided for in the CP Law.
                    Examples from other jurisdictions should be shared and discussed with stakeholders
                    in Mozambique. In some countries such as Estonia, it was the insurance association

                                                                                       FINANCE & MARKETS | 60

                               who set up a mediator service for dispute resolution. South Africa, where separate
                               ombuds-services have been set up for short term72 and long term insurance73, and for
                               pensions74, provide good examples from a neighboring country. Once a preferred
                               model finds consensus, a road map to implementation can be determined and
                               executed.

     SECTION F                 GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND INSOLVENCY

     Good Practice F.1         Guarantee Schemes and Insolvency
                                     a. With the exception of schemes covering mandatory insurance (and
                                        possibly long-term insurance), insolvency guarantee schemes are
                                        not to be encouraged for insurance because of the opaque nature of
                                        the industry and the scope for moral hazard. Strong governance and
                                        prudential supervision are better alternatives.
                                     b. Nominal defendant arrangements should be in place for mandatory
                                        insurances such as motor third party liability insurance to cover
                                        situations where there is no insured guilty party.
                                     c. Assets covering life insurance mathematical reserves and
                                        investment contract policy liabilities should be segregated or at the
                                        very least earmarked, and long-term policyholders should have
                                        preferential access to such assets in the event of a winding-up.
     Description               Paragraph (a)
                               There are no insolvency guarantee schemes for insurance in Mozambique. Liquidation
                               of insurance companies follows the general procedures for commercial companies
                               specified in the Commercial Code except for specific stipulations of the insurance law,
                               which protects the assets covering technical reserves from any third party creditors,
                               and any “legislation that regulates insurance activity, especially at the level of financial
                               guarantees and protection of interests of policyholders, the insured and the insurance
                               creditors in general”. No such legislation has been issued beyond Decreto-Lei No.
                               1/2010 and Decreto No. 30/2011 in respect of orderly resolution of insurance
                               companies. The regulatory framework specifies methods for the calculation of life
                               insurance mathematical reserves and requires that they are certified by an actuary.
                               Paragraph (b)
                               There are no nominal defendant arrangements for mandatory insurances to cover
                               situations where there is no insured guilty party. While this is not a pressing issue for
                               mandatory workers’ compensation insurance and sportsmen insurance which are
                               easier to enforce, it is an issue for motor third party liability insurance because it is
                               estimated that only half of all vehicles in circulation actually have this insurance.
                               Furthermore, car insurance is often the “face” of a country’s insurance industry,
                               because it is the most prevalent type of insurance among individuals and households,
                               and even those who don’t have cars often form their opinion of the insurance industry’s
                               reliability based on others’ experience with this line of business.
                               Paragraph (c)
                               Article 26 (3) to (5) of Decreto-Lei No. 1/2010 provided for the segregation of assets
                               as follows:
                               “3.    The assets representative of the technical provisions constitute a special

                    claims in relation to movable and immovable assets which represent technical
                    provisions, and are ranked in the first place” .
                    These provisions would seem to apply to both new life insurers and to existing
                    composite insurers.
Recommendation      Because of the importance that motor insurance has for the image and reputation of
                    the insurance industry among the general public, and because accidents with
                    uninsured or unidentifiable motorists can have disastrous consequences for individuals
                    of all social segments, it is recommended that Mozambique considers the
                    establishment of a guarantee fund to cover such injuries and deaths. At the same time,
                    greater effort would be justified to enforce 100% coverage of mandatory motor third
                    party liability insurance.

SECTION G           CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT

Good Practice G.1   Broadly based Financial Capability Program
                        a. A broadly based program of financial education and information
                           should be developed to increase the financial capability of the
                           population.
                        b. A range of organizations–including government, state agencies and
                           non-governmental organizations–should be involved in developing
                           and implementing the financial capability program.
                        c. The government should appoint an institution such as the central
                           bank or a financial regulator to lead and coordinate the development
                           and implementation of the national financial capability program.
Description         Paragraphs (a) to (c)
                    There are a number of strategic initiatives currently addressing financial education in
                    Mozambique. The government’s Financial Sector Development Strategy 2013–2022
                    includes activities to promote financial literacy, such as financial education campaigns
                    to be disseminated through media and financial education material to be used in
                    schools. It documents the government’s commitment to financial inclusion as signaled
                    by the signing of the Maya Declaration in 2012. It is understood that financial literacy
                    will also be covered by Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy which is in the
                    process of development with the support of the World Banks’ FISF Program. The FISF
                    program includes the promotion of financial literacy among its objectives.
                    ISSM also has a new Financial Literacy Strategy for Insurers 2014-2018 which, in
                    addition to providing for print material and seminars, also includes capacity building
                    for journalists and collaboration with schools in the development of insurance teaching
                    material. It recognizes the need to coordinate with a considerable number of
                    stakeholders as well as the need for corresponding resources. It also acknowledges
                    the potential to include suitable insurance related teachings in school curricula, so that
                    young adults become familiar not only with insurance as a financial service that can
                    be of value to them, but also as a potential employer. This will be important as (micro)
                    insurance grows into new socioeconomic segments of population that will need to be
                    serviced by more insurance staff, ideally with a similar background.


                                                                                         FINANCE & MARKETS | 62
                                           INSURANCE SECTOR

                    At present, it is not entirely clear how the various initiatives are coordinated, nor who
                    is responsible to lead and coordinate their implementation.
                    It is encouraging, however, that informal risk pooling and sharing mechanisms are
                    familiar to many more Mozambican than those who use insurance today, and so they
                    will understand the basics of insurance if properly framed.
Recommendation      There should be consultation and coordination between relevant stakeholders in
                    developing and implementing Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy, including
                    aspects related to financial literacy, and also in relation to the implementation of the
                    ISSM Financial Literacy Strategy.
                    Mozambique’s commitment to financial inclusion – including the increase of financial
                    capability – is most encouraging, and reflects the fact that the 2015 Global Policy
                    Forum of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion will be hosted in this country. The diversity
                    of initiatives by various stakeholders and the availability of donor funding is also
                    promising. To achieve the best results, coordination between all stakeholders should
                    start as soon as possible.
                    Ideally, any initiative for financial literacy / capability should coordinate with any
                    initiative to systematically develop microinsurance. Mozambique put in place regulation
                    for microinsurance, contained in the Insurance Law and Insurance Regulation to be
                    complemented by upcoming notifications; but that is only a necessary condition, and
                    not in itself sufficient to develop a market for inclusive insurance. That usually needs
                    coordinated effort, and insurance awareness and capability plays a key role.
Good Practice G.2   Unbiased Information for Consumers
                        a. Consumers, especially the most vulnerable, should have access to
                           sufficient resources to enable them to understand financial products
                           and services available to them.
                        b. Financial regulators should provide, via the internet and printed
                           publications, independent information on the key features, benefits
                           and risks—and where practicable the costs–of the main types of
                           financial products and services.
                        c. Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to provide
                           consumer awareness programs to the public regarding financial
                           products and services.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    Consumers – especially emerging customers outside of the social segments currently
                    served by insurance – today do not have access to all the information that would help
                    them make well informed decisions. On the one hand, the insurance sector in
                    Mozambique is focused on commercial customers who often have considerable
                    expertise for the purchase of their specific insurance programs. On the other hand,
                    customers are served by agents and brokers expected (and required by law) to provide
                    consumers with the information they need. However little voluntary insurance is
                    purchased by individuals so far. Hence investment in helping the general public better
                    understand insurance has not been a priority, apart from the compliance with
                    mandatory car insurance.
                    Paragraph (b)
                    Being a new institution, ISSM has only just started to provide customers with
                    information via their website that is available since December 2014. The website
                    provides basic educational material on insurance in general and on mandatory motor
                    third party liability insurance (Q&As and glossaries). It also lists all licensed insurers,
                    pension funds, brokers and corporate agents, provides some key figures on the market
                    and on every insurer, and information about ISSM. But the information displayed so
                    far only shows the relative sizes and market shares of the various insurers, and offers
                                                                                         FINANCE & MARKETS | 63
                                                              INSURANCE SECTOR

                                 no further performance indicators related to financial stability, operational efficiency
                                 and service quality, which could help proactive insurance clients choose between
                                 insurers.
                                 Paragraph (c)
                                 With support of the German Development Agency GTZ, the AMOMIF produced the
                                 “ABC of insurance” (and similar brochures on savings and on investments) following
                                 the template developed by GTZ for Ghana and the Philippines in 2009, but adapting it
                                 to Mozambique. These basic brochures in short and longer versions are available in
                                 the offices of AMOMIF and of the consumer protection association DECOM. They
                                 constitute an encouraging example of consumer awareness initiative, but must have
                                 been produced before 2010 when GTZ renamed to GiZ. Instead of ISSM, for example,
                                 the brochures mention the Commisão Nacional de Seguros, ISSM’s predecessor.
                                 Public radio and television networks are required by the CP Law to reserve airtime
                                 (under terms yet to be defined by law) for promoting consumer rights and interests75.
     Recommendation              If Mozambique wants insurance to be used not only by industry and corporations but
                                 also by households beyond mandatory car insurance and loan-related insurance,
                                 trustworthy and useful information to help prospective customers develop trust in the
                                 industry, develop competence with insurance concepts, and make well informed
                                 decisions will be of paramount importance. It will be even more important if
                                 Mozambique wants to see microinsurance thrive and serve clients whose financial
                                 literacy in general is lower, and often also their familiarity with formal services. It is
                                 most encouraging to see that ISSM has established itself as a reputed and well-
                                 resourced center of competence in insurance, and that ISSM has a clear strategy of
                                 insurance education that include outreach to consumers via helplines and physical
                                 presence.
                                 The above efforts can and should be supported by creating ongoing transparency
                                 about the insurers’ products and performance. ISSM should consider the examples of
                                 other countries like Peru who publish premiums for e.g. mandatory car insurance
                                 online76 as well as the number of complaints by insurer77. (Peru is also an excellent
                                 example of insurance education provided by the supervisor78.) Other examples of
                                 supervisors that publish performance indicators such as claims ratios and complaints
                                 for every insurer are Brazil79 and Colombia80.
                                 In more developed markets, the availability of detailed information about insurers’
                                 products and service indicators is considered to be necessary for intermediaries to
                                 comply with their mandate to provide best advice to customers, and if such data is not
                                 provided by supervisors, it is provided by private entities. (If such data is provided by
                                 supervisors81, private entities sometimes provide greater degree of detail).82 Shedding
                                 light on insurers’ products and performance not only increases the understanding and
                                 confidence of consumers – and their trust in ISSM who would provide such data – but
                                 it also provides a natural benchmarking where insurance companies who perform
                                 poorly on some relevant indicator are strongly motivated to improve. It is often not
                                 welcome by the industry initially, and ISSM deserves every support to convince
                                 Mozambican insurers, collect and analyze the necessary information, and make it

     Good Practice G.3             Measuring the Impact of Financial Capability Initiatives
                                        a. Policymakers, industry and advocates should understand the
                                           financial capability of various market segments, particularly those
                                           most vulnerable to abuse.
                                        b. The financial capability of consumers should be measured through a
                                           broad-based household survey that is repeated from time to time.
                                        c. The effectiveness of key financial capability initiatives should be
                                           evaluated.
     Description                   Paragraph (a)
                                   The 2014 World Bank report on Financial Capability and Inclusion83 documents the
                                   findings of a thorough survey among over 3,000 adults representative of the country’s
                                   financially active population. It provides a wealth of insights and numerous
                                   recommendations, and confirms the findings of the FinScope Mozambique 2009 Survey
                                   Report84. FinScope interviewed a representative cross-section of more than 5,000 adult
                                   Mozambicans comprehensively about their financial behavior, familiarity with financial
                                   terminology, and use of financial services, resulting in detailed insights into
                                   Mozambiqueans’ awareness and use of formal insurance as well as informal insurance-
                                   like services such as funeral mutual assistance funds. Among other findings, the report
                                   shows that more than half of the interviewed had never heard of insurance. The
                                   research has been updated in 2014 and the FinMark Trust has announced the launch
                                   of the results of FinScope Mozambique Consumer Survey 2014 (the date is to be
                                   confirmed).
                                   Paragraph (b)
                                   The only broad-based household survey on financial capability of consumers that is
                                   repeated from time to time is the FinScope survey. It does not, however, follow the
                                   same panel of households. And its frequency may outside the control of the
                                   Government of Mozambique, considering also that the cost of such surveys and their
                                   evaluation is considerable.
                                   Paragraph (c)
                                   No assessment of the effectiveness of insurance capability initiatives has been
                                   conducted so far. Such initiatives are resource-intensive and impact assessments from
                                   other countries tell a cautionary tale85 about effectiveness, so monitoring and
                                   evaluation are important. Although there is an increasing body of documented
                                   experience from other countries’ microinsurance development that can guide
                                   Mozambique in respect of emerging customers (micro or otherwise), caution is
                                   required when attempting to transfer lessons on financial and insurance capabilities –
                                   and the impact of initiatives to strengthen them – from one country to another.

     Recommendation               Ideally regular household financial capability surveys would be held to monitor
                                  progress in financial literacy levels.
                                  ISSM should also develop a framework to assess the impact of insurance capability
                                  initiatives, in close coordination with BdM. While cooperating on the overall effort,
                                  ISSM should be responsible for the insurance aspects of financial capability, initiatives,
                                  and their impact evaluation.
                                  To include also the private sector initiatives, the Banking Sector Good Practice in the
                                  2012 CPFL Review recommends establishing a common website where government
                                  authorities, consumer organizations and industry associations could upload their
                                  financial education materials for consumers and discuss the effectiveness of various

                           III. GOOD PRACTICES: PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR

OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVATE PENSIONS MARKET
Over and above basic social protection, mandatory pension coverage in Mozambique is limited to the
small number of formal sector workers, with private, supplementary schemes just starting to develop.
Pensions are provided only to formal sector workers, mainly through the public sector and Bank of Mozambique pension
schemes and through the mandatory social security scheme for private workers managed by INSS. A small number of
employers offer supplementary, occupational pension schemes for their staff, and open pension funds run by external
providers are starting to develop. Basic social protection also exists for the most vulnerable elderly, through the proxy
means tested, Programa de Subsido Social Basico (PSSB), a social pension providing between USD10-USD18 a month
to approximately 400,000 households.

                                                         PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


The public sector scheme (CSSASPS) is currently managed directly by the Ministry of Finance,
with an independent, contributory, pension fund due to be established in 2015. The scheme
covers 250,000 active public sector workers (central and local government, teachers, police, military etc.)
and 130,000 pensioners and other beneficiaries (90,000 from the military). It is a defined benefit (DB)
scheme, with generous benefits87 providing 100% replacement rate after 35 years of service. Parametric
reforms will be needed to maintain the stability of the fund over the long-term.88 The new scheme will be
managed by the recently established Institute. In addition to employees contributing 7% of salaries to the
scheme (which covers current benefits payments), the government, as employer, will also start to
contribute a similar amount to the scheme. The fund will build surpluses in the initial years of operation,
and the management of these assets will need careful governance and oversight given it will quickly grow
to be one of the largest funds in the country. Whether existing workers or only new hires will join the
scheme is yet to be established (and the potential impact on the government budget needs to be
assessed). 89

The Bank of Mozambique pension fund is one of the largest in the country, but remains outside
the new pension regulations. The Bank of Mozambique scheme for central bank employees has only
1500 members but large assets (USD 300 million), which are mainly invested in bank deposits. Though
under the supervision of ISSM, this fund is not subject to investment and other regulations. The fund was
cash flow negative at the time of the CPFL Review mission (receiving 92 million MT in contributions whilst
paying out 400 million MT, with the difference covered by ‘special contribution’ from the Central Bank
employer).
The INSS also requires parametric reforms to maintain financial stability over the long-term
and needs to continue to address the issue of non-payment of contributions, particularly as
coverage is extended to self-employed groups. The INSS is meant to cover all formal sector workers
(estimated at 1.5 million out of total labor force of 10 million). However only 1.2 million individuals were
registered as of September 2014. In practice, contributions are only being paid on behalf of 400,000
members, with pensions paid to 56,000 individuals. INSS management team confirmed that they have
stepped up the campaign to enforce contribution payment by employers (through visiting offices and

   Parameters, including the accrual rate of 2.87%, pensions based on final salary and indexed to wages, are generous by regional and international
comparisons.
88
 An actuarial assessment of the fund was carried out in 2011 by the ILO. This estimated that a long-run contribution rate of 20.9% is needed to
maintain the financial security of the fund.
89
   Administrative upgrades to move from manual to electronic records, and a through data cleaning exercise are needed before migrating data to the
new scheme. This should help with issues around delayed payments of benefits (which can take up to 6 months to be received) and ‘ghost’ pensioners
in the system.

threatening fines) – including the remittance of withheld individual contributions paid by employees but not
transferred to the fund by their employers. Though not a direct consumer protection issue, this is a key
aspect of member protection within the INSS scheme. Coverage is being extended to select groups of self-
employed workers (i.e. those organized via associations such as traders, lawyers etc.), with an eventual
roll out of the scheme to informal sector groups being considered. Service to members is being improved
through the roll out of digital registrations, allowing for on-line account information and the faster benefit
processing and payments – which should also help to reduce the high cost level of the fund.90 The current
contribution rate to the INSS is not high (7% - 4% employer, 3% employees). As with the civil service
scheme pension scheme, parametric reform is required to ensure the long-term viability of the fund.91
Benefit levels have dropped following the parametric changes introduced in 2008, though the high level of
minimum pension (based on the highest sector minimum wage) introduces distortions.92 The investment
portfolio of the fund is being restructured due to the high level of exposure to short-term bank deposits.93
The small but growing voluntary occupational pension sector is supervised by ISSM. The
Pension Regulations (25/2009) requires all funds and service providers to be licensed and follow fairly
comprehensive operating procedures. There are currently 5 registered private pension funds, 2 of which
are also insurance companies.94 Around a dozen large employers (such as railway, commodities, airport
operator and banks) offer supplementary, occupational pensions to their employees. Some of these are
managed in-house (a few are yet to register with ISSM), with two external management entities (Global
Alliance and Mocambique Previdente) also managing some closed funds on behalf of employers. Global
Alliance also offers an umbrella fund which several smaller employers have joined, with Mocambique
Previdente due to launch a similar product in 2015. Pension funds are not sold on a retail basis directly to
individuals. As funds are established by employers and there is no individual choice of provider or
investment portfolio, members of pension funds are not strictly ‘consumers’. However, protection is still
required for members of private pension funds, and it is in this context which the diagnostic is conducted.

     23% contributions are currently spent on administration costs.
91
  The ILO also conducted an actuarial review of the INSS in 2011. This projects that the fund will become cash flow negative in 2023 with asset
depletion estimated in 2035. The breakeven contribution rate was estimated by the ILO to be 11.9%.
92
   Benefits are based on the final 16 years’ salary (rising to 20 years by 2017), with a 2.5% accrual rate with full pension after 20 years of
contributions. The retirement age is 55 for women and 60 for men.
93
     These have been reduced from 78% to 61% of the portfolio from June to September 2014, with a target level of 50%.
10% off-shore investment is allowed, but has yet to be instituted in practice by the funds as additional approvals from the central Bank are required
and are proving cumbersome.

 SECTION A                       CONSUMER PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS

 Good Practice A.1               Consumer Protection Regime
                                 The law should recognize and provide for clear rules on consumer
                                 protection in the area of private pensions and there should be adequate
                                 supporting institutional arrangements:
                                      a. There should be specific provisions in the law, which create an
                                         effective regime for the protection of consumers who deal directly
                                         with pension management companies and members/ affiliates of
                                         occupational plans.
                                      b. There should be a general consumer protection agency or a
                                         specialized agency, responsible for the implementation, oversight
                                         and enforcement of pension consumer protection, as well as data
                                         collection and analysis (including inquiries, complaints and
                                         disputes).
                                      c. The law should provide, or at least not prohibit, a role for the
                                           private sector, including voluntary consumer organizations and
                                           self-regulatory organizations, in respect of consumer protection
                                           regarding private pensions.
 Description                     Paragraph (a)
                                 General consumer protection is provided for in Article 100 of the Constitution of
                                 Mozambique, as well as via the CP Law. The consumer rights covered in the CP Law
                                 include rights (in summary) to education, information (and there are specific
                                 provisions in relation to credit contracts), a 7 day cooling off period, substantive
                                 fairness, clear and legible print in contracts and rights to the protection of economic
                                 interests and the legal protection and accessible justice. Further there are
                                 prohibitions against misleading advertising and abusive clauses and provision for the
                                 establishment of consumer arbitration centers. There is also provision for the
                                 establishment of a Consumer Institute designed to promote consumer protection
                                 policies.
                                 The Law also recognizes consumer associations and provides them with rights in
                                 relation to (amongst other things) social partner status in matters concerning
                                 consumers and to State funding. This legal oversight also extends to the pensions
                                 sector - though in practice has not been tested as this is a new and developing
                                 market.95 However, notwithstanding the broad scope of this law, it does not appear
                                 to have been implemented or enforced to date (as also noted in the 2012 CPFL
                                 Diagnostic). However implementing regulations are being prepared and are
                                 expected to be approved early in 2015, with the establishment of the Consumer
                                 Institute to follow. The Advertising Code also provides general protection to

   Pension schemes in Mozambique are currently arranged on an occupational basis. Membership of in-house schemes (run by the sponsoring
company) is covered under employment contracts (outlining benefit conditions etc.). Where schemes are managed externally, the contact is between
the sponsoring employer and the pension fund management entity. In these cases the members are not strictly consumers. However, the scope of the
CP Law (Article 3) extends to ‘collective persons’ and ‘bodies, suppliers and providers of good services and rights’. They would therefore receive
protection under the Law. If a retail market for pensions develops in future (as allowed for in the Pensions Regulations) protection would also be
directly provided to individual purchasers of pension products.

                                                           PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                                    consumers, noting that advertisements must be based on the principle of respecting
                                    consumers’ rights (Article 4).
                                    The Pension Regulations provide the main legal protection for members of pension
                                    funds. The Regulations oblige all pension funds, as well as their managing entities,
                                    to register with the supervising entity (Article 19). In addition, Article 37 requires
                                    that the fund management entity acts in the exclusive interest of the affiliates,
                                    pension members and beneficiaries. 96 This is reiterated in Article 38 on conflicts of
                                    interest, and Article 60 on the internal audit function (which should check that the
                                    management of pension fund activities is effected in the best interest of pension
                                    fund members and beneficiaries). Article 8 gives the supervisor responsibility for
                                    ensuring that pension fund managing entities not only comply with legal and
                                    regulatory provisions, but also “avoid or eliminate any irregularities which may
                                    prejudice the interest of pension fund members and beneficiaries”, and can restrict
                                    or suspend them if they do not.
                                    The pension sector in Mozambique is regulated and supervised by ISSM.97 The
                                    Insurance Law explicitly gives ISSM supervisory authority over not only
                                    supplementary pension funds but also the mandatory INSS fund and the staff fund
                                    run by the Bank of Mozambique workers. Article 7 of the Pensions Regulations gives
                                    the supervisor powers over pension funds and their managing entities. 98
                                    Protection for members of pension funds is also provided by the governing body of
                                    the fund which looks after members interests. In Mozambique, the governing body
                                    takes the form of a Supervisory Committee, which must be established by all funds
                                    under the Article 52 of the Pension Regulations. 99 Article 53 requires that one-third
                                    of the representatives must be chosen by the members of the fund (nominated by
                                    unions or elected by members). However, the Pension Regulations do not prescribe
                                    any suitability or knowledge requirements for the members of the governing body,
                                    as is normally required and is considered good practice internationally – as outlined
                                    in the OECD Guidelines for Pension Fund Governance100:
                                    4. Suitability
                                    Membership in the governing body should be subject to minimum suitability (or non-
                                    suitability) standards in order to ensure a high level of integrity, competence,
                                    experience and professionalism in the governance of the pension fund. The
                                    governing body should collectively have the necessary skills and knowledge to
                                    oversee all the functions performed by a pension fund, and to monitor those
                                    delegates and advisors to who such functions have been delegated. It should also
                                    seek to enhance its knowledge, where relevant, via appropriate training. Any criteria
                                    that may disqualify an individual from appointment to the governing body should be
                                    clearly laid out in the regulation.



96
     There is no trust law or general application of fiduciary duty in Mozambique, though the introduction of such an Act has been discussed.
97
     The preamble of Decreto-Law No. 1/2010 establishes the supervisory body ISSM under the Ministry of Finance.
98
  ISSM is mainly funded via industry levies, the majority coming from the insurance sector, with the pension fund managing entities required to pay
an annual fee of 30,000 MT to the regulator.
99
     Including all open pension funds with more than 50 individual members.

                                                          PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                                    Training requirements for pension fund supervisory boards are becoming good
                                    practice in many countries. For example on on-line training, known as the Trustee
                                    Toolkit, has been developed by the UK Pension Regulator.101 Alternatively, in
                                    countries such as Ireland, the regulator authorizes external training providers.
                                    It is too early a stage in the industry’s development to tell how well these supervisory
                                    committees are operating in practice. International experience suggests that the
                                    governance of DC funds operated by commercial, financial institutions is always
                                    challenging.102 The supplementary pension fund industry in Mozambique is small,
                                    new and developing. Given the industry structure is market-driven, the regulator will
                                    need to watch for challenges around fees and governance which have been an issue
                                    in similar situations internationally. As the pension market is new and small, fees are
                                    currently high (ranging from Assets under Management (AUM) charge of around
                                    1.5% to 5%, the top end being well above international averages and even some
                                    regional peers). These should decline as the market grows and matures. However,
                                    competition has proven not to work as well for pensions as for other financial sector
                                    markets, with fees staying stubbornly high as pension fund members lack knowledge
                                    and are generally disengaged. Regulators in other countries have been forced to
                                    intervene when this is the case.103
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    The Insurance Law required that ISSM be created, with Ministerial Decree 29/2012
                                    approving its statutes. Whilst ISSM is clearly respected by the pension industry and
                                    the developments of the previous few years are recognized, further staff resources
                                    and capacity building are clearly needed as at the time of the CPFL Review mission
                                    there were only 2 staff focused on supervision of the pensions sector and the legal
                                    and regulatory framework had not been implemented in full, which itself indicates a
                                    lack of supervisory resources. For example, in addition to some supplementary funds
                                    which are still operating without a license, the fund portfolios of some supplementary

                                    Regulations (261/ 2009).104 Further, whilst fledgling off-site supervision has
                                    commenced in that reports are being received from pension funds, standardized
                                    reporting format has not yet been established, and information on the industry is
                                    yet to be published in a transparent fashion. Further there is no separate department
                                    overseeing market conduct / consumer protection for either insurance or pensions.
                                    Paragraph (c)

  Recommendation                    Supervisory capacity within ISSM needs to be built to ensure full protection for
                                    pension fund members.

                                                    PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                               At a minimum, ISSM staff focusing on pensions should be increased and should
                               attend specialist training courses on pension supervision. In this regard it is noted
                               that ISSM is a member of four international organizations, namely: ASEL (1998),
                               CISNA (1999), AIAS and IOPS (both since 2014). Membership of such organizations
                               is to be encouraged in order for staff to gain experience and knowledge from their
                               international peers.
                               ISSM should establish a standardized reporting format and start to publish industry
                               data in a clear and timely fashion, in order to allow all stakeholders and fund
                               members to gain a clear picture of the pension industry as it develops. This includes
                               the on-line publication of pension industry data (e.g. number of schemes, members,
                               assets, average/range rates of return, average/range of fees charged etc.) on the
                               newly launched website.
                               ISSM should also begin to focus on regulatory implementation. The authority needs
                               to ensure that all funds are licensed. The few funds which continue to operate
                               without authorization should be forced to register, to join an umbrella fund or to
                               close. At a minimum, the regulator should agree a timetable with these funds for
                               compliance. The investment regulations established under Ministerial Diploma 261
                               /2009 also need to be enforced, at a minimum agreeing a timeframe with non-
                               compliant funds to bring their portfolios in line with asset class restrictions.
                               ISSM should issue additional guidance on pension fund governance via appropriate
                               guidelines or circulars. This should including minimum standards for trustees. Over
                               the longer-term, ISSM should consider providing or supporting training for members
                               of the supervisory committees, particularly those appointed by members.

  Good Practice A.2            Other Institutional Arrangements
                                     a. The judicial system should provide credibility to the enforcement
                                        of the rules on pension consumer protection.
                                     b. The media and consumer associations should play an active role in
                                        promoting pension consumer protection.
  Description                  Paragraph (a)
                               The CP Law requires that consumers have access to justice and the courts under
                               appropriate conditions. This would also apply to pension related cases. In addition,
                               the Pensions Regulations allow for the supervisory authority “recourse to competent
                               judicial entities” (Article 8). As this is a new sector, legal protection through the
                               courts has not been tested in practice. Unless the system has changes substantially
                               in the last two years, the findings of the Banking Sector Good Practices in the 2012
                               CPFL Review105 suggests that the judicial system is not practical or accessible for
                               retail consumers because of the costs and delays of the procedure, and the lack of
                               expertise of judges.
                               Paragraph (b)
                               The CP Law provides for the media and consumer associations to play an active role
                               in promoting consumer protection.

                                 PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                 Article 9 of the states that “Public radio and television networks shall reserve airtime
                 under the terms to be defined by the law, for promoting consumer rights and
                 interests.” Article 35 states that “      Consumer associations are entitled to the
                 following rights: … b)     Airtime on radio and television under the same terms as
                 associations that have social partner status”. The BdM has used TVM as a means of
                 providing financial education, but the focus has been on banking issues and a call-
                 in show hosted by a securities expert. To date there has not been any focus on the
                 private pensions sector. The reality is that no airtime is likely to be made available
                 (either on radio or on TV) unless paid for, and no budgets are known to have been
                 allocated.
                 The CP Law recognizes consumer associations and cooperatives and endows them
                 with a social partner status in consumer policy matters, so that they can appoint
                 representatives to the corresponding consultative or cooperative bodies and
                 represent consumers during the decision-making process. The CP Law also gives
                 them a right to airtime on radio and television that comes with the social partner
                 status (despite the law, no airtime seems to be available for CP unless paid for).
                 These associations and cooperatives are non-profit legal entities and can be
                 considered part of the private sector.
                 The responsibility of state and local municipalities for the information of consumers
                 includes support to information initiatives promoted by consumer associations and
                 cooperatives.
                 Two existing consumer associations have been identified in Mozambique:
                 •   DECOM
                 •   PROCONSUMERS
                 Neither is widely known, impressively resourced, or equipped with pensions’ specific
                 expertise. This is understandable given their broad focus and given the absence of
                 a substantial private pensions market.

Recommendation   Training for the media on pension issues could be provided by ISSM and a
                 partnership with key financial journalists built. Further capacity building support for
                 consumer associations in relation to pensions issues should also be considered.

  SECTION B                         DISCLOSURE AND SALES PRACTICES

  Good Practice B.1                 General Practices
                                          a. The information available and provided to the consumer should
                                             clearly inform the consumer of the choice of accounts, products
                                             and services, as well as the risks associated with each of the
                                             options or choices.
                                          b. Employers should be responsible for ensuring that new plan
                                             members are made fully aware of their rights and obligations
                                             under any occupational pension arrangements.
                                          c. Employers should be required to vest benefits with employees
                                             relatively quickly so as to avoid undesirable personnel practices
                                             (such as terminating employment just as employer contributions
                                             are about to vest).
                                          d. Employers should be obliged to ensure that contributions are
                                             properly collected, accounted for and passed on to the pension
                                             fund’s managers.
  Description                       Paragraph (a)
                                    The CP Law (Article 10) gives consumers the right to clear, objective and adequate
                                    information.
                                    The Pension Regulations provide comprehensive guidance on the information which
                                    is required to be provided to individual pension fund members on joining a fund
                                    (Article 27). This includes benefit conditions, transfer and termination information,
                                    fees etc. Individuals are also required in writing to confirm their agreement with the
                                    fund management regulations. In addition, Article 64 outlines that, in order to
                                    ensure a better understanding of the characteristics of the fund by members before
                                    they join, the supervisor may require that the relevant information in the
                                    management agreement (relating to the risks inherent to membership and of the
                                    applicable tax regime etc.) is made available by way of an informative prospectus.
                                    No pension funds are currently sold to individuals on a retail basis, and no existing
                                    pension products offer any investment choice.
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    Article 61 of the Pensions Regulations initially requires the managing entity to
                                    provide information to members joining a closed, occupational pension plan.
                                    However, Article 61(4) allows for this responsibility to be transferred to the
                                    sponsoring employer (‘affiliate’) or the supervisory committee of the fund by prior
                                    agreement between the managing entity and sponsoring employer or union
                                    establishing the fund.
                                    The information which is required to be provided on joining an open occupational
                                    fund106 is fairly comprehensive, including the characteristic principles of the fund´s
                                    financing plan, the conditions on which benefits shall become due, transfer rights,
                                    risks of the plan, investment policy, management regulations, and fees (Article 26).

      This would apply to the ‘umbrella’ funds which small employers can join.

                                                        PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                                   External pension fund managing entities confirmed that they provide this standard
                                   plan information to members when they join a pension fund. It was not possible to
                                   verify the information provided by in-house managed funds.
                                   Paragraph (c)
                                   The Pensions Regulations do not cover vesting. In practice, an external management
                                   entity confirmed that the general custom with their clients is that employee
                                   contributions vest immediately. However, employer contributions in some cases do
                                   not vest at all. International good practice is for employer contributions to also vest
                                   within a reasonable time frame (normally within 5 years). The OECD Guidelines on
                                   The Protection of Rights of Members and Beneficiaries of Pension Plans state that:107
                                   Accrued benefits should vest immediately or after a period of employment with the
                                   employer sponsoring the plan that is reasonable in light of average employee tenure.
                                   Paragraph (d)
                                   The Pension Regulations (Article 36) state that it is the responsibility of the pension
                                   fund managing entity to collect the expected contributions. The fund managing
                                   entities confirmed that contribution collection is not a problem with the
                                   supplementary, occupational plans which they manage, which are up to date not
                                   only with these supplementary contributions but also their mandatory payments to
                                   the INSS (indeed they have to be in order to launch a supplementary scheme).
                                   However, contribution collection is an issue with the mandatory INSS fund – where
                                   contributions are only being received for 400,000 of the total 1.2 million registered
                                   members (with only around 50,000 out of 100,000 firms in compliance). Not only
                                   are employers not paying the contributions due, but some are also not remitting the
                                   contributions to the fund which they take from employees’ salaries. This an
                                   important issue for the protection of pension fund members, and ISSM, as
                                   supervisors of mandatory scheme, should support the INSS in their efforts to
                                   improve contribution collection. As is the case in other countries, such as Hong Kong,
                                   Israel, Kenya, Peru and Turkey, amongst others, pension fund managers should
                                   send a warning to the employee (and preferably to the authorities ) if contributions
                                   do not arrive properly.108

  Recommendation                   ISSM should include checks on information provision in their supervisory oversight.
                                   If a retail market develops in future ISSM may wish to reexamine the legal
                                   information requirements and issue further guidance as appropriate.
                                   ISSM should issue a guidance note confirming that employee contributions should
                                   vest immediately and that employer contributions should vest within a reasonable
                                   time frame (maximum 5 years).
                                   ISSM should support the INSS in their compliance efforts.

Good Practice B.2   Advertising and Sales Materials
                        a. Pension management companies should ensure their advertising
                           and sales materials and procedures do not mislead the customers.
                        b. All marketing and sales materials of pension management
                           companies should be easily readable and understandable by the
                           average public.
                        c. The pension management company should be legally responsible
                           for all statements made in marketing and sales materials related to
                           its products, and for all statements made by any person acting as
                           an agent for the company.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    There are multiple controls on advertising. The Constitution (Article 92) requires all
                    advertising to be regulated and misleading examples prohibited, whist the CP Law
                    (Article 4) outlines truthful advertising as a consumer right. The full Advertising Code
                    also applies. This states that: “Advertising is governed by the principles of lawfulness,
                    identifiability, veracity and respect for the rights of consumers.” (Article 4). For
                    further details see Insurance Good Practice B.2.
                    The Pension Regulations state that the advertising of pension products is explicitly
                    covered by these general advertising laws (Article 66). Specific requirements are also
                    made, including that:
                    “The publication of future results, based on estimates of the managing entity, is
                    prohibited, unless a statement that the results are a simulation is printed in
                    characters which stand out from all other typographical characters.” (Article 66.2) In
                    addition: “Public documents, and supporting publications relating to open pension
                    funds, must clearly indicate that the value of the participation units held varies, in
                    accordance with the development of the value of the assets which make up the
                    pension fund equity, specifying also the existence of a guarantee relating to the
                    payment of minimum income.” (Article 66.3)
                    Insurance Regulation (Article 88) empowers ISSM to issue norms relating to
                    consumer protection in advertising, and to check compliance with these norms,
                    ordering if necessary the suspension or immediate publication of an adequate
                    rectification. The Pension Regulations (Article 51) allows marketing of pensions by
                    insurance brokers, and these powers are therefore presumed to apply to the pension
                    sector. But so far, no such norms have been issued, and there is no process for ISSM
                    to systematically review pension or insurance advertising before it is launched
                    (though little has so far been issued due to the lack of a retail market for either
                    insurance or pensions).. The Insurance Regulation requires brokers to disclose
                    commission upon request of the client (and prohibits charging any additional
                    administrative or other fees). Insurers that are part of multinational groups often
                    have group wide internal codes of conduct to protect their brand, including rules for
                    communication and advertising.
                    In practice, pension products in Mozambique are currently ‘sold’ by pension
                    management entities to employers, and are not advertised directly to the public via
                    retail marketing. These legal protections have therefore yet to be tested.

                                    Industry codes of conduct are also useful tools for regulating advertising standards,
                                    and supervisory authorities may explicitly request pension administrators to come up
                                    with such a code of conduct (for instance, in Mexico).109 Examples of good practice
                                    in the sales and marketing of pension products include the guidance prepared by the
                                    European Commission amongst others.110
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    The general legal requirements which apply to pensions require advertising to be
                                    clear and truthful. In addition, Article 66 of the Pension Regulations specifically
                                    requires any simulation or estimates of future results to be presented in a different
                                    form of typographical character.
                                    Paragraph (c)
                                    Article 51 of the Pensions Act explains that the ‘marketing entities’ for pension
                                    products are either the pension fund managing entities or authorized insurance
                                    brokers and credit institutions, and that these are covered by their respective
                                    legislation. The responsibility of insurers – or brokers – for any acts of insurance
                                    agents or promoters in the course of insurance intermediation is established in ICL–
                                    which is the Second Book of the Insurance Law.
                                    ICL requires the insurance proposal to document that the mandatory information has
                                    been provided to the customer (ISSM may issue further norms and guidelines in
                                    respect of information duties). Violation of this information duty allows the customer
                                    to rescind from the contract within 30 days of having received the policy; the same
                                    rescission right applies if the policy conditions do not correspond to the information
                                    provided before inception of the contract.
  Recommendation                    ISSM should include checks on marketing in their supervisory oversight. If a retail market
                                    develops in future ISSM may wish to reexamine the legal information requirements and issue
                                    further guidance as appropriate.

 Good Practice B.3               Key Facts Statement
                                 A Key Facts Statement disclosing the key factors of the pension scheme and its
                                 services should be presented by the pension management company before the
                                 consumer signs a contract.

 Description                     Article 61 of the Pension Regulations outlines the initial information to be provided to the
                                 members of a pension fund – including the basic benefits, rights, risks and nature of the
                                 scheme. For individual members of open funds, an ‘information prospectus’ with the relevant
                                 information from the regulations and membership agreement of the fund may be provided by
                                 the managing entity to ensure better understanding of the fund (Article 64). The Act also
                                 allows for “the duties to provide information…may be increased, if it becomes necessary to
                                 ensure better and effective comprehension of the characteristics of the fund…”
                                 Much work on these documents in relation to the pension sector has been undertaken by the
                                 European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). For example, a statement
                                 of the EIOPA Occupational Pensions Stakeholder Group (OPSG) includes a recommendation
                                 for a Basic Information Document (BID). This would include: the name of the pension scheme;
                                 the nature and main features of the pension scheme; a brief indication of whether loss of
                                 capital is possible; indication of the consequences of an early exit; risk and reward profile of
                                 the pension scheme; contributions to be paid by the member and all costs and charges; past
                                 performance of the pension scheme; and not legally binding projections of possible retirement
                                 benefits. Such a BID could then form the first layer in a multilayer disclosure approach.111

 Recommendation                  ISSM should study international examples of Key Fact Statements for pension products,
                                 develop a form of statements suitable for use in Mozambique and require pension fund
                                 management entities and plan sponsors to provide such information to occupation fund
                                 members. ISSM could use Article 64 of the Pension Law to require a Key Facts Statement as
                                 the retail market develops.

 Good Practice B.4               Special Disclosures
                                       a. Pension management companies should disclose information relating to
                                          the products they offer, including investment options, risk and benefits,
                                          fees and charges, any restrictions or penalties on transfer, fraud protection
                                          over accounts, and fee on closure of account.
                                       b. Customers should be notified of any planned change in fees or charges a
                                          reasonable period in advance of the effective date of the change.
                                       c. Pension management companies should inform consumers upfront of the
                                          nature of any guarantee arrangements covering their pension products.
                                       d. Customers should be informed upfront regarding the time, manner and
                                          process of disputing information on statements and in respect of
                                          transactions.
                                       e. Customers should be informed in writing, at the time of sale or when
                                          joining an occupational plan, of the options available to them if they decide
                                          to change employer, move or retire.

Description      Paragraph (a)
                 Articles 26 and 27 of the Pension Regulations state that specified information
                 (including on benefits, fees, transfers and fund closures) must be included in the
                 membership agreement for collective funds and in the individual agreement of
                 membership for retail funds. Articles 61 and 63 reiterate these requirements as part
                 of the initial information which must be provided to members. The external
                 management entities the mission team met confirmed that this information is
                 provided to fund members. In-house managed funds are also understood to provide
                 such information, but the mission meetings were unable to verify this fact.
                 Paragraph (b)
                 Article 29 of the Pensions Act states that individuals must be informed of an increase
                 in commissions, a substantial change in the investment policy or a change in fund
                 manager, and be given the option to switch to another fund free of charge. Article
                 62 (3) reiterates the requirement to provide this information on major changes to
                 the fund, including that the information has to be provided within 45 days
                 (presumably of the date of effect of the change). Article 63 also explicitly requires
                 the information to be provided to those already in retirement who are receiving
                 benefits from the fund (within 30 days of the change). These legal requirements
                 have yet to be tested in practice.
                 Paragraph (c)
                 Article 25 of the Pensions Regulations requires disclosure of minimum guaranteed
                 income, the duration of the guarantee and an explanation of how the investment
                 policy shall meet this objective (if the managing entity assumes the investment risk).
                 Such products are not currently offered (almost all funds are defined contribution in
                 nature).
                 Paragraph (d)
                 Dispute resolution is not covered in the Pension Regulations. See section E for
                 comments and recommendations.
                 Paragraph (e)
                 Details on the portability of benefits are required to be provided on joining an
                 occupational fund under Article 61 of the Pensions Act. The external management
                 entities met by the mission team confirmed that this information is provided to fund
                 members. In-house managed funds are understood to provide such information, but
                 the mission meetings were unable to verify.
Recommendation   ISSM should check information provision as part of the supervisory oversight process.
                 See Section E on dispute mechanisms.

Good Practice B.5   Professional Competence
                        a. Marketing personnel, officers selling and approving transactions,
                           and agents, should have sufficient qualifications and competence,
                           depending on the complexities of the products they sell.
                        b. The law should require agents to be licensed, or at least be
                           authorized to operate, by the regulator or supervisor.
                        c. Personnel departments with responsibility for occupational
                           arrangements should have at least one suitably qualified individual
                           who can explain the plan to members and deal with third-party
                           providers such as asset management companies.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    Article 51 of the Pension Regulations allows the marketing of pension products only
                    by pension managing entities, authorized insurance brokers and credit institutions.
                    The legal framework for these sectors requires qualifications and competence from
                    these agents. Insurance intermediation can only be exercised by those registered
                    with ISSM pursuant to the Insurance Regulations. Brokers need to have at least one
                    manager or administrator who has been registered as an individual insurance agent
                    for at least 5 years or who has proven professional experience in technical and
                    commercial insurance for the same period of time. Individual agents have to receive
                    basic insurance training from the insurer who proposes them for registration by
                    ISSM, and ISSM may test the applicants unless they can prove 5 years of professional
                    insurance experience. There is no standard syllabus of what the basic insurance
                    training needs to cover, nor has ISSM test been elaborated yet (Articles 116-119).
                    Corporate agents, on the other hand, only need to have at least one full time
                    employee with insurance knowledge (Article 120). Ian insurance promoter also needs
                    to receive insurance training from the relevant insurer, and the content of that
                    training is to be defined by ISSM; it is unclear whether it has been defined already.
                    In practice, pensions are not sold by insurance brokers as a retail product. There is
                    currently no capacity in terms of independent financial advisors in Mozambique,
                    though the external pension providers recognize this will need to be built as a retail
                    market for financial products develops. External pension providers currently use
                    consultants to develop relationships with existing and potential corporate sponsors
                    of occupational pension plans. These consultants have international training and
                    background (for example some come from the South African parent groups of these
                    companies). Local capacity is being built but will take time.
                    Pension intermediaries are controlled in a number of countries (Australia, Bulgaria,
                    Hong Kong, Namibia and the Netherlands among others). Standard fit and proper
                    criteria apply to pension intermediaries in most IOPS member jurisdictions.
                    Qualifications required may be academic (Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Serbia, Slovakia,
                    Thailand and Turkey among others) and/or issued by the industry (for instance,
                    Austria, Mexico or the Netherlands). Many jurisdictions maintain on-going training
                    requirements (such as Costa Rica, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Slovakia
                    and Turkey). In Hong Kong, Pakistan, Spain, or Turkey, and in many Latin American
                    countries (Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru) pension fund providers themselves sell the
                    product – and in such cases, requirements apply to internal staff. At the other

                                  extreme, in countries such as Korea, Jamaica or Romania, only agents are involved
                                  (pension providers do not handle distribution directly). Most countries allow both
                                  internal staff and agents.112
                                  Paragraph (b)
                                  As above.
                                  Paragraph (c)
                                  The Pension Regulations do not impose any requirement on human resources
                                  representatives from firms sponsoring occupational funds. In practice, the managing
                                  entities interviewed advised that they work with human resources representatives
                                  from their client firms to ensure they are suitably knowledgeable on pension issues
                                  and the plan details. In-house funds also have dedicated staff responsible for the
                                  fund.

  Recommendation                  ISSM should check the qualifications and information provided by pension
                                  consultants employed by the external managing entities as part of their on-going
                                  supervisory oversight.
                                  ISSM may wish to introduce training requirements for human resources staff
                                  responsible for pension issues.

  Good Practice B.6               Know Your Customer
                                  The sales officer should examine important characteristics of any potential
                                  customer, such as age, employment prospects and financial position, and
                                  be aware of the customer’s risk appetite and his or her long-term
                                  objectives for retirement, and recommend relevant financial products
                                  accordingly.

  Description                     The Pension Regulations do not specifically cover KYC rules. As all funds are currently
                                  managed on a group/ occupational basis and have not been sold to individuals, the
                                  KYC tests are not currently required in Mozambique.
                                  International research on how to apply such a test to pensions has been undertaken
                                  by IOPS. For example, consumers in many countries (Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
                                  Israel, Mexico and Thailand among others) are notified if providers lack sufficient
                                  information, and/or the sales may not go ahead in such instances (the latter is the
                                  case in Hong Kong, India or Pakistan). Many jurisdictions require that the consumer’s
                                  circumstances and the advice given be put in writing and retained (Australia and
                                  Hong Kong among others). These suitability checks may be supervised, in cases on
                                  the basis of complaints and compliance testing (for instance in Colombia, Israel and
                                  Slovakia). 113

  Recommendation                    ISSM should study international experience in KYC rules applying to pensions, and
                                    could introduce regulations and/ or provide guidance should a retail market develop
                                    in future. 114

  Good Practice B.7                 Disclosure of Financial Situation
                                          a. The regulator or supervisor should publish annual public reports on
                                             the development, health and strength of the pensions industry
                                             either as a special report or as part of its disclosure and
                                             accountability requirements under the law that governs these.
                                          b. All pension management companies should disclose information
                                             regarding their financial position and profit performance.
                                          c. Actuarial reports on funding levels should be required annually for
                                             defined benefit plans and members and affiliates should be advised
                                             of the condition of the plan in a short and clear written report.
                                          d. Investment reports for defined contribution plans should at least
                                             match best practice mutual fund reporting.
  Description                       Paragraph (a)
                                    ISSM does not have up to date statistics for the pension funds (available data is still
                                    as of the time of registration of the funds), and centralized statistics on the industry
                                    are not yet available on the authority’s website.
                                    If the retail selling of pension products becomes more common in future, ISSM could
                                    consider becoming a central source of comparative information between
                                    administrators (e.g. providing a table of returns earned by different providers’ funds
                                    and costs charged on a standardized basis) – as is increasing international practice
                                    in countries such as Australia, Bulgaria, Hong Kong, Chile, Israel, Jamaica, Mexico or
                                    Turkey. As IOPS Working Paper No. 15 states: 115
                                    “The fact that information comes directly from the supervisor may contribute to
                                    maintaining public confidence in the functioning of the pension system - a goal which
                                    has risen in prominence following the global financial and economic crisis of recent
                                    years.”
                                    Article 89 of the Pension Regulations requires the regulator to publish any supervisory
                                    decisions, which could be a useful tool in terms of direction and dissuasion in future.
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    Article 43 of the Pension Regulations requires pension management companies to
                                    publish annual reports during their first 3 corporate tax years. It is not clear that this
                                    is an on-going requirement after this date. However, in practice, the audited annual
                                    reports over several years are published on the more established pension fund
                                    management company’s website.116



114
   IOPS (2012) outlines that, in terms of what client information is required to be collected in order to establish suitability of product or advice, age is
standard in virtually all countries which have such suitability requirements. Risk appetite and income are requested in many case, investment
experience, family situation and tax position and net worth being less common.

                         Paragraph (c)
                         Article 65 of the Pension Regulations requires the managing entity to present the
                         supervisory entity with annual report and accounts certified by an external auditor
                         for the fund by 31st May in each year (relating to period up to 31st December of the
                         previous year). Article 56 of the Regulations requires that DB) funds appoint an
                         actuary who must report annually and tell the supervisor of violations or substantial
                         financial concerns regarding the fund. Articles 57, 60 and 62 require that all funds
                         appoint an external and internal auditor and produce an annual report on the
                         financial situation of the fund. Article 77 requires a full actuarial evaluation every 3
                         years (including a recommendation on the level of contributions needed to meet
                         benefits). Articles 80-83 deal with recovery plans and treatment of surpluses
                         resulting from these actuarial reviews.
                         Article 54 requires that the managing entity shall provide the supervisory committee
                         with a copy of the annual report and accounts of the pension fund and the actuary
                         and auditors reports. Article 62 requires that the managing entity inform members
                         of the financial situation of the fund on an annual basis, with Article 63 requiring that
                         the report and annual accounts be provided to already retired beneficiaries of the
                         fund on request.
                         The external pension management companies met by the mission team confirmed
                         that such information is provided regularly to their clients. Financial information (unit
                         prices and returns) on the open, umbrella fund managed by the more established
                         fund manager is available on their website.117
                         Paragraph (d)
                         Article 64 of the Pension Regulations requires that individuals must be told the
                         annual rate of return generated by the fund. The managing entity of the open,
                         umbrella fund provides detailed pricing and performance information for the fund
                         on their website.118 The information provided by in-house managed funds to their
                         members could not be verified.

  Recommendation         ISSM should improve its record collection and publish information on the pension
                         sector (including number and nature of funds, membership and asset data and
                         performance and fee information) at least annually, both on its website and in an
                         annual report format.
                         ISSM should check the provision of information to members of closed pension funds
                         as part of its supervisory oversight.

                                     PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


Good Practice B.8   Contracts
                    There should be consistent contracts or membership forms for pension
                    products and the contents of a contract should be read by the customer or
                    explained to the customer before it is signed.

Description         Article 22 of the Pension Regulations requires closed pension funds to be established
                    by a written, published agreement signed by the management entity and the
                    sponsoring firm. The fund is then managed pursuant to an agreement signed
                    between the two entities. A similar agreement is required between the managing
                    entity and each sponsoring employer which is a member of an open pension fund.
                    The external management entities met by the mission team confirmed that contracts,
                    including service level agreements, are signed with all clients. As these are
                    negotiated contacts between the sponsoring employer and the provider, the contract
                    terms will differ between clients (e.g. lower fees can be negotiated by larger clients,
                    some of the funds managed will be DB in nature, some DC etc.).
                    Regarding individual pension fund membership, the agreement is concluded between
                    the contributing member and the managing entity of the fund. Details of what should
                    be included in these contracts are laid out in the Pension Law (Article 25). Individuals
                    would be joining a pooled fund with standardized benefit etc. Article 27 (4) requires
                    that “individuals confirm, in writing, their agreement with the fund management
                    regulations.” As no retail products have been sold, actual practice in this regard has
                    not been tested.
Recommendation      Further regulation and /or guidance on the retail selling of pension products in accordance
                    with this Good Practice may be required from ISSM if a direct market for pension products
                    develops and issues subsequently arise.

Good Practice B.9   Cooling-off Period
                    There should be a reasonable cooling-off period associated with any individual
                    pension product.

Description         Article 30 of the Pension Regulations applies an individual contributor to cancel a pension fund
                    membership within 30 days of joining. As pensions are not currently sold as retail products,
                    this has not been tested in practice.

Recommendation      No recommendation.

                                             one week) after providing notification of a desire to switch
                                             investment profiles.
                                          b. Customers or occupational plan members should receive a regular
                                             streamlined statement of their account that provides the complete
                                             details of account activity (including investment performance on a
                                             standardized basis) in an easy-to-read format, making
                                             reconciliation easy.
                                          c. Customers should have a means to dispute the accuracy of any
                                             transaction recorded in the statement within a reasonable,
                                             stipulated period.
                                          d. When customers sign up for paperless statements, such statements
                                             should be in an easy-to-read and readily understandable format.
  Description                        Paragraph (a)
                                     Pension funds in Mozambique currently do not offer any investment choice for
                                     individual members.
                                     Paragraph (b)
                                     Articles 62 and 64 of the Pension Regulations require information to be sent to
                                     pension fund members annually covering their accumulated rights and the financial
                                     status of the fund. Article 64 also allows the supervisory entity to increase
                                     information requirements as deemed necessary for the better understanding of the
                                     fund. The external pension providers confirmed that such information is provided to
                                     fund members.
                                     The OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Rights of Members and Beneficiaries in
                                     Occupational Pension Plans out line International good practice around disclosure of
                                     information to members of DC pension funds as follows:119
                                     4.4 “Timely, individualized benefit statement should be provided to each plan
                                     member (and to beneficiaries where relevant). The information included on the
                                     benefit statement and the frequency of its delivery will depend on the type of pension
                                     plan. The information included should enable the plan member to identify current
                                     benefit accruals or account balances and the extent to which the accruals or account
                                     balances are vested. For pension plans with individual accounts, the information
                                     should include the date and value of contributions made to the account, investment
                                     performance and earnings and/or losses. For member-directed accounts, a record of
                                     all transactions (purchases and sales) occurring in the member’s account during the
                                     relevant reporting period should be provided. This information and other similarly
                                     personal data should be maintained and delivered in a manner that takes full account
                                     of its confidential nature.”

                                     The Pension Regulations do not have any specific requirements regarding dispute
                                     mechanisms. In practice, the HR departments of sponsoring employers have staff
                                     assigned to answer pension related queries. In addition the external management
                                     companies have nominated client relationship managers.
                                     See Section E for information and recommendations on dispute mechanisms.
                                     Paragraph (d)
                                     The pension fund management companies confirmed that information on members’
                                     accounts is currently only available on paper. However, they have plans to roll out
                                     on-line information services as the size of the market grows. This is in line with
                                     international good practice. For example, Australia, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain and
                                     the UK, among others, require simple and understandable information provision,
                                     emphasize simple language and recommend the use of graphs. Modular approaches
                                     are also used (Australia) with simple introductory materials available on the web
                                     page with links to documents for interested members.120

  Recommendation                     ISSM should check the annual information provided to pension fund members and
                                     provide guidance on content and format if required.

  SECTION D                          PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

  Good Practice D.1                  Confidentiality and Security of Customers’ Information
                                           a. The financial activities of any customer of a pension management
                                              company should be kept confidential and protected from
                                              unwarranted private and governmental scrutiny.
                                           b. The law should require pension management companies to ensure
                                              that they protect the confidentiality and security of personal
                                              information of their customers against any anticipated threats or
                                              hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and against
                                              unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information that could
                                              result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
  Description                        Paragraph (a)
                                     Data protection is included in the Constitution of the Republic of Mozambique. Article
                                     71(4) of the Constitution provides that access to data bases containing personal data
                                     and the transfer of such data is prohibited except where provided for by law or
                                     judicial decision.
                                     Article 54 of the Pension Regulations imposes a duty of confidentiality on members
                                     of the pension fund supervisory committees. The Insurance Regulation also
                                     demands that all intermediaries observe professional confidentiality, in relation to
                                     third parties, concerning any information disclosed to them in their function as

                                    insurance intermediaries. It should be noted that there is no data protection law in
                                    Mozambique which would back up these requirements.121
                                    The pension fund management companies met by the mission team confirmed that
                                    confidentiality clauses form part of the service level agreements which they sign with
                                    their clients. Personal information of members of in-house managed, occupational
                                    pension funds are also likely to be protected by general employment law and the
                                    terms of relevant contracts. However, as the pensions market is new in Mozambique,
                                    issues around confidentiality of data have not been tested in practice, but generally
                                    this is not a problem in most pension systems internationally, unlike the position in
                                    relation to other financial products.
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    The Pension Regulations do not specify requirements regarding the confidentiality
                                    and security of pension fund members’ personal information. In practice, the pension
                                    fund managing entities met by the mission team advised that the administrative
                                    systems which they use in Mozambique are based on platforms which they use in
                                    other countries. Back office functions are based in South Africa, and conform to
                                    international standards applied in this more developed pensions markets. No
                                    problems with data security have been reported so far in the new Mozambique
                                    market.

  Recommendation                    As data confidentiality and security is one area of consumer protection missing from
                                    the Pensions Act, ISSM could issue guidance on the topic in future as the market
                                    develops.
                                    When Mozambique enacts a Personal Data Protection Law (see recommendation in
                                    Good Practice D.1 Banking Sector, CPFL Diagnostic 2012 Comparison with Good
                                    Practices), the particularities of private pensions products and related fund
                                    management issues should be taken into consideration with due consultations with
                                    the industry, ISSM and consumer protection agencies.




121
    The 2012 CPFL review notes that According to the CIFC Law, all credit institutions and finance companies must ensure that they protect the
confidentiality and security of the personal data of their customers. However, there is no data protection law that would clearly define liability for misuse
of personal data.

Good Practice D.2   Sharing Customer’s Information
                        a.    Pension management companies should inform the consumer of
                              third-party dealings for which the pension management company
                              intends to share information regarding the consumer’s account.
                        b.    Pension management companies should explain to customers
                              how they use and share customers’ personal information.
                        c.    Pension management companies should be prohibited from

                              any outside company not affiliated with the pension
                              management company for the purpose of telemarketing or direct
                              mail marketing.

                              sharing by the pension management company of certain
                              information regarding the customer, and the pension
                              management company should inform its customers of their opt-

                        e.    The law should prohibit the disclosure of information of

Description         Paragraph (a)
                    Though the Pensions Regulations are silent on this topic, the pension fund

                                        d. The regulator or supervisor should investigate whether pension
                                           management companies comply with their internal procedures
                                           regarding dispute resolution.
 Description                      Paragraph (a)
                                  Although the Pension Regulations do not explicitly require pension management
                                  entities to establish an internal dispute resolution process,122 managers met by the
                                  mission team advised that in practice they have such processes. As pension schemes
                                  in Mozambique currently operate on an occupational rather than a retail basis, the
                                  external providers handle disputes with client firms sponsoring the pension schemes
                                  which the entities manage, rather than retail clients. Individual members of pension
                                  plans are likely to first raise any issues with the HR representatives responsible for
                                  their staff pension plan, followed by the member representatives on the Supervisory
                                  Committees and could also raise issues directly with the supervisory authority (as
                                  outlined in the Insurance Act 1/2010 which established ISSM). None of these
                                  mechanisms have been tested in practice given the recent development of the
                                  pension industry.




122
    This contrasts with the ICL which requires that insurers inform prospective clients of avenues to make complaints. Policy conditions furthermore
have to mention the terms for appeals, arbitration, and the selection of tribunal for judicial settlement of disputes.

                                   PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                    Paragraph (b)
                    Although not explicitly required by regulation, the external pension fund
                    management entities have established internal complaints handling processes, with
                    designated client managers responsible for the firms sponsoring the pension plan
                    acting as the designated employee in case of queries and disputes. For in-house
                    managed funds, a HR representative is normally in charge of pension issues and
                    there are member nominated representatives on the Supervisory Committees. The
                    Pension Regulations do not make it clear that these representatives need to be made
                    known to the members of the fund.
                    Paragraph (c)
                    The pension fund management companies met by the mission team confirmed that
                    they have internal dispute mechanisms and inform customers (i.e. the firm
                    sponsoring the plans) of these via service level agreements. No retail market exists
                    so they do not have mechanisms for dealing with complaints of individual plan
                    members.
                    Paragraph (d)
                    Given that ISSM is yet to fully instigate their inspection processes, these procedures
                    have not been established.

Recommendation      Pension scheme members should be given information regarding complaints /
                    dispute mechanisms on joining the scheme, and should be informed as to who are
                    their main HR contact and their representatives on the supervisory committees. This
                    information should also be clearly disclosed in any on-line interaction points with
                    members and in their regular statements and should be kept up to date. These
                    obligations should be made clear by ISSM via appropriate guidelines or circulars.
                    When next amended, the Pension Law should also include these requirements.
                    Internal dispute mechanisms should be checked as part of supervisory oversight and
                    guidance issued by ISSM if any issues are found.

Good Practice E.2   Formal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms
                    A system should be in place that allows consumers to seek third-party
                    recourse in the event they cannot resolve a pensions-related issue with
                    their employer or a pension management company.

Description         There is no formal external dispute resolution scheme (such as a financial services
                    ombudsman) in Mozambique for consumers. The CP Law provides for the
                    establishment of consumer arbitration centers (which are intended to be free to
                    consumers) but no action has to date been taken to establish such centers.
                    There are no specific requirements regarding either internal or external dispute
                    resolution within the Pension Regulations. The external pension providers confirmed
                    that, should a dispute not be settled internally, a case would be transferred to CAMC,
                    which organizes arbitrations, and ultimately to the courts. No cases have arisen in
                    practice. No individual consumer arbitration process is currently required for pensions
                    and these are not sold as retail products.

                                               PRIVATE PENSIONS SECTOR


                                The Pensions Regulations do allow for an appeal against a supervisory decision to
                                be challenged in the courts (Article 97). In practice, no disputes have arisen due to
                                the recent development of the industry.

  Recommendation                In the shorter term, it is recommended that there be established within ISSM
                                dedicated resources for considering consumer complaints and that ISSM analyze and
                                publish complaints statistics (see Insurance Good Practice E.1 for details). Relevant
                                staff should be appropriately trained and of a number which is built up over time as
                                the market for insurance and private pensions develops.
                                ISSM could provide further guidance on dispute resolution mechanisms, obliging
                                financial institutions to proactively inform consumers of the right to complain and
                                how to proceed in the case of a dispute, particularly if retail market develops.
                                ISSM should also require the entities they supervise to report complaints statistics to
                                ISSM, who should in turn analyze the statistics for systemic issues (as well as
                                checking compliance with regulatory requirements).
                                In the longer term, it is suggested that Mozambique considers options for the
                                development of an independent third party external dispute resolution scheme,
                                which would apply to all parts of the financial sector.
                                Consideration could, for example, be given to the establishment of a financial
                                ombudsman service. The recommendations 2012 Volume II CPFL Report (see Good
                                Practice E.2 Banking Section) discuss the legal foundations, possible ways to
                                establish and fund such a service, governance and corresponding international
                                standards.
                                Another option which might be considered is the establishment of the Consumer
                                Arbitration Centers provided for in the CP Law.
                                Examples from other jurisdictions should be shared and discussed with stakeholders
                                in Mozambique. In some countries such as Estonia, it was the insurance association
                                who set up a mediator service for dispute resolution. South Africa, where separate
                                ombuds-services have been set up for short term123 and long term insurance124, and
                                for pensions125, provide good examples from a neighboring country. Once a preferred
                                model finds consensus, a road map to implementation can be determined and
                                executed.

  SECTION F                         GUARANTEE SCHEMES AND SAFETY PROVISIONS

  Good Practice F.1                 Guarantee Schemes and Safety Provisions
                                    Guarantee and compensation schemes are less common in the pensions
                                    sector than in banking and insurance. There are more likely to be fiduciary
                                    duties and custodian arrangements to ensure the safety of assets.
                                         a. There needs to be a basic requirement in the law to the effect that
                                            pension management companies should seek to safeguard pension
                                            fund assets.
                                         b. There should also be adequate depository or custodian
                                            arrangements in place to ensure that assets are safeguarded.
  Description                       Paragraph (a)
                                    Articles 58/59 of the Pension Regulations outline requirements for internal risk
                                    management. Article 67 requires that “pension funds must be managed in
                                    observance of prudential methods and criteria which assure the existence of the cash
                                    flow necessary for the punctual payment of benefits”. Articles 70, 71 and 75 require
                                    managing entities take into account the liquidity, diversification, and liabilities of the
                                    fund when devising the asset portfolio. Article 74 requires an investment policy (in
                                    writing) reviewed every 3 years. Articles 76-84 outline prudential regulations
                                    regarding the solvency of DB pension plans.126
                                    Given there are so few DB funds in Mozambique a guarantee fund would not be
                                    feasible or recommended.127
                                    Paragraph (b)
                                    The Pensions Regulations (Article 46) require that all pension funds must use a
                                    depository. Articles 47 and 48 lays out the requirements for these. This is in line
                                    with the OECD Guidelines on Pension Fund Governance.128
                                    8. Custodian
                                    “Custody of the pension fund assets may be carried out by the pension entity, the
                                    financial institution that manages the pension fund, or by an independent custodian.
                                    If an independent custodian is appointed by the governing body to hold the pension
                                    fund assets and to ensure their safekeeping, the pension fund assets should be
                                    legally separated from those of the custodian. The custodian should not be able to
                                    absolve itself of its responsibility by entrusting to a third party all or some of the
                                    assets in its safekeeping”


126
   Adequate prudential regulations are an important part of consumer protection. The details of the regulation and the practical applications have not
been considered in this review – noting that only a few DB funds exist. These have been under funded in the past but those now managed by external
managers are being brought into line with regulations. Some of the outstanding, unlicensed funds may not yet meet these standards, and the
regulator will have to discuss funding plans with them as they come under the regulatory umbrella. Numbers are limited and it is not thought to be a
major issue, as faced in other countries in the region on the establishment of a regulatory framework.

                    The external fund management entities confirmed the use of a custodian. It could
                    not be confirmed if this is the case for all in-house funds.

Recommendation      ISSM should include checks on pension funds risk management systems in their
                    supervisory oversight. In future, guidance could be issued guidance if these are
                    found to be less than adequate.

Good Practice G.1   Using a Range of Initiatives and Channels, including the Mass Media
                        a. A range of initiatives should be undertaken to improve people's
                           financial capability.
                        b. The mass media should be encouraged by the relevant authority to
                           provide financial education, information and guidance to the
                           public, including on the private pensions sector.
                        c. The government should provide appropriate incentives and
                           encourage collaboration between governmental agencies, the
                           supervisory authority for private pensions, the private pension
                           industry and consumer associations in the provision of financial
                           education, information and guidance to consumers, particularly on
                           the private pensions sector.
Description         Paragraph (a)
                    There are a number of strategic initiatives currently addressing financial education in
                    Mozambique. The government’s Financial Sector Development Strategy 2013–2022
                    includes activities to promote financial literacy, such as financial education campaigns
                    to be disseminated through media and financial education material to be used in
                    schools. It documents the government’s commitment to financial inclusion as
                    signaled by the signing of the Maya Declaration in 2012. It is understood that
                    financial literacy will also be covered by Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy
                    which is in the process of development with the support of the World Banks’ FISF
                    Program. The FISF program includes the promotion of financial literacy among its
                    objectives.
                    ISSM also has a new Financial Literacy Strategy 2014-2018 which, in addition to
                    providing for print material and seminars, also includes capacity building for
                    journalists and collaboration with schools in the development of insurance teaching
                    material. It recognizes the need to coordinate with a considerable number of
                    stakeholders as well as the need for corresponding resources. It also acknowledges
                    the potential to include suitable insurance related teachings in school curricula, so
                    that young adults become familiar not only with insurance as a financial service that
                    can be of value to them, but also as a potential employer. This will be important as
                    (micro) insurance grows into new socioeconomic segments of population that will
                    need to be serviced by more insurance staff, ideally with a similar background.
                    At present, it is not entirely clear how the various initiatives are coordinated, nor who
                    is responsible to lead and coordinate their implementation.
                    Given the recent development of the pension market in Mozambique, both the
                    regulator and industry providers confirmed that knowledge and awareness of pension

                                     and retirement issues is low.129 The population is still young, and most of the people
                                     still rely on family and community support in old age.130 Formal sector workers in the
                                     private sector have been covered by the previously generous, INSS mandatory
                                     pension scheme – with the need for voluntary additional pension savings only just
                                     beginning to be realized following parametric reforms to the mandatory scheme in
                                     2007. For example, the Ministry of Labour as part of their general education
                                     programs for workers explains the need for individuals to take responsibility for
                                     themselves after they stop work as well as relying on the state.
                                     Paragraph (b)
                                     Given the recent development of the pension industry, the media has yet to focus on
                                     the issue of pensions.
                                     Paragraph (c)
                                     ISSM recently launched an Insurance Literacy Education Strategy 2014-2018, but
                                     has yet to initiate any education on pensions. Consumer groups and industry
                                     providers do not currently undertaken financial education programs in this sector.
                                     This is understandable given their limited resources and the recent development of
                                     the sector, which currently only covers only a limited number of higher end
                                     consumers.

  Recommendation                     There should be consultation and coordination between relevant stakeholders in
                                     developing and implementing Mozambique’s Financial Inclusion Strategy, including
                                     aspects related to financial literacy, and also in relation to the implementation of the
                                     ISSM Financial Literacy Strategy.
                                     A campaign on financial education and awareness in relation to pensions should be
                                     developed, led by ISSM. As noted in the 2012 CPFL review, coordination between
                                     stakeholders should be improved through the Steering Committee for the Financial
                                     Sector Development Strategy, potentially through a Financial Education Task Force.

    The Household Capability Survey conducted by the World Bank team in 2012 confirmed that sophisticated products such as private pensions are
hardly used at all in Mozambique.

  Good Practice G.2         Unbiased Information for Consumers
                                a. Financial regulators and consumer associations should provide, via
                                   the internet and printed publications, independent information on
                                   the key features, benefits and risks –and where practicable the
                                   costs- of the main types of financial products and services,
                                   including private pensions.
                                b. The relevant authority should adopt policies that encourage non-
                                   government organizations to provide consumer awareness
                                   programs to the public in the area of pensions.
  Description               Paragraph (a)
                            Being a new institution, ISSM has only just started to provide customers with
                            information via their website that is available since December 2014131. The website
                            provides basic educational material on insurance in general and on mandatory motor
                            third party liability insurance (Q&As and glossaries). It also lists all licensed insurers,
                            pension funds, brokers and corporate agents, provides some key figures on the
                            market and on every insurer, and information about ISSM. The information on
                            pensions is more limited than for insurance.
                            Paragraph (b)
                            Given the recent development of the sector, NGOs are not yet active on pension
                            topics.

  Recommendation            For industry information see B7.

  Good Practice G.3         Consulting Consumers and the Financial Services Industry
                               The relevant authority should consult consumer associations and the
                               private pension industry to help the authority develop financial
                               capability programs that meet the needs and expectations of financial
                               consumers, especially pension fund members and affiliates.
  Description               The mission team were advised that pension providers undertake training and
                            awareness for their clients on pension issues. For example, training for HR
                            departments, which are the main points of contact for the pension managing entities
                            with the client plan sponsors, is undertaken (the provider of the current umbrella
                            fund organizes roadshows around regions to explain to clients about the fund and
                            how it is managed). In an example of an international good practice introduced from
                            South Africa, one provider requires all pension fund members who are shortly to
                            retire to undertake a two week training on personal finance (unless the Supervisory
                            Committee of the fund deem this not to be necessary), particularly if the individuals
                            are about to receive a lump sum payment. The management entities confirmed that
                            they are planning to roll out on-line access for account information. Once established
                            this could also be used as a platform for greater education and awareness efforts.
                            There are no financial planning institutions/ financial advisors in Mozambique. All
                            estate planning (for example) is done via attorneys and personal advice is not

                 provided before or after retirement. This capacity will need to be developed in the
                 country.
                 As well as general campaigns, particular groups also need training on pension issues.
                 In an occupational pension system such as Mozambique, it is important that HR
                 officers at sponsoring companies understand pensions as they are the first point of
                 call for members with questions and problems. In addition, the pension fund
                 ‘trustees’, or members of the supervisory committees in the Mozambique case, need
                 training to be able to fulfil their role as protectors of the fund members’ interests.
                 Training is particularly required for the representatives on these boards elected by
                 the fund members themselves as they often do not have knowledge in finance issues
                 generally and rarely in pensions in particular. The external pension managing entities
                 in Mozambique do provide such training for the human resources representatives of
                 their client firms, however, no training is currently provided to members of the
                 supervisory committees.

Recommendation   ISSM should collaborate with the key players in the pension industry to develop
                 knowledge and awareness on the topic.
                 The consumer association could be invited to attend any training and awareness
                 events on pensions organized by the regulator, and future collaboration with the
                 association could be build (bearing in mind their limited resources and other
                 priorities).
