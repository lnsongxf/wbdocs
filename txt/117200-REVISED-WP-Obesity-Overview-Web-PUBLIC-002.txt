An Overview of Links between Obesity and Food Systems; Implications for the Food and Agriculture Global Practice Agenda   vii
Executive summary

Obesity has emerged as a global challenge, affecting developed and developing coun-
tries alike. Globally, overweight and obesity cost an estimated US$2 trillion per year,
and 68 percent of all deaths are caused by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), of
which three of the four most common are diet related (namely cardiovascular dis-
eases, cancers, and diabetes). Moreover, two-thirds of deaths from NCDs take place in
developing countries, where also two-thirds of overweight or obese people live, casting
obesity no longer as only a developed country challenge.

While the World Bank Group (WBG) has embraced the global nutrition challenge
since the launch of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement in 2010, the Food and Agri-
culture Global Practice’s (Agriculture GP) efforts to date have focused largely on one
dimension of the malnutrition spectrum, undernutrition and micronutrient deficien-
cies, leaving a role for the GP in addressing the challenges associated with the other
dimension of the spectrum, overweight and obesity.

This Knowledge Product (KP) is an initial attempt to better understand how agricul-
ture and food systems can contribute to and mitigate against the rising incidence of
overweight and obesity in WBG client countries, and to do so by presenting evidence-
based interventions (policies and actions) in the agriculture and food systems domain.
This report is based on literature review, and not primary research. It is intended pri-
marily to inform World Bank staff in related operational and analytical work.

Obesity is a multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary challenge that requires a collaborative
effort; any successful intervention strategy and actions would need to be multifaceted.
This report has been undertaken at the request of the World Bank’s Health, Nutrition
and Population GP and to complement their ongoing analytical work on preventing
and controlling overweight and obesity: approaches and policy options that examines
overweight and obesity through the lens of many other sectors, including and beyond
agriculture and food systems.

As the world faces an evolving malnutrition crisis, with countries moving from the
challenges of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency to a crisis that also includes

INtroduction and relevance
of this work
In order to permanently end poverty and hunger by 2030, the world needs a food
system that can feed every person, every day, everywhere; that can raise real incomes
of the poorest people; that can provide safe food and adequate nutrition; and that can
better steward the world’s natural resources. In this context, the World Bank Group’s
Food and Agriculture Global Practice (Agriculture GP) work is aligned around four
strategic pillars: (i) ensuring a more climate-smart agriculture, (ii) improving nutri-
tional outcomes, (iii) strengthening value chains and improving market access, and
(iv)  promoting rural livelihoods and agriculture employment—as illustrated in the
GP’s 2015 Ending Poverty and Hunger by 2030: An Agenda for the Global Food System publica-
tion (Townsend, 2015). The GP’s 2016 The Future of Food: Shaping the Global Food System
to Deliver Improved Nutrition and Health (World Bank Group, 2016) publication focuses on
how food systems can contribute to improved nutrition and health and lays out a spec-
trum of food system interventions to address different forms of malnutrition, which
include reducing energy deficiency (hunger), reducing micronutrient deficiency (hid-
den hunger), reducing excessive net energy intake (overweight/obesity), and improv-
ing food safety.

The World Bank Group has embraced the nutrition challenge as a multi-sectoral
agenda. Since the launch of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement at the Bank’s
Spring Meetings in 2010, the Bank has worked across internal silos to address nutri-
tion, and to set in practice the understanding that addressing underlying causes of
malnutrition requires broader, nutrition-sensitive approaches implemented through
multiple sectors in addition to health, including agriculture.

Efforts in the Agriculture GP have largely focused on undernourishment (hunger) and
one dimension of the malnutrition spectrum (undernutrition) and micronutrient defi-
ciencies, leaving a role for the GP in addressing the challenges associated with the
other dimension of the spectrum, overweight and obesity. Undernutrition and micro-
nutrient deficiencies have been at the core of policies and operations because, despite
significant progress, 795 million people are still not meeting their minimum dietary

 Box 1. What is a healthy diet?
 There is no universal definition of what constitutes a healthy, or high quality diet, as the exact composition of it depends on indi-
 vidual characteristics and needs (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle, etc.), but also on culture and availability of food. Nevertheless, the World
 Health Organization (WHO) advises that for adults a healthy diet comprises:

    »» fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g,. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g., unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice).
    »» at least five portions of fruits and vegetables a day (note: potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots are not
       considered fruits or vegetables) to reduce the risk of NCDs and help ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fiber.
    »» less than 30 percent of total energy intake from fats helps prevent unhealthy weight gain. Also the risk of developing NCDs
       is lowered by reducing saturated fats to less than ten percent of total energy intake, and trans fats to less than one percent,
       and replacing both with unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats (e.g., fats found in fish, avocados, nuts, and sunflower, canola and
       olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (e.g., found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard).
       Industrial trans fats (found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and
       spreads) are not part of a healthy diet.
    »» less than ten percent of total energy intake from free sugars, which is about 12 level teaspoons for a person of healthy body
       weight consuming around 2,000 calories per day. WHO guidelines suggest ideally less than five percent of total energy intake
       for additional health benefits. Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and
       sugars found naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Excess consumption of free sugars
       contributes to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity.
    »» less than one teaspoon of salt per day, and use iodized salt. The majority of people consume too much sodium through salt,
       and not enough potassium that can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption. This combination contrib-
       utes to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.

 In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the cancer agency of the WHO, advised people to moderate
 consumption of red meat and processed meat to reduce the risk of cancer. Red meat refers to all mammalian muscle meat, includ-
 ing, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat. Processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed through salting, cur-
 ing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain pork or
 beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, poultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood. The risk of cancer
 increases with the amount of meat consumed, but the data available for IARC’s evaluation did not allow for a conclusion about
 whether a safe consumption level exists.

An Overview of Links between Obesity and Food Systems; Implications for the Food and Agriculture Global Practice Agenda                                 3
Objectives
This Knowledge Product (KP) is anchored within the framework outlined in the
Agenda for the Global Food System (Townsend, 2015), and the 2016 Future of Food
publication (World Bank Group, 2016). Given that energy/food supply and availabil-
ity are a recognized contributing factor to overweight and obesity, this report is an
initial attempt to better understand how agriculture and food systems can contribute
to and mitigate against the rising incidence of overweight and obesity, and to do so
by presenting evidence-based interventions (policies and actions) in the agriculture
and food systems domain. This work is based on literature review, and not primary
research. Obesity is a multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary challenge that requires a
collaborative effort; any successful intervention strategy and actions would need to be
multifaceted. This report is undertaken at the request of the Health, Nutrition and
Population Global Practice (HNP GP) of the World Bank Group and in order to com-
plement their currently ongoing Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) on preventing
and controlling overweight and obesity: approaches and policy options that examines overweight
and obesity through the lens of many other sectors, including and beyond agriculture
and food systems.

Nutrition transition: the changing
dimension of the “malnutrition
challenge”
According to the WHO, nutrition is defined as the intake of food considered in rela-
tion to the body’s dietary needs. Good nutrition—an adequate, well-balanced diet
combined with regular physical activity—is a cornerstone of good health. Poor nutri-
tion can lead to reduced immune response, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired
physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.2 Poor nutrition comes in
multiple forms: undernourishment (hunger), undernutrition (poor nutritional status
due to nutritional deficiencies), micronutrient deficiencies (when a person does not get
enough important vitamins and minerals in their diet), and overweight and obesity
(when a person eats too many calories and/or lacks sufficient exercise).

Past data have shown that as poverty levels fall, undernutrition and micronutrient defi-
ciency rates also fall. That is, as poverty levels fall, less people suffer from widespread and
chronic undernutrition or hunger challenges. As incomes rise, people choose to eat better
quality staple grains,3 as well as more diversified diets, including more animal source foods
(ASF), fruits and vegetables. Studies show that undernutrition (defined as low weight-
for-age) declines at about 50 percent of the rate that Gross National Product (GNP) per
capita increases. Cross-country results resemble those coming from household surveys of
individuals (Alderman, 2012). This is illustrated in the global decline of people suffering
from undernourishment and children who are stunted. In 1990 more than a billion peo-
ple worldwide suffered from undernourishment, whereas currently the numbers are less
than 800 million. In terms of child stunting, 250 million children under the age of five
were stunted in 1990 compared to about 156 million in 2015. About 40 percent of them
live in South Asia (Aguayo and Menon, 2016), while more than one-third live in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Progress on reducing stunting is particularly slow in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Both Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have cut stunting rates by over one-third

    Consumers choose more expensive staple grains, e.g., rice with less grit, and the average cost of a calorie increases.

Overweight/obesity: a complex
challenge of high cost to society
Being overweight harms health in many ways. High BMI is a known risk factor for
diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and some cancers, to name just
a few, and reduces the life span by about three (3) years for overweight people and up to
eight (8) years for the obese (Grover et al., 2014). Treating obesity and obesity related
conditions costs billions of dollars a year. There is wide variance in estimates of the
economic cost of obesity since different studies include different costs. Direct costs
typically include all or some of costs related to health service delivery to treat obesity
related health problems such as the cost of hospitalization, medical consultations in
outpatient clinics and the consumption of medications. Indirect costs typically include
all or some of the costs associated with lost productivity when individuals must tem-
porarily (absenteeism) or permanently leave work for health reasons (disability or pre-
mature mortality). Reduction in the productivity of workers in the workplace whose
performance is impaired by their illness is also sometimes included. Some studies also
include changes in insurance premiums since employers pay higher life insurance pre-
miums and pay out more for workers’ compensation for employees who are obese than
for employees who are not.

McKinsey Global Institute estimates the global economic impact of obesity as roughly
US$2 trillion per year or equivalent to 2.8 percent of global GDP. This includes the
cost of lost economic productivity through the loss of productive years, direct costs
to health care systems, and the investment required to mitigate the impact of obesity.
The McKinsey Global Institute’s estimates put obesity as the third most costly human
caused social burden behind only smoking (US$2.1 trillion per year) and ‘armed vio-
lence, war and terrorism’ (US$2.1 trillion per year) (McKinsey Global Institute, 2014).
In the U.S., the medical care costs to treat obesity were estimated to be US$147 billion
dollars in 2008, and the annual nationwide productive costs of obesity related absen-
teeism ranged between US$3.38 billion to US$6.38 billion.11 Combined, this roughly
equates to about 1 percent of GDP in the U.S. In the U.K., another high-income

Role of agriculture and the food
system in promoting safe, diversified
and healthy diets with a focus
on overweight/obesity

As the world faces an evolving malnutrition crisis, with countries moving from the
challenges of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency to a crisis that encompasses
also overweight and obesity, one thing remains constant: agriculture and the food
system have an important role to play in ensuring access to a high quality diet that
includes a diversity of foods that are safe, and provides levels of energy appropriate to
age, sex, disease state and physical activity as well as micronutrients (Glopan, 2016).
Obviously, given the complexity of malnutrition as evidenced in the UNICEF frame-
work for child malnutrition as well as the UK Foresight Report Obesity System Map
and the Swinburn framework of obesity, agriculture and food systems are only part of
the solution, since the set of associated factors that cause the problem is far reaching
and amounts to a tightly knit obesogenic environment that sustains people to eat more
and exercise less.

There is no available quantification of the share or importance of agriculture and the
food system within the set of factors that contributes to rising obesity, and that share,
even if quantifiable would likely differ from country to country. Most studies take the
approach that while research generates more evidence, “as many interventions as pos-
sible must be delivered to have significant impact” because almost all interventions
that are commonly discussed in obesity prevention/mitigation are highly cost effective
from a societal viewpoint (McKinsey Global Institute, 2014), and that “a strategy to
tackle obesity needs a comprehensive portfolio of interventions targeting a broad set
of variables and different levels within the obesity system. Although, alone, each com-
ponent part of the strategy may not create significant impact, their complementary
and reinforcing action is critical to achieving the significant shift required in popula-
tion obesity trends.” (Butland et al., 2007).

     Box 2. NOURISHING framework policy actions
     Each letter in the word NOURISHING represents one of ten actions that governments can take:

     N = Nutrition label standards and regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food
     O = Offer healthy food and set standards in public institutions and other specific settings
     U = Use economic tools to address food affordability and purchase incentives
     R = Restrict food advertising and other forms of commercial promotion
     I = Improve nutritional quality of the whole food supply
     S = Set incentives and rules to create a healthy retail and food service environment
     H = Harness food supply chain and actions across sectors to ensure coherence with health
     I = Inform people about food and nutrition through public awareness
     N = Nutrition advice and counseling in health care settings
     G = Give nutrition education and skills

     Letters in the word NOURISHING, and associated actions, fall within one of the three domains, as follows: NOURIS actions fall
     under the domain of the food environment; H represents the food system; and ING falls under behavior change communication.

 The Access to Nutrition Index rates food and beverage manufacturers´ nutrition related policies, practices and disclosures world-
 wide on a recurring basis, and publishes results every year. The first Global Index was launched in 2013, and the second Global
 Index in January 2016.

 The top three companies in the 2016 Index are Unilever, Nestlé and Danone, which also led the Index in 2013. The report states:
 “Although all companies still have a long way to go, Unilever, Nestlé and Danone have clearly embedded a commitment to addressing
 global nutrition challenges into their core business models; commitments are translated into practice and reported on publicly. This
 is commendable. It should be regarded as an example of best practice and as a guide to improvement for other companies. Unilever
 leads with regards to providing healthier products to consumers worldwide. The company has a strong Nutrient Profiling System (NPS)
 against which the global product portfolio is checked for levels of key nutrients. Nestlé stands out with a clear corporate nutrition strat-
 egy that is approved at the highest levels of the company and includes a comprehensive set of objectives that cover the reformulation
 of products to make them healthier, access to healthy foods and responsible marketing. Danone remains relatively strong in including
 nutrition in its business strategies as well as its processes. It leads for including affordability considerations in its product Research &
 Development (R&D) programs, and for stakeholder engagement. However, Danone dropped in the overall rankings mostly because
 the company’s nutrition targets for the next few years had not yet been published at the time of the research for this report.”

Conclusions
The Agriculture GP has made great strides in internalizing and acting on the nutrition
sensitive agriculture agenda designed to address the undernutrition and micronutrient
deficiency challenges. Embracing the challenge of overweight and obesity is a natural
next step given that the role and responsibility of agriculture and food systems is to
deliver safe, diversified, and healthy diets for all.

Preventing obesity and improving other forms of malnutrition can best be achieved by
one common approach—the promotion of a high quality diversified diet. Actions and
policies that support the provision of and access to a safe, diversified and healthy diet
should be supported continuously across the entire food system as countries transition
from focusing on undernutrition to overlapping malnutrition problems increasingly
including overweight and obesity.

As demonstrated, actions adopted in the food storage, transport and trade subsystem
to improve diet quality are also interventions that are undertaken for more conven-
tional objectives of raising profitability of the value chain. In other subsystems new or
customized actions are needed, as for instance in the agricultural research and produc-
tion subsystem where actions to maximize profitability are not aligned with improving
diet quality, and in the food retail and provisioning subsystem, where traditionally the
Agriculture GP has been less active.

The remainder of this section will list entry points for actions, discuss what is needed
to translate them into policy dialogue between the Agriculture GP teams and country
clients to enable future action, and list areas for possible future research. Some of the
listed interventions can be discussed with and undertaken by the ministry of agriculture
in client countries, while others require multi- and cross-sectoral cooperation among
ministries and agencies responsible for health, gender, trade, transport, and more. The
need for collaboration across boundaries is further reinforced by the impact on overall
diet quality, obesity, and chronic noncommunicable diseases of the level of consump-
tion of ultra-processed products. Partnerships between the Agriculture GP and the
WBG’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector, and civil society
are just a few that need to be pursued in order to influence that part of the food system.
