1	 At the aggregate level, theories of economic growth put innovation at the center of the growth process since the seminal work of Solow (1957), where economic growth is
   driven by technical change. This interest in innovation was reinforced by the emergence of “new growth theory” emphasizing the role of knowledge accumulation for the
   growth process and ‘Schumpeterian” creative destruction arising from a competitive R&D sector as the main engine of growth (Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Romer, 1986).
   At the micro or firm level, where innovation occurs, Klette and Kortum (2004) show how innovation activities create rich firm-level dynamics. In their model innovation
   increases product quality and make firms more competitive, which increases their revenue and size and forces existing firms producing old and obsolete versions of the
   product to exit the market.
2	 Lentz and Mortensen (2008), using Danish firm-level data, find that up to 75% of productivity growth comes from reallocation of inputs to innovating firms, of which
   25% is entry and exist of firms and 50% reallocation to growing innovative firms.
3	 This dataset provides a larger source of information and sample than the previous 2007 enterprise survey, which had a sample of 396 firms but no comprehensive innovation
   questionnaire, and the 2012 innovation survey, implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST),which had a sample of 160 firms.

6	 The impact of innovation on the level of employment at the firm level depends on the type of innovation implemented. For example, some products innovations are likely
   to increase the demand for labor by expanding production lines, while on the other hand, some process innovations can reduce the demand for labor when improving the
   efficiency in which existing products are produced. What effect is larger is an empirical question, but most empirical studies suggest that the employment creation effect is
   larger. See section 5 for an empirical analysis for Kenya.

    Innovation Activities
    Innovation or knowledge inputs are activities that are associated with the development of innovation at the firm level.
    They are grouped into four main categories:

       i.	Research and development – firms are surveyed about the source of R&D (internal vs external) as well as
          expenditure on this component;
      ii.	 Capacity building - firms report on the expenditure carried out in training for producing innovations;
      iii.	Purchase/licensing of inventions or other knowledge forms - firms report on the purchase of inventions or
           intellectual property that help introducing innovations; and
      iv.	Intellectual property - firms report on whether they applied for patents, utility models, trademarks, copyright
          design or registered an industrial design.

A challenge of measuring innovation outcomes is                                           using data from different sources (see framework

7	 The impact of innovation on the level of employment at the firm level depends on the type of innovation implemented. For example, some products innovations are likely
   to increase the demand for labor by expanding production lines, while on the other hand, some process innovations can reduce the demand for labor when improving the
   efficiency in which existing products are produced. What effect is larger is an empirical question, but most empirical studies suggest that the employment creation effect is
   larger. See section 5 for an empirical analysis for Kenya.

  Innovation Outcomes in the Enterprise Survey
 Similar to the innovation surveys based on the Oslo Manual, the ES innovation survey measures the following types
 of outcomes:
       i.   Product innovations
      ii.   Process innovations
     iii.   Organizational innovations
      iv.   Marketing innovations

 For each of these outcomes, the survey includes information about the:
      •     Extent (number) of innovations introduced
      •     Impact on the specific operational aspects of the firm
      •     Level of automation involved in their adoption
      •     Level of novelty of the innovation(s)–local market, national market and international market
      •     Channels used to acquire business intelligence
      •     Acquisition of talent as part of the innovative process
      •     Level of collaboration in the development of the innovation(s) and the impact of the number of staff(skilled and
            unskilled) that the firm had.

 Product innovations are essentially new, redesigned, or substantially improved goods or services. In the context of the
 survey, there are 3 metrics used:
      a. New products to the firm
      b. Significantly improved products
      c. New products to the market.

 Process innovation is the implementation of new or significantly improved production or delivery methods. Specifically:
      a. Innovation methods for manufacturing products or offering services
      b. Innovative logistics, delivery, or distribution methods for inputs, products, or services
      c. Innovative supporting activity for processes, such as maintenance systems or operations for purchasing, accounting,
         or computing.

 The following are not considered to be process innovations: Minor changes or improvements; an increase in production
 or service capabilities through the addition of manufacturing or logistical systems which are very similar to those
 already in use; ceasing to use a process; simple capital replacement or extension; changes resulting purely from changes
 in factor prices; customization; regular seasonal and other cyclical changes; and trading of new or significantly improved
 products.

 Organizational innovation means the implementation of a new organizational method in business practices, workplace
 organization, or external relations. This type of innovation is grouped into: structural innovations which are meant to
 impact responsibilities, accountability, command lines, and information ﬂows, as well as the number of hierarchical
 levels; the divisional structure of functions (research and development, production, human resources, ﬁnancing, etc.) or
 the separation between line and support functions; and procedural innovations, which consist of changes to routines,
 processes, and operations of a company. Thus, these innovations change or implement new procedures and processes
 within the company, such as simultaneous engineering or zero buffer rules.

 Marketing innovations are changes made to incorporate the advances in marketing science, technology or engineering
 to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing, in order to gain competitive advantage.

    An example of firm level innovation in Kenya - Fairbrooks Water Purification
    Fairbrooks Water Purification, a venture supported by the Kenya Climate Innovation Center (KCIC), has developed an
    innovative PVC-based tube system that filters water in an effective and cost-efficient way. First, ground water is pumped
    into a high tower; in a second phase, gravity pushes the water through a tube system that filters out bacteria, sediments,
    and other particles. This innovative system can produce up to 10,000 liters of clean and safe water per hour.


    This innovative company started three years ago and is already an inspiration for many new local entrepreneurs. The
    system is patented and has been sold to large hotels, restaurants, and many organizations across the country. The system
    costs around US$12,000 and mainly targets institutions and the service sector. However, the company is working to
    bring this innovation to a larger part of the population.

  The CHS framework for measuring intangible assets

  CHS (2005, 2009) classify firm spending on intangibles into three main categories: computerized information;
  innovative (scientific and creative) property; and economic competencies. They include the following sub-categories:

  1. Computerized information
      •	 Computer software: own use, purchased, and customized software
      •	 Computerized databases

  2. Scientific and creative property
      •	 Research and Development (R&D) in science and technology (spending for the development of new products
         and production processes, usually leading to a patent or license)
      •	 Mineral exploration (spending for the acquisition of new reserves)
      •	 Copyright and license costs (spending for the development of entertainment and artistic originals, usually
         leading to a copyright or license); and development costs in the motion picture, radio and television, sound
         recording, and book publishing industries
      •	 Other product development, design, and research expenses (not necessarily leading to a patent or copyright),
         such as new product development costs in the financial services industry, new architectural and engineering
         designs, and R&D in the social sciences and humanities

  3. Economic competencies
      •	 Brand equity (advertising expenditures and market research for the development of brands and trademarks)
      •	 Firm-specific human capital (spending on developing workforce skills; for example, on-the-job training and
         tuition payments for job-related education)
      •	 Organizational capital (costs of improvement in organizational structures).

                                Appendix 3. Methodology

The knowledge function

The first step of the model is to specify the choice of knowledge capital investment intensity. To this end, we
extent the CDM model in two main directions. First, when measuring knowledge intensity, we also include
other knowledge capital investments in addition to R&D, such as equipment and training for innovation (see
table 4). Second and differently from Griffith et al. (2006), who only have data on R&D activities for innovators,
the enterprise survey asks the question of knowledge activities to all firms. As a result, in our dataset zero
research intensity is an important outcome of knowledge capital investments that we need to incorporate this
to the model. Therefore, rather than using a generalized Tobit model, often implemented in CDM model, we
use a generalized Poisson estimator in order to better cater for the number of zeroes in the data.

Specifically we estimate the following model

                           									(I)

Where ki is knowledge intensity for firm i; xi is a vector of determinants of knowledge intensity and is
a vector of estimated coefficients. We follow the literature on the determinants of knowledge activities in
the Schumpeterian tradition and use as determinants variables to represent market share, diversification and
demand conditions, and firm level characteristics such a size and technological opportunities. In order to avoid
simultaneity between knowledge activities and market share we use firm’s market share before the introduction
of any innovation activities three years ago. For diversification and demand conditions we use whether domestic
or external demand is decreasing for the firm and whether the firm is a two-way trader, exporter and importer.
Technological opportunities are captured by ISIS 2 digits sector dummies. In addition, we control for firm size,
age and whether the firm is foreign owned. Finally, and more importantly, we extend the model and introduce
variables that represent the perceptions about the business environment for the firm. Specifically, we use indices
reflecting firms’ perceptions on how much of an obstacle lack of finance, trade costs, telecommunications and
government policies and regulations are (see table 4 for the definition of the variables used).

The innovation function
The second step is to determine the innovation equation. One important element in the decision to innovate
is that firms decide simultaneously what innovation outcomes to produce based on existing knowledge capital
investments. As a result, one should expect some correlation between the decisions to carry out product and process
innovations, and perhaps organizational innovations. In order to incorporate these correlations in the empirical
estimation, we use a multivariate Probit framework, which allows us to estimate the decision to innovate in the
different areas simultaneously and, therefore, correcting for potential correlation in these decisions.

Specifically, we estimate m Probit equations for the probability of innovate, where m equals 3 when considering
the three types of innovation.

Where the log-likelihood function can be expressed as:


                                               								(4)

And allowing for correlation in the errors across equations, matrix Ω elements are:


                                    									(5)




The likelihood function depends on the multivariate standard normal distribution.18
As a determinant for the innovation equations we follow the literature and control for size and capital intensity,
proxied by the ratio of capital to labor. One important input of the innovation function is the number of technical
staff in the establishment that can facilitate the transformation of knowledge inputs into innovation outcomes.
Given that the data on skilled labor is uncompleted we proxy skilled labor by an index of how much of an
obstacle is inadequately labor force.

Finally, given the potential endogeneity of knowledge capital investments in the innovation outcomes, we use
the predicted values from the Poisson process in the first stage in order to instrument knowledge activities, for
both R&D intensity and total research intensity.

The productivity Equation
The final stage to estimate the impact of innovation on firm performance is to derive the productivity equation.
We approximate productivity using a Cobb-Douglas function where sales (Y) are a function of capital (K), labor
(L) and innovation outcomes (H).




                   									(6)
Transforming equation 6 in logarithm form and adding sector controls (Xi) we have:

                                                                                                            		   (7)
Equation (7) can be estimated by OLS. However given the potential simultaneity between innovation outcomes
and performance, we use the predicted values of the innovation outcomes as instruments and correct the standard
errors by removing the mean squared error from the VCE of the second stage (Greene, 2012). Specifically we
estimate by OLS the following equation:

                                                                                                             	(8)
Robustness
The set of equations (1), (4) and (8) above are solved sequentially and instrumented at each stage following Griffith et
al. (2006). This, however, assumes no major feedback effects from productivity to innovation and from innovation to
knowledge capital investment. As a robustness test, we re-estimate the second and third stages, innovation functions
and productivity, simultaneously by maximum likelihood and compare the results with the sequential method.
18	 In order to solve the likelihood function we use the mvprobit command (Cappelari and Jenkins, 2003),.

                   Appendix 4. Main Econometric Results


A4.1 The determinants of investing in knowledge inputs
Table A4.1 shows the results of the first stage, the determinants of the intensity in knowledge capital investments.
As shown in the methodology in Appendix 3, we use a Poisson estimator in order to account for the number
of firms with zero investments. Columns (1) and (2) show the results for R&D intensity and research (sum of
R&D, training and equipment) intensity.

Regarding R&D intensity (column 1), two-way traders and firms that face shrinking demand domestically or
internationally have larger R&D intensity. Also, firms with greater perceptions of being financially constrained
invest less on knowledge inputs. This suggests that international competition and pressure for diversification are
important predictors of R&D intensity, while access to finance is likely to be an important inhibitor of these
investments. Interestingly, firms with foreign ownership tend to invest less on R&D, while in line with some of
the literature size does not appear to matter for these investments. Finally, neither market power position nor
none of the obstacles explored; telecommunications, trade or government obstacles appear to have an impact
on knowledge capital investments intensity. This emphasizes the role of external demand factors in explaining
R&D intensity.

Looking in column (2) to a broader measure of knowledge capital investments, including equipment and
training, yields very similar results to the ones on R&D, but with only two differences. First, lack of finance
does not have a significant role explaining knowledge intensity investments when broadening the definition, so
it appears less binding when including machinery, equipment and training. Second, foreign owned firms appear
to invest more in knowledge inputs when considering machinery, equipment and training, which is likely the
result of the fact that they carry out R&D abroad or in related firms.

Columns (3) and (4) estimate the same specifications for robustness as (1) and (2), but this time looking at the
decision (not the intensity) to invest. Thus, we use a Probit model to estimate the probability that firms incur
any R&D (3) or R&D, machinery, equipment and training (4) investments.

In the case of R&D, the only variables that appear to explain the decision to invest are having a decreasing
domestic or international demand, larger market share at the beginning of the period in 2008(t-3), the perception
of greater incidence of government obstacles and the perception of how important is access to finance as an
obstacle. Firms that claim to be more finance constrained are less likely to engage in R&D, while firms that
have larger sector market shares and that have more incentive to diversify due to contracting demand are more
likely to implement R&D. The coefficient on government obstacles is, however, puzzling. Firms which perceive
government regulations to be more of an obstacle are also more likely to engage in R&D, which could be
explained by the potential endogeneity of these perceptions to firm performance.

Finally, the results for the expanded decision to invest in knowledge activities in general (column (4)) show large
heterogeneity when trying to explain the investment decision, since our model only captures that larger firms
and two-way traders are more likely to engage in these investments.

Understanding Firm-Level Innovation and Productivity in Kenya                                                                                                               37
A4.2 The innovation function
In order to measure the impact of knowledge capital investments on innovation, we estimate the probability
of introducing an innovation, equation (4) above. Table A4.2 shows different estimates of equation (4). The
first six columns estimate individual Probit equations for product, process and organization innovations and
using observed R&D and research and equipment intensity. Columns (7) to (10) show the bivariate Probit
estimates allowing for correlation between product and process innovation decisions, and instrumenting
knowledge intensity with the predicted values of the previous stage. Finally, columns (11) to (16) implement
the multivariate framework to also include organization innovation.

In general the individual equations without instruments show very little predicted value of the model. Knowledge
capital investments do not appear to impact the probability of introducing innovations; we only find a negative
sign associated to R&D and organizational innovation. However, these estimates are likely to be biased given
the potential endogeneity between knowledge capital investments and innovation outcomes.

In order to correct for this endogeneity we instrument knowledge intensity with the predicted values estimated
in the previous stage. In addition, we allow for simultaneity in the decision to innovate for the different types
of innovation allowing for correlation of the error terms. Estimates of equations (7) to (10) that consider
only product and process innovation show a negative and statistically significant correlation between the two
equations, which suggest simultaneity between product and process innovation decisions and the need to control
for this correlation.

The estimates also indicate that firms that are more capital intensive are more likely to introduce product or
process innovations. Larger firms are more likely to introduce product innovations, while firms with a larger
perceived obstacle in education of the labor force are less likely to introduce process innovations. The most
surprising result is fact that similarly to the non-instrumented results, investment in knowledge activities, both
R&D and broad knowledge inputs, is not statistically significant in increasing the probability of product and
process innovation.

Columns (11) to (16) replicate the estimations but add organizational innovation to the simultaneous
equations. Adding organizational innovation implies a loss of observations since the organizational module was
only implemented to firms considered medium and large in the sampling frame.19 The decision to introduce
product and process innovations are still correlated, but the correlations with the residuals of the organizational
innovation equation are not statistically significant, which suggests that organizational innovation decisions
are done independently from product and process innovations. The results again suggest the importance of
large firms and capital intensity, although only for product innovation, and education of the labor force as an
obstacle for both product and process innovation. Medium sized firms appear to be more likely to implement
organizational innovations. Again, we do not find evidence that investments in knowledge capital are statistically
significant in affecting the probability of innovation; with the exception of a marginally significant coefficient of
R&D on organization innovation.

Overall, the results of the innovation equation suggest that in the case of Kenyan firms’ investments in knowledge
and acquisition of capabilities in the form of R&D, equipment and training do not necessarily translate into
firm level innovations. This result is not surprising for R&D, since it is likely that the type of small incremental
innovations do not require significant acquisition of capabilities via R&D; but is more surprising for total
knowledge capital investments, since even imitations tend to require some degree of acquisition of machinery
and training of workers.



19	 In the sample, however, there are small firms that were asked about organizational changes due to the fact that some firms had de facto lower employment levels than
    previously thought in the sampling frame.

A4.3 Innovation and productivity
The final stage to determine the impact of innovation on performance is to estimate equation (8). As productivity
measure, we use two proxies of labor productivity: the logarithm of sales per worker and the logarithm of value
added per worker. Although value added per worker is a better measure of labor productivity, the existence of
missing observations for material inputs in some firms reduces significantly the sample when using this variable.
In order to control for potential endogeneity of innovation decisions to firm performance when trying to
estimate causality in equation (8), we instrument the different type of innovations using the predicted values of
the multivariate framework described in the previous section and correct the standard errors of the regression
as proposed in Greene (2012). Table A4.3 shows the results of the OLS estimates without instrumenting for
comparison and Table A4.4 shows the instrumental variables estimates using the logarithm of sales per workers.
Columns (1) to (4) in Table A4.4 show the results when using R&D intensity as knowledge input to predict
innovation, while columns (4) to (8) uses the instruments of innovation estimated using research, training and
equipment for innovation intensity to explain innovation.

The main result that emerges from the table is that innovation is not statistically significant in increasing
productivity for our sample of Kenyan firms, with or without instrumenting. Only column (6) in table A4.3 show
statistically significant signs for a positive impact innovation on value added per worker. However, these results
are likely to be biased given the endogeneity problems discussed above. When we introduce instruments and
correct the standard errors in Tables A4.4 and Table A4.5, these increase significantly and only capital intensity
appear to be statistically significant in the sales per worker specifications using R&D to predict innovation.

Also, we introduce interactive innovation dummies to capture complementarities between different types of
innovation. However, the coefficients are not statistically significant.

As proposed in the previous section, as a robustness test we estimate stages 2 and stage 3 simultaneously as a
system of equations by maximum likelihood and allowing for correlations in the innovation decisions. Table
A4.6 shows the results for sales per worker. The results confirm the lack of statistically significant impact of
innovation on productivity. One difference, however, is that when estimating the innovation equation and
the productivity equation jointly, the knowledge intensity coefficients are statistically significant in explaining
innovation outcomes. The estimates using research, equipment and training investment intensity also show a
positive and statistically significant impact of knowledge capital investments on innovation outcomes, but no
impact of innovation on productivity.

One needs to interpret these results with caution, given the low number of observations and the lack of panel
structure of the dataset. However, overall, the main result of the estimates is that firm-level productivity appears
to be largely unexplained and there is no statistically significant impact of innovation on productivity.

A4.4 Innovation and employment
As a further check for the impact of innovation on employment, we use the retrospective information in the
survey on full-time employment and sales and estimate a model of employment growth. We follow Harrison et
al. (2008) and decompose sales growth into the share linked to new products and the share linked to old products
using the share of sales attributed to product innovation. We assume that this share accounts for the growth of
the entire three years period and estimate equation (9) below, where the change in permanent employment is
determined by: the growth in sales of old products and product innovation (new), process innovations; and a set
of controls X that include region to control for labor market conditions, whether the firm is a two-way trader,
the size of the firm, the age and sector dummies.

                                                                						(9)

Table A4.7 shows the OLS estimates of equation (9). We start estimating in column (1) the specification
considering only sales growth and province and sector dummies. Surprisingly, we find that the coefficient on
sales growth is not statistically significant affecting employment growth in the period. In columns (2) we add a
specification with more controls: including firm characteristics such as ownership, trading status, age and size,
in order to better capture the impact of sales growth. However, the coefficient is still not statically significant.
Equations (3) and (4) apply the decomposition of sales growth between old and new products and also introduce
process innovation, but the coefficients associated to innovations remain statistically not significant.
