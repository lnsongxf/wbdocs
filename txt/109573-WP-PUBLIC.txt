Overview
This learning product (study) draws upon existing IEG evaluations, project
documents and analytical work relating to the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s)
experience with supporting efforts towards the rapid scale up of off-grid
electrification (“pico-solar” products, individual solar home systems [SHSs], and
micro and mini-grids), in client countries. The focus is on experiences geared
towards efficiently and effectively integrating off-grid electrification scale-up efforts
with grid rollout – within a national roadmap for achieving universal access in a
given time-frame. Relevant findings and lessons are framed as strategic
considerations to inform the design, development and implementation of country
engagements tailored to the prevailing sector conditions and readiness; through
capacity building, technical assistance, and investment lending.


Background
In recent years, there has been renewed focus on the 1.1 billion people around the
world without any access to electricity from either the conventional grid or any off-
grid or stand-alone source. Most of these people are poor and are held back from
their potential for human development and from the improved quality of life that
can be enabled by access to electricity services.1 In Sub-Saharan Africa alone there
are over 600 million people without access, and this figure may rise to 935 million in
2030 if the population grows as projected and the pace of new electricity connections
remains at the average annual rate of the last 10 years (IEG 2015).

Against this background, the World Bank Group and the United Nations have
committed to the Sustainable Energy for All initiative2, which is reinforced by
Sustainable Development Goal 7 (“ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable
and modern energy for all”) and the World Bank Group’s goals of ending extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

The IEG report World Bank Group’s Support for Electricity Access, FY2000–2014
(IEG 2015) presented to the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in 2015, was
a strategic evaluation of the engagement, operations, and outcomes of the entire

1Another 1 billion people around the world who are connected to the grid still experience a
highly unreliable and inadequate power supply, which triggers high welfare costs; they are
not the focus of this study.

Bank Group portfolio in this sector for fiscal years (FY) 2000–14, related to the
provision of adequate, reliable, and affordable electricity access. The report noted
that the World Bank Group’s support for off-grid electrification was a small
proportion of its overall portfolio for the electricity sector during FY2000–14.
However, the report also recognized a rapidly growing trend and scope in several
countries in the adoption of portable solar products that can speedily bring, at a
minimum, basic electricity services—lighting, fans, small television, and cell phone
charging—to those who have little prospect of receiving grid-based electricity for
several years or even decades.

An updated and in-depth examination of World Bank and International Finance
Corporation (IFC) operations approved or closed during FY2000–16 identified 83
projects—71 Bank projects and 12 IFC operations—that were either dedicated to or
had a component for off-grid electrification. The total commitment for World Bank
Group projects for off-grid applications during this period was US$1.594 billion,
estimated at about 2.5 percent of Bank Group lending for the electricity sector.

The World Bank’s projects with off-grid components are concentrated in 10
countries (five low-, four high-, and one medium-access country). The countries
received 78 percent of all World Bank assistance for off-grid electrification during
FY2000–16. Bangladesh alone accounted for 32 percent of this lending, followed by
Argentina (12 percent). The shares for Mali, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Uganda, India, Sri
Lanka, Bolivia, and Liberia ranged between 7 percent and 2 percent. The
predominant portion of the lending was for individual SHSs.


The Coming of Age of Off-Grid Access Delivery: World Bank Group’s Catalyzing
Role
From a near-standing start less than 10 years ago, more than 100 companies are now
actively focusing on stand-alone solar lanterns and SHS kits targeted at those
without modern energy access. They have sold over 14 million quality-certified pico-
solar products (defined as having a photovoltaic panel smaller than 10 watts),
mainly portable lights, as of mid-2015. These products provide basic electricity
access for millions of people in Africa and Asia and have lifted 21 million
individuals to the first rung of the energy ladder, according to our estimates. This
rapid growth has been stimulated and supported by the World Bank and IFC’s
Lighting Africa program and its successor, the Lighting Global program, which
pioneered well-designed and targeted technical assistance for improving quality
assurance and service delivery. Though no firm estimates are available, the value of
quality-certified pico-solar products is several orders of magnitude higher than the



                                         vii
relatively small outlay for technical assistance from the Lighting Africa and Lighting
Global programs.

Despite some significant pilot examples of micro-grid and mini-grid project
components supported by the World Bank Group and in the private sector, scaling
up continues to pose a challenge – in terms of institutional arrangements and for
commercially viable business models. This contrasts with the expectations from the
International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2014 New
Policies Scenario of SSA for universal access by 2040, in which 315 million people in
rural areas are expected to gain access to electricity, with around 80 million (25
percent) of them through stand-alone off-grid systems, and around 140 million (44
percent) through mini-grids requiring the development of between 100,000 and
200,000 mini-grids, depending on the number of households connected to each
system (IEA 2014).


Implications from Good Practice Examples
This study highlights good practice country program experiences in supporting
commercially viable and rapidly scalable off-grid access and services provision
models and institutional frameworks. These encompass supply and service delivery
chains for SHSs and microgrids as well as the technologically and commercially fast-
evolving pico-solar products and their growing transformative record. These
experiences have taken different routes in mainstreaming off-grid electrification
according to their own needs and context. In Bangladesh, the scaled-up SHS
program in grid-proximate areas took hold as an opportunistic market response to
the then-stalled grid extension program; in Sri Lanka off-grid electrification (initially
isolated village hydro mini-grid networks) grew out of an ex-ante strategy, anchored
by an island-wide spatial electrification plan, and implemented as staged pre-
electrification till such time as planned grid extensions arrived at those locations; in
Rwanda and Kenya, off-grid electrification is proceeding in an ex ante planned
manner; Morocco presents a case in which the cycle of planned pre-electrification
has transitioned to mostly grid-based electrification; and most recently, Myanmar –
drawing on preceding good practice experiences, has also embarked on a conscious
strategy of ex-ante planned pre-electrification – designing an off-grid program that
promotes solar products, SHS and isolated mini-grid networks coordinated with
grid expansion.

This collective experience illuminates valuable insights and strategic considerations
for low access countries that are looking to efficiently and rapidly achieve universal
electricity access. From a strategic, nationwide perspective, realizing the full



                                           viii
potential of off-grid electrification in each country-specific context calls for a
comprehensive approach that can leverage the dynamics of access expansion
through both grid and off-grid means in a coordinated manner in space and time.


Findings and Lessons – Strategic considerations for scaling up off-grid
electrification in low access countries.
The experience and good practices from countries—with Bank support or
otherwise—yield the following insights:

PUTTING PEOPLE (BENEFICIARIES) FIRST, NOT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
      People want affordable, adequate, reliable access “yesterday.” From a
       personal as well as a social and national perspective, the opportunity costs of
       delay in providing even basic access are very high—tantamount to depriving
       another generation of the benefits of modern services, including education
       and health care services. Time is of the essence.

      Access to even small quantities of modern electricity—sufficient to power
       basic modern lighting, cell phone charging, a small radio or television—can
       trigger a giant step for that are without any access. The United Nations
       Sustainable Energy for All Global Tracking Framework’s tier 1 and tier 2
       market segments typify this first hugely transformative step of demand for
       basic access.

      Significantly, over time, peoples' expectations tend to grow, and almost all
       aspire to electricity access comparable in adequacy, quality, and reliability
       that is typical of a well-managed utility-run grid system.

      A national roadmap for achieving universal access (“electricity for all”),
       irrespective of where people are located (for example, urban areas, including
       any slums; peri-urban; rural; or rural), can avoid or counter tendencies
       toward “cherry picking” geographical service areas or beneficiaries, whether
       for grid or off-grid rollout.

GRID VERSUS OFF-GRID: A FALSELY FRAMED BINARY CHOICE
      The “grid versus off-grid” trade-off needs to be framed in relation to
       complementarity and coordination geared toward universal access. Grid and
       off-grid technologies and access service delivery are not necessarily either-or
       options to be determined simply based on a narrow least-cost calculus.
       Rather, looking ahead, off-grid access provision is appropriately viewed as



                                              ix
       playing a complementary and coordinated role alongside grid rollout in the
       process of achieving universal access.

      The manner in which the off-grid and grid combination plays out during
       implementation varies by country and is dynamic in space and over time, as
       for instance in the cases of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Morocco. This may
       come about in response to progress—or lack thereof—in the respective grid
       rollout and off-grid rollout implementation in the field; to potential factors
       such as evolving customer expectations and aspirations for service standards
       and the sociopolitical policy responses to those; and possibly to other real-
       time triggers.

      Off-grid electrification can play a significant role in most low-access countries
       in the near future. In many countries, grid rollout has yet to get under way. In
       others, it has stalled or advanced in starts and stops and at an unpredictable
       pace on account of one or more factors in sector readiness conditions, such as
       governance, institutional framework, capacity, long-term vision, targets,
       commitment and sustained follow-through, lack of accountability, or on-and-
       off rather than programmatic finance, not taking into account the commercial
       viability for the qualified private sector agents engaging in access rollout.

PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR ENGAGEMENT: BOTH PLAY ROLES IN CATALYZING AND ENABLING SCALE-UP
OF OFF-GRID ACCESS ROLLOUT FOR TIER 1 AND 2 MARKETS

In tracing the evolution of off-grid access delivery across the WBG portfolio
(sections 2 and 3) two noteworthy features are: (i) the evolving scope and roles of
the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) engagements in
response to opportunity for maximizing the synergies resulting from their respective
strengths and comparative advantages in enabling early stage (“pre-market")
development, and (ii) assisting the client countries in designing the participation of
the private and public sectors working in close partnership, bringing their respective
natural roles and comparative strengths towards scale up delivery for realizing the
national goal of universal access efficiently and rapidly

The complementary roles of the public and private sectors are to be seen in
Bangladesh where the World Bank played a key role by supporting IDCOL, an
autonomous government undertaking, in mentoring and promoting private sector
operators, NGOs, and microfinance institutions for deploying SHS in a competitive
business model. The WBG’s Lighting Global Program has engaged in design and
preparation of a substantial scale off-grid electrification program for Tier 1 and 2
segments, aided by the spatial information provided by the nationwide geospatial
least cost plans funded by the World Bank and grid extension plan over time. The


                                             x
instances of Kenya, Rwanda and Myanmar typify country cases where the World
Bank assisted the Government with preparation of the national least cost geospatial
electrification implementation plan for universal access by 2030 (grid and alongside
coordinated in space-time the off grid program scale up), and syndication of the
investment financing requirements orchestrated by the governments’ within a sector
wide organizing architecture and oversight process.

MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES OF A HIGH-LEVEL NETWORK PLANNING PLATFORM THAT IS ANCHORED IN A
GEOSPATIAL AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN COVERING GRID AND OFF-GRID MEANS
           Providing access (in some form) to all households, clinics, and trading
            centers—wherever they may be—requires identifying where the
            beneficiaries are located geospatially. This enables least-cost placement
            and expansion of existing electricity access infrastructure. Sound
            geospatial planning platforms that can be readily updated to reflect
            changes in key variables have been shown to provide a comprehensive
            analytical foundation for and a dynamically coordinated strategic-level
            rollout implementation of grid and off-grid growth in space and time.
            Such planning facilitates further detailing of design and rollout
            operationally.
           The national geospatial least-cost strategic rollout plan serves to further
            anchor and foster closer alignment of multiple and varied donor
            programs with national priorities and targets and to effect harmonization
            across donor programs. It also facilitates and directs financing support
            (called syndication) of the investment prospectus on-grid or off-grid and
            in space and time (more below).

SECTORWIDE ORGANIZING ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRAMMATIC FINANCING SHOW PROMISE
      Sector-wide organizing architecture and programmatic financing can be
       effective for rallying and orchestrating stakeholder participation in closer
       alignment with national priorities than otherwise; as well as syndication of
       program financing of an integrated grid and of-grid rollout, up to a medium-
       term horizon. Specifically, the sector wide investment prospectus for grid and
       off-grid expansion¬ would be anchored by the overall least cost geospatial

1. Setting the Context
Introduction
1.1     In recent years, there has been renewed focus on the 1.1 billion people around
the world who are without any access to electricity from either the conventional grid
or any off-grid or stand-alone source. Most of these people are poor and are held
back from their potential for human development and the improved quality of life
that can be enabled by access to electricity services.3 In Sub-Saharan Africa alone it
is estimated that about 600 million people were without access in 2012 (IEA and
World Bank 2015), and this figure may rise to 935 million in 2030 if the population
grows at the projected rate and the pace of new electricity connections remains at the
average annual rate of the last 10 years (IEG 2015).4

1.2   Against this background, the World Bank Group and the United Nations
have committed to the Sustainable Energy for All initiative5, which seeks to achieve
universal access to energy by 2030 and improve energy efficiency and the use of
renewable energy. This initiative is reinforced by Sustainable Development Goal 7
(“ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”) and
the World Bank Group’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity.6


The Independent Evaluation Group’s Strategic Evaluation of Electricity Access
1.3    The Bank Group’s commitment to assist client countries in moving toward
the Sustainable Energy for All goal together with other development partners was
the backdrop for the comprehensive evaluation by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG), World Bank Group’s Support for Electricity Access, FY2000–2014 (IEG
2015), which was presented to the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in
2015. The report was a strategic evaluation of the engagement, operations, and


3Another 1 billion people around the world who are connected to the grid still experience a
highly unreliable and inadequate power supply, which triggers high welfare costs; they are
not the focus of this study.
4The Independent Evaluation Group’s report’s estimates are indicative and based on
average growth of connections in last 10 years up 2014 along with projected population
growth (IEG 2015).

outcomes of the entire Bank Group portfolio for fiscal years (FY) 2000–14 as they
related to the provision of adequate, reliable, and affordable electricity access to all.
These operations encompassed generation, transmission, and distribution and were
differentiated across country groups by level of access.7

1.4     To achieve universal access by 2030, the report estimated that the pace of
connections in low-access countries (those with less than 50 percent of the
population connected—mostly low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) needs
to rise from the present average of 2 million per year8 to about 15 million per year
for the next 15 years. This translates to an increase of investments from
US$3.6 billion per year to about US$37 billion per year, including for new generation
capacity and rehabilitation of the electricity sector’s physical assets. This huge
increase in connections is unlikely to result solely or predominantly from grid
expansion alone in the time frame set by global access goals.

1.5     The Bank Group’s 2013 directions paper for the energy sector, “Toward a
Sustainable Energy Future for All: Directions for the World Bank Group’s Energy
Sector,” contains the Bank Group’s approach to off-grid electrification (World Bank
2013b). In countries with low energy access, the World Bank Group’s priority would
be “to support affordable and reliable energy through all means, grid, minigrid, and
off-grid.” In rural, remote, or isolated areas, off-grid solutions based on renewable
energy combined with energy-efficient technologies would be the most rapid means
of providing cost-effective energy services. The paper notes that “grid, minigrid, and
off-grid solutions are all needed, that they are not mutually exclusive, and can be
implemented in parallel or, under specific conditions, in sequence.” The strategies
proposed in the directions paper are reflected only to a limited extent (less than one-
third) in country partnership strategies (CPSs) effective 2014 or later for low-access
countries where off-grid electrification is likely to be of relevance. A fuller analysis
in this regard of CPSs for 50 low-access countries in the last 10 years is presented in
appendix A.

1.6     IEG’s 2015 electricity access report noted that the World Bank Group’s
investment support for off-grid electrification—mainly SHS, portable solar products
for lighting and cell phone charging, and a small number of micro- and minigrids—
was a small proportion of the World Bank Group’s overall portfolio for the
electricity sector during FY2000–14. The penetration of SHS is concentrated in a few

7Countries are classified in terms of the percentage of population having access to
electricity: Low (up to 50 percent); Medium (>50 to 75 percent); High (>75 to 95 percent);
Universal: (>95 percent). This is consistent with IEG’s 2015 electricity access study.

countries, namely Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and is in a nascent
stage in several other countries.

1.7     At the same time, the report recognized a positive and growing trend and
scope for the adoption of solar products that can speedily bring, at a minimum, basic
electricity services—lighting, fan, television, and cell phone charging—to those who
have little prospect of receiving grid-based electricity for several years or even
decades. This is seen in the proliferation of quality-certified portable cash-and-carry
pico-solar products for lighting and cell phone charging, enabled by the targeted
support for starter and early markets by the joint IFC-World Bank Lighting Africa
program, which has evolved into the present Lighting Global program.

1.8     These experiences are particularly relevant for low-access countries, many of
which are in fragile situations, have significant shares of dispersed populations
without prospect of electricity access, or do not have enabling sector conditions
sufficiently in place for systematic and rapid access scale-up through grid extensions
and supply.


Terminology: What Is Considered Off-Grid Electrification?
1.9    For the strategic evaluation purposes of this report, off-grid electrification is
viewed in the following categories, which span a variety of products, services, and
technologies and reflect recent and emerging trends in the provision of off-grid
access (World Bank 2011).

    Isolated network systems with generation plants (microgrids and minigrids).
     Microgrids typically range from 30 kilowatts9 to 500 kilowatts and use a range of
     technologies, from simple diesel generators to hydropower, biomass,
     photovoltaic, wind, or hybrid systems. Larger minigrids are typically above
     1 megawatt capacity, and can provide sufficient power for activities such as
     water pumping, milling, grinding and other forms of processing.

    Individual systems. These include SHS, which range from household-sized
     systems of 30–100 watt peak10 capable of powering a few bulbs, a fan, and




9A microgrid with a 30 kilowatt capacity can cater to about 200 households for lighting,
television, and possibly small appliances.
10Watt peak stands for peak power. This value specifies the output power achieved by a
solar module under full solar radiation


                                             3
     possibly a small television, to institutional sizes (100–500 watt peak) for use in
     small community centers, schools, or health centers.

    Pico-solar photovoltaic charging products. (This term is used interchangeably in
     this report with the terms solar products and pico-solar products.) Such products are
     for modern lighting, cell phone charging, and so on, and are linked with solar or
     grid-based charging.

1.10 A multitier framework for defining and measuring the level of access to
electricity was introduced through the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. In
contrast to the binary measurement of electricity access undertaken historically, the
Global Tracking Framework distinguishes five levels of access.11 The schematic in
figure 1.1 illustrates the corresponding service level tiers (tier 1 through tier 5). Each
tier is differentiated by the typical electricity end uses that can be powered and the
associated number of hours per day for which that access should be available.
Specifically these range from simple task lighting, phone charging, and radio (tier 1)
and general lighting, television, and fan (tier 2) at one end, to the use of the full
range of modern appliances such as air conditioners at the other end (tier 5; World
Bank 2015). Further, the expectations for duration and reliability of service increase
with the tier level. Tier 1 and 2 services should be available for at least four hours a
day, and tier 5 services should be available for 23 hours in a day.

1.11 Tier 1 services are fully supported by off-grid solar products, including pico-
solar products. Tier 2 access is technically and economically feasible with off-grid
solar, especially SHS, and increasingly so by pico-solar products, as more efficient
lighting and gadgets become available. Isolated network systems (microgrids or
minigrids)—if properly designed and maintained—are capable of providing tier 3
services (air cooling, refrigeration, water pumps, and rice cookers) or higher tier
services in the case of larger minigrid systems (figure 1.2).




11Access to electricity is measured based on technology-neutral multitiered standards for
which successive thresholds for supply attributes allow increased use of electricity
appliances. The key attributes relevant for household electricity are (i) capacity; (ii) duration
(including daily supply and evening supply); (iii) reliability; (iv) quality; (v) affordability;
(vi) legality; and (vii) health and safety (World Bank 2015).

 Note: The power supply also needs to cover at least two evening hours for tier 1, 2, and 3, four evening hours for tiers 4
 and 5; be affordable from tier 3 to tier 5; and be assessed on reliability, quality, legality, and health and safety for tiers 4
 and 5.

1.12 In the following sections, this report highlights the emergence of an expanded
array of market-proven solar options, that is, products and service delivery for


                                                                 5
effectively achieving tier 1 and tier 2 markets for access. They are now “market
proven” and available for mainstreaming and rapid penetration within the context
of an overall sector strategy for implementing universal access by 2030. These cover
quality-certified solar products ranging from plug-and-play solar kits, which can
provide sufficient power for the most basic services of essential lighting and cell
phone charging, up to SHS kits rated 100 watt peak and beyond, and related services
delivery. These products can potentially and rapidly provide access to basic
electricity services to the billion people that make do today with far inferior and
more expensive sources of energy such as kerosene, wood, or candles and get them
to the first step of the energy access “ladder” (figure 1.2).


The Scope of This Report
1.13 This learning product study draws upon existing evaluations of the
Independent Evaluation group (IEG), and a wide-ranging literature review to derive
key principles and lessons from the World Bank Group's experience with supporting
the rapid scale up of off-grid electrification on a sustainable basis in client countries.
The purpose is to identify key strategic directions and essential building blocks of an
enabling policy and institutional framework for planning, financing and
orchestrating a planned and coordinated rollout - in space and time - of off-grid and
grid electrification alongside. This study is not a toolkit for detailed project design,
service delivery model specifications, technology, or payment mechanisms for off-
grid electrification. It is not so much about identifying best practice answers or
implications for one question per se: how or what to do in off-grid electrification
operationally. Rather, the study gathers the findings and lessons of experience in
the World Bank Group and from other actors to understand the context and
mechanisms underlying experiences and instances where rapid and efficient scale
up of off-grid electrification has been achieved in client countries. This with a view
to putting forth key considerations as well as implications for the World Bank
Group to assist in framing the right questions in a country-specific context with
respect to strategic directions for operational strategy development and for
engagement, technical assistance and lending; for scaling up off-grid
implementation alongside the grid extension program.


Audience
1.14 The main audience for this report is staff and task team leaders of the Global
Practice for Energy and Extractives, who are concerned with designing and
operationalizing electricity access scale-up implementation under diverse country

contexts and levels of sector “readiness.” The study is of particular relevance to task
team leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the low-access countries are
situated with a wide diversity of sector readiness conditions and start-up
challenges.12 The messages from the study would also be of interest to policymakers
and sector practitioners in client countries, other multilateral and bilateral lenders
and donors, and nongovernmental organizations.

1.15    The rest of the report is organized as follows:

     Section 2 traces how off-grid electrification has come of age in its ability to serve
     both tier 1 and 2 category access needs in several developing countries. The
     pivotal ways in which the World Bank Group has contributed to these
     developments is examined with respect to individual SHSs, scaling up the use of
     solar products with relatively small financial outlays, and micro- or minigrids.

     Section 3 builds on the evidence for off-grid electrification as a mainstream
     component of broader national efforts to increase electricity access. It highlights
     several country examples that embody the “next generation” of off-grid
     electrification strategic planning and implementation staging.

     Section 4 brings together the findings and lessons from the World Bank Group’s
     experience for strategic considerations, operational directions, and implications,
     keeping the country-specific context in focus.


2. Off-Grid Electrification’s Coming of Age:
Pivotal Contributions by the World Bank Group
2.1    The World Bank Group’s contribution to advancing commercially viable and
readily scalable off-grid access delivery over the last decade, especially in the tier 1
and tier 2 access categories, has been transformative in several respects. Despite
relatively low and sporadic lending for off-grid electrification (in comparison to
overall electricity sector lending), the World Bank has supported sound service
delivery mechanisms for solar home systems (SHSs) in South Asia, while the World
Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have jump-started the market
for pico-solar products in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.




12
 This also applies to other countries that are advancing their electric access, such as
Myanmar, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and other Pacific Island countries.

2.2    This section traces how off-grid electrification has come of age in its ability to
serve both tier 1 and tier 2 category access needs in several developing countries.
The pivotal ways in which the Bank Group has contributed to these developments is
examined with respect to individual SHSs, scaling up the use of solar products
(mainly with technical assistance and relatively small financial outlays), and micro-
or minigrids.

2.3    The World Bank Group’s assistance for off-grid electrification has averaged
about US$87 million per year during a 17-year period covering fiscal years
(FY)2000–16 (out of total US$1.594 billion), which is estimated to be about
2.5 percent of its overall lending for the electricity sector during the period. No
discernible trend is found in these commitments over the observed time period.
There was relatively low activity year after year, punctuated by large commitments
especially in FY2002 and FY2013, and what appears to be a promising trend in 2015
and 2016 (Figure 2.1). An analysis of the World Bank Group lending portfolio for
off-grid electrification during FY2000–16 is presented in appendix B.

Large-Scale Rollout of SHS Systems and Services: Bangladesh
2.4    Bangladesh’s well-known experience with deploying SHSs in peri-urban and
rural areas built on an earlier World Bank–supported model in Sri Lanka using a
financial intermediary and private vendors.13 In its ongoing effort, Bangladesh has

Project (P010498) 1997-2003.

rolled out nearly 4 million SHSs since the early 2000s (Figure 2.2). These installations
provide basic electricity services to about 12 percent of the country’s population
(Pavel 2016).

2.5     Bangladesh’s rapidly scalable off-grid access expansion can be viewed as pre-
electrification for areas that otherwise could be covered cost-effectively by
centralized grids. The impetus for the Bangladesh SHS program originally came
from a stalled extensions and connections program on the main grid, exacerbated by
a severe shortfall in electricity generation in the country in the previous decade. A
vendor-based program managed by the implementing agency and financial
intermediary Industrial Development Company Limited (IDCOL) stepped into this
breach and set the stage for the SHS market to take off in the country. The World
Bank’s Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development I and II projects
have supported IDCOL in installing over 2.3 million systems from 2002 to March
2016. IDCOL has mentored over 49 partnership organizations—nongovernmental
organizations, microfinance institutions, and private sector institutions—and
engaged them in a competitive business model for SHS sales and servicing. A vital
factor contributing to the success of IDCOL’s SHS program is the availability of and
access to finance from lenders and donors. By the deployment of these funds
through a microcredit financing mechanism, supported by a combination of targeted
consumer credit and (declining) subsidies (Khandker et al. 2014) poor households
are enabled to access affordable energy services through SHS, because they do not
have to come up with upfront costs or pay separately for operation and maintenance
(Rai et al. 2015). Another vital factor contributing to the success of Bangladesh’s SHS
program is the attention to product quality standard through mechanisms set up by
IDCOL.

2.6    However, since the peak installation pace of over 75,000 per month in
Bangladesh during April and May, 2014, SHS sales have shown an overall declining
trend, with a sharply lower 28,000 installations in October 2015. This slowdown is
attributed to the rapid acceleration in grid connections (now more than 300,000 per
month) in the push to achieve the government target of 90 percent geographic
coverage by the grid by 2018. Given these developments, IDCOL is exploring
various options, including promoting SHS as a back-up facility since reliability of
grid supply continues to be uneven, and diversifying into product offerings such as
solar pumps for drinking water for the partner organizations (to ensure that they
remain in business to service the needs of existing SHS users in rural areas).

2016; World Bank 2015e; IEA and World Bank 2015.
Note: The electrification rate decline of 62 percent in 2014 down from 67 percent in 2015 is due to the fact that the data for
2014–16 are from Bangladesh Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR), whereas the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics (BBS) provide time series of data from 2002–13. This underreporting by MPEMR could be because in
India and Bangladesh, the SHSs are not considered in the rural electrification figures because they cater only to lighting
needs (Palit and Chaurey 2011). BBS’s data is for electricity for lighting, which could include SHS and also based on the
sample survey. MPEMR’s access rate may be based on the number of electricity connections and not a sample survey.


Deploying SHS in Remote Areas
2.7     Argentina and Peru employed a concession model for off-grid electrification
in their remote, high-cost, isolated areas that are unlikely to be covered by the
conventional grid in the foreseeable future. In both instances, the respective utilities
servicing the area were responsible for the services, though procurement and
installation could be undertaken by contractors. Mongolia established a reliable
supply chain for SHS across the country, particularly benefiting over 85 percent of
its herder population.

2.8     Argentina: The World Bank’s Argentina Renewable Energy in Rural Markets
Project (FY1999–2013) supported an early fee-for-service concession model to supply
electricity to remote areas. The model delivered expected results, given Argentina’s
long experience with concessions in traditional electricity markets. The project
developed eight concessionaires that installed off-grid facilities in nearly 30,000
households (about 0.3 percent of the population in a universal access country)—
mainly with SHS but also with wind turbines and minigrids, in addition to installing
more than 2,000 SHSs in schools, medical centers, and other public buildings (World
Bank 2013e). The relatively large unit size of the institutional installation and
mandated installation (as opposed to individual households that may not opt to sign
up) greatly increased the attractiveness of the package to private sector bidders.


                                                                           10
2.9     Peru: Similarly, under Peru’s Rural Electrification Project (FY2006–13),
electricity distribution companies installed and managed as a utility service, in excess
of 100,000 SHSs in remote and isolated areas, representing about 1.6 percent of the
national population, mostly living in remote areas. The World Bank’s role was
important in supplementing the financing plan, particularly in supporting capital
investments and helping ensure transparency in awarding concessions.

2.10 Mongolia: The Mongolia Renewable Energy for Rural Areas Project
relaunched the commercial solar home systems market by establishing a reliable
supply chain and a country-wide system of sales and service centers for
maintenance and repair; it also enabled underpinning of manufacturer warranties
and partial subsidization of the sale of solar home systems. The project transformed
the market for solar lighting from a subsidized to a fully commercial basis,
accelerated its expansion from a baseline of 15 percent of the herder population in
2006 to 85 percent in 2014, and catalyzed its expansion beyond lighting products to
supply all kinds of appliances, such as television sets and satellite receivers. By mid-
2014, the market for solar home systems and appliances had become established
over the entire country. (World Bank 2016).


Rapid Market Penetration of Solar Products for access tiers 1 and 2: The Lighting
Africa and Lighting Global Programs
2.11 In recent years, a vastly expanded array of market-proven off-grid solar
products and service options have become available, and products are no longer
confined to a piloting mode. These quality-certified products include cash-and-carry
plug-and-play solar kits, which provide sufficient power for the most basic services
of essential lighting and cell phone charging, as well as SHSs rated up to 100 watt
peak (and beyond) and related service delivery

2.12 From a near-standing start less than 10 years ago, more than 100 companies
are now actively focusing on stand-alone solar lanterns and SHS kits targeted at
those without modern energy access. They have sold over 14 million quality-
certified pico-solar products (defined as having a photovoltaic panel smaller than 10
watts), mainly in the form of portable lights, as of mid-2015 (Figure 2.3). These
products improve energy access for millions of people in Africa and Asia and have
lifted 21 million individuals to the first rung of the energy ladder, according to our
estimates. These market developments signal a changing strategic paradigm for
scaling up access efficiently and in a timely manner to enable access to basic
electricity services. Deep and rapid-paced market penetration appears achievable for




                                           11
off-grid access provision to tier 1 and tier 2 markets on a commercially viable
sustainable basis (beyond possible need for start-up subsidies).

2.13 This rapid growth has been stimulated and supported by the World Bank and
IFC’s Lighting Africa and its successor, the Lighting Global program, which have
pioneered well-designed and targeted technical assistance for improving quality
assurance and service delivery. (Box 2.1).

Box 1.1 Lighting Africa; Lighting Global: Transformational Off-Grid Program for T1 and T2 access
for the Poor
 The World Bank and IFC piloted and scaled up Lighting Africa, an innovative program to
 address the lighting needs of a large segment of the population not served by the power
 grid. The program has been expanded successfully from its pilot phase within Kenya and
 replicated in other countries in Africa and Asia. Earlier efforts to provide solar lamps to
 poor families funded by donor grants and distributed free have had limited uptake.
 The program design incorporated the entire supply chain and was informed by experience.
 The World Bank and IFC initiated Lighting Africa in 2007 to accelerate the development of
 a sustainable commercial market for quality, clean, and safe solar lighting products that are
 affordable to very-low-income households and small businesses. The collaborative effort
 was based on each institution’s core competencies and has benefitted from frequent, regular
 communication between the two teams.
 Lighting Africa enabled transformation at two levels. From a market development
 perspective, the project transformed the solar lamp market in Kenya by making modern,
 good quality, and affordable lighting products available to the very poor. It also
 demonstrated the commercial viability and sustainability of the approach to address the
 lighting needs of the base of the pyramid, in contrast to donor subsidized lending for the
 purchase of solar lamps. To achieve this, Lighting Africa considered constraints along the
 entire supply chain (such as high taxes on solar imports, lack of export financing, access to
 supplier credit, market analysis)—considering the entire system. At project start in 2009,
 only 2 percent of Kenya’s population was using solar lamps for their lighting needs; this
 number had grown to nearly 10 percent in 2014 (although growth cannot be attributed
 solely to the project). About 850,000 solar lamps have been sold under the project from 2009
 to 2014 (compared with an anticipated 300,000 units), benefitting an estimated 4.25 million
 people, mostly in poor areas of Nairobi and in rural areas. Household members using these
 lamps no longer inhale toxic fumes from kerosene lamps and paraffin. School children are
 able to study and do their homework at night. Households and small businesses had
 savings by drastically limiting their kerosene purchase.

2.14 The success of Lighting Africa has inspired programs in India, Bangladesh,
Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Lighting Global is the
World Bank Group’s global platform supporting sustainable and rapid scale up of
commercial market based off-grid access for the Tier 1&2 segments – encompassing
(Figures 1.1 and 1.2 ) pico-solar lighting and charging devices and solar home
systems (SHS) - to people not connected to grid electricity. Through Lighting
Global, IFC and the World Bank work with the Global Off-Grid Lighting
Association, manufacturers, distributors, and other development partners to
develop the off-grid lighting market. The Lighting Global program’s role is to
provide market insights, steer development of quality assurance frameworks for
modern, off-grid lighting devices and systems, facilitate product and systems


                                              13
quality certification, and promote sustainability, in close partnership with industry
and appropriately enabled and supported by Government policy. Lighting Global
supports Lighting Africa, Lighting Asia and Lighting Pacific, which work along the
supply chain of off-grid lighting products and systems to reduce market entry
barriers and first mover risks.

2.15 The well-established and sustained market record in a growing number of
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South and East Asia illuminates the
foundations and principles for workably credible and scalable mechanism for
bringing about a fast and initial transformational impact on those who otherwise
make do with an inferior and higher unit cost means such as kerosene, candles, and
wood, to meet their most basic lighting needs.

2.16 Evidence of a rapidly maturing industry can be witnessed firsthand and is
shaped by the cycle dynamics of entrepreneurial energy, technological advances
enabled by high-efficiency direct current appliances, and business model
innovations. Between cost reductions, latent consumer demand, and a sales-driven
push for higher-margin products, SHSs that are capable of powering appliances
such as televisions and fans are projected to capture an increasing market share.14
The cost of providing energy for basic lighting, radio, and a 19" television has gone
down from US$991 in 2009 to US$354 with the use of super-efficient appliances and
is slated to drop further to US$193 by 2020 (figure 2.4). With the sales-driven push
for higher-margin products, SHSs capable of powering appliances such as
televisions and fans are projected to capture an increasing market share.15

2.17 The share of certified and branded solar products has been growing steadily
over the years, as seen in figure 2.5. The products have been branded and certified
by either Lighting Global or companies associated with it or by other companies
producing their own branded products. Solar lights and SHSs have seen substantial
cost reductions and performance improvements during 2010–15; for example, a low-
cost light-emitting diode lantern was US$20 in 2010 and US$4 in 2015 (Bloomberg
Energy Finance et al 2016). This low-cost pico-solar photovoltaic could provide the
poor with their first pre-electrification experience and be available at local retail
shops and kiosks where they would otherwise buy kerosene, dry-cell batteries, and
candles, years before the utilities or electricity service companies offer SHSs or
connection to the minigrid or main grid.

2.18 While firm estimates are not readily available, the market sales revenue of
quality-certified pico-solar products (excluding SHS) are several orders of
magnitude higher than the relatively modest dollar amounts funding the
significantly well designed and targeted technical assistance facilitated from the
WBG’s Lighting Africa and Lighting Global Programs. For further perspective, the
cumulative (2011-2015) market share of branded and Lighting Africa/Global
quality-verified products sold by the first-half of 2015 was about a third of the total
cumulative sales of all such products 44.2 million, and by comparison typically
vastly inferior in performance, quality and life (Figure 6). The efforts of Lighting
Africa/Global programs of the WBG have steadily made ever deeper inroads into
this growing global market for pico-solar lighting and charging products.

Micro- and Minigrids
2.19 Microgrids and minigrids are a big step up on the energy access ladder from
pico-solar products and SHSs. Depending on the their capacity, microgrids and
minigrids can provide the means for use of appliances such as refrigerators, rice
cookers, and microwaves, and productive applications such as water pumping,
milling, grinding, and other forms of processing (see figures 1.1 and 1.2) . As
explained in section 1, microgrids and minigrids span a range of capacity and
technologies. Broadly for the purposes of the is study, microgrids are characterized
as ranging in capacity from 30 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts and can use a variety of
technologies, from simple diesel generators to hydropower, biomass, photovoltaic,
wind, or hybrid systems. Larger minigrids, typically from 500 kilowatts to 1
megawatt and above can provide sufficient power for a bundle of activities
consisting of water pumping, milling, grinding, and other forms of electricity
intensive process requirements.

2.20 The deployment of microgrids and minigrids comes in a variety of business
and financing models, each with their own risk profiles and financing structures.
While there are prominent examples of microgrid and minigrid project components
supported by the World Bank Group and in the private sector, scaling up of the

micro- and minigrids is at an early stage.16. One overriding benefit of minigrids is
that the cost to their customers is almost always lower than the monthly
expenditures made by these same customers before the minigrid arrives. However,
cost structures on a kWh basis are high, which in turn, requires high levels of
government and donor subsidies. To date, there has been no systematic study of
how the subsidies required by commercially viable minigrids compare with
subsidies for connecting new rural customers through traditional main grid
expansion.

2.21 Overall, the experience of the World Bank Group in the limited number of
projects with minigrid components indicates that to date, minigrid programs are not
yet scalable or replicable from country to country. Investors have been deterred as
in the case of Bangladesh (World Bank 2014a) and other countries which were
nonstarters in respect of micro- and minigrids because of the lack of a clear policy
and regulatory framework, especially for remunerative tariffs17. At the same time,
there are signs that some of the regulatory and policy impediments are now being
addressed. For example, in Africa explicit regulatory and policy framework for
mini- and microgrids have been adopted (Tanzania and Rwanda) or proposed
(Nigeria and Kenya). In all four countries, there are provisions for compensation
payments to minigrid owners when the main grid arrives.

2.22 The absence of or lack of clear communication about plans for grid expansion
in the medium term makes it difficult for investors to plan ahead. Experience shows
that off-grid electrification needs to be planned in coordination with the growth of
the grid, with some assurance of compensation for stranded assets in case of faster
grid expansion than anticipated. In addition, financing is a constraint: most
minigrids are not yet straightforward deals for commercial investors or lenders (IFC
2012). However, IFC’s review of business models for scaling up access concludes
that this subsector holds real potential and merits greater attention of operating
companies, policymakers and investors (IFC 2012). The World Bank / ESMAP in
response to these issues initiated a Global Facility on Mini-Grids to provide ground
level, “just in time” information for stakeholders and operational support to World

16Historically, China had tens of thousands of isolated minigrids before they were
connected to the main grid or phased out. Similar minigrids, numbering 12,000 to 16,000
operate in Myanmar, providing electricity at relatively high prices of about 40 to 75 US cents
per kWh.
17According to feedback provided by the World Bank’s Energy and Extractives Global
Practice, as of September 2016, a senior IDCOL official reported that 7 minigrids are in
operation and that IDCOL expects to finance a total of 50 minigrids by the end of 2018. This
seems to be attributable to a much clearer regulatory and subsidy policy framework.

Bank task teams. Since the Global Facility became operational only late 2015, it is still
too early to know how it will perform.

2.23 Sri Lanka has used its micro- and small hydro potential to augment the
supply situation in rural and isolated areas (Chowdhury et al. 2015) and has
integrated it in a planned way with the grid as it gradually spread across most of the
country. Between 1997 and 2011, 268 village hydro projects were created in Sri
Lanka, an effort that was supported by the World Bank’s Energy Service Delivery
Project18 and Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project.19 These
are very small, microhydro installations with typical average installed generating
capacities of 3–50 kilowatts, usually serving from 20 to 80 households. The facilities
are owned and operated by community organizations known as Village Electricity
Consumer Societies. The owner and operator of a Village Electricity Consumer
Society is a community organization rather than a private business person. Rather
than simply relying on villages to create village hydro projects on their own
initiative, the government sought developers to promote the village hydro projects
and advise the community organizations. About 20 private engineering consultants
and nongovernmental organizations received payments of about US$8,000 for each
successful village hydro project that they promoted (Tenenbaum et al. 2014). Many
community-owned schemes have been taken over by entrepreneurial members,
resulting in efficiency improvements (World Bank 2014c).

2.24 Over the past several years, the grid system of the national utility, Ceylon
Electricity Board has reached about 70 of these previously isolated villages. In most
instances, the households closest to these new grid facilities left the Village
Electricity Consumer Society and chose to become Ceylon Electricity Board
customers. Connecting to the Ceylon Electricity Board is more attractive because of
better quality and reliability of electricity supply and comes with a subsidized
national lifeline tariff (2.5–3.0 cents/kilowatt versus the typical 25 cents/kilowatt
that they were paying as members of the Village Electricity Consumer Society;
Tenenbaum et al. 2014). Several village systems have been connected to the Ceylon
Electricity Board grid under a net-metering scheme.20 Smaller systems connected to
the grid can sell power to the utility at an agreed tariff that is higher than under net-
metering. This is a win-win situation for the village-communities that have invested

money and sweat equity into their off-grid systems because they can now benefit
from the reliability of the national grid while continuing to earn revenues from the
sale of electricity generated by their village hydro schemes back to the utility at an
agreed tariff. Hence the microgrids developed by the Village Electricity Consumer
Societies provided a useful transitional supply of electricity to isolated villages
before the arrival of the Ceylon Electricity Board grid.

2.25 The World Bank Group supported minigrids on a significant scale in a few
countries (Nepal, Sri Lanka, Mali, and Cambodia). Other relatively smaller efforts
were made in Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Efforts are underway or were
recently completed in Tanzania for a larger-scale off-grid program, leveraging
private sector resources and promoting small-scale power projects.21

2.26 A full list of World Bank and IFC projects and investments that that were
approved or closed during FY2000–16 is presented in appendix C. A more detailed
discussion of the World Bank Group’s efforts in off-grid electrification is presented
in appendix D.22


Productive Uses and Welfare Outcomes
2.27 The use of off-grid electrification is mostly dedicated to lighting, comfort,
entertainment, and communication (IEG 2015). In principle, combining off-grid
projects with interventions to promote local productive uses of electricity is expected
to catalyze economic activity and improve incomes, especially from microgrids and
minigrids, but there is little systematic evidence of this in the literature. Impact
studies of World Bank projects and others are inconclusive in terms of degree and
direction (positive or negative) of the welfare effects, although they identify a
variety of benefits, such as income, health, education, gender equality and equity,
communication, and environment (Pueyo et al. 2013; Pueyo and Hanna 2015; Rao,
Agarwal, and Wood 2016; Wilcox et al. 2015).

2.28 A systematic review of the welfare impacts of electricity access carried out as
part of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) 2015 study on electricity access
covered 32 impact evaluations, including 8 for off-grid provision of electricity
comprising six cases of SHSs and two with minihydro schemes (including five

associated with World Bank projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, India, and Vietnam). The
results broadly showed that access to electricity, including from off-grid
electrification sources, has a positive influence on school enrollment, years of
schooling, and children’s study time at home. Two studies show significant effect of
electricity access on fertility reduction, whereas one other study found no effect.
Very few studies measured the impact of electricity access on health. The evidence
base for the impact of electricity access on microenterprise profits is also thin.
Regarding household income, electricity access is found to have a positive effect on
total income as well as nonfarm income. No overall impact on the number of hours
worked was observed. The systematic review stressed that a bigger evidence base is
needed to better understand the extent and magnitude of these links.

2.29 This study notes that 28 projects out of the 83 World Bank Group projects
with off-grid electrification objectives or components planned to address productive
uses or income-generating activities. Of these 28 projects, 20 actually implemented
some of these planned activities, but there is no systematic evidence from these
efforts. Out of the 82 project, 34 addressed cross-sectoral linkages by providing
electricity access to schools, clinics, agricultural processing, mobile charging, and
other livelihood activities, as well as to contribute to addressing climate change
issues (see appendix C for further information).


3. Off-Grid Electrification Planning and
Implementation: “The Next Generation”
3.1    Historically, off-grid electrification has been used for covering remote areas
that were effectively out of reach of the grid, or for pre-electrification in areas where
the grid was not likely to reach in the short or medium term. In instances and at
points in time when and where grid rollout advance stalled or slowed, off-grid
delivery has been scaled up opportunistically by market agents. However, over the
years, with steady improvements in renewable technology performance and costs,
off-grid electrification has shown the potential to be competitive for broader use in
other areas well. The preceding sections 1 and 2 provide evidence of the potential for
off-grid electrification to be implemented as a mainstream component of broader
national efforts to increase electricity access.

3.2   In country situations where the grid rollout was or is advancing per
scheduled plan but large segments of potential beneficiaries of grid access face
extended wait times, there are instances of governments deploying a strategy (which
may be termed ex ante planned pre-electrification) for efficiently and effectively



                                           20
coordinating the advance of the grid geospatially and in time with off-grid
electrification. This is backed by policy to effectively address the issues of retiring
off-grid assets when grid service becomes a reality in those locations. This section
highlights several country examples that embody the “next generation” of off-grid
electrification strategic planning and implementation staging.

3.3     It is also noteworthy that good practice national electrification programs for
achieving universal electricity access—even those well under way before launch of
the Sustainable Energy for All initiative in 2013—reflect this strategy in their
respective national geospatial least-cost access rollout program plans, capturing the
synergies and dynamic complementarity between grid and off-grid rollout in space
(geospatially) and time. They have strategically and systematically deployed off-grid
access delivery, as circumstances warranted, across locations and time, both in a pre-
electrification mode as well as otherwise.

3.4    A key takeaway from these experiences is that the starting point and sound
basis for any off-grid access scale-up program staging and design is first preparing a
comprehensive and analytically sound geospatial least-cost national electrification
program plan, irrespective of staging of the grid rollout implementation, which
depends on readiness along certain key dimensions.


Off-Grid Electrification and Implementation: “The Next Generation” of
transformational programs
3.5    Space and time coordinated grid and off-grid rollout implementation (guided
by a comprehensive least cost geospatial plan and roadmap for implementing
universal access nationwide) enabled by sector viability – institutional and financial
framework – are hallmarks of the next generation of national electrification
programs to achieve universal access efficiently and fast. The following highlights
of the ongoing experiences of Rwanda, Kenya, and Myanmar typify these features.

3.6    Rwanda and Kenya, both low-income countries, launched comprehensive,
nationwide programs starting around 2008/2009, to achieve universal access by
2030. Both national electrification programs are grounded in a rollout strategy with a
roadmap for achieving universal access. Implementation has progressed
systematically and efficiently, and in a staged, and coordinated grid and off-grid
rollout. Both countries are well ahead of the original plan targets in terms of
monitored results on the ground.

3.7   Although both programs are naturally “home-grown” in their respective
design features and supporting institutional framework, each program reflects the


                                           21
core organizing principles and strategic drivers across the large and diverse
spectrum of best practice country contexts and experiences highlighted in IEG’s 2015
electricity access report; for example, Thailand, Tunisia, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Vietnam, and Morocco. In their own manner, the Rwanda and Kenya
programs share with this diverse set of countries, the four key dimensions and
characteristics that typify transformational programs for achieving universal access:
developmental relevance, depth of change from the program as result, scale of
change (large scale impact and widespread), and sustainability.23

3.8     The Kenya and Rwanda programs present a major break from their past
modus operandi, which were typified by fragmentation, piecemeal electrification
activities and initiatives, and scattered projects now and then. Rather than being
aligned and contributing to national priority–set targets, many of these activities
reflected donor priorities and interests; for example, rural electrification, slum
electrification, intensification of connections in selected areas, and off-grid, small-
scale new renewable energy for poverty alleviation. Coordination among these
numerous well-intentioned if not always suitably designed initiatives was weak,
and they do not add up for significant impact. The current approach of the two
countries, with a comprehensive and programmatic institutional and investment
financing framework shares the essential features of the good practice country
programs worldwide in earlier years even before the Sustainable Energy for All
initiative was launched.

3.9    Rwanda and Kenya, both low-income countries have mainstreamed
planning, programmatic financing and implementation of comprehensive and
coordinated grid and off-grid rollout programs to systematically scale up towards
universal access, with aggressive intermediate targets. A key driver of the positive
and encouraging experience and results from these programs was the government’s
ownership, early commitment, and persistent follow-through on the enabling
actions established in Investment Financing Prospectuses. Each program is anchored
by a least-cost geospatial national electrification rollout plan for grid and
coordinated off-grid development for universal access by 2030; exemplifying best
practice.

3.10 The World Bank’s engagements began in 2007 for Kenya and 2008 for
Rwanda. The first major step for each was preparation of a national geospatial
access rollout plan that combined geographic, demographic, and technical
parameters to scale up access in a least-cost and time-bound manner. Geographic
information system (GIS)-based platforms have proved to be powerful planning

23   World Bank. 2016.



                                            22
tools for grid/off-grid national rollouts to meet time-bound targets. Experience
confirms their easy understandability and appeal to effectively rally and shape
broad consensus across the entire range of key sector institutions and stakeholders
that such national programs need to mobilize for efficient, fast implementation. The
geospatial plans have also been effectively used by the governments to syndicate
large-scale financing on a programmatic basis and organize the diverse spectrum of
stakeholders working together toward achieving universal access.

3.11 Spatial planning helps identify the “footprint” of the areas in which MV grid
extensions that will enable downstream LV reticulation and achieving connection
targets indicated in each planned state of the grid year by year as the country moves
to universal access by 2030. All social institutions falling within the shaded
planning cells are earmarked for grid connection. The remaining social institutions
targeted for electricity supply are shown by distinct symbols in the box figure (Box
3.1) and will be equipped with solar PV units. These results can be achieved by
progressively extending the medium voltage network and by concentrating initially
on increasing the number of connections within the areas already reached by the
MV network. Given the high population density in the country, the plan shows that
most areas can expect to be connected to the national grid. However, in some areas,
local mini-grids based on micro-hydro and solar PV systems will continue to be
efficient for some time.

3.12 The geospatial planning platform captures a national development
perspective across all sectors (health, education, administrative centers) and all
households (urban, peri-urban, rural, and deep rural) and is not restricted to a “rural
electrification project here and there” planning framework. The GIS data layers
support the high level spatial network planning platform algorithm and
postprocessor results processing of the least cost grid and off-grid plan; and can be
updated readily.

3.13 The Bank’s engagements began in 2008 for Kenya and 2009 for Rwanda. The
first major step for each was preparation of a national geospatial access rollout plan
that combined geographic, demographic, and technical parameters to scale up
access in a least-cost and time-bound manner. The plan addressed equity and shared
prosperity considerations through policies for keeping connections charges
affordable for the poor. A substantial off-grid program gave priority to connecting
public facilities (schools, clinics, primary health centers, and administrative centers)
so that developmental effects could be spread out even ahead of the progress on
household connections (box 3.1). The plans were funded by the Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program as knowledge products that would be translated
into operations.

Box 3.1. Rwanda Geospatial National Electrification Rollout Plan and Investment Financing
Rwanda is among the first countries to prepare and implement a nationwide
electrification program combining grid and off-grid means based on a systematic
and least-cost plan aided by geographic information system mapping techniques
that combine technical, economic, demographic, and demand and supply data.
The rollout plan can be updated with new information and offers several
advantages over traditional electrification master plans.

        Geospatial planning is easier to visualize for all stakeholders and can rally
         financial participation. As experienced in Rwanda and Kenya, (and recently
         Myanmar), the geospatial plan effectively anchors a “prospectus” for large
         and diverse groups of national and international stakeholders to coordinate
         and commit to an adequate and sustainable financing package.
        The geospatial plan captures a comprehensive national development
         perspective across all sectors (health, education, administrative centers) and
         all households (urban, peri-urban, rural, and deep rural) and is not
         restricted to a ‘rural electrification project here and there’ planning
         framework. Geospatial planning helps identify the areas where off-grid
         access delivery options can potentially make the highest impact in the
         overall national plan for achieving universal access.
Note: Modest cost and ability to make frequent updates make geographic information systems a dynamic planning
platform capable of undertaking rapid updates reflecting changes in key parameters. The comprehensive geospatial
plans (coupled with a prospectus) for Rwanda and Kenya each cost about US$1 million and took one year to prepare.
They better capture the ever-changing situation (growing grid extensions, changing demand and affordability, equipment
costs) to inform the implementation process. By contrast, classic electrification master plan studies take two to three
years, cost more than $2 million to prepare, and are based on a static framework that is not readily updated.

3.14 As part of the process, each country prepared a prospectus detailing the
national electrification rollout plan. The prospectus stated the governments’
commitments to sector policies and regulations for ensuring the financial viability of
the sector and service providers. It also specified the financing requirements for each
element of the program—generation, transmission and distribution, off-grid
facilities, and others—in a phased manner for the next 15 years. These prospectuses
were presented to donor groups in 2009 for Rwanda and 2010 for Kenya.

3.15 After the prospectus was prepared, the government of each country led a
donor financing roundtable inviting all stakeholders and interested donors for
syndication of the investment and technical assistance financing requirements of the
comprehensive first five-year implementation program (2009–2014). The tables 3.1
and 3.2 below summarize the donor pledges, which are broadly allocated as follows:

         Off-grid program co-financing. These are financed 100 percent by the
          government and donors: capital cost (US$80 million) plus technical assistance
          (~US$10 million).

         Grid program co-financing. Financing is 10 percent each from utility and
          new customer connection charges, and the remaining 80 percent is split
          evenly between government and development partner contributions.

3.16 Rwanda implementation track record (2009–2015). Within a short time from
program rollout initiation in 2009, Rwanda’s national utility has displayed
impressive growth for both grid and off-grid access in a coordinated manner guided
at the strategic level by its comprehensive national geospatial least-cost rollout plan:

3.17 Grid connections. Grid connections showed impressive growth that has so
far exceeded original targets.

        Year-end 2015 grid access was reported at 22 percent (563,000 national utility
         grid-connected customers, compared with about 6 percent access at program
         start in 2008 and 2009 (~110,000 customers).24

        In 2015, the marginal new connection rate on the grid established a new peak
         and exceeded 150,000 connections per year, compared with the program start




24Rwanda’s population in 2015 is reported to be about 12 million. Intermediate access
statistics in selected intervening years are as follows: 2012, access 14 percent (332,000
customer accounts) and a marginal connection rate of about 80,000 per year; 2014, access
22 percent (458,000 customer accounts) and a marginal connection rate of about 150,000 per
year.


                                                    26
         rate of about 30,000 per year (and a preprogram rate of less than 5,000 per
         year).25

        Assuming that the on-grid connection rates are maintained at 150,000 per year,
         with other conditions remaining the same, the projected national access rate
         would be as follows: year 2020 (>60 percent); year 2025 (>80 percent); and
         universal access by or before 2030 (assuming a population of about 15 million
         by then).

3.18 Off-grid connections. Under the national rollout plan, all schools,
administrative centers, health centers and hospitals across the country were
expected to be covered either by grid or off-grid means by 2016. This appears to
have been achieved early, with off-grid access accounting for a significant share,
which may decrease in the coming years as the grid catches up in these areas (table
3.3)

Micro- or minigrids: With respect to off-grid access, led mainly by the private
sector, (coupled with capital subsidy in some instances), the recent developments
are as follows:

            Pico-solar lighting and cell phone charging products. Over 11,000
             products (one per household) were sold, (equivalent to about 17,000 watt
             peak) in only four months.



25Over this time, the national utility has substantially reduced unit connection costs to
US$742 per connection in 2015, which is lower than the performance indicator target of
approximately US$1,000 per connection agreed to at the start of the program with the
government and donor financiers (and a preprogram costs of about US$3,000 per
connection).


                                                     27
             Micro- or minihydro projects. There are two microhydro projects (in
              aggregate, about 700 kilowatts) and one minihydro project (3.9
              megawatts) that are all bankable and advancing well toward
              implementation for power sale to the national utility grid.

             Active pipeline. Additionally, micro- and minihydro sites (in aggregate,
              about 5 megawatts total) are under various stages of feasibility study and
              advancing toward financial closure with technical assistance financed by a
              Bank project.

3.19 Kenya’s experience parallels that of Rwanda, with and Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program–funded technical assistance in 2008–09 supporting
a comprehensive geospatial least-cost rollout plan to anchor a strategic roadmap for
systematically staging a coordinated grid and off-grid program to achieve universal
access. This involved intermediate targets differentiated for households, education
and health sector facilities and priority administrative locations and centers. This
plan anchored the first investment financing prospectus to rally all stakeholders and
interested donors for funding the projected investment financing gap for both grid
and off-grid electrification for the first five years of implementation (2010–2014).

3.20 Grid connections: Within a very short time from program rollout initiation
(2009), Kenya’s national utility, KPLC, has blazed a noteworthy and impressive
record of overall progress in access scale-up implementation achieved in the field.
This was guided at the strategic level by the comprehensive national geospatial
least-cost rollout plan developed at the outset and since updated for the grid
program:

         The national access rate based on-grid connections is about 32 percent in
          2015.26 Over the most recent five-year period (FY2009/10–FY2014/15), KPLC
          connected just under 2 million new customers, more than doubling the base
          of about 1.5 million customer accounts in FY2009/10. A further 1.5 million
          Kenyans gained access to basic power from the off-grid private market for T1
          and T2 access highlighted earlier. (World Bank 2016)

         Although the average annual implementation rate of new connections on-
          grid over the past five years is about 370,000 per year, the marginal rate in
          FY2014/15 was about 500,000 connections, and the rate is projected to rise
          well above that figure in the future.




26   With an estimated national population of about 44 million in FY2013/14.


                                               28
3.21 Off-grid access: Two broad demographic segments with very distinct
characteristics and challenges can be identified in the country. The remote areas of
the country have a population of about 7.3 million (out of the present national
population of about 45 million) spread cross 13 counties in the northern areas. Here,
access stands at 7 percent, or about 540,000 households. Aggressive and sustained
efforts are under way to georeference map the population clusters across the entire
northern region, as well their settlement patterns within, and systematically and
comprehensively identify the effective options for scaling up access to the tier 1 and
tier 2 segments as well as micro- and minigrid networks where appropriate.

3.22 In the rest of country, where the overwhelming majority of Kenya’s
population is concentrated, over 2 million quality-certified pico-solar products, and
increasingly SHSs, have been sold since 2008, which represents over 25 percent of all
quality-verified product sales in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 3.1). In this segment,
private sector players in Kenya have been successful in developing a robust,
commercially self-standing market for solar products and services—the strongest in
Africa. They have developed innovative business models and efficient supply
channels for cash sales of portable lanterns and locally assembled SHSs.
Furthermore, they have also pioneered the rollout of innovative technological
approaches such as pay-as-you-go, which enables customers to pay for their solar
products in affordable monthly increments, often paying via mobile money. Local
financial institutions are actively supporting the sector by providing loans to actors
across the value chain.

3.23 Myanmar recently (September 2015), launched its National Electrification
Plan to achieve universal electricity access by 2030, supported by an International
Development Association credit of US$400 million for implementation over the
initial five years (FY2016–22). In the long run, systematic extension of the national
grid system is expected to reach over 95 percent of the population as a least-cost
solution. The off-grid component has an allocation of US$80 million investment for
remote area communities of the country; identified under National Electrification
Plan as those townships, villages, and households located farther than 11 miles from
the national grid and unlikely to be reached by the grid for at least the next 10 years.
These are targeted for pre-electrification by identifying the appropriate system(s)
options: SHSs and minigrid systems. Additionally, the off-grid component of the
National Electrification Plan targets public institutions (schools, rural health centers,
and religious buildings). Private sector agents—suppliers, contractors, delivery
chain management, and project developers—are expected to play a significant and
varying role in providing the products, services, materials, construction activities,
and operations.

3.24 The Ministry of Land, Fisheries, and Rural Development is vested with the
overall responsibility for orchestrating the off-grid component. This covers the
functions of detailed operational planning; technoeconomic financial assessment of
options, standards, and procurement; and overall program management and regular
coordination with counterparts responsible for grid rollout operationally. To this
end, the International Development Association credit provides for US$10 million
technical assistance to the ministry.

3.25 With respect to the off-grid market for pre-electrification, initial market
assessments undertaken by Lighting Global indicate that the potential commercial
off-grid market for solar photovoltaic products is approximately 8 million
households in the central zone, which is home to 75 percent of the national
population, with a commercial market economic potential of 4 to 5 million
households. In addition, remote areas also represent potential for solar products and
systems, but the market development costs and associated risks are judged to be
much higher.


A National Roadmap for Universal Access Effectively Navigated: Morocco
3.26 Morocco National Rural Electrification Program. By 1995, most of the urban
population of Morocco—representing about half of the national population of about
26 million at the time—had been electrified by the government-owned National
Office of Electricity via the national vertically integrated utility, ONE. In rural areas,



                                            30
the picture was not so bright, with only 18 percent access and over 80 percent of
villages not electrified. In 1996, the government launched the Global Rural
Electrification Program. In 15 years, over 42,000 rural villages and 2.1 million
households (about 13 million people), representing about 99 percent of the rural area
population, were provided electricity access, which was comparable in parity to
overall national access.

3.27 Investment financing for this effort was shared across major stakeholder
groups, with their share and responsibilities evolving over the years. The
cumulative investment of the Global Rural Electrification Program from 1996 to 2009
is estimated at over €1.8 billion. Of this total investment amount, approximately
50 percent (US$ 1 billion) financing was syndicated across major international
financiers: Agence Française de Développement (24 percent), European Investment
Bank (18 percent), Islamic Development (15 percent), African Development Bank
(12 percent), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (11.5 percent), European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (6 percent), Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (5 percent), Kuwait Fund (4 percent), Oil for Development
(4 percent), and KfW Development Bank (0.5 percent). Significantly, there was no
World Bank Group engagement during this scale-up program. By 2009, consumers
had provided about 25 percent of total investment, municipalities and communities
provided about 20 percent (enabled by earmarked allocations sourced from value-
added tax receipts and municipal development fund allocations), and ONE
provided 55 percent. ONE’s share of total investment financing was split
approximately fifty-fifty with government borrowings, grants, and equity. These
funds were raised in four tranches over the 15 year period from 1996 to 2009 (Ettaik
2013; IsDB 2013; Nygaard and Dafrallah 2016).27

3.28 Morocco’s effort was from a home-grown plan, but it displayed international
best practice principles for many partners, one plan, and one implementer, and was
similar to earlier experiences in Tunisia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Lao PDR.

3.29 Factors driving Morocco’s access scale-up experience. A single
professionally competent implementation agent, the national utility ONE,
systematically orchestrated and effectively managed the process. Morocco’s access
scale-up was informed at the outset by an analytically sound, comprehensive plan
prepared by ONE that incorporated both grid and off-grid means in a least-cost

spatially optimized plan that was technologically neutral and took into account grid
extensions, minigrids, and SHSs.

3.30 At one time, the minigrids were supplied by microhydro (63 villages), wind
hybrids (2 villages), and diesel (12 villages). However, over time, these scattered
systems were phased out as the grid extensions advanced geospatially.
Additionally, in several instances, sociopolitical and regional balance and equity
considerations—coupled with aspirations of the communities involved for grid
service—resulted in grid extensions not identified as part of the least-cost plan.

3.31 At one time 105,000 SHSs, ranging in sizes from 50 watt peak up to 200 watt
peak, were competitively procured and installed on a fee-for-service basis.
Subsequently, consumers began to view SHSs a second-best solution because they
were more expensive at that time and, in the final analysis, did not provide the same
service as a grid connection. Under pressure, ONE expanded the grid extension
program and scaled back the size of the SHS program.


4. Strategic Implications for Moving Forward
4.1    The current rate of new connections in low-access countries averages about
2 million per year, almost all through grid extensions. In stark contrast, an annual
average implementation rate of about 15 million per year (about 100 million
beneficiaries per year) is required to achieve the Sustainable Energy for All target of
universal access by 2030. If low-access countries are to have an even chance of
providing at least basic services (lighting, cell phone charging, fan, and television) to
large sections of their population within a generation, off-grid electrification will
need to be mainstreamed in a big way into the national access rollout effort.

4.2     The mainstreaming of off-grid electrification has taken different routes in the
several countries where it has occurred on a significant scale. In Bangladesh, the
scaled-up solar home system (SHS) program in grid-proximate areas took hold as an
opportunistic market response to the then-stalled grid extension program. In Sri
Lanka, off-grid electrification (initially in the form of isolated village hydro-minigrid
networks) took place as staged pre-electrification on an ex ante spatial geography–
based plan until planned grid extensions arrived at those locations. In Rwanda and
Kenya, off-grid electrification is proceeding in an ex ante planned manner. In
Morocco, the process occurred earlier in a spatially planned, staged manner,
achieving 98.5 percent overall access, including in rural areas. Most recently,
Myanmar has laid out a conscious strategy of ex ante planned pre-electrification
utilizing an off-grid program promoting solar products, SHSs, and isolated minigrid



                                           32
networks as appropriate, which is integral to the country’s National Electrification
Program Roadmap and Investment prospectus.

4.3     Looking ahead, the recent program experiences that have mainstreamed the
scale up of off-grid access delivery, and related best practice developments
highlighted in earlier sections signal that some off-grid access scale up modalities
and market-based business models have come of age. No longer should a whole
generation of the population be forced to wait in the dark with limited or no choice,
forced to make do with grossly inferior and extremely high unit cost options to meet
their most basic energy service needs until the grid reaches them. The era of modern
electricity access services (pre-electrification) delivered by quality-certified solar-
powered products—from pico sizes to upward of 100watt peak—is within reach in
the short to medium term, to a very large portion of the 1 billion in the tier 1 and tier
2 market segments worldwide, and especially in low-access countries.

4.4     Fundamentally, this calls for seeing and thinking of off-grid electrification
roles differently—no longer as pilot or small components in access projects, nor as
the new answer to addressing the access scale-up challenge in entirety. From a
strategic, nationwide perspective, realizing the full potential of off-grid
electrification in each country-specific context calls for a comprehensive perspective
that can leverage the synergies of access expansion through both grid and off-grid
means in a coordinated manner in space and time.

4.5     The experience and good practices from countries—with World Bank support
or otherwise—yield several findings and lessons that are outlined here as
considerations to inform and tailor, for a given country context, potential modalities
for mainstreaming off-grid electrification within the overall national electrification
program. Such programs must take into account where, when, and in what
modalities off-grid electrification can play its most effective role within the context
of the institutional framework for achieving national goals of universal access in a
country context and the country’s “sector readiness” to do so.


Off-Grid Electrification: Framing the Key Strategic Questions Differently
PUT PEOPLE (BENEFICIARIES) FIRST, NOT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
4.6    The cumulative empirical evidence from worldwide best practice programs
indicates to the following:

      People want affordable, adequate, reliable access “yesterday.” From a
       personal as well as a social and national perspective, the costs of delay in
       providing even basic access are very high—tantamount to depriving another


                                             33
       generation of the benefits of modernized services, including education and
       health care services. Time is of the essence.
      Access to small quantities of modern electricity—sufficient to power basic
       modern lighting, cell phone charging, and a small radio or television—can
       trigger a giant step for those without access. The United Nations Sustainable
       Energy for All Global Tracking Framework tier 1 and tier 2 market segments
       typify this first, hugely transformative step of demand for basic access.
      Significantly, over time, peoples’ expectations tend to grow, and almost all
       aspire to electricity access comparable in adequacy, quality, and reliability
       that is typical of a well-managed utility-run grid system.
      In light of the above, A National Roadmap for achieving universal access
       (“electricity for all”), irrespective of the area where they are located (for
       example, urban, including any slums; peri-urban; rural; or deep rural) needs
       to be based on spatially mapping where the people and settlements are
       located and identifying the best means to reach them in a staged manner
       based on techno-economic and equity considerations. This approach should
       also avoid or counter any tendencies toward “cherry picking” geographical
       service areas and/or beneficiaries, whether for grid or off-grid rollout, absent
       an effective plan to provide access to the excluded.

GRID VERSUS OFF-GRID: A FALSELY FRAMED BINARY CHOICE
4.7    The “grid versus off-grid” trade-off is not so much about competing
answers for the same question as about competing ways to frame the right
question. An important theme emerging from the good practice country experiences
with achieving universal access effectively, efficiently, sustainably, and at a good
speed (see section 3) is that grid and off-grid technologies and access service
delivery are not necessarily either-or options to be determined based simply on a
narrow least-cost calculus. Rather, looking ahead, off-grid access rollout provision is
appropriately viewed as playing a complementary role to coordinated
implementation alongside grid rollout in the process of achieving universal access.

4.8    “Staging” in a particular country’s context may constitute more than simply
looking at time and, inevitably, may also entail considerations that go well beyond
the techno-economic calculus of alternatives. The institutional framework and
enabling policy framework put in place by the government, and what constitutes
“electricity access” under its policy vision, is also crucial to take into account.

4.9    The scope and scale of off-grid electrification should be planned and
designed as appropriate in the country context and be influenced by the need to act
strategically from the outset in tailoring a country-specific program strategy design
and operational engagements. To realize the full potential of off-grid electrification


                                             34
in each country-specific context—taking into account scale, scope, geographic
coverage, and time—can benefit from an expanded perspective in the process of
designing country-specific roadmaps for access scale-up implementation.

4.10 This role of off-grid access rollout needs to be properly conceived and
designed into the overall sector strategy for achieving universal access, with due
consideration to least-cost and waiting time for access. There is a need to act
strategically from the outset in tailoring country-specific program strategy design
and operational engagements that are informed by a sound geospatial least-cost
nationwide rollout program plan—grid and off-grid—to achieve universal access by
the target year.

4.11 A key building block for anchoring the overall high-level roadmap plan for
reaching universal access is preparation of a nationwide geospatial coverage least-
cost plan for implementation that is periodically revised to reflect updated
circumstances and changes in key parameters of the underlying analytical platform.
It is not a central command and control tool or a “master plan.” Furthermore, it is an
essential frame of reference in terms of

      defining and monitoring target mandates and accountabilities of various
       agents and multisector institutions engaged in access rollout (such as
       departments of health and education, provincial and local government
       authorities, and water resources and supply)

      providing an essential and effective basis for coordinating implementation in
       space and time in the dynamically evolving grid-off-grid program; and

      signaling relevant and valuable information for private sector markets and
       agents interested in or engaged with some aspect of the electricity access
       business.

      Last but not least, as the country program examples in the preceding section
       highlight, a sound and comprehensive nationwide least-cost geospatial plan
       for implementation toward universal access (and the accompanying
       “bankable” investment financing prospectus it anchors) in effect serves as a
       fulcrum or central pivot point in an otherwise business-as-usual piecemeal
       jigsaw puzzle with many missing pieces. The plan rallies diverse stakeholder
       participation toward closer alignment to national time targets for access,
       crowding in new donors and guiding syndication of investment financing
       requirements on an ongoing and programmatically sustained basis.




                                          35
4.12 The manner in which this combination plays out during implementation
varies by country and is dynamic in space and over time. This may come about in
response to progress, or lack thereof, in the respective grid rollout and off-grid
rollout implementation in the field. Potential factors include evolving customer
expectations and aspirations for service standards, the sociopolitical policy
responses to those, and other real-time triggers. The specific circumstances and
factors that trigger and shape the moving frontiers of grid and off-grid rollout
advances—from the ex ante geospatial least-cost national electrification rollout
plan—will vary but are broadly seen in the following country experiences:

   Bangladesh: Grid rollout advance may slow down or in extreme cases stall at
   some point for an extended period of time and then restart later. Bangladesh’s
   pace-setting and best practice–establishing SHS rollout program typifies an
   instance of “ex post opportunistic” pre-electrification facilitated by deploying
   standardized, quality-certified SHS–based access delivery and related services to
   beneficiaries.

   Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka’s national spatial rollout plan for scaling up envisaged ex
   ante at some point that village small hydro–based off-grid network access
   schemes would be phased out when grid reach was operational at that location,
   and this was achieved. This typifies an instance of “ex ante pre-electrification”
   facilitated by deploying isolated minigrids.

   Morocco: SHS and isolated generation minigrid networks were identified ex ante
   under its nationwide comprehensive geospatial least-cost rollout plan for areas
   where grid extensions were not justifiable on technoeconomic calculus.

4.13 Off-grid can play a significant role in most low-access countries in the near
term. In many countries, grid rollout has yet to get under way. In others, it has
stalled or it advanced in starts and stops and at an unpredictable pace on account of
the state of one or more sector readiness conditions, such as governance,
institutional framework, weak capacity, long-term vision, targets, commitment and
sustained follow-through, lack of accountability, on-and-off rather than
programmatic finance, or not maintaining the commercial viability for the qualified
private sector agents engaging in the rollout. And in country contexts where the
main sector is functioning generally well and grid rollout implementation can be
advanced efficiently (for example, Rwanda, Kenya, Morocco, and the recently
launched project in Myanmar), off-grid electrification can make a major contribution
as well via ex ante planned pre-electrification.

PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR ENGAGEMENT: BOTH MUST PLAY THEIR DUE ROLES IN ENABLING AND
CATALYZING EFFICIENT AND RAPID SCALE-UP OF OFF-GRID ACCESS ROLLOUT FOR TIER 1 AND 2 MARKETS
4.14 In tracing the evolution of off-grid access delivery across the WBG portfolio
(sections 2 and 3) two noteworthy features are: (i) the evolving scope and roles of
the World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) engagements in
response to opportunity for maximizing the synergies resulting from their respective
strengths and comparative advantages in enabling early stage (“pre-market")
development, and (ii) assisting the client countries in designing the participation of
the private and public sectors working in close partnership, bringing their respective
natural roles and comparative strengths towards scaled-up delivery for realizing the
national goal of universal access efficiently and rapidly

4.15 Notably in Bangladesh, the World Bank played a key role by supporting
IDCOL, an autonomous government undertaking, in mentoring and promoting
private sector operators, NGOs, and microfinance institutions, resulting in rapid
scale-up of SHS penetration, based on a competitive business model. It has
supported mechanisms for product quality assurance and starter market capital
subsidies; typically towards financing the soft program costs, and directed towards
lowering the high initial costs typical – such as extending service dealer chains,
building capacity – costs not fully recoverable in market prices for the solar home
systems, at early stage of development. Further, , Lighting Africa which over time
focused on the Tier 1 starter market development, evolved into the Lighting Global
umbrella program of the World Bank Group with broadened market focus.
Specifically, the Lighting Global Program has engaged in design and preparation of
a substantial scale off-grid electrification program for Tier 1 and 2 beneficiary
segments; within the context of a national Road Map for achieving universal access;
aided by the spatial information provided by the nationwide geospatial least cost
plans funded by the World Bank and grid extension plan over time. The instances of
Kenya, Rwanda and Myanmar typify country cases where the World Bank assisted
the Government with preparation of the national least cost geospatial electrification
implementation plan for universal access by 2030 (grid and alongside coordinated in
space-time the off grid program scale up), and syndication of the investment
financing requirements orchestrated by the governments’ within a sector wide
organizing architecture and oversight process.

MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES OF A HIGH-LEVEL NETWORK PLANNING PLATFORM THAT IS ANCHORED IN A
GEOSPATIAL AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN COVERING GRID AND OFF-GRID MEANS
4.16 Providing access (in some form) to all households, clinics, and trading
centers—wherever they may be—requires identifying where the beneficiaries are
geolocated. This enables least-cost placement and expansion of existing electricity



                                             37
access infrastructure. Sound geospatial planning platforms that can be readily
updated to changes in key variables have been shown to provide a sound and
comprehensive analytical foundation for and dynamically coordinated strategic-
level rollout implementation of grid and off-grid growth in space and time. Such
planning therefore facilitates further detailing of design and rollout operationally.

4.17 The national geospatial least-cost strategic rollout plan serves to further
anchor and foster closer alignment of multiple and varied donor programs with
national priorities and targets, and to effect harmonization across donor programs. It
also facilitates and directs their financing support (called syndication) of the
investment prospectus on-grid or off-grid and in space and time (for further details,
see the following section).

SECTORWIDE ORGANIZING ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRAMMATIC FINANCING SHOWS PROMISE
In their own home grown manner, the good practice transformational national
programs for implementing electricity access scale (identified earlier), have adapted
in essence a sector-wide organizing architecture, comprehensive nationwide geospatial least
cost rollout plan, and programmatic financing framework. Their respective successes
serve to highlight the effectiveness and multiple ranging benefits of such a
framework for efficiently and rapidly advancing along a roadmap to achieve
universal access in a timely manner. Specifically, the sector wide investment
prospectus for grid and off-grid expansion would be anchored by the nationwide
least cost geospatial rollout plan to achieve the time-bound targets set by
Government on grid and off-grid, and updated regularly; and the enabling policy
and institutional framework also in place. Such a framework and process,
transparently and effectively facilitate: closer alignment of individual Donor
program designs with national priorities than otherwise; syndication of the
investment financing requirements (public sector portion) of an integrated grid and
off grid rollout implementation, on a rolling five year horizon programmatic basis,
and; facilitate timely and appropriate course corrections along the way should
circumstances and implementation progress in meeting planned access targets on-
grid and off-grid deviates significantly from expectations.

 Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences
 in Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector
 Efforts
1. Bolivia

The World Bank has been supporting off grids electricity access with the solar home
system (SHS) and pico-solar photovoltaic (PV) through the Decentralized
Infrastructure for Rural Transformation Project (IDTR, P073367, FY2003–11)28,
Decentralized Electricity for Universal Access Project (EDAU, P102479, FY2008–13)
and ongoing IDTR2 which was renamed Access and Renewable Energy Project
(IDTR2, P127837, FY2014-). The IDTR and EADU achieved the total number of both
project’ combined installation of SHS and pivo-PV equivalent of about 2.7 percent of
rural households in 2012.29 If the IDTR2 achieves the target number of SHS and pico-
photovoltaic installation set at the project appraisal, the total of the IDTR and IDTR2
and EADU’s SHS and pico-photovoltaic installation would be an equivalent of
4.5 percent of total rural households in 2012.30 In Bolivia, 72.5 percent of the rural
population had access to electricity, whereas 90.5 percent of the total population and
99.2 percent of the urban population had access to electricity in 2012 (IEA and World
Bank 2015).

The IDTR and EDAU used the output-based approach (OBA) with the medium-term
service contracts (MSC).31 However, under IDTR , the upfront payment required for
the SHS users was not able to reach to the poorest of the poor and additional
financial support was required. The EADU introduced a pilot pico-PV delivery to
the very poor population who could not afford to the subsidized SHS and
demonstrated the pilot success. Sustainability of the SHS and pico-PV was a
challenge in ensuring the long-term after-sales service, maintenance and

28 The IDTR originally was multisectoal nature including the information and
communication technologies (ICT) (i.e., cellular phones) and electrification, but the ICT was
mostly dropped due to the procurement issues, and the multisectoral approach including
two ministries were complicated (although at the time of preparation, multisectoral projects
were being supported by the Bank) (World Bank 2011).
29 Based on the 2012 data of IEA and World Bank 2015.
30 Based on the 2012 data of IEA and World Bank 2015.
31 Under this hybrid approach combining the fee for service approach and the dealer

approach, known as Medium Term Service Contracts (MCS), subsidies were provided in
return for obligations extending over a number of years to provide service and spare parts.

replacement after the end of the MSC the contracts were found to be too short for the
project period to have sufficient maintenance and service period. SHS supply under
IDTR was combined with improved cookstoves implemented by another
development agency. This collaboration was not designed at the project appraisal,
but resulted in improved incentive for households to adopt SHS and cookstoves
benefiting women (World Bank 2011b). The IDTR 2 was designed based on the
experiences of IDTR1 and EDAU, with much longer project period of seven years
than IDTR1 and EADU, which required closing date extensions for 3.5 years and
three years, respectively partly due to procurement delay and the learning
experience that the contractors would need to be familiar with the local situations.

2. Cambodia

World Bank was a major player in supporting Cambodia in grid integration and
capacity building of private off-grid rural electricity enterprises (REEs) and solar
home systems (SHS) in off-grid rural areas with rural electrification fund (REF) that
was introduced by World Bank Cambodia Rural Electrification and Transmission
Project (RETP, P064844, FY2004–12). These REEs emerged with their own private
funding due to the very limited grid extension after the civil war (1971–75) and the
Pol Pot regime (1975–79). RETP’s total off-grid connections included 62,093
households, of which 50,000 by REEs and 12,093 SHS. However, since 155 REEs had
been connected to the grid by the end of the project in January 2012 (World Bank
2012a), some of these 50,000 households with REEs connections might not be off-
grid anymore and grid connected. Around the time that the RETP started, licensed
rural consumers were 26,099 or 11 percent of total licensed consumers32. Around the
closing of the RETP, in 2011, the number of customers in isolated system was 100,832
or 12.4 percent of total licensed customers (EAC 2012), of which 62,093 (62 percent)
could be attributed to the RETP. In 2014, this customer number was reduced to
28,475 or 2 percent of total licensed customers, which was much less than RETP’s
off-grid household connections of total 62,093 (EAC 2015). Therefore, it was not clear
if this number include SHS because the RETP has installed 12,093 SHS and the after
the RETP, the REF installed another 4,000 SHS in 2014. This meant out of 28,475
household connections in isolated grid areas, 57 percent of households were using
SHS. Otherwise, many of the customers of isolated grid moved to on-grid from 2011
to 2014.

REEs’ daily service hours rose from four hours at the project appraisal to 12 hours
by the project closing, exceeded the RETP target of eight hours with 54 percent of

32
  The 2003 Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) annual report (EAC 2003) did not have a
category of isolated system customer, but the rural consumer category appeared to be relevant to
isolate system customer.


                                                 66
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

REEs provided 24 hour service at the project closing (World Bank 2012a). Minigrids
system loss was 31 percent in 2003 (rural areas) (EAC 2004), and 19 percent in both
2011 and 2014 (EAC 2012 and 2015). An attractive tariff system by the Electricity
Authority of Cambodia (EAC) helped the development of the licensed REE model.
However REEs provided rather poor quality service (IED 2013). However, these
REEs’ services quality has improved and many of them provided power 24 hours
daily as of 2014 (EAC 2015).

The original design of SHS delivery mechanism of RETP was OBA subsidy but
similar to Bolivia IDTR experience, it was not affordable for the consumers to pay
that upfront cash. Therefore, it was changed to use the hire-purchase delivery
mechanism based on the World Bank Lao PDR Rural Electrification Project (REP) 1
and 2 and the RETP achieved SHS installation target accordingly. While the REEs
needed funding to upgrade the technical standards and revenue management
system that were consistent with those of the national grid that REEs could
interconnect and get integrated, the RETP’s REF did not provide this kind of
funding. After the RETP closure, the REF moved on to include additional programs
such as guarantee and loan for REEs to improve their infrastructure so that they
could upgrade their technical standards and revenue management and improve
other aspects of REEs, and a Power to Poor program similar to that supported by the
World Bank Lao REP 1 and 2.

As of February 2016, about 56 percent of households had access to electricity
(Cambodia Daily 2016). But neither the government-owned Electricité du Cambodge
(EDC) nor REEs had funding and capacity to electrify the rest of households to
achieve the national target of 70 percent electrification by 2030. Almost all off-grid
were diesel based generation and there was no specific government support and
enabling environment to promote renewable energy based off grids except SHS. The
decision to reduce grid supply tariff rates in 2015 further weakened the green
minigrid potential as renewable energy based minigrid could not compete with the
prevailing grid supply tariff. The government stopped approval of diesel minigrids
due to the increased disparity between the off-grid diesel tariff and the grid supply
tariff. Therefore, going forward, in addition to the existing renewable energy policy,
more specific legal, regulatory and institutional framework to promote renewable
energy would be needed.

3. China

The World Bank China Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP) (P046829,
FY1999–08) was successful in promoting the rapid growth of a sustainable off-grid
PV market in China, which focused on supply side quality and product
development with innovative performance- and output-based subsides and grants
that were cost shared by the subsidy recipients thereby ensured ownership. The

             Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in

project could have achieved even higher sales volumes had there not been any
market inroads by highly subsidized government and donor PV projects (IEG 2010
and World Bank 2010a). More than 2 million people in western China were provided
electricity service through the project. The REDP installed PV capacity of
11.1megawattp, exceeded the target of 10megawatt. The total installed capacity of
PV in China was estimated to be 80megawattp at that time. Although the PV
systems could have turned over during the project years (that is, some users
abandoned or by new SHS, etc.), The REDP contributed an equivalent of
13.8 percent of the PV installed in China. The REDP provided some technical
assistance (TA) for the Chinese government’s renewable energy based off-grid
electrification programs, such as Brightness Program, etc. The Golden Sun Program
was started under the REDP and it supported the adoption of the Photovoltaic
Global Approval Program (PVGAP) program in China and its implementation. The
REDP’s Golden Sun Quality Mark was awarded to qualifying products and it
continued beyond the REDP until the market for off-grid solar declined due to
market saturation. The importance of solar quality and setting up quality standards
and testing protocols was initiated through the REDP. The REDP PV specifications
for off-grid PV components were eventually adopted as their national standards.
Beneficiary surveys of REDP PV users in selected provinces were positive in general
but energy stacking remained as they continues to use other fuels (for example,
kerosene, candle, ghee light and dry cells) as well as solar home system.

However, the REDP was not the only one that led to the leadership position that
China had in large-scale PV as of 2016.33 For example, some financing was available
even without the REDP support. At the mid term of the REDP implantation,
technology improvement (TI) companies under the REDP invested at least
$187 million (from their own resources or bank loans), which was over 12 times the
amount originally targeted by the REDP to finance (World Bank 2009). The PV
companies also succeeded in accessing private financing to support sales growth
and investments. After improvements in management, business skills and financial
systems, some companies received access to commercial bank credits and financial
support of other institutions. However, consumer financing remained difficult,
which was out of the scope of the REDP. While the overall Chinese both off- and on-
grid electrification was very successful, some studies on the government’s off-grid
electrification programs in western China found that the general top-down
approach lacked attention to users’ needs, quality of services, operation and
maintenance, which would affect the sustainability (Zhang and Kumar 2011, Shyu
2013 and Niez 2010).

4. India

The major World Bank Group’s support to off grids in India were Renewable Energy
Resources Development Project (P010410, FY1993–01); Second Madhya Pradesh
District Poverty Initiatives Project (P102331, MDPDPI2, FY2009–15), and
International Finance Corporation’s support to Husk Power Systems (HPS) which is
a microgrids company and a solar company Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBIL) (2007),
IFC/GEF Photovoltaic Market Transformation Initiative (PVMTI) (1998–2010)
supported solar companies Selco India, Eskom-Shell Solar Home Systems, Shri
Shakti, SREI Infrastructure Finance, Ltd, Total and others, and Applied Solar
Technologies. There was also a technical assistance (TA) for Scaling up Deployment
of Renewable Energy Technology for Promoting Business Models (P119894, FY2011–
16). Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (P097985, FY2010-) does not
promote off-grid but extends main grid to off-grid areas in Sagar Islands, where
Renewable Energy Resources Development Project financed off-grid solar PV village
electrification. Decentralized Energy Systems, India (DESI Power) won a grant the
World Bank Global Development Marketplace Competition 200634.

The Renewable Energy Resources Development Project’s examples of off-grid sub
projects were Solar Lantern Leasing Program by a Savings Cooperatives, Sagar
Island Solar PV Village Electrification, and Solar PV Irrigation Pumps Leasing
(World Bank 2002a). At the completion of the project, all these off grids sub
components had positive economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and financial
internal rate of return (FIRR) except the isolated solar PV power station in village,
which was negative EIRR unless the global environmental benefits were included.

The Renewable Energy Resources Development Project contributed to the
development of renewable energy both on-grid and off-grid and capacity building
of IREDA. Commercial market development in solar PV was evidenced by : (i) the
large private sector-led manufacturing base; (ii) a competitive market where product
costs were among the lowest in the world; (iii) retail sales and service networks; and
(iv) emerging participation of financial intermediaries. IREDA became a mature
financing institution for renewable energy and energy efficiency. IREDA encouraged
other lenders to support renewable energy projects, including bank and nonbank
institutions -- in 1993, there was no funding for this type of project. The government
has changed its approach to renewable energy development from state -
administered to market-driven. India started to export wind and PV technology.
International joint ventures were fostered by the project requirement for competition
in procurement. Marketing and service delivery business models that IREDA helped

launch included renewable energy service companies; consumer retails of renewable
energy products and services; private power developers selling to captive
consumers, third parties and to State Electricity Boards (SEBs); consumer financing
by rural banks, saving and trading cooperatives, etc. The project helped identify
innovative approaches to addressing rural credit risks faced by PV energy
entrepreneurs thus opening avenues for renewable energy supply to penetrate the
rural market. Participation of cooperatives or micro/rural financing entities was a
key to making the systems accessible to rural/poor consumers (World Bank 2002a
and 2002b).

IREDA promoted businesses owned by women and scheduled tribes and castes as
evidenced by several women-owned businesses ( for example, Dastkar Society for
Crafts and Craftpeople (Gujarat), solar lantern leasing by self-help groups (Andhra
Pradesh), Sagar Solar Shop (Vadodara), and Prakritik Lighting & Urja Systems Ltd.,
perhaps the first woman-owned PV module manufacturer) (World Bank 2002a).

The off-grid experience of this Renewable Energy Resources Development Project
found the following (World Bank 2002a and 2002b). Adequate time was requried to
develop innovative projects and the market for renewable energy. A specialized
financial institution such as IREDA was essential at the beginning as new
technologies were commercialized, but for market growth, broader participation by
the financial sector was essential. Affordable financing accessible to rural consumers
was essential for selling PV products in rural areas. Delivering rural PV services
needed a partnership between key actors: rural financing institutions,
product/service suppliers and organized consumer groups. Assessment of land
acquisition as well as payment of compensation needed be completed prior to
commencement of civil works to avoid delays in project implementation. The
renewable energy program needed to be consistent with and embedded into the
plan for power sector reform and restructuring. Supportive and predictable policies
and regulatory framework were essential for market development. Tariffs and
power sales rules needed to be fair to all parties for sustainable development of the
sector. Careful attention needed to be paid to maximizing energy output rather than
installed capacity. Regular review and rationalization of subsidy policy was
necessary (World Bank 2002b).

The PVMTI added value to the emerging Indian PV market through incubating
innovative firms and business models. As an example, PVMTI directly supported a
start-up entrepreneur through an investment in SREI, a nonbank financial
intermediary to address two key issues facing the Indian solar PV industry,
namely, the lack of after-sales services and maintenance activities, and the lack of
rural credit mechanisms. SREI became one of the world’s largest rural electrification
entrepreneurs as of 2010. The entrepreneur, Enviro Energy India Ltd. (EEIL),

                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

received support from SREI to establish to establish a PV installation and service
business, eventually acquiring Shell Renewables India when it divested from rural
electrification projects in India and Sri Lanka. From the original hub in West Bengal,
EEIL expanded operations to Karnataka, Bihar, Jharkand and Orissa. As of 2010, the
business installed and serviced approximately 45,000 SHS (IFC 2010). Its experience
highlights the need for patience, particularly in a challenging solar PV market (IFC
2007). Selco, the first PV rural electricity installation and service provider in India,
was also supported by the PVMTI. With its focus on poorer segments of society and
quasi-commercial approach, Selco initially experienced many challenges relating
primarily to shortage of working capital, fluctuating market and PV equipment
supply constraints. The PVMTI helped the company through this tough phase by
restructuring and partially writing down the PVMTI loan and helped sort out bigger
corporate issues. The business attracted new equity to support its future business
growth of 2010.

The modest success of the PVMTI in India came from firms that had a preexisting
PV/renewable energy business dedicated to this line of business or one that creates
such a line rather than financial or other institutions who might have been offered
incentives to introduce PV financing or systems as a product or service (IFC 2010).
This success could be attributed, in large part, to the high population density in off-
grid areas, the existence of established solar PV companies, and the relatively
widespread knowledge about solar PV technology (IFC 2007).

Solar energy was one solution for the problem of erratic electricity supply in rural
areas that affected livelihood and education. The MPDPIP2 promoted the use of
solar energy for meeting household electricity needs through microgrids and multi-
utility centers in 81 and 42 villages respectively. Solar lanterns and solar mobile
stations were initiated in project districts. Solar lanterns were being used in 249
villages. (World Bank 2015g). A common solar charging station was developed and
a community member was trained to recharge the solar lamps provided to
villagers.35

IFC provided financing and advisoryadvisory support to HPS, that quickly scaled up
to serve 30,000 households, or about 200,000 people in four years with innovative
business model. Some highlights of HPS and DESI Power were discussed in the sub-

and on grids process and the enabling environment for the private sector, are still
much to be improved. The inconsistent subsidy systems between the on-grid and
off-grid, which unfairly lower the on-grid electricity tariff with lower quality and
reliability, distort the market and consumer choice.

5. Lao People’s Democratic Republic

The World Bank played a major role in supporting the Lao government to promote
off-grid, especially SHS under the public-private partnership (PPP) and developing
and ensuring regular updates of the rural electrification master plan to include both
off-grid and on-grid. As of December 2013, 87 percent of the total households were
electrified in Lao PDR (Pillai, 2014). Out of these electrified households, about
2 percent or 18,872 households were electrified by renewable energy based / hybrid
off-grid systems, of which 13,000 were SHSs (Pillai, 2014). The World Bank installed
total 22,763 SHSs36 excluding the withdrawn SHSs under the World Bank Lao PDR
Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project (SPRE) (P044973, FY1998–05), Rural
Electrification Phase I Project (REP1) of the Rural Electrification (APL) Program
(P075531, P080054, P119715, FY2006–12) and REP2 APL (P110978, P117177, FY2010–
15). Since some of these SHSs might have already been out of use, the estimated total
13,000 SHSs in Lao PDR in 2014 does not match the three projects’ contribution of
total 22,763 SHSs. The projects’ support to rural electrification master plan and
updates of the plan, which included both on-grid and off-grid had limited impacts
because actual electrification did not necessary follow the plan and some local
authorities were not aware of or followed the plan, which resulted in uncoordinated
off-grid and on-grid electrification that expanded more rapidly than expected.
Cream skimming and principal agent problems were experienced with the SHS
contractor Provincial Energy Service Companies (PESCOs). Going forward,
following would be needed: (i) improved incentives to PESCOs to target only poor
and other vulnerable people where the grid would not reach for the next 10 years or
so and improve the after-sales services and availability of spare and replacement
parts, (ii) buyback of withdrawal of reusable SHSs only; (iii) coordinated efforts with
other private players such as Sunlabob and other development partners to ensure
level playing fields and complementarity; (iv) improved sustainability of REF, (v)

36The Implementation Completion and Result Report (ICR) of REP1 noted that 5,000 SHS
purchased with Australian Government’s cofinancing under REP1 were being installed
under REP2 (World Bank 2013). REP2 ICR reported that the total number of SHSs to 11,758
but considering the funding from the Australian Agency for International Development for
5,000 SHSs from REP I, the effective prorated target achievement for IDA and local
contributions was 9,601 units or 96 percent (World Bank 2015). Hence, this reports included
11,758 SHS for REP2 since neither REP1 nor REP2 reported the SHS co-financed by
Australia.

ensuriing the regular updates of rural electrification master plan and the central and
local authorities follow the updates in planning and implementing off-grid and on-
grid access and (vi) development or improvement of the favorable policy, legal,
regulatory and institutional framework for off-grid promotion. These World Bank
projects hire-purchase scheme for SHS and Power to People scheme for grid
electrification were both adapted in the World Bank Rural Electrification and
Transmission Project in Cambodia.

6. Nepal
The World Bank Nepal Power Development Project (PDP) (P043311, P116190,
FY2003–14) was successful in Micro-Hydro Village Electrification (MHVE) that
66,174 households had electricity access under MHVE, slightly less the final revised
target of 74,000 but exceeded the original target of 30,000 (World Bank 2003a and
2014b). This meant within the total of about 1 million households with off-grid
access as of 2015, seven (7) percent of these households with off-grid access would
be the equivalent number of households under MHVE (World Bank 2003a, 2014b
and 2015; Government of Nepal 2012). The project’s restructurings and additional
financing allowed MHVE to scale up. This scaling up was not only due to the
successful implementation of MHVE itself, but also the PDP’s largest component
Power Development Fund (PDF) to provide long-term financing for private sector
small and medium-sized hydropower developments was scaled down and
eventually canceledcanceled. This was because (i) the long lead time was needed for
the PDP to facilitate private sector led development of Nepal’s hydropower
potential, (ii) the Kabeli-A hydropower plant, which was originally envisaged as the
first private sector small hydropower project financed by the PDF was supported by
the World Bank as a stand-alone intervention (World Bank 2008 and 2012), and (iii)
the political unrest -Maoist insurgency attacked large size commercial hydro
projects suitable for PDF and not microhydro suitable for MHVE (Sovacool et al.
2011).

MHVE’s success factors included (i) community involvement, (ii) capacity building,
(iii) special attention to women, (iii) income generation activities, (iii) simple
technology, (iv) de-politicization, (v) maintenance and after-sales service and (vi)
flexibility. Community-based microhydro projects required lots of capacity building,
as estimated MHVE’s 56 percent was spent on capacity development and
institutional strengthening, only 44 percent was spent on hardware (Sovacool et al.
2011).

However, communities did not fully use available electricity and used only for
lighting and energy stacking continued even for lighting by using kerosene, candle,
etc. and their priorities were not electricity. Social culture could exacerbate

                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts


inequalities, with in some cases those contributing labor during construction not
given access or an electricity connection (Sovacool et al. 2011).
Still market penetration is likely to be difficult in these areas due to low industrial
activity. The power plants located in remote locations in Nepal run at low plant
factor because of low demand for productive end uses. Lack of transport
infrastructure is one of the reasons why productive end uses are not so well
developed (Mainali and Silveira 2011; Sovacool et al. 2011; Rao, Agarwal, and Wood
2016).

Limited people were available for maintenance, after services and delivery of the
units, resulted in a large back log. MHVE suffered financially with no cost recovery,
uneven and unequal tariff, no meters, nonpayment, noncollections, etc. There was a
problem of donor dependency and lack of domestic financing, different donor
priorities – competition with other alternative energies such as solar, biogas, etc.
(Sovacool et al. 2011).

While Nepal achieved remarkable progress in off-grid electrification, coordination
with grid extension needs to be enhanced through planning future rural
electrification to avoid stranded off-grid assets when the grid is extended to the off-
grid areas (World Bank 2015a and 2015b). Energy crisis as a major constraint to
growth. The lack of grid-supplied electricity is a major barrier for Nepal to expand
access to quality electricity services, improve living standards, raise agriculture
productivity and incomes, and help its youth transit from farming to nonfarm
employment (World Bank 2015a and 2015b).

Subsidy policy 2000 promoted more installation of SHS and micro hydro. The
community contribution also increased. But there was a lack of credit and those very
few financial institutions that finance renewable energy suffered from bad debt and
nonperforming assets. Subsidy was also not efficient and effective due to high
transaction costs and did not really meet the needs. SHS was rather for the better off
people (Mainali and Silveira. 2011).

7. Tanzania

Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion Project (TEDAP) (P101645,
P092154, FY2008-) is one of the World Bank’s flagship projects in Tanzania and
included support to the first attempt in Tanzania for a larger-scale off-grid
electrification program, mobilizing and leveraging private sector resources and
promoting small-scale power projects. TEDAP scaled up its support to small power
producer component which included both off grids and on-grid with additional
financing in 2010. With combinations of its support to simplified regulations for
small power producers (SPPs), cost-sharing grants, credit lines (CL) and technical

         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

assistance, the TEDAP promoted SPPs provide power to the isolated grid and main
grids of Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) and Rural Electrification
Agency’s capacity has also improved. Sustainable Solar Market Packages (SSMP)
was also a part of the World Bank/International Finance Corporation (IFC) Lighting
Africa Initiative (World Bank 2007). However, cream skimming and principal agent
problems were experienced due to the apparent lack of interest by the contractor on
the households solar PV sales as the potential profits for the base load business of
public facilities PV was sufficient. The contractor was qualified for the task of
designing and installing relatively large-scale PV systems (the project developer or
builder type) but had little competence or experience in the business of marketing
SHS (the vendor type). Unlike in the World Bank Philippines Rural Power Project
(RPP) (P066397, P113159, P072096, FY2004–13), the contractor did not partner with
established vendors. The products were unaffordable on cash-only basis to majority
of households. The contractor initially presented a consumer financing plan for their
products that would enable payments over time but never implemented it. Also, the
matching grant program allowed some of the inexperienced developers to initiate
the projects that have never been completed to the required standards to move
ahead to financial close.

The Bank is preparing a follow up project entitled Tanzania Rural Electrification
Expansion Project under the Program for Results (PforR) operation. In the off-grid
subsector, among the donor communities, the World Bank plays a leading role in
helping the Rural Energy Agency (REA) support private sector initiatives along with
support from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and
UK Department for International Development (DfID). The proposed PforR will
provide funding through a window in an existing CL developed under TEDAP for
the SPP development. A new, second window under the CL will be directed at
providing financing to vendors for the delivery of quality-certified solar products to
consumers in rural areas. A Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) will be set up to
ensure that the SPPs in operation and the ones expected to sign SPPAs with
TANESCO are paid on time (World Bank 2016a). IFC launched a $5 million program
to increase access to energy in Tanzania by developing a market for minigrids in
October 2015 (IFC 2015).

8. Timor-Leste

The World Bank Timor Leste Gas Seep Harvesting Project (GSHP) (P092055,
FY2007–12) was to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of harvesting
seep gas from natural gas seeps to produce reliable and affordable power for
isolated rural communities in the southeastern part of Timor-Leste. Replication
potential of demonstration project was perceived high as at least 30 gas seeps spread
throughout the country. However, during the implementation, the gas test revealed
an inadequate quantity of gas, which led to the project’s closure. The project


                                             75
          Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                            Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts


preparation did not have sufficient funding to conduct comprehensive feasibility
study and took a risk as this was a pilot. Even before this reveal, the government
ownership and interest in this project was declined due to the power development
and grid expansion as well as problems of conflict of jurisdiction between ministries
and state secretaries.

This GSHP demonstrated that even with a pilot project, technical risk and cost
estimates needed to be properly assessed and even if the probability of risk was low,
the magnitude of impacts if the risk materialized needed to be examined and
decision needed to be made accordingly. In pilots without lessons learned for a
specific type of project like this GSHP, lessons learned and the risk mitigation
measures should have been rigorously sought from the relevant industry.
Otherwise, there would be a waste of public resources of tax payers’ money of donor
countries. Establishing and maintaining effective communications with the client
country was extremely important to ensure (i) timely decision to change the course
of project when the client made a decision to expand the grids to the isolated areas
and (ii) justification of the donor finance. The GSHP was justified given the
(underestimated) low cost of pilot project and the cost to the rural poor without
sufficient electricity services was overwhelming. In fact, the GSHP was high risk and
high cost and some of the project deigns were premature, although the GSHP was
well intended to support the country.

9. Mali

The World Bank Mali Household Energy and Universal Access Project (HEUAP)
(P073036, P076440, FY2004–12)promoted isolated minigrids at the project closing on
June 30, 2012 with a cumulative number of about 74,787 connections exceeding the
target of 68,896 connections. As a result, Mali was perceived to the most successful
in promoting minigrids in Africa (RECP/EUEI PDF 2014). The Agency for the
Development of Domestic Energy and Rural Electrification (AMADER) is the central
authority for rural electrification. AMADER has incorporated a variety of regulatory
and policy reforms and measures, concessions and capital cost grants to support
successful deployment of over 160 stand-alone minigrids (70,000–80,000 customers),
serving an average of 500 connections each —perhaps the most of any Sub-Saharan
African country (Rai et al. 2015). In the early 2000s, a market for minigrids did not
yet exist in Mali (Rai et al. 2015). Mali’s Energy Sector Organization Law in 2000 set
the stage for minigrid market by: allowing private operators to supply electricity;
launching a rural electrification program; and eliminating the nationwide monopoly
of (Énergie de Mali (EDM) (Rai et al. 2015).

AMADER works with local governments and companies to submit proposals for
minigrids concessions and manage Rural Electrification Fund established in 2005


                                              76
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

under HEUAP. The country has a coordinated program of support across Mali
agencies with World Bank and KfW, the World Bank projects included HEUAP and
Mali Rural Electrification Hybrid System Project (FY2014-; P131084) which has been
promoting a renewable-diesel hybrid minigrids (World Bank 2003c, 2013h, 2013i).
The primary driver behind the creation of AMADER was the World Bank, which,
based on its experience in other countries, recognized that creating a so-called one
stop government agency to regulate and grant funds to the rural electrification
sector was a “cleaner” and “easier to implement” approach than “assigning
regulatory responsibilities over isolated minigrids to the national electricity
regulator” (Tenenbaum et al. 2014).

HEUAP emphasized the cost recovery of operation and maintenance of minigrid,
Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) and helped strengthen technical
and managerial capacity building (World Bank 2003c and 2013i). The Mali
government has taken both a top-down and a bottom-up approach (bidirectional
approach) to encouraging private developers to build minigrids by providing two
separate routes to approval. Although the government has designated clear areas for
concessions, nearly all the developers chose the route of submitting unsolicited
proposals as that provided fewer administrative burdens than competitive
concessions. The program has been successful in attracting a wide range of minigrid
developments and providing increased energy services. The simplified institutional
framework, given full authority to AMADER, attracted the private sector interests
(Rai et al. 2015). Malian society is very entrepreneurial. The success of the bottom-up
approach was due to local private entrepreneurs’ interests in rural minigrids and the
local market (World Bank 2014). The decentralization of decision-making, financial
resources, and budgetary autonomy to local authorities changed the mind-set from
one of waiting for national-level action to one of stimulating local-level initiatives
(World Bank 2003c).

However, the electricity tariff in minigrids for households is higher than the tariff
for grid-connected customers, which caused “tariff envy,” leading to the rapid
extension of the national grid to seven minigrids sites located close to the national
utility’s concession area (Tenenbaum et al., 2014).

Mali’s privately run minigrid case highlights (i) Opening multiple avenues to solicit
projects from minigrid developers can jumpstart private investment; (ii) Partial
capital cost grants can support financial viability and sustainability of minigrid
projects; (iii) Designating a “one stop” agency to regulate and provide minigrid
grants can increase efficiency and make private sector engagement more attractive;
(iv) Allowing minigrid developers to set their own tariffs can support minigrid
deployment; and (v) Including support for hybridization of diesel-powered
minigrids can reduce their operating costs and thus lower their tariffs, which has



                                             77
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts


been supported by Mali Rural Electrification Hybrid System Project (FY2014-;
P131084).

Mali’s approach of allowing minigrid developers to set their own tariffs has enabled
the creative use of technology through several business models. For example,
‘Shared Solar’ has developed a pay-as-you-go model that allows customers to
purchase small amounts of electricity “on demand” by purchasing scratch cards
from local vendors and sending a text message with a single-use code to the network
operator. These minigrids have led to new local small businesses, a new local radio
station, and improved hospital services in some of the pilot villages (Harper 2013).
Columbia University’s Earth Institute has constructed a series of minigrids that
deploy prepaid meters and “smart controls” that limit overuse at the customer and
minigrid level to ensure a stable supply (CEM 2013).

Under HEUAP’s SHS promotion, private operators were not interested in adopting
as much as expected solar technologies and beneficiaries also wanted multiple uses
of energy services that were difficult to be provided by solar home systems. Hence
some of the allocated funding for SHS was canceledcanceled. Instead, this HEUAP
had a greater success in minigrids, which contributed to Mali to be most successful
in minigrids in Africa (World Bank. 2013i; RECP/EUEI PDF. 2014; Rai et al 2015)

HEUAP also supported multifunctional platforms, composed of a small 10 kilowatts
diesel engine coupled to a generator, that could be connected to income-generating
equipment, such as cereal grinding mills, battery charger, de-huskers, and water
pumps, or to generates electricity that can be distributed through a microgrid to
households (World Bank 2013i; Sovacool et al. 2013). A multifunctional platform is
installed in 81 communities, just shy of the target of 86 communities, covering
approximately 4,700 users. Women’s associations played an important role in
remote communities as providers of energy services (World Bank 2013i). The
communal model for managing the platforms, with active involvement of women’s
associations was not found workable, and the management of 61 platforms was
transferred to the private sector (World Bank 2013i).

10. Microgrid and minigrid experiences in the private sector and communities
(with or without any involvement of the World Bank Group)

Following examples of Indian private biomass minigrids IFC-financed HPS and a
World Bank Group grant recipient Decentralized Energy Systems (DESI Power) and
non-World Bank Group supported solar minigrids Gham Power, illustrate the
private sector’s strong focus on performance and financial viability.




                                             78
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

The private sector is serious in market development, for example, by employing
market development specialist, and in payment collection, for example, by sending a
tariff collector daily. They are very strenuous in reducing theft but even with the use
of modern technology, theft and overuse are very difficult to capture and person-to-
person detection is still needed, a similar experience in Haiti by EarthPark
International, active in minigrid with smart prepaid meter, which still requires a
person to tackle theft (EarthPark International 2015). To scaling up minigrid
business, HPS uses franchising, which also could help the franchised agencies get
financing given the established brand (Bhattacharyya 2014 and Schnitzer et al 2014).

The private sector strives for using the resource efficiently. In some cases, the
biomass minigrid operator integrated the rice mill business to ensure business
viability and to internalize the symbiotic relationship with the power plant. Further,
the char obtained from burning the husk is used for incense stick making by women,
thereby monetizing the waste. Silica precipitation is sold for mixing with cement
(Bhattacharyya 2014). To meet investor expectations on the level of return on a
project, Gham Power has expanded its product offering more than just selling
electricity, selling basic services needed in that community, such as rice milling, a
dairy chilling center and telemedicine. Gham Power put an Internet connection on
all our systems for remote monitoring. Gham Power’s role often shifts into business
incubation where their staff is going to the community and sitting down with
community leaders, and asking things that have nothing to do with solar (IRENA
2015).

They employ women operators and conducting women empowerment and business
development activities to complement the arrival of electricity. They develop
income-generating activities, which requires significant time and resources as an
example of DESI Power giving loans to existing industries to convert their diesel
engine-driven loads to motor-driven loads, and employing a staff position that is
dedicated to assisting commercial customers to develop businesses and increase
electrical load. In most areas, however, especially village markets, electricity is not
necessarily linked in the minds of villagers to productive activities – just lighting
(Bhattacharyya 2014 and Schnitzer et al 2014).

Many private minigrid operators are still partially dependent on some form of
subsidy or grant, yet cannot serve the poorest of the poor for them to be
commercially viable.

Both public and private sector experience in minigrids in many countries ( for
example, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Mali, Kenya, China, etc.) showed that the
community involvement was important but could interfere commercial practices,
independent regulation, and transparency due to adverse politicization, social
network, etc. (Schnitzer, et al. 2014; Ulsrud et al. 2011; Yadoo 2012; World Bank


                                             79
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts


2014a). A case study in Orissa in India found villagers did not want to dedicate the
time needed to collectively maintain the system that could never facilitate power for
income-generating activities (Schnitzer et al 2014).

In some cases, community-based minigrids were able to finance most of the working
capital. Non-Bank Mpeketoni Electricity Project (MEP), a community-based diesel-
powered microgrid system in rural Kenya during 1994–2007 demonstrated the
potential to cover a substantial proportion of the operating costs from internal
revenue derived from sales of electricity and other charges and a grain mill as an
income-generating activity to cover the operating deficit. At the time of the Kenya
Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) takeover of the microgrid in September 2007,
MEP had attained 94 percent cost recovery, nearly five times that realized by the
diesel-powered microgrids operated by the KPLC, the national utility. Through the
Rural Electrification Program (REP), KPLC installed a new and larger (250
megawatt) diesel-distributed generation system to supply power to Mpeketoni and
surrounding villages. Aside from receiving a 24-hour/ day power supply, the
government’s takeover resulted in considerable consumer surplus. This was
because, under REP, Mpeketoni customers obtained service at a highly cross-
subsidized rate of Ksh8/kilowattsh (US$0.11/kilowattsh) compared to
Ksh37/kilowattsh (US$0.53/kilowattsh), the rate MEP customers were willing to
pay at the time of the takeover. Conversely, this arrangement yielded a negative
producer surplus because the cost of diesel-powered supply by the KPLC
(Ksh39/kilowattsh or US$0.56) (Kirubi et al. 2007), which reduced the scarce public
funds and sustainability. Despite the extremely unreliable electricity supply, the use
of electric equipment by small and micro enterprises resulted in significant
improvement in productivity per worker ranging 100–200 percent depending on the
task and in a corresponding growth in income levels in the order of 20–70 percent,
depending on the product made. Access to electricity enabled and improved the
delivery of social and business services. It demonstrated that when local electricity
users had an ability to charge and enforce cost-reflective tariffs and when electricity
consumption was closely linked to productive uses that generate incomes, cost
recovery could be feasible (Kirubi et al. 2007).

In non-World Bank community-owned minigrids in Indonesian Borneo, three NGOs
with complementary roles collaborated to develop renewable energy minigrid
projects. Two international NGOs helped channel the financing for installing the
minigrids and offered technical expertise and community organizing skills. The
third NGO, a community association, focused on training people in the skills to
maintain the systems. After one year of operation, the NGOs handed over
ownership to the community. A village-level committee was then created to operate
and regulate the minigrid. The tariffs, decided by the community, were directed
toward a fund for operations and maintenance. Because these minigrids were not


                                             80
         Appendix D: Off-Grid Electrification: Summaries of World Bank Group Experiences in
                                           Selected Countries; and Other Private Sector Efforts

registered with the government, the only source of funding for repairs was what the
community pays in tariffs. When repair costs were too high, repairs were not made
(IRENA 2015). This issue was a common issue elsewhere, such as Malaysia
(Schnitzer et al. 2014)

Community PV systems in two primary schools and three health posts in rural areas
under the non-World Bank Malawi Community Rural Electrification and
Development (CRED) 2008–2011, in Chikwawa district in Malawi also demonstrated
its ability to cover working capital by providing mobile phone charging and cold
drink sales to communities as their supplementary income generation activities.
Selected and trained community energy committee encouraged community access,
regular maintenance, security, income generation and a logbook record of all
activities. A local fieldworker was hired and trained to support the energy
committees with further technical support in the main town (Frame et al. 2011).
Frame et al (2011) who examined the systems operations for the first 18 months,
noted that technically the systems trouble free expect one faulty charge controller,
which the energy committee reported to the fieldworker who in turn contacted the
supplier to replace this item, financed by the revenue generated by the committee
via the system. Funding of systems operations supported from income generation
activities on mobile phone charging and cold drink sales and well accounted
maintenance funds growing, income generation on track to allow battery
replacement for after four years. This project gained institutional support for the
community energy approach from the health and education authorities, and local
government’s formal support to the energy committee activities (Frame et al. 2011).
