Executive Summary


The Government of India launched Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) in March, 2009 which is
along the lines of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan but with the focus on secondary education. The key objectives of the
scheme are to enhance access to secondary education and to improve its quality. It envisages achieving
universal access to secondary level education by 2017, and improving quality of education imparted at the
secondary level by making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms.

The objective of this study is to document and analyse the current use of classroom time and identify
good practices to improve classroom teaching in Mathematics and Language in secondary education in
support of the implementation of the RMSA scheme. This study has been carried out as part of the World
Bank’s initiative with concurrence from Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government
of India (GoI).

This study builds upon an earlier study on time-on-task which was carried out by the World Bank for
elementary schools in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in 2006-2007.
That study was instrumental in providing valuable insight on time spent and the nature of teaching in
elementary classrooms. The current study aims to achieve the same in secondary schools.


Scope and Design
This study looks at the available learning time, teaching methods and learning materials available in the
classroom along with the characteristics of students, teachers and schools to document how effectively
instructional time is used in the class. The study also video records teaching practices of a smaller subset
of teachers in order to create a corpus of real-life examples of teaching practice that can serve as an
effective learning tool in teacher training programs and generate discussion among educators and teachers
on effective teaching practices to increase student engagement in the class. This is the first time such a
study has been conducted in secondary education in India and therefore this report goes into some of the
technical issues addressed during the implementation, so that others can repeat and extend the study in
other places.

The present study covered 150 secondary schools spread across 3 districts each in Madhya Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu. Language and Mathematics subject classes were observed in class 10 in each school. In case
it was not possible to survey class 10, class 9 was observed in that school. The following instruments were
administered in each school: A) Stallings tool; B) SOS Log; C) Student Questionnaire; D) School & Teacher
Questionnaire; and, E) Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge Questionnaire. All these tools are
discussed in detail in subsequent chapters.


Key Findings
Overall, classes were held for 179 days in Madhya Pradesh (Figure 1) and 182 days in Tamil Nadu
in the academic year 2014-2015 (Figure 2: Expected vs actual days on which classes held, Tamil Nadu
(2014-2015)Figure 2). Even though schools operate for 6 days a week in Madhya Pradesh the actual
number of days on which classes were held was very slightly less than in Tamil Nadu because of a longer
summer break (45 days in Madhya Pradesh as against one month in Tamil Nadu), more exam days

(44 days against 27 days) and unscheduled closings. Discussion with state officials revealed that the
number of unscheduled closings was as per their expectations and could be due to various reasons such
as local festivals, state/district events or heavy rains.

On an average, teachers were away from schools for 17.8 days in Madhya Pradesh and 20.6 days
in Tamil Nadu. Out of these, the number of days for personal leave was the highest across all 6 districts.
Teachers were not in school mainly due to personal leave, training and other official duties. The number of
days spent in training is very less especially in Madhya Pradesh where teachers were in training for 3.7 days
in 2014-15 in comparison to 6.3 days in Tamil Nadu. Also, an analysis of teacher availability data by gender,
age and experience shows that:

Male teachers were in training and on official duties for significantly more days than female teachers in
    Madhya Pradesh. No such differences were found in Tamil Nadu.
In Madhya Pradesh young teachers in the age group of 21 to 30 years have taken far less leave and also
    went on training or official duty for fewer days which results in them being away from school for 10 days
    in comparison to approximately 19 days among other age groups.




  xiv     What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
Classroom observations noted how much time teachers were spending on various activities. Activities
were further classified into – 1) Instructional activities: activities where teacher and students are involved
in productive teaching and learning, and 2) Classroom management and other off-task activities: where
the teacher is spending his/her time in managing the classroom or on other activities not associated with
student learning. The average class time in both states is 45 minutes.

Overall, almost 89 percent of teachers’ time was spent on instructional activities (Figure 3). However,
there is significant difference in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu on how time is being spent in the
classroom. In Madhya Pradesh, 83 percent of the time is spent on instructional activities whereas this
number is 94 percent for Tamil Nadu. In Madhya Pradesh, time being spent on classroom management
and off-task activities is high at 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively, and is lower in Tamil Nadu at
5 percent and 1 percent respectively.

There are important differences in the way instructional time is used across subjects.
Teachers are spending more time on ‘Discussion’ and ‘Reading Aloud’ in Language than in Mathematics
classrooms. ‘Assignment/class work’ and ‘Copying’ activities are take up a higher proportion of class time
in Mathematics classrooms than in Language classrooms. The observers found that most Mathematics
teachers solve examples on the blackboard and ask students to copy it down which may explain more
time in class work and copying in Mathematics classrooms. ‘Instruction, demonstration or lecture’ and
‘Assignment/class work’ dominate and take up almost 50 percent of class time across subjects. It is
also noteworthy that 17 percent (approximately 7-8 minutes per lesson) of the class time is devoted for
discussions in both the subjects.

There are also differences in the teaching and learning materials used, though the range of such
materials was very limited. In Mathematics classes in both states, teachers are using the blackboard
for more than 50 percent of class time (Figure 4). In contrast to this, in Language classes, use of textbooks
dominates and takes up 40 percent of class time (Figure 5). In both subjects and states, use of other
learning aids is limited and co-operative learning and use of ICT is almost non-existent in the classroom.
(It should be noted that ICT tools may be used in computer labs which were not part of this survey.)
Along with the materials available in the classroom, observers also noted if students have textbooks and
notebooks of their own in the class. All students in both states had textbooks and notebooks in more than
90 percent of the classes observed.

There is a stark difference between the two states in terms of availability of learning resources.
Whereas Tamil Nadu reported more than 95 percent schools having 7 out of 9 learning resources on
the survey questionnaire, this percentage was 38 percent in Madhya Pradesh. In Madhya Pradesh,

learning resources are especially lacking in Balaghat schools. Only 11 percent schools in Madhya Pradesh
reported having computers in comparison to 85 percent schools in Tamil Nadu.

The engagement level of students in Tamil Nadu was high as all the students were doing the
activity carried out by the teacher for 73 percent of the classroom time (Figure 6). It was significantly
lower in Madhya Pradesh where the entire class was engaged for 41 percent of the classroom time.1
However, it should be noted that when all students were engaged this almost always meant that all
students were doing the same activity, regardless of whether they were able to understand what was
being taught or, indeed, their understanding had already gone significantly beyond the material being
discussed.

In Madhya Pradesh, a student attendance rate of 70 percent was recorded on the day of observation
in comparison to 88 percent in Tamil Nadu schools. There is no significant difference in enrolment or
attendance rates for boys and girls across rural and urban schools (Figure 7).


1	 The Stallings Manual identifies 4 categories of student participation to be used during the class observations: ‘Entire Class’ – All
   the students are involved in the activity, ‘Large Group’ – 6 or more students are involved in the activity but not the entire class,
   ‘Small Group’ – 2 to 6 students are involved in the activity, ‘1 student’ – 1 student is involved in the activity independently.

More than 95 percent students in both states responded positively when asked if they like to come to
school and feel that education is important. Approximately the same number of boys and girls responding
yes. The survey also looked at the gender neutrality of classroom practices or if they favoured any one
gender. The survey checked gender neutrality by checking if teachers were asking questions, praising,
scolding or offering to do classroom management predominantly for one gender group in the class. Data
shows that there was no significant gender bias in either state.

Around 50 percent of students in Madhya Pradesh and 74 percent of students in Tamil Nadu are
15 years old (i.e., the expected age for class 10) (Figure 8). In Madhya Pradesh, schools have diverse
groups in terms of age as at least 18 percent students are younger than 15 years and more than 30 percent
students are older than 15 years. This diversity of student ages poses an additional challenge to teachers in
responding effectively to the different educational needs of students.

Principals and students generally perceive effective teachers and teaching in the same way as the
expert observations in this study. Principals’ rating of teachers are moderately positively correlated with
time spent on instruction in the classroom and student engagement level. Effective teaching practice as
perceived by students is also moderately positively correlated to engagement levels of students.

In order to understand if teachers are able to point out errors made by students, a test of 10 questions
was given to each of 28 language and Mathematics teachers who were observed. The test was voluntary
with no time limit.

On an average, in each state, language teachers were able to identify student errors 50 percent of the
time and Mathematics teachers got 40 percent of the questions correct (Table 1). The performance of
Madhya Pradesh teachers was found to be slightly higher than that of Tamil Nadu teachers in Mathematics
as well as Language. Across all the districts, performance of teachers in the district of Gwalior was the
highest (with the language teachers getting 53 percent of the questions right and Mathematics teachers
getting 47 percent of the questions right).

 xviii     What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
While teachers were able to identify errors made by students correctly for some of the questions of
lower class levels, there were cases where most teachers missed fundamental conceptual errors
made by students. Also, responses on some of the questions of higher class levels (classes 8, 9 and 10)
seem to indicate that the teachers probably have the same wrong notions as their students.

The study also created separate videos that capture teaching-learning practices in Language and
Mathematics in each state. The purpose of this video compilation is to serve as a starting point for a
discussion among teachers, teacher trainers, principals and other key stakeholders on classroom
practices that can best support student engagement and student learning to suit their specific learning
environments.


Conclusion
This study highlights the need for further examination on the link between classroom practices and
student outcomes. Teachers are spending substantial class time on instructional activities but results
from the National Achievement Survey (NAS) indicate this is not leading to good enough student learning
outcomes. Most of the time all students are engaged in what is happening in the classroom; but this
is because they are all doing exactly the same thing. Further, re-examining the content of teacher
preparation and training programs to ensure content mastery among teachers will be crucial for teacher
effectiveness and student learning. Finally, there were small but notable differences across districts
in instructional practices; these differences could be the result of district-level processes for teacher
recruitment and pre- and in-service training.

All the material from the study, including the questionnaires and the edited video material, is available for
use by governments and researchers.

1. Study Overview


1.1	About the Study
How effectively instructional time is used is a core determinant of the quality of education a child receives.
Every element of the education system, from curriculum design to school construction, book procurement
and teacher salaries, comes together at the moment when a teacher interacts with students in the classroom.
The information about classroom practices in this study is expected to support the development of more
effective teacher training programs that leverage skills of well-performing teachers (good practices) and
provide a range of solutions for challenges faced by teachers in classrooms.

Effective learning is an output of many factors which interact together in a complex manner. Among
these, primarily, learner characteristics, teacher characteristics, classroom environment and context
define the teaching and learning activities which take place in a class and which are critical to learning
outcomes. UNESCO has proposed a model outlining the relationship between different factors and
learning outcomes (Figure 9).

As very few studies on time on task in secondary education have been completed internationally, this is an
opportunity for India to demonstrate how to do it, what is possible and what can be learnt from such studies.
A prior Time on Task Study (2006-07) by the World Bank conducted in 3 states (Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) in government and private elementary schools provided valuable insights on
time spent and the nature of teaching in classrooms. With similar objectives, this study has been conducted
in secondary schools of Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh.

1.2	Scope and Objectives
The study aimed to observe the time spent by teachers in different activities in the classroom. The study was
conducted in 3 districts each of Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. The districts selected were Coimbatore,
Salem and Vellore in Tamil Nadu, and Balaghat, Gwalior and Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. A total of 150
schools were covered for classroom observations and 32 classrooms were video recorded.

In the study, one Language and one Mathematics classroom were observed mostly in class 10 by field
observers (trained by EI) in each school. Apart from observing Language and Mathematics classes,
2 questionnaires were administered in each school to capture: (i) background information about the
school and teachers; and, (ii) perceptions of the students about the teaching practices in their classrooms.
Teachers of the classes observed also completed the Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge
(TUSK) tool in Mathematics and Language (Hindi/Tamil).

In both states, some classes were video recorded to capture a variety of teaching practices for dissemination
and discussion among teachers on effective teaching practices. The RMSA offices in both states were
requested to suggest names of teachers whose classroom could be selected for this purpose. In each state
8 classrooms were chosen for the video recording for both Language and Mathematics.

The study had the following objectives:

To document and analyse the current use of classroom time and identify good practices to improve
    classroom teaching in Mathematics and Indian Languages in secondary classrooms in India.
To collect data on the various background factors of interest which may have direct or indirect influence
    on the classroom practices of the respective schools, teachers and students surveyed.
To collect information on students’ perceptions of classroom practices and whether they found the
    teaching useful.
To analyse functional days in schools, teacher absence and time spent on academic and non-academic
    activities.
To develop videos on teaching practices followed in schools, which can be used to generate discussion
    on effective teaching practices during training activities.
To understand if teachers are able to identify conceptual mistakes or the root cause of errors made by
    students while solving problems.

1.3	 Key Stages and Timelines
The study was initiated with meeting and discussing the idea of a ToT study with senior officials of Tamil
Nadu and Madhya Pradesh (Table 2). This was followed up with getting permission and field work for
data collection. Regular progress reports were shared with the World Bank, RMSA Madhya Pradesh and
RMSA Tamil Nadu. The field operation process was completed with data entry of survey tools. Once the
preliminary analysis was completed, the findings were shared with both Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
state governments and RMSA offices by holding state level meetings. Based on the comments received the
report and videos were finalised.

1.4	Limitations
Since schools were told about the survey beforehand due to logistical reasons, though the exact date of
survey was not communicated to them, a complete surprise visit was not possible to ensure that observers
capture the typical scenario in the school. Even if a surprise visit would have been possible, the presence of
the surveyor in the classroom itself can cause the teachers to alter their behavior in the class. To measure
the extent to which classroom behavior got affected due to the survey, a series of questions were asked to
students who were present in the classroom observed (Table 3).

In Tamil Nadu, the trend was different than expected especially in Salem and Vellore. The data presented
here is as reported by students in the questionnaire. During the survey no specific trend was reported by
observers in the state.

2. Test Design and Development


2.1	Instruments
The following tools were used for the study:

i.	Student questionnaire: The primary objective of the student questionnaire for the ToT Study was
    to collect background information about the students, which could then be used to study various
    things with respect to the type of schools they go to, infrastructure available in those schools,
    teachers in those schools, and the classroom practices observed in their classrooms. It also tried
    to capture the ‘student recall’ factor, which could provide some information about how students
    perceived their classroom in general and the particular classroom which was observed by the
    evaluator.

	This was administered to 25 percent of the students present in the classroom. Students were randomly
  selected and completed the questionnaire in a separate room.

ii.	School questionnaire: The primary objective of the school questionnaire was to collect information
     about school infrastructure, resources available, and background of the headmaster and the teacher,
     which could then be used to understand the type of schools covered, the educational and professional
     background of the headmaster and the teachers surveyed and also provide information about the
     amount of time spent by the teacher on academic and non-academic activities, number of days she
     had to go for trainings and other work and leave taken.

	Primarily the school principal filled this questionnaire. In case some information about the teacher was
  not known, the teacher was consulted.

iii.	Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge (TUSK): The primary objective of the TUSK tool
      was to capture how well teachers understand errors made by students. Based on sample responses
      given by the students on previous assessments conducted by EI, the teacher was asked to identify
      the different errors being made so that the information could then be used to plan appropriate
      remediation to handle those errors. Hence understanding students’ errors is an important skill that a
      teacher is expected to possess. This was attempted by the Language and Mathematics teachers whose
      classrooms were observed. Teachers whose classrooms were observed were asked to complete the
      TUSK tool, but it was not made mandatory.


2.2	Design of the Tools
In order to understand the relevant parameters that should be included in the questionnaires, various
national as well as international questionnaires were reviewed. Based on this, a broad framework for
each tool was designed.

The Student questionnaire covered 6 parameters, with majority of the focus on students’ perception about
studies, teachers and their school, and student recall parameters (Table 4).




                                                                       2.  Test Design and Development   5

The TUSK tool focussed primarily on one skill –teachers’ understanding of student errors. The Mathematics
tool had 8 multiple choice questions and 2 free response questions while the Language tool had 7 multiple
choice questions and 3 free response questions. Each multiple choice question also had some space where
the teacher could express his/her thoughts.

2.3	Tool Development Process
The tool development process was divided into 3 broad stages:

Stage 1 consisted of reviewing national and international surveys, defining the blueprint for each tool and
developing questions for the tools. The blueprint was reviewed by members from the World Bank team.

Stage 2 consisted of translation (and its validation) of the tools in Hindi and Tamil languages.

Stage 3 consisted of collecting feedback on the tools through pilot testing and review by the members
of the Advisory Committee. The tools were finalized based on their feedback. Changes in the translated
versions (if needed) were incorporated. Such finalised tools were then used for final testing.

Review of national and international surveys
In order to understand the different parameters captured through various national as well as international
questionnaires, questionnaires of surveys such as National Achievement Survey, Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study, Programme for International Student Assessment, Teaching and Learning
International Survey, Tripod Student Survey, etc. were reviewed. This was very helpful as it gave insights
into the different detailed ways of asking some very simple questions.

For example, while reviewing the National Achievement Survey Background Questionnaire, it was noticed
that instead of capturing the educational background and occupation of parents in general, it may be better
to capture it separately for each parent.

Looking at international surveys such as Tripod Survey (used for the Tripod Project) was very helpful
in understanding the questions used to capture student perspectives on teaching practices, classroom
learning conditions and student engagement.

While most of the survey questionnaires tried to capture one or more parameters like social and economic
background and student perceptions, very few focussed primarily on the student recall factor. For this, new
questions were developed that suited the objective of understanding what students remembered from the
class that just got over (the class that was also observed using the Stallings tool).


Development of blueprint for the tools
Based on the review of the different surveys and the objectives of developing the different tools for the ToT
Study, a blueprint with an overall framework (as shared in section 3.2) for each tool was laid down. The
blueprint also tried to specify how each parameter and its sub-components could be used in analysis.

For example, questions capturing social background of students could be used in descriptive analysis
comparing schools with different student compositions and their correlation with types of classroom
practices.

For the TUSK tool, there was no detailed framework as there was only one specific skill - ‘teachers’ ability
to identify student errors’ to be tested.


Item Development
While most questions for the student and school questionnaires were either used from past studies done
by Educational Initiatives (EI) or adapted from surveys like National Achievement Survey and Tripod, the
questions for TUSK were developed anew using information from earlier studies done by EI.




                                                                           2.  Test Design and Development   7
In order to ensure that there were sufficient items, extra items were developed and field-tested so that the
irrelevant/difficult items could be dropped. Apart from this, detailed feedback from the Advisory Committee
members was used to finalise the questions.


Translation of the tools
All the tools were developed in English and then translated into Hindi and Tamil based on the guidelines
specified for translation. Reliability was ensured by further checking the translated tools with language
experts and reverse translation into English (validation). Terminologies in the Mathematics and Language
papers were retained as per the vernacular language. This rigorous process for translation and validation
provided comparable test items across both the participating states.


Feedback from the advisory committee members
In order to review the tools critically, all the tools were subject to feedback from the Advisory Committee.
Advisory Committee members were a diverse group of people with varied expertise in the education domain,
ranging from subject and pedagogy experts to policy advocates.

Comments from the Advisory Committee members included inputs on objectivity and sensitivity of
questions, clarity, language and format. All the comments were captured and a detailed response sheet
addressing each comment was prepared (see sample in Figure 11).

Pilot testing and finalisation of the tools
Pilot tests were carried out for the following purposes:

To understand how teachers would react to the optional TUSK tool, one-on-one interviews were carried
out with some teachers. One of the main concerns teachers shared was that the questions had 4 options
and at times they may want to provide an answer that was not mentioned. The revised tool therefore
included space for additional open-ended responses from teachers. Based on detailed feedback from the
Advisory Committee members, the questions were fine-tuned and finalised. Field teams only raised a few
points on translation which were addressed during the finalization of the tools.

3. Sampling


The key objective of sampling was to select 75 secondary government schools each from the states of
Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Sampling had to ensure:
Random selection to ensure no bias in the data.
Proportional distribution of students from urban and rural areas and gender breakup within government
     schools of the respective states.

3.1	Sampling Design
Since only 75 schools were to be sampled from each state, it was decided that the survey would be
conducted in 3 districts in each state to minimize logistical challenges. A set of criteria were developed for
each state (Table 8).

Table 8: Sampling criteria for each state

                   Madhya Pradesh                                                Tamil Nadu

5. Mix of Urban and Rural and Tribal & Backward
    localities.

Districts were selected such that were selected such that the Population Weighted Average Human
Development Index (HDI) of the sampled districts (with the weights being the district populations based
on the Census - 2011) was close to the weighted average HDI of the state (Table 9). Some component of
convenience sampling did factor in the selection of final districts due to state preference for some districts.
In Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior was selected to see how an urban district performs (it was considered similar
to Bhopal). Bhagelkhand region lags in most of the indicators hence it was considered important to include
Balaghat. Jhabua was representative of tribal districts. In Tamil Nadu, the state preferred Salem district
in place of Thiruvallur. Thiruvallur district was not considered due to its proximity to Chennai. Coimbatore
and Vellore were accepted as originally suggested by EI. The HDI values for Balaghat, Gwalior and Jhabua
in Madhya Pradesh, and Coimbatore, Salem and Vellore in Tamil Nadu are given below:

                                                                                                3.  Sampling   11
To select 25 schools from each district, a Stratified Two Stage Cluster Sampling technique was used. The
first level of stratification involved classifying schools into Rural and Urban categories. The next level of
stratification involved splitting the Rural and Urban schools into girls, boys and co-educational schools. The
next phase of the sampling procedure involved calculating the number of schools to be sampled from each
stratum based on the proportion of the stratum followed by simple random selection of required number
of schools from each stratum.

As number of schools selected in each state was only 75, the error margin was higher than normally
accepted. Based on the error margin calculator (Creative Research Systems - http://www.surveysystem.
com/sscalc.htm) the sampling design had an 11.2 percent margin of error at the state level.

Steps/assumptions involved in calculation:

Total population size taken as 4,0002 secondary schools in the state.
A school was considered a single observation not taking into account the number of teachers
    participating in the study in each school.
Any clustering effect was not taken into account due to selection of schools from only 3 districts rather
    than selecting them randomly from the entire state.

3.2	Sampling Frame and Data Collection
The target population was all the schools run by Department of Education (DoE) of the respective states
which have class 9 and class 10 in the selected districts. In the district of Jhabua, since the number of
schools run by DoE was only 7, tribal schools were also included in the sampling.

This data was provided by the SCERT of the respective states and included the list of all the schools with
necessary fields like ‘UDISE code’, ‘School type’, ‘School location’, ‘District’ and ‘Management’.


3.3	 Final Sample
To make sure the target of 25 schools in each district was achieved, schools were over sampled in each
district increasing the sample by 10 percent or 3 additional schools in each district. These schools were
selected from the blocks which represented the larger part of the district from the replacement list.

From this final list of schools, 2 schools in Balaghat, 1 school in Jhabua and 1 in Vellore were replaced
due to incorrect school details or unavailability of Language or Mathematics teachers in the originally
selected school.




2	The total population was taken as 4,000 based on preliminary discussion with the State officials in both Tamil Nadu and
   Madhya Pradesh on approximate number of secondary schools.

4.2	Pre Survey Work
The pre survey work was divided and completed in the following stages:

Meetings: Meetings with the senior state government officials in MP and Tamil Nadu were held in the
    first and second week of October by the World Bank and EI. In these meetings, information about the
    study was shared with state officials and their support was requested for smooth conduct of the study.
    As a follow-up, the EI team visited each of the 6 districts in both the states and met district officials to
    seek their help and support for the study.
Obtaining Permission Letter: An official permission letter was obtained from the state government
    before the trainings.
Informing districts and inviting them for training: All 6 districts were informed about the training,
    pilot and timeline for the main survey. District officials were invited to join the Master Training Workshop.
    The details of the pilot and main survey work were discussed in detail with district officials during and
    after the master training.
Training preparation: A 3-day Master Training Workshop was planned in each district from the first
    to third weeks of November in coordination with the EI team and the respective district officials. The
    training sessions were planned in consultation with Dr. Sudhakar Venu, trainer of master trainers
    specially appointed for the study by The World Bank. All logistical arrangements were made by the EI
    team with the help of the district nodal person and concerned district officials. Identification of training
    venue, arrangement of projector and white board, seating arrangements, breakfast, meals, tea &
    snacks etc. were completed. To provide participants with hands-on experience using the Stallings tool,
    participants were taken to schools for 2 days to do the survey with actual tools. Travel arrangements
    were made in advance by the EI team for visiting these schools.

4.3	Preparation of Training Material
Training materials included tools and manuals, both in English and the local language, presentation slides
and tablets:

Tools and manuals: Stallings tool, TUSK for Mathematics and Language, Student Questionnaire,
    School Questionnaire, SOS log form3 and description sheet for Stallings tool were used in the survey.
    All these tools were prepared before the training.
Translation: Stallings tool manual for classroom observation was translated followed by validation by
    experts in Hindi for Madhya Pradesh and in Tamil for Tamil Nadu. Comments on translated manuals
    were received during the Master Training Workshop and the comments were incorporated in the final
    version. Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge and student questionnaire were developed in
    English and translated in Hindi and Tamil.
Preparation of tablets: To ensure that the Stallings tool would be administered in a standardized
    manner, a special application was developed by the Educational Initiatives IT team which can run online
    and offline. This application takes care of all the validations as recommended by Stallings. The screens
    made for this application are provided in appendix A. These screens were developed in Hindi and Tamil.
    A total of 60 tablets were procured for conducting the survey in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. The
    Stallings tool prepared for the survey was tested on these tablets, the school questionnaires were
    also installed on these tablets. In all the trainings, the observers were trained to use tablets and the
    application developed for the survey.

4.4	Training and Recruitment of Observers
To ensure quality of the data and uniformity in survey administration, trainings were planned at two levels
in each state. Level 1, three day training to master trainers and level 2, three day training to field team on

district level was given to conduct the survey. In Salem, the field team was trained along with the master
trainers of the 3 districts of Tamil Nadu. Participants were invited from DIET, RMSA, SSA and Teacher
Training Institutes.

The agenda of the training sessions included all aspects of the study an observer should cover during
survey. Detailed and in-depth information on the Stallings tool was provided along with the other tools
on each day of the training. Field visit to schools were organised where an observer could get maximum
knowledge and experience on how to administer the Stallings tool in the classroom before going for the
actual survey. The training agenda is given in appendix B.

The training process included the followed steps:

Hiring of field observers: To conduct the survey in the field, professionals with B.Ed/M.Ed degree
    with teaching experience were called for training. In Madhya Pradesh, initially DIETs were considered
    to participate in the survey. Later, this idea was dropped due to limited number of faculty members
    in DIETs, already entrusted responsibilities of faculty members and location of districts. Another
    option was to consider DIET students for the survey. Based on discussion with Rajya Shiksha Kendra
    and DIET principals, it was decided not to consider them as they had just 12 years of school education
    and may not have enough experience to conduct classroom observations for class 10. Later, based on
    the recommendations of the Rajya Shiksha Kendra, professionals were hired from College of Teacher
    Education in Gwalior and Institute of Advanced Studies In Education, Jabalpur. Observers for Jhabua
    were from the pool of experienced professionals from Jaipur who had previously worked in educational
    projects in Rajasthan conducted by EI. This was done because at the time of training, Jhabua and Dewas
    were having elections, so to avoid delay in training the survey team was built in Jaipur. In Tamil Nadu,
    observers were selected from the DIET faculties and SSA, based on the availability of officials keeping
    in mind the scheduled routine work.
Classroom Training: On the first day, the training focused on the Stallings tool and how to administer
    it with the help of tablet. Day 2 and day 3 were more focused on clearing doubts from the classroom
    observations made on day 2 and day 3 (Table 11).

Note: Observers for Jhabua were trained and hired from Jaipur. This was done because at the time of training, Jhabua and Dewas
were having elections, so to avoid delay in training, the team was built in Jaipur. The trainees chosen for training were of high
quality. They have worked on education projects in schools earlier. Training in Salem had over 20 observers and 10 master trainers,
so the selected trainees were only 10. In Vellore, more officials were trained for building the capacity in the system and only 10 were
selected for the survey. In the Bhopal master training, 3 master trainers were chosen to train officials at the district level.

Field visit: To get hands-on-experience of the Stallings tool, all participants were taken to actual
   classrooms on day 2 and day 3 of the training workshop. In school, they were assigned 2 classrooms
   each day to observe using the Stallings tool on tablet. In total, four classrooms were observed by each
   participant to get in-depth knowledge of the tool during the training period. The challenges faced by
   the participants during the school visit were shared and discussed in the second half of day 2 and day 3
   along with individual experiences of each participant.
Written Test: To maintain high quality of the study, all participants went through a written test
   prepared by the World Bank’s Master Trainer. Participants were selected based on their performance
   on this written test, understanding of the Stallings tool and a positive attitude towards the study.
   Participants who scored 65% or more marks on the written test were selected to work on the
   survey. For those who scored close to the cut-off, their doubts were further clarified and they received
   additional hand-holding.

4.5	Survey in Schools
Actual field work involved 3 key stages: 1) Planning, 2) Conducting the survey in schools, and, 3) Auditing
and data collection.

Planning
Making the survey and route plan: A route plan to visit schools was prepared by the EI state coordinator
   with the help of the district nodal person. The total number of schools scheduled for each day was
   based on the number of persons available for the survey on a specific date. Each school was visited and
   surveyed independently by one observer as per the schedule. This was prepared in advance and was
   shared with the World Bank.
Informing schools about survey: The DEO (District Education Officer) informed schools about
   the visit in Madhya Pradesh and schools were informed by the CEO (Chief Education Officer) in
   Tamil Nadu.
      In Madhya Pradesh, a letter was issued by the DEO in each district to all the secondary schools
        of the district and not just the schools which were selected for the survey. The letter mentioned
        the survey and requested to support the team from EI visiting the school for survey. The selected
        schools were not informed especially about the visit beforehand.
      In Tamil Nadu, the schools were informed in the following way:
         Coimbatore: A letter from the CEO’s office was sent to all 28 schools mentioning the date of
            survey. After completion of 7 - 8 schools, date of visits was changed for the remaining schools
            and surprise visits were made. To avoid bias in the classroom observations, in some of the
            schools both classroom observations were made on day 1 and remaining work if any was done
            on day 2.
         Salem: RMSA informed all secondary schools in the district having class 9 and class 10 about
            the survey via e-mail. On day 1 of the survey, some schools complained that they were not aware
            about the survey. As a result, a letter from CEO was sent to all 28 schools mentioning date
            of survey in their school. After completion of 10 schools, the date of visit for the remaining 18
            schools was changed. This was done to avoid bias in the classroom observations.
         Vellore: A letter from the CEO was sent to all secondary schools having class 9 and class 10
            that their school may be visited from 15 to 18 December as part of the survey. No school was
            informed about the exact date of visit and survey was done as per scheduled plan.

Conducting the survey
Visiting schools for survey: Selected surveyors were informed about the survey schedule and they
   visited schools as per the schedule. Each school’s survey was completed in 1-2 days based on the
   availability of teachers in the school and other logistical considerations (Table 12).

Activity of surveyor in school: The surveyor performed the following activities in school on day 1 and
   day 2:
   1.	 Reach school before the school starts.
   2.	Meet the principal to explain the purpose of the visit. Obtain details like whether teachers
       teaching Mathematics and Hindi/Tamil in class 10 or class 9 are present in the school and
       timing of the class. Based on the timetable, classrooms were selected for observation by the
       field observer.
   3.	Before going in the classroom, the observer briefed the teacher whose class he/she was going to
       observe, about the process of classroom observation.
   4.	Completed classroom observation for one subject. If the teacher was available for the second
       subject, then the second observation was also completed on day 1 else it was done on day 2.
   5.	After classroom observation, the student questionnaire was administered to 5-10 students in
       the same classroom (25 percent of classroom strength with minimum 5 students and maximum
       10 students).
   6.	Requested the teacher whose classroom was observed to fill the ‘Teacher Understanding of Student
       Knowledge’ tool. Before the teacher started answering the questions, each teacher was briefed
       about the tool and its objective and that it was not necessary to answer all the questions.
   7.	Filled the school questionnaire with the help of the principal and teacher on day 1 and complete it
       on day 2.

Auditing and data collection
Visiting schools for spot checks: The EI team continuously visited schools during the survey period
   for spot checks. Every day, 1 to 3 schools were visited by EI team members in each district during the
   survey. They spent some time in school and observed how observers carried out the survey activities.
   Observers were guided by the team on how to maintain quality in their work and follow standardization
   in survey activities. Apart from this, a team member from the World Bank also visited 2 schools in
   Gwalior and 2 schools in Coimbatore for spot check along with EI auditors.
Syncing Stallings tool data: At the end of each school visit day, the EI team used to meet all observers
   at 1-2 central points and synchronized the Stallings tool data in the tablets.
Checking supporting tools: The EI team also checked supporting tools on a daily basis which were
   completed in school by the principal, teachers and students. Observers were guided to complete
   missing data, if any, the next day.
Receiving the tools back: On completion of the survey in each school, the EI team checked all the tools
   and received completed tools back from the observer. After the survey completion in all the schools,
   the tablets were taken back and data was synchronized.



                                                                                    4.  Field Operations   17
4.6	Material Packing and Delivery
Once all the schools were surveyed and all data collected from the observers, all the data was packed
school-wise in separate envelopes and quality check was carried out before sending to the EI office for data
entry and analysis.


4.7	 Video Shooting of Classrooms
The list of classrooms and teachers to be recorded was received from RMSA in Madhya Pradesh and
from the DEO of each district in Tamil Nadu. These classrooms were recommended as the teachers in
these classes were considered effective in the classroom. Video recording was done with the overarching
objective to study patterns of instructional activities across subjects and teachers and common teaching
practices that result in effective learning.

A team of 2 people was selected in each school for video recording. The schools were informed in advance
about the visit so that teachers were available during the specified date and time of the survey. The video
recording was completed by mid-December 2015. Given below is the schedule during which video recording
was carried out. Overall, 31 Language and Mathematics classrooms recommended by the RMSA across the
states of Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were observed and recorded (Table 13).

Two cameras were used to capture the classroom; 1 stationary camera documenting the class (students)
and 1 mobile camera documenting the teacher and his/her interaction with students. The cameras used
were high resolution DSLR cameras and wireless microphones were used to ensure good audio-visual
quality. During the shoot a clear list of do’s and don’ts was followed.

Classes were recorded in real time without any major pre-preparation by the teachers. Subtle indicators
such as teacher-student interaction before and after class, comfort of students during class, and teacher-
student relationship were observed to assess the authenticity of the recorded classroom. At no point was
the teacher/natural classroom environment disrupted for the purpose of this recording.

Students, during the class, were engaged in different activities like copying from the board, reading
textbooks or responding to the teacher. The student footage was shot mainly to gauge how much of the
students’ attention and interest the teacher could hold and by what measure. At no point were the students
made to repeat or speak louder for the benefit of the recording.

Guidelines for video shooting in the classroom were developed (Table 14).


Process of Analysis
1.	The raw footage for each of the teachers was seen multiple times to get a sense of the different teaching
    practices and teacher behaviors. An exhaustive list was developed which was then logically divided into
    larger buckets and put into a framework.

Table 14: Video shooting guidelines
Do's
   Follow the guidelines and place the cameras accordingly.
   Talk to the teacher at the beginning of the class to understand what he/she is planning to do.
   Explain the purpose of recording the classrooms briefly to the teacher and tell her to communicate the purpose
     of your visit to the students at the beginning of the class.
   Inform students to be aware of the microphone in the middle of the classroom so that it doesn’t get unplugged.
   Try and minimize interactions with the students/teachers during the classroom.
   Thank the teacher and students at the end before leaving.

Do Not's
   Do not interrupt the teacher/students during the classroom to record something specific.
   Do not make the teacher/students repeat something just for the camera.
   Do not engage with the students while the class is going on.
   Do not make eye contact with the teacher/students during the classroom to help them from becoming conscious
     of the recording.

2.	The footage was watched again to select clips that would be the best representations to demonstrate
    the condensed list.

3.	Frequency of occurrence of a certain trait across teachers was checked for, to understand the
    importance of each selected trait.

4.	Multiple opinions were sought to analyse the same footage.

5.	The selected traits were further divided under GENERAL and SPECIFIC (Subject specific) traits.

6.	 Final clips were selected to be used in the Teaching Practices videos.


4.8	Data Entry and Cleaning
During the study the following tools were used to collect data from the field with a brief description of the
process followed to collect the data:

Stallings tool: Was administered using tablets. Data was stored in pre-determined csv format (comma
     separated values).
SOS log: Was filled by observer on an A4 sheet after the classroom observation.
School questionnaire:  Was administered using tablets. Data was stored in pre-determined csv
     format. The questionnaire was filled by the principals.
Student questionnaire: Was administered in the paper-pencil mode. The questionnaire was filled by
     students.
Teacher understanding of student knowledge: Was administered in the paper-pencil mode. The
     questionnaire was filled by teachers.

After the survey was complete, the student questionnaire, TUSK and SOS log tools were collected at a
central location and data entry was carried out. Data entry was not required for the Stallings tool and the
School Questionnaire as it was administered on tablets. Other tools and questionnaires were converted to
pre-determined digital format by trained data entry persons. Data entry was done for only multiple choice
questions type, free response questions were not captured digitally. To analyse free response questions,



                                                                                           4.  Field Operations   19
all the tools were scanned and saved in soft copy format. There was no special treatment required during
data entry.

Data cleaning steps were specific to each tool. Though some steps were common:

Ensuring that correct school name and UDISE code has been filled
Ensuring that there are no duplicate records
Ensuring that school name and UDISE code match across different tools
Ensuring that only valid values are entered in each cell

The data cleaning steps for the tools are as follows:

Stallings tool: For the Stallings tool, apart from the steps mentioned above, a lot of data cleaning was not
required. But data was analysed to check for the following:

If each classroom observation has 10 snapshots
If each snapshot has teacher activity marked
If all the other mandatory fields are filled for each snapshot or not

Snapshots belonging to one classroom observation for excessive similarity to ensure that observers had
properly filled the snapshots and not just randomly marked the same observation multiple times.

School questionnaire and student questionnaire:

Valid codes for each column were checked and ensured that each cell had only one value or was
    blank.
At the time of data entry, some of the school data was selected at random and cross checked to see the
    quality of data.
In questions where more than one option had to be selected, the options not chosen were considered
    as ‘No’ and chosen options were considered as ‘Yes’.
If the student had marked two qualifications for father or mother then entry with higher qualification
    was considered.

5. Analysis Methodology


This chapter summarizes the key objectives behind each of the questionnaires which was used in the survey
along with the methodology used to analyse the respective datasets.


5.1	Stallings Tool and Sos Log
The key objective of the Stallings tool was to understand classroom practices in government schools
especially related to teacher availability, instructional time and nature of tasks. Data from the Stallings tool
and SOS log was analysed to answer the following questions:

What proportion of time was devoted to learning related activities, classroom management activities
    and activities which are off task

Use of materials in teaching learning processes and the type of materials used.

Analysis of classroom practices, nature of task and material used by school characteristics such as
    type and location of school.

How engaged students are in the classroom and what proportion of the classroom is not involved with
    teachers on average.

Prevalent enrolment and attendance rate in the classrooms and if there are any differences based on
    the factors such that gender, school type and location.

Percent of students using textbooks and notebooks in the classroom.
Any bias towards a specific gender in the classroom.

Primarily descriptive statistics were used to analyse data captured through the Stallings tool. Except for the
attendance rate at the beginning and end of the class which were summarized through mean values, other
fields were analysed examining distributions in the class either across the time dimension or across the
number of student dimension. Each of these fields were further analysed by districts, type of schools and
location and relevant findings were included in the report.

During classroom observation, surveyors were also asked to record any unusual or noteworthy information
in the form of the comments in each snapshot. These comments were later analysed qualitatively by
distributing them into distinct themes which emerged from the analysis of all the comments. It was decided
to report these themes and relevant comments as anecdotes since the instructions did not require that
comments be recorded for each snapshot.

Similarly for the SOS Log tool data, the quantitative data which was mandatory to be recorded for each
classroom was analysed using descriptive statistics. To analyse SOS log data, those records which were
observed in ‘Only Girls’ or ‘Only Boys’ school as it would not have been possible to observe gender inclusion
in those schools. Also there were large numbers of blank entries in SOS log data. Two options were
considered – 1) 'Filling the blank cells with neither option, or 2) Rescaling the rest of the entries to 100
percent and the latter was chosen.' The comments were analysed qualitatively and presented in the form
of anecdotes.




                                                                                 5.  Analysis Methodology   21
5.2	School Questionnaire
The school questionnaire was primarily designed to support the overall objective of understanding
classroom practices better and how much time is available for teaching and learning activities in an
academic year. The second objective was to collect data on the various background factors of interest
which may have direct or indirect influence on the classroom practices of the respective schools, teachers
and students surveyed.

How many school days (in the previous academic year):

Were prescribed (by the state/districts/local body authorities) for the primary schools/grades to
    function?
Did the school function in reality? What accounted for the loss of time between allocated days and
    actual days available?
Teachers were unable to attend schools due to personal leave, training and other duties?

In addition, the school questionnaire collected information about:

How many hours teachers spend on academic activities vs non-academic activities?
Availability of infrastructure and learning materials in schools.
Materials used by school and teacher characteristics.

Analysis of functional days in schools, teacher absence and time spent on academic
and non-academic activities
School and teacher questionnaires included some items to analyse how many days schools were open
in the previous academic year, how many days teachers were unavailable in schools and how much time
teachers spent on academic and non-academic activities. Along with this, data on the official number of
days schools were supposed to be open in the previous year, if there is any recommended number of days
teachers need to do training and if there are any guidelines on the time break up between academic and
non-academic activities.

Before analyzing the data, a sanity check was run and outliers were removed. In some instances, the entered
data was double checked with the respective schools.


Availability of infrastructure and learning materials in schools
A battery of 12 questions was asked to analyse infrastructure availability in the school. An additive index was
created by adding the responses to these 12 questions. Since all the questions were asked in affirmative
only, there was no need to reverse direction in any of the questions.

Similarly for ‘Material and Resources’, an additive index was created with one difference that all the questions
were not included in creating the index. In the ‘Material and Resources’ section of the questionnaire,
respondents were not only asked about availability of the index but also if it was functional and being used.
So in creating the index, only questions which asked about functionality and usage were included. A separate
analysis was carried out to check what percentage of resources was actually used by students.


5.3	Student Questionnaire
The student questionnaire was primarily designed to collect information on how students perceived the
particular class which was observed by the evaluator. This information was useful in understanding if the




  22    What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
classes in each district were held as usual during the observation or if the classroom behaviour changed
due to the observation (Hawthorne Effect).

Apart from this, the questionnaire also collected information on student background, time spent on
studying at home, perception about school, studying pattern and co-curricular activities.

Most of the data in student questionnaire was analysed independently to understand the background of
students who are attending the schools included in the survey. Two indices were developed – 1) An additive
index was created to analyse the facilities and appliances available at home based on data collected in
item 7 and 2) An additive index was created to analyse student’s perception of good teaching practices in
class based on data collected in item 14.

For analysing good teaching practices, 9 questions (shown in the appendix) were identified within item
14 which corresponds to good teaching practices. To ensure that all the items identified contribute to
the theme of good teaching practices, a correlation matrix was calculated to check if all the items have
positive correlation with each other. Based on this exercise, questions '14.F' and '14.O', which had a negative
correlation with the rest of the items, were dropped. Cronbach's Alpha had a value above 0.5, so the index
was retained for analysis'.


5.4	Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge (Tusk)
The teacher-wise question-wise data was analysed to gain insights at two levels: Overall performance at
state and district level; and Individual question level.

For this 8 multiple choice questions in Mathematics and 7 in Language were considered. While there was
no direct comparison made between states to say that a given state was better or worse than the other, the
data was analysed and presented for the two states together so that insights could be drawn for the same
question for both the states.




                                                                                 5.  Analysis Methodology   23
6. Discussion of Findings


6.1	Days Prescribed by the School Calendar and Teaching Time in Schools
In Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu the school calendar is released every year at the state level. This
calendar defines the number of leave days, working days, optional holidays, what will be taught in each
month and exam dates/duration, etc.

In Madhya Pradesh, the number of functional days expected during the preceding academic session (2014-15)
was 251 days and the expected number of days on which class should be held (excluding exams) in schools
was 207. But it was found that, on average, classes were held for 179 days in schools (Figure 12).

In Tamil Nadu, the number of functional days expected during the preceding academic session (2014-15)
was 210 days, while classes were supposed to be held for 183 days. It was found that, on average, classes
were held for 182 days (Figure 13). It is noteworthy to mention that in Madhya Pradesh, schools run 6 days
in a week with 6 periods (4 hours) per subject per week and in Tamil Nadu schools run for 5 days in a week
with 7 periods (4.4 hours) per subject per week.

6.2	 Tracking Teachers’ Teaching Time in Schools
To track a teacher’s time being spent in schools, data was collected at two levels – 1) Percent of time the
teacher is physically present in the school, and 2) When present at school, how much time is being spent by
the teacher on academic and non-academic activities. This section describes the findings on each aspect.

Every teacher marks her attendance at school in the attendance register. This register captures the day the
teacher had taken leave, was sent on training and/or spent the day on official duty. This data was used to
calculate the total days teachers were found to be available at school. In Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,
the data was taken from these registers and provided to the survey team by the teacher or the principal of
the school. In MP, the surveyors randomly checked the data from the register based on need and on a case-
to-case basis. In TN, it was taken as provided by the principal of the school.


Availability of teachers in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
On average, teachers reported that they were not physically present in school for around 18 days in
Madhya Pradesh and 21 days in Tamil Nadu during the academic year 2014-15 on which the school was
functioning (Table 15).

In Tamil Nadu, classes should have been officially held for 183 days but teachers were present in schools
for 161 days only. As reported by the principals in Tamil Nadu, the teaching load of a teacher who is not
present in the school is shifted to a teacher who is present in the school to ensure that classes are held
as per schedule. Similar analysis for Madhya Pradesh was not done because there could be an overlap
between the number of days when the teacher is not present in the school and number of days when the
schools did not function.

The number of days of personal leave taken by teachers is comparable in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil
Nadu and does not vary a lot across districts. The number of days spent in training is almost double in
Tamil Nadu compared to Madhya Pradesh. Balaghat and Gwalior reported approximately 2 days of training
which is significantly less than 6 days being spent by teachers in the other 4 districts. Discussions were
held with state officials in Madhya Pradesh about how these trainings get organized and the criteria used to
decide who will receive training. Based on their inputs we understood that trainings are provided to those
teachers who have shown weak performance during the previous academic year. In the last year training
was provided to 13,000 teachers out of approximately 43,000 teachers in the state.

Overall, teachers in Jhabua were not physically present in school for 22.5 days which is the highest among
all the districts surveyed.

Overall, female teachers in Madhya Pradesh tend to be present in school for more days than male
teachers, while in Tamil Nadu presence of male and female teachers was found to be similar

(Table 16). Data also reflects that female teachers received less days of training when compared to their
male counterparts across all districts except Gwalior. Similarly, male teachers were sent more on other
duty work like elections, census, scholarships, etc. when compared to female teachers. In Madhya Pradesh,
during the discussion with the state officials they shared that some male teachers are more willing to
attend trainings and hence their number of training days can be higher than others. The reasons could be
that male teachers are comfortable going for trainings while female teachers find it difficult to go alone or
have other family responsibilities or avoid going to far off locations to attend trainings.

It is interesting to note that in Madhya Pradesh, 71 teachers out of 156, i.e., over 45 percent, reported that
they had not attended any training in the last year. In Tamil Nadu, 16 percent teachers did not receive any
training in the last year.

In Madhya Pradesh, young teachers (aged up to 30 years) and teachers with experience of up to
10 years were available in schools for more days when compared to other groups of teachers. In
Tamil Nadu, this trend was not observed (Table 17). In Madhya Pradesh, more experienced teachers
were sent more on official duty, while in Tamil Nadu, teachers with 11 to 20 years of experience were sent
more on official duty. In Tamil Nadu, leave taken by teachers increased with an increase in the average
age of the teachers.

Teachers’ time spent in classroom on academic activities and non-academic
activities
In Madhya Pradesh, schools are typically open for 36 hours per week (6 days x 6 hrs per day). Schools follow
three types of daily timings: 1) School starts at 10:30 AM and closes at 4:30 PM, 2) School starts at 7:30 AM
and closes at 1:30 PM and 3) School starts at 11:30 AM and closes at 5:30 PM. If two schools run in the
same building then type 2 and type 3 timings are usually followed. In this discussion, type 1 school timing
is considered (Table 18).

Ideally, teachers are expected to reach school at 10.30 AM and remain in school till 4:30 PM, i.e. 6 hours
per day and students remain in school from 11 AM to 4 PM i.e. 5 hours per day. So, teachers get around
1 hour of time to do office work other than teaching, when students are not in school. In the remaining 5 hrs,
50 minutes are spent in morning prayer and lunch, so a teacher is left with a maximum time of 4 hours and
10 minutes to teach in school. Based on the number of sections and number of teachers available in school,
a teacher is allotted classrooms. A teacher can teach 2 classes per day to a maximum of 6 classes per day.
So based on this a teacher can teach a maximum of 24 hours in a week.

In Tamil Nadu, schools work 5 days a week and the school timings are uniform across the state. Schools
open at 9 AM and close by 5:20 PM. It is important to note that there are extra classes held for grades 7 to
12 from 4:20 PM to 5:00 PM. To keep uniformity with Madhya Pradesh, extra class time is not considered
while calculating hours available for teaching and non-teaching activities. In Tamil Nadu, 8.3 hrs per week
is spent on prayer and breaks for students. A teacher is expected to teach 28 periods per week i.e. 18.6 hrs
of teaching time and has available free time of 12 periods i.e. 8 hrs per week of free time where she can
prepare for class or non-teaching activities.

Note: The information presented here is based on the discussion with Additional District Project Coordinators (ADPC) of a district
in Madhya Pradesh and of Tamil Nadu.

In this survey, teachers were asked to report number of hours they spend on academic and non-academic
activities. Academic activity means the number of hours spent on teaching and preparation for teaching.
Non Academic activity means the number of hours spent on non-teaching activities. During the survey in
Madhya Pradesh, it was observed that in most of the schools teachers came at 11 AM and not at 10:30 AM
and left mostly along with the students. Teachers reported that on average 17.8 hrs of time in the week was
spent on academic activities and 9.1 hours on non-academic activity (Table 19). Similarly, in Tamil Nadu
teachers on average spent 21.1 hrs per week on academic activity and 4.0 hrs per week on non-academic
activity. In Vellore, 29 teachers out of 53 teachers reported that they spent 0 (zero) hours on non-academic
activity. Many reported that they spent only 1-2 hours.

Gender equity of teachers' classroom behavior
The objective of this analysis is to check gender bias, if any, in the classroom. To do this analysis, 4 specific
questions were asked to the observer who observed the class. The observer had to report if the teacher was
asking questions in the class and to whom, and if the teacher scolded (reprimanded) or praised (encouraged)
any students or a particular group. Along with that the observer also reported if the teacher gave leadership
opportunities such as asking to discipline/monitor the class, distribute learning materials, and organize
charts, etc. to a particular group only. These questions were compiled in a separate questionnaire which
is attached in the appendix. Co-educational schools in the sample were considered for this analysis and
included 108 classes from Madhya Pradesh and 124 classes from Tamil Nadu.

Overall teachers’ attitude and perception was not different for girls and boys. During classroom
observation, teachers were asking questions without any gender bias in 76 percent of observations
in Madhya Pradesh and 87 percent of observations in Tamil Nadu (Panel A, Figure 14). The concern
here is that teachers were not asking any question to students in 6 percent of observations in
Madhya Pradesh and this was found in 20 percent of observations in Jhabua district. Neither

All students were encouraged in 56 percent of observations in Madhya Pradesh and 79 percent of
observations in Tamil Nadu (Panel C, Figure 14). The other side of this analysis shows that no student
was encouraged in 35 percent of observations in Madhya Pradesh. Leadership opportunities were
provided only in few observations in Madhya Pradesh, and in Tamil Nadu this percentage was 82 percent
(Panel D, Figure 14). Similar to the rest, here also both boys and girls were involved when any leadership
opportunities were given.


6.3	Students’ Presence in the School
Average class size for schools in the study based on enrolment was found to be 56 in Madhya Pradesh and
38 in Tamil Nadu. Average attendance of 39 was recorded in Madhya Pradesh and 33 in Tamil Nadu on the
day of the observation which translates to 70 percent attendance rate in Madhya Pradesh and 88 percent
attendance rate in Tamil Nadu.

Girls’ enrolment is almost equal or higher than boys’ enrolment in all districts observed (Figure 15). There
is no significant difference in the attendance rate for boys and girls or in rural and urban schools except in
Balaghat (Figure 16). Balaghat being a rural area, only 4 urban schools were included in the sample.

No significant difference was found in the attendance rate at the beginning of the class and end of the class
for both boys and girls (Figure 17).

Along with enrolment and attendance, students’ perception about school and studies was analyzed to
understand their willingness to come to school. As part of the student questionnaire, a few students
were asked about whether they like to come to school every day and perceive education as important
(see example in Figure 18).

More than 3,000 students answered these questions and 93 percent of students shared that they look
forward to come to school daily and feel that it is important to do well at school (Figure 19). Overall, only 1
percent of students do not want to go to school daily and 2 percent of students said that it is not important
to perform well in school.

6.4	Classroom Practices
This section looks at what happens in the classroom when a teacher is teaching, in which type of activities
teachers are spending most of their time, what type of materials they are using and what students are
doing when the teacher is teaching. In both the states, almost 90 percent of classes were found to be
scheduled for 40- 45 minutes (Figure 20). It was found that most classes (87 percent in Language and

Time spent on different types of activities in the classroom
The Stallings snapshot observation method was used to capture different types of activities in the classroom.
Many activities were recorded and these activities were grouped into four different categories: i) Active
instruction, ii) Passive instruction, iii) Classroom Management and, iv) Off-task (Table 20). An activity is
categorised as active instruction when teachers are directly engaging with students and passive instruction
if students are involved in activities like copying what the teacher has already explained or completing
assignments or class work while the teacher is more likely to monitor the class rather than engage directly.
Classroom management occurs when the teacher is organising the classroom to maintain discipline, and
off task activities are defined as instances when the teacher or student(s) are not involved in any learning-
related task.4

Overall, almost 89 percent of teachers’ time across the two states was spent on instructional activities which
includes active and passive instruction (Figure 21). The Stallings benchmark suggests that at least 85 percent
of time should be spent on instructional activities for effective use of classroom time. Almost 8 percent of time
was absorbed in classroom management activities like managing or organising students, taking attendance,
discussing time schedule and explaining homework. It is possible that teachers might behave differently
during a classroom observation and observed sessions can be considered best practice scenarios. However,
the way a teacher engages with students is very much dependent on practice and behaviour.

The general distribution of categories is similar across Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu but there is
significant difference in time being devoted to instructional activities, especially active instructional activities.
In Tamil Nadu, teachers are devoting almost 94 percent of time on ‘Instruction’ while it is 83 percent in
Madhya Pradesh.

In Madhya Pradesh, 11 percent of teachers’ time is spent in classroom management and 6 percent of time
in off task activities (Figure 22) while in Tamil Nadu, 5 percent of class time was observed to be spent on
classroom management and only one percent of time was used for off task activities (Figure 23). This
shows that teachers in Madhya Pradesh are spending less time in learning related activities compared to
teachers in Tamil Nadu. Breakup of off-task activities in Madhya Pradesh shows that for around 2 percent
of the total class time teachers were out of the room and spent 4 percent of time off-task (on social
interactions with students).

District-wise data shows that teachers in Coimbatore devoted almost 80 percent of time to active instruction
while in Gwalior teachers spent only 61 percent of time on active instruction. Gwalior shows the highest
time spent (7 percent) on off task activities compared to other districts.

Teachers are spending more time on ‘Discussion’ and ‘Reading Aloud’ in Language than Mathematics.
‘Assignment/classwork’ and ‘Copying’ activities occupy higher percentage for Mathematics than Language
(Table 21). Observers found that most Mathematics teachers solve examples on the black board and
ask students to copy it down which may be the reason more time is spent on classwork and copying in
Mathematics classrooms.

‘Instruction, demonstration or lecture’ and ‘Assignment/class work’ dominates teachers’ task in
classroom which takes up almost 50 percent of the class time in Mathematics and language classes. It
is interesting to note that 17 percent of class time (which in effect is about 7 to 8 minutes) is devoted for
discussions across subjects.

6.4.1	 Materials used in the classroom
Classroom practices and teaching methods can be better understood by analysing the type of materials
used in the classroom. Most teachers rely heavily on using blackboards and for more than 20 percent of
time spent on instructional activities no learning material was used in the classroom. This section includes
material where students were involved with teacher. Student groups who were unengaged have not been
included in the charts below.

Teachers are using the black board for more than 50 percent of time in Mathematics classrooms
(Figure 24). In Madhya Pradesh, around 26 percent of class time was spent without any learning materials
(Figure 25) and in Tamil Nadu this proportion was 14 percent (Figure 26). Notebook or paper-pencil was
used for almost 15 percent of class time in both the states. These numbers do not differ signficantly across
districts in each state.

Use of learning aids is limited and maximum use of learning aids like charts, graphs, posters, currency,
compasses was observed in Coimbatore.

Co-operative learning and use of ICT is non-existent in both the states (these categories do not appear in
the charts because they were not observed in any significant numbers). Material is reported as co-operative
when students use any material but work together on a common task to produce a common product and
ICT is used for any kind of electronic learning aid like, radio, television, videos or computers. Surveyors
observed co–operative learning only in 3 classrooms in Gwalior and 1 classroom in Vellore.

It is insightful to see which activities are carried out in the classroom while different materials are being
used. The blackboard and chalk are the most prevalent teaching aide (Table 22). When it is being used,
56 percent of the time teachers were engaged in ‘Instruction, Demonstration or Lecture’ in the Mathematics
class, while ‘Discussion’ was observed in only 16 percent of the time when the chalk and blackboard are
used. The next most frequent learning device was the notebook: in these cases, ‘Copying’ was observed
42 percent of the time. Interestingly, discussion was most frequently found when no teaching materials
were being used.

In Language classes, ‘Textbooks’ are used most in the class, for 40 percent of the class time in both
Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, followed by ‘No material’ which is used for 30 percent of the class time in
Madhya Pradesh and 20 percent of the class time in Tamil Nadu. Learning aids are used for less than one
percent of the class time in Madhya Pradesh and 7 percent in Tamil Nadu. Black board is used for almost
25 percent of class time. Similar to Mathematics classes, very rare usage for ICT and co-operative learning
was observed. ICT was observed in two classes in Coimbatore but at both the places teachers used their
own devices in the classroom and it wasn’t a school driven practice.

  38        What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
It is interesting to see that when ‘Textbooks’ are used in Mathematics class, the primary activity is ‘Reading
aloud’ but when it is used for Language, the primary activity is ‘Instruction, demonstration or lecture’ which
was observed for 44 percent of total textbook usage time (Table 23). When ‘No material’ is in use, the top
activity is ‘Discussion’ for Mathematics and Language both.

observation (Figure 30). In Madhya Pradesh, in 56 percent of classes all the students had textbooks and in
36 percent of classes more than half of students had textbooks. Similarly, in 64 percent of classes, all the
students had notebooks and in 32 percent of classes more than half of the students had notebooks.

Engagement levels in the classroom
As part of the Stallings tool, the observers also note the number of students that are engaged with
the teacher in learning. Observers note whether one student is engaged, between 2 and 6 students
(categorised as a ‘small group’ activity), more than 6 students but not the whole class (‘large group’ activity)

Student involvement was higher in Tamil Nadu with the entire classroom paying attention for around
73 percent of the class time (Figure 31). The number for Madhya Pradesh was significantly less at
41 percent. Both states reported at least a large group of students working with teachers for around
90 percent of the class instructional time.

Off task behaviour
Teachers were found spending around 4 percent of total classroom time on off-task activities. It would be
useful to understand what these activities are and how much time is going into each of them. The Stallings
tool recorded 3 types of Off-task activities – 1) Social interaction with students, 2) Social interaction with
others, and 3) Teacher out of the classroom. The data shows that teachers’ off-task time is split equally
between social interaction with others and going out of the classroom (each with 45 percent of total off-task
time). Teachers are spending very less time in social interaction with students.

Students: This section looks into the activities of those students who are not involved with teachers in the
classroom. The key objective here is to understand:

If these students, though unengaged with the teacher, are still involved in learning activities or are
    spending their time in unproductive activities (Off-task).
The composition of these students, whether large group of students are unengaged or only small
    groups.
The extent of unengaged behavior.

For almost 55 percent of the class time, the entire class is involved in the activities being carried out by the
teacher in the classroom and for another 5 percent of the time the entire class is off-task when teacher
is busy in classroom management or engaged in off-task behavior. So this section will only focus on the
rest of the instances when few or many students are uninvolved. These cases have been classified into 3
categories for further examination:

Cases when a large group is involved with the teacher (33 percent of the class duration, on average).
Cases when a small group is involved with the teacher (2 percent of the class duration, on average).
Cases when one student is involved with the teacher (6 percent of the class duration, on average).


Group composition and activity breakup when a large group is involved with the teacher
This category is most critical to understanding what students are doing when they are not involved
with teachers as it accounts for more than 75 percent of such cases. Almost two-thirds (62 percent)
of the time small groups of students were not involved with the teacher and 80 percent of the

Group composition and activity breakup when one student was involved with teacher
When a teacher was engaged with 1 student, in 63 percent cases a large group of students was doing
the same activity and only 37 percent of the time the class broke up into smaller groups (Figure 33). This
suggests that in most of these cases there was discipline in the classroom and students were working as
instructed by the teacher. The activity breakup also suggests the same; in 68 percent of cases students
were involved in instructional activities.

Correlation between classroom practices and school and teacher factors
Correlation analysis was carried out to find out if factors related to class, teacher or school have any impact
on classroom practices such as time spent on different activities in class or engagement level of students.

Findings from the correlation analysis show that:

Teacher rating is moderately positively correlated with time spent on ‘Instruction’ and ‘Engagement
    level’.



                                                                                     6. Discussion of Findings   41
Effective teaching practice as perceived by students is moderately positively correlated to student
    engagement levels.
Infrastructure and learning materials available in schools does not impact the time spent on
    instructional activities.
Class size does not influence time spent on instructional activities.


6.5	Infrastructure and Resources
School infrastructure and resources can have an impact on students’ learning and it is essential to have
basic facilities to encourage teachers and students to come to school regularly. Data related to school
infrastructure and resources was collected for each sampled school through the school questionnaire.

Infrastructure availability in schools
Data on school infrastructure was also analysed to understand which items were present in most of the
schools and which were less readily available (Figure 34). Barring a compound wall and backup electricity,
more than 80 percent schools surveyed had other infrastructure items. Other noteworthy points with regard
to infrastructure are as follows:
Overall 97 percent schools reported ‘pucca’ buildings.
More than 92 percent schools in both Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu reported having a separate
    toilet for girls.
Only 45 percent schools in Madhya Pradesh have a compound wall.

The school questionnaire checked for 11 different items related to school infrastructure. An additive index was
created based on the 11 indicators. The school infrastructure index was further divided in three groups; index
value between 0 to 4, 5 to 8 and 9 to 11 indicating low, medium and high categories (respectively) (Figure 35).

Most schools in both the states have good infrastructure and facilities. Seventy-four percent of schools
in Madhya Pradesh and 90 percent of schools in Tamil Nadu have an index value between 9 to 11. Only
2 schools were found to have an index value of 4. These schools are in Balaghat and both these schools
have a ‘pucca’ building and separate classrooms and cupboards. One of the schools had electricity while
the other has a separate toilet for girls. Overall, there is no significant difference in school infrastructure in
Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

Learning resources availability in schools
Learning resources include materials which can directly or indirectly help achieve learning among students.
The school questionnaire included 9 different items on availability of learning resources. A learning
resources availability index was created using the additive method. Here, the index range is 0 to 3, 4 to 6
and 7 to 9 (the maximum achievable value for each school is 9).

In Tamil Nadu, more than 96 percent of schools show a learning resources availability index ranging from
7 to 9 while in Madhya Pradesh overall, 38 percent of schools scored in the same range (Figure 36).
In Madhya Pradesh, schools from Jhabua district show the highest availability of learning resources and
Balaghat scores the lowest on the learning resource availability index. One school in Balaghat shows an
index in the 0 to 3 range though it has a blackboard, charts and chalks in each class.

  44     What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
6.6	Head Master and Teacher Background
Teachers’ education and training, behavior, attitude, and perceptions shape the way students learn in their
classroom. Information on these factors were gathered through the school questionnaire.

Overall in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, across sampled schools, 72 percent head teachers are
males and 28 percent head teachers are females. In Madhya Pradesh, the number is higher with almost
80 percent head teachers being males. 88 percent head teachers have a master’s degree. 84 percent
head teachers in Tamil Nadu have an M. Ed teacher training degree while 15 percent head teachers in
Madhya Pradesh have an M.Ed. degree.

In Madhya Pradesh, 35 percent head teachers have attended in-service training in the last 12 months while
58 percent attended in-service training in Tamil Nadu. Head teachers had teaching experience of almost
20 years before becoming a head teacher.


6.7	Student Background
International evidence shows that a student's socio-economic status and parents’ education have a big
impact on a student’s learning. In this study, in each sampled school, 5–10 students from an observed
class were asked different questions on age, social and economic background, and parents’ education and
occupation. In addition, some other contextual questions were asked, relating to whether students received
assistance with academic work outside school, what amenities they had at home, etc. These questions
were asked as part of the student questionnaire.

Mostly grade 10 and very few grade 9 classrooms were observed during this study. Around 50 percent
students in Madhya Pradesh and 74 percent students in Tamil Nadu are 15 years old. In Madhya Pradesh,
schools have diverse groups in terms of age as at least 18 percent students are younger than 15 years and
more than 30 percent students are older than 15 years. This diversity of student ages poses an additional
challenge to teachers in responding effectively to the different educational needs of their students.

Students’ Home Amenities
Thirty-four percent students in Madhya Pradesh and 61 percent students in Tamil Nadu report that they live
in a ‘pucca’ house (Table 24). More than 95 percent students reported that they had 2 or 3 meals at home
on the day before the observation (Figure 40).

The student questionnaire listed 14 amenities which were used to create an additive index (Table 25).
Overall, 20 percent students reported having more than 50 percent amenities available at home. Overall,
comparison of amenities at home shows that students in Tamil Nadu are better off than their counterparts
in Madhya Pradesh (Figure 41). It is interesting to note that 90 percent students have mobile phones
though some other basic facilities are missing. More than 94 percent students reported having electricity
at home which is a critical utility.

6.8	Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge
In each district, 28 Mathematics and Language teachers each, teaching class 10 were administered the
Teacher Understanding of Student Knowledge (TUSK) questionnaire to check whether they could identify
errors made by students (Table 26). The questionnaire was voluntary with no time limit.

Overall Performance
On an average language teachers got 50 percent of the questions correct and Mathematics teachers got
40 percent of the questions correct in both states. Overall performance data shows that there is very little
difference in performance between Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu teachers.

Among all districts, the relative performance of teachers in Gwalior is highest in Mathematics as well as
Language (Table 28). Relative difference in Mathematics performance is quite small.

There were, however, significant differences in the types of questions which teachers were able to
answer correctly.5 In particular, teachers were less able to identify student errors on questions related to
subject material covered in higher classes (8, 9 and 10).


Question-wise analysis - Mathematics
For some of the concepts covered in lower classes, as in the example below, teachers seem to be
able to predict student errors correctly.


                                                                                                                   Grade 5 or 6

Sample question 1: Around 77 percent teachers in Madhya Pradesh and 65 percent teachers in Tamil Nadu
were able to point out the error made by students correctly. However, compared to Madhya Pradesh,
significantly greater number of teachers in Tamil Nadu were not able to identify the error correctly;
31 percent Tamil Nadu teachers think that students have not understood addition in this case.

Sample question 2: Around 69 percent teachers in Madhya Pradesh and 64 percent teachers in
Tamil Nadu were able to correctly point out the error related to lowest common multiple made by
students.


5	 Moreover, it is also noteworthy that not all teachers answered all the questions and it may that they were more likely not to
   respond to questions about which they were not less sure of the answers.

        In an exam, around 40% of the class was not able to answer the question
        “which is the least number that is a multiple of both 98 and 84?”

to predict student errors correctly.

Sample question 3: Teachers seem to think that students are confusing addition of fractions with division
of fractions. In fact, in this example, the method is perfectly correct and will work for any fraction.

Responses to some of the questions of higher class levels (classes 8, 9 and 10) seem to indicate that
teachers might have the same wrong notions as students.

Here is a student’s “proof” to show that 1 = 2.                                                                                             Grade 8 or 9

Sample question 4: Almost 50 percent of the teachers in both Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu seem to
think that there is no error in the given proof, even though this ‘proof’ concludes that 1 is equal to 2. They
might be missing the fact that division by zero occurs in step 3, which is an error.

Given log 1.25 = 0.0969 evaluate cube root of 0.000125.                                                                         Grade 9 or 10
A part of a student’s working to the above problem is shown below.
                 −                                                    A       10.4%

                                  −
Therefore 3 0.000125 = anti log ( 1.3656)
Which of the following do you agree with?                             D                            37.3%

A.  He has made a mistake in step (1) in calculating log 0.000125.
B. He has made a mistake in step (2) as he should be multiplying      0%   10%    20%     30%   40%       50%     60%   70%     80%   90%     100%
    by 3, instead of dividing.
C. He has made a mistake in step (3) as he is interpreting the                                  MP                TN
    logarithm as -4.0969.
D. There is no mistake in his working.



Sample question 5: This is a concept that is taught by class 10. Majority of the teachers in Madhya Pradesh
as well as Tamil Nadu seem to have a wrong notion that there is no mistake in the working of the student.
                              −
Even they probably think that 4 .0969 = –4.0969.

Question-wise analysis - Language
In a similar way, teachers of language were able to identify the errors in questions which were based
on a relatively simple text (a poster) but were less successful with questions which were based on a
story and required higher levels of comprehension.

 Antara
 The windowpane creaked a little on its hinges, as it was slowly pushed open. A thin beam of light furtively ran
 over the furniture, pausing for a brief second on a piece of metal that sparkled in the velvet darkness.
 Both men quietly stepped over the windowsill into the marble-floored room, their rubber-soled slippers making no
 noise. Hearing no sound, Badri flicked on the flashlight again and surveyed the room. Birju’s jaw dropped open as
 his eyes tried to take in the wealth that lay around. Badri reedily smacked his lips. “Birju, we’ve hit the jackpot!”
 Badri pointed to the massive ceilling-to-floor cabinet of burnished wood holding slickly - designed electronic gadgets,
 television and audio system, flower vases and beautiful antique statuettes, on the right wall. ‘We didn’t wait in vain.”
 They had spent the entire previous week watching the goings-on in this spacious three-storeyed beach side
 bungalow. imported cars fleeted in and out, expensively dressed people bustled around, huge metal boxes and
 poles were brought in vans and carried into the house by workers. They were lucky to see a few film stars too.
 Everything had quietened down the day before. Everyone had presumably left on a holiday and the tow had
 chosen this moonless night to move in for the kill.
 Birju was running his hands over a large colourfully painted wooden panel set among the shelves of the cabinet.
 And before his amazed eyes, the panel slid open with a click, revealing a safe inside which spilled out gold coins
 on opening its lock.
 Badri’s heart was racing wildly. It was a windfall they hadn’t expected. They would be rich overnight.
 Birju’s head was chalking out plans rapidly.
 The sudden shrill whistle of the night guard pierced through the dark silence around. Badri and Birju almost
 jumped out of their skins. Without wasting another moment they hauled the huge, heavy sack over the window
 and dived after it.
 Two days after “hitting the jackpot”, Badri and Birju were back to roaming the streets. The sack of fake gold coins,
 the “antiques” of papier-mache and the gold-painted aluminium clock were lying in the junkyard behind their hovel
 in Dombivili, along with the hollow plastic cabinets resembling the VCR and the stereo. Sale of this “loot” had fetched
 them a total of 28 rupees from the junk collector. The two strangers in the tinsel town had not known that the
 mansion they had chosen for burglary was “Rang Mahal” which is lent out to movie producers for film shootings.

 5.	 What can we say about students answering option 2, from the data in the table below?
 A.	They don’t know the meaning of the word ‘Jackpot’ and have made a random guess based on the clue wealth
     that lay around’.
 B.	They don’t understand how valuable electronic gadgets, furniture, and antiques can be, and think that only
     gold is valuable.
 C.	They are unable to connect what event led to the exclamation, and have relied mainly on their previous
     knowledge of ‘jackpot’.
 D.	They probably don’t understand the meaning of several words like ‘antique’, ‘jackpot’ etc. and so couldn’t
     understand the story.

Sample question 7: While teachers seemed to be pointing out the incorrect connection students were
making between ‘gold coins’ and ‘jackpot’, they were missing the fact that the sequence of events is also
important in this case and students may be missing that critical piece of comprehension.




  52          What is Happening Inside Classrooms in Indian Secondary Schools? A Time on Task Study
7. Conclusion


The importance of teacher quality for improving educational outcomes is widely recognized. Measuring
teacher quality is a relatively new and expanding area of research that includes several components –
teacher qualifications, attendance, instructional practices, governance and accountability. While several
of these areas have been investigated in the Indian context, observing teachers’ classroom practices has
received little attention – especially at the secondary level. This study, for the first time, gathered information
on teachers’ time-on-task in secondary classrooms in India. The study systematically documented teacher
practices in grade 10 classrooms across 150 schools in 6 districts in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to
better understand how teachers are spending their time on instructional and non-instructional activities,
the kinds of teaching-learning materials being used for instruction and the extent to which the teaching
practices used are able to engage students in these classes. The findings indicate that while the majority
of teaching time is spent on instruction, the use of materials beyond the blackboard and textbook is very
limited. Further, instruction is most often directed at the entire class or a large group of students in the
class with few instances of the teacher focusing on small groups or individual students. We also find that
these patterns vary across the districts included in this study requiring further exploration into factors like
teacher recruitment and training that might be related to differential district patterns.

The findings from this initial study have several implications for policy and further research. More and better
evidence from classroom observations is needed to gain a more holistic picture of teachers’ instructional
practices in secondary classrooms and to identify teachers’ training needs. This information must be
coupled with data on students’ learning outcomes to make direct linkages between the kinds of classroom
instructional practices that result in higher student engagement and learning. Finally, international
classroom observation techniques like the Stallings and CLASS6 tools offer a new and cost-effective way of
thinking about alternative forms of teacher training. These tools can be used by principals, district officials
and teachers themselves to generate discussions on effective classroom practices and provide direct and
timely feedback on practices that could potentially improve the quality of teaching and learning in secondary
schools.

   of Teaching and Learning at the University of Virginia.
