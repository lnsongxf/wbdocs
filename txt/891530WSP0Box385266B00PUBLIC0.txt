T
       he main objective of this report is to contribute towards the formulation of
       a coordinated vision for Mexico’s Financial System for Water (Sistema de
       Financiamiento del Agua or SFA) by laying down definitions, a conceptual
framework, and a set of concrete proposals and recommendations that will allow
the SFA to operate effectively under the leadership of the National Water Com-
mission (Comisión Nacional del Agua or CONAGUA) and with the support of the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público or
SHCP). The importance of addressing this issue from a medium- and long-term
perspective stems from the need to understand the growing challenges faced
by Mexico’s water sector as an engine of economic development and poverty
alleviation.


    The water sector in Mexico faces many challenges and properly addressing them requires an
analysis of the financing sources available for the sector and of their viability as a tool to reach the
sector’s objectives. This analysis should be embedded in a model of integrated water management to
ensure the rational use of water at local and regional levels. Against this backdrop, formalizing the SFA
is seen as a means to integrated management of water resources rather than an end in itself.
    This report presents a proposal to formalize the concept of an SFA supported by the World Bank,
providing CONAGUA with solid conceptual foundations, and offering suggestions to achieve the stra-
tegic coordination of the flow of financial resources towards the water sector. The next step to this
report would be to formalize the SFA, and then devise a financial strategy and implementation tools.
    The report examines the SFA through basic concepts and its current legal framework, and defines
the SFA as follows: “A subsystem of the Mexican financial system composed of (public, private, and
social) institutions that channel resources from different financing sources (public and private) to the
various (public, private, and social) programs and investment projects aimed at the development and
management of water resources and associated water systems; these financial resources are chan-
neled through a range of instruments and mechanisms, in accordance with relevant legislation and
regulations, and taking into account sustainability, economic efficiency, and equity criteria.”

        he abundance of financial resources that characterized the second half of
        the 1970s and early 1980s, originating in the country’s rise as an oil power,
        and the relatively large supply of external credit, made it possible to sig-
nificantly extend the country’s water infrastructure. Among other things, the total
irrigated area was expanded and existing irrigation systems were rehabilitated; the
development of the humid tropics was given a boost; and several bulk water sup-
ply systems were built for urban centers and industrial ports. However, changes
in the financial conditions, severely affected investments and operations and
maintenance of water infrastructure.


     In the late 1980s, the overreliance on fiscal resources for the development of water programs
further exacerbated its financial problems. Aside from funding provided by international development
banks—by then already limited—no other funding sources were available. The sectors that benefited
the most from the water works and associated services as well as the benefiting state and municipal
governments were encouraged to shoulder a larger share of the burden, but with limited success.
The declining revenue from service charges for water supply and sanitation services, the low service
tariffs in relation to total costs (mainly covering the cost of operations and maintenance), and the cost
of irrigation services in certain agricultural areas strained the federal government’s limited resources.
     In 1986, the LFD introduced a set of fiscal reforms that included charges for the exploitation, use, or
usufruct4 of the nation´s water resources and their inherent public goods.5 However, the lack of clarity of
the new regulations, along with the delay in updating the charges on water rights6, limited the financial
resources collected in real terms. In 1990, the Contribution to Improvements in Public Water Infrastructure

   Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution states that all surface and groundwater, except water that flows through a
single property or lies beneath one, belongs to the Nation. It also lists the “national waters,” which include territorial
seas, lagoons, lakes, rivers and their tributaries, etc. The “inherent public goods” refer to so-called federal zones (land
close to waters) and sand and gravel found in river beds.

   While there is no universally agreed definition of a water right, it is usually understood to be a legal right to withdraw
and use a quantity of water from a natural source such as a river, stream or aquifer.

 Part 1: Background and Concepts



M
          exico’s water sector is currently facing a severe crisis, despite the substan-
          tial increase in investment funds allocated to it. This crisis is character-
          ized, among other things, by an increase in the number of overexploited
aquifers; the deterioration of the quality of water in rivers and other water bodies;
the increase in the number of conflicts over water; the growth in the coverage of
water supply and sanitation services, be it with services that are inefficient and of
relatively low quality; and the hidden threat to dams and other important water
infrastructure, in light of extreme hydro-meteorological events that are becoming
more frequent and intense.


       The current crisis is very likely to escalate if corrective measures are not taken. In essence,
it is necessary to tackle a series of weaknesses that afflict the entire sector, among others, the low
efficiency and effectiveness of the numerous investment projects and programs that operate in an
uncoordinated manner. This lack of coordination, in turn, has led to overlapping programs, inefficient
use of public resources, and a lack of comprehensive policies.



The Financial Challenge

Analyses of possible future scenarios suggest that in order to successfully address the future chal-
lenges in water, an annual investment of over Mex$50 billion will be necessary over the next 20
years.13 The most likely scenario corrected for the climate change impact would increase the gap
between supply and demand of water by 58 percent, which would require additional annual invest-
ments of Mex$12 billion a year. Other estimates (for example, Fernández, 2011) show that the above
figures could be on the low side if the financial requirements to rehabilitate and/or replace the existing
infrastructure, and the costs of addressing extreme events, in particular floods, are also taken into
account.

    STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM FOR WATER IN MEXICO:
2   FROM A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO THE FORMULATION OF PILOT INITIATIVES




             Given the financial limitations of the public sector, which even under the most optimistic scenarios
         would not be able to allocate substantially more resources to the water sector, it is evident that the
         investments required are considerable. Financing these investments will require resources from dif-
         ferent sources. At present, the financial resource mix appears to rely excessively and increasingly on
         taxpayers, something that is definitely not sustainable and should be corrected; the funding provided by
         users should be increased significantly.

                                                                              Starting Point


1.1  Legal Foundations of the SFA

The amendments and additions to the 1992 National Water Act (Ley de Aguas Nacionales or LAN),
which took effect in 2004, include the Title Eight Bis (Título Octavo Bis), consisting of a single chapter
entitled “The Financial System for Water”.
      Article 111 Bis of the LAN provides the legal basis for the creation of an SFA. In fact, the third
paragraph of this article clearly establishes what is expected of the SFA. Article 112 of the LAN has
been aligned with the provisions of the LFD regarding the payment obligations of the users of national
waters, for the exploitation, use or usufruct of such waters and their inherent public goods—bodies
of water that are used for the discharge of wastewater. Thus, by charging levies for water use, article
112 Bis to a large extent sustains the funding of actions and programs undertaken by the water sector
to reach its medium- and long-term objectives.14
      Even if the provisions of the LAN are confined to “the rates of the levies charged for the water
use as well as other federal taxes and tariffs established for the use or usufruct of water, or for the
provision of services related to water infrastructure works,”15 including the contributions to partially
or totally recover the cost of federal investments in this area, the Act itself leaves open the pos-
sibility of extending the SFA to achieve a coordinated funding mix that also includes other public
and private resources (article 111 Bis, second paragraph), as is currently the case through different
mechanisms.
      The challenge for the government is to make the provisions of the LAN operational and incorpo-
rate them into the various programs and projects at the federal, state, and municipal level. As stated in
the first paragraph of article 111 Bis, the federal executive shall define, create, and implement the SFA.
The fastest legal path to attaining this would be the regulation of articles 111 Bis, 112, and 112 Bis.16 This
would confer legal status on the SFA, thereby securing its long-term sustainability.




14 
    The provisions of article 112 Bis of the LAN in a way provide a solid legal argument to earmark the revenues resulting
from the provisions of the LFD on the exploitation, use, and usufruct of national waters.

Notes: (1) The general tax concept includes the proceeds from the collection of the water use and wastewater
discharge levies. (2) Water Resources Management includes all the actions necessary for the comprehensive
management of the water resources (to control water quantity and quality), as well as those necessary to preserve
vital ecosystems. (3) The resource flow derived from SFA is not static; it should be seen as a financial flow in a given
timeframe.

  As pointed out in figure 1, although the SFA is to a large extent linked to CONAGUA’s sphere of competence, it should
also include the investment programs and projects related to other subsectors that use water such as the energy,
industry, and tourism sectors.

                            Towards the Formalization
                                           of the SFA


P
       rograms, projects, and activities in water are currently implemented through
       different financing mechanisms, without having to resort to an SFA. However,
       the financing is channeled through a large number of federal programs with
overlapping operating rules and eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the financing gap
is increasing so a framework to coordinate and improve the efficiency in the public
spending is required. The formalization of the SFA could contribute to improve the
abovementioned and will also ensure the compliance of the LAN. Formalizing the
SFA would facilitate the encoding of experiences and, thereby, the creation of a
permanent system for reviewing, updating, and improving the different transac-
tion mechanisms, aside from promoting the adoption of new and innovative forms
of financing.


     The need to manage the financial arrangements for the sustainable development of water
resources and its associated services has been highlighted in a recent report by the OECD (2012),
which points out that there are several opportunities for Mexico to raise the efficiency of public
spending in the water sector. In this context, one of the aims of formalizing the SFA would be to create
an instrument that would make it easier to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the
multiplier effect of the public resources applied to the programs implemented in this sector.



3.1  The SFA and CONAGUA’s Scope of Competence

According to the conceptual framework presented in Figure 2, CONAGUA coordinates the relationship
among the institutions providing financing and those demanding resources to finance their programs and
projects,48 including CONAGUA itself as administrator of the national waters. As shown in the conceptual

    Although initially the SFA would operate in the realm of programs that are under CONAGUA’s care (water supply and
sanitation, agricultural irrigation and drainage, flood control, and IWRM), it would be possible and desirable to extend
the concept to other sectors.

       s part of the work that led to this report and as a result of the dialogue with
       CONAGUA officials, a number of initiatives were analyzed that could be
       incorporated into the SFA. Four of these initiatives (technological upgrad-
ing and modernization of irrigation and emergency services for floods) are further
presented here and could be implemented as pilot projects. The report presents
general considerations for potential initiatives on water and sanitation and on the
development, management, and usufruct of national waters, as well as the use of
public domain goods as wastewater-receiving bodies.

4.1  Background

Water for agriculture is channeled through irrigation districts and irrigation units,50 designed to trans-
port large volumes of water to the fields under a shift-irrigation system. At present, producers who
use irrigation systems still employ practices and technologies that were adequate at one time but
nowadays are no longer acceptable due to their low efficiency, combined with the shortages of water
and conflicts over this resource.
     However, farmers are reluctant to change their current irrigation practices. The reason for
this is twofold: (i) the high cost of modernizing an irrigation system, which cannot be financed with
easily accessible credit; and (ii) the fact that mandatory water-saving and efficiency actions have
been undermined by policies that enable farmers to get their water and energy relatively cheaply.
There are just not enough business mechanisms and innovative, long-term credit instruments that
allow for a more effective financial participation of all the parties involved; moreover, the financial
participation of farmers, particularly small, will require subsidize interest rates to make the credit
affordable.
     A series of proposals and tools to optimize available resources and facilitate access to credit for
investments in the upgrading of irrigation infrastructure and plot technological upgrading will be dis-
cussed briefly. These tools, as well as the existing ones, would not be mutually exclusive: combinations
involving different mechanisms, resources, and parties can be made to create the best fit for every
specific situation or project.



4.2  Overview

In rural areas, water management is usually characterized by practices that promote water to be
wasted, as well as the overexploitation of aquifers. To reverse this situation, the federal government

    The “irrigation districts” are areas of land linked to a principal project. The “irrigation units” are systems that receive
irrigation from water sources (including wells and springs) that are somewhat dispersed. The main difference between
the two lies in their origin. The infrastructure of the irrigation units was built primarily by the federal government and
right at the start handed over to the users for its administration, and O&M. While the irrigation districts were also built
by the federal government, their administration, and O&M were the responsibility of the federal government until being
transferred to the users in the 1990s.

5.1  Background

Mexico is exposed to different types of disasters. The geographic location of the country makes it
particularly vulnerable to seismic and volcanic activity, while its location in the inter-tropical region
makes it susceptible to tropical storms along the coasts of the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean, and the
Gulf of Mexico. These tropical storms periodically affect the populations by causing strong winds and
significant amounts of rainfall, leading to severe damages and widespread flooding. CONAGUA plays a
key role in the prevention of and response to disasters caused by these extreme hydro-meteorological
events.
      According to the National Center for Disaster Prevention (Centro Nacional de Prevención de
Desastres or CENAPRED), in the period 1980–99, Mexico suffered 75 disasters of a significant size,
causing over 10,000 deaths (see table 4) and hundreds of thousands of victims suffered from dis-
placement and the loss of valuable assets. The cost of direct damages in that period reached US$9.6
billion, giving a yearly average of approximately US$500 million. If indirect damages are also taken into
account, that is, the interruption in the production flows of goods and services, at least another US$40
million a year would have to be added.58 Table 4 shows that the total number of fatalities caused by
hydro-meteorological phenomena is 2,767 persons. Total direct damages for these weather-related
disasters have been estimated at US$4.4 billion.

T
        he 1992 legal reform of the LAN incorporated a series of economic instru-
        ments to manage the water resources of the country in order to encourage
        a more efficient allocation and use of water. One of those instruments are
water rights and by creating the possibility of transferring the rights associated
with their respective concession titles, the LAN established a market for rights.
This is a regulated market, since third parties and water quality are invariably
affected—externalities that prevent the market from operating adequately when
left alone.


6.1  The Water Rights Market

The basic characteristics of the water rights market, established in 1992 and amended in 2004, are
the following:

      ●●   Article 25 of the LAN states that “The concession holder may totally or partially modify the use
           of the water licensed, as long as the consumptive use established in the corresponding title is
           not altered, provided the change is final and the concession holder provides timely notice to the
           Water Authority for the purpose of updating or modifying the respective discharge permit and,
           where needed, updating the REPDA.” Authorization will always be required when changes are
           made to the consumptive use stated in the corresponding title; the point of withdrawal;59 the
           discharge site; or the volume or quality or wastewaters.”60
      ●●   General provisions (articles 33 to 37 of the LAN) regulate the transfer of water rights outside
           the irrigation districts and units.
      ●●   The possibility of “establishing final or temporary agencies to manage the regulated opera-
           tions of the transfer of water rights, called water banks, is defined. The Bank’s functions will be


59 
    The process of abstracting water from any source, either temporarily or permanently; most water is used for irriga-
tion or treated to be safe for consumption. Water withdrawal is also known as water abstraction or water extraction.
60 
    This is an important restriction of the free transfer of water rights, meant to ensure that the rights of third parties are
not affected nor is the quality of the water that down-stream users benefit from. It should be noted that what is set forth
in this article concerning the regulation of water right transfers has not been put in practice.

                  Water Supply and Sanitation


There are multiple challenges in the financing of water supply and sanitation services:

    ●●   Lack of financial viability of most water utilities. State laws proclaim the obligation to set
         tariffs that allow for full cost recovery. In practice, the tariffs, which must be approved by the
         local congresses, with some exceptions, do not fully cover real costs. Federal support, based
         on the current Operating Rules of federal supported programs, is lax when it comes to ensuring
         a proper tariff structure. The low efficiency of the water utilities substantially contribute to the
         financial deficit.
    ●●   Budget Cycle of Federal Support. The existing one-year budgetary cycle imposes severe
         constraints in the design and implementation of infrastructure projects.
    ●●   Competing Operating Rules of Federal Programs. The existing rules for the different federal
         programs in water supply and sanitation are not sufficiently linked to broader strategic objec-
         tives or results regarding financial efficiency and sustainability and the rules across programs
         are often with different types of requirements, some of them lax.
    ●●   Lack of Solvency of the Majority of Water Utilities. The vast majority of the water utilities
         and municipalities in Mexico do not have a sufficiently high credit rating that will allow them to
         access non-public sources of funding.


    The last challenge is the result of a complex set of institutional interactions summarized in Table 9.
For each challenge, the Table depicts, using Harvey Balls, the respective weight and responsibilities of
the main players. On a scale from 0 (white or empty Harvey Ball) to 100 percent (grey or full Harvey
Ball) the circles illustrate the relative influence that each player and framework has in making adjust-
ments to address a particular problem. The table depicts that CONAGUA has enough space to act
and improve in different areas, but other factors and players also come into play. A lack of willpower
from utilities, the existing regulatory framework, and several political factors are additional external
challenges that are not necessarily under the control of CONAGUA.
    The first salient point of this analysis is that the excessively low tariff levels are at the heart of the
financial problems faced by utilities. This has made it necessary to increase the subsector’s revenues
through taxation: either in the form of fiscal resources channeled directly through the PEF or the States’
expenditure budgets, or through other mixed financial programs such as PRODDER, APAZU, PROTAR,
PROSANEAR, and PROMAGUA (PROME), or special funds like the 1928 Trust Fund (Valley of Mexico).
    The proliferation of financial mechanisms creates a perverse incentive for the water utilities (or
the municipalities) not to raise because some of these programs provide capital and operation and

 Box 1.  Tariffs and Subsidies
 The tariff policy must take into account three basic aspects: (a) the efficient cost of the service provision;
 (b) the subsidy required for the low-income population; and (c) the financing mechanism of the subsidy.

 The tariff policy is directly linked to the financial policy. Costs that are not recovered through tariffs must
 be covered by the government through taxes and/or through the resources it receives from CONAGUA
 stemming from water use and effluent discharge fees. The amount to be paid by the government and
 CONAGUA to water utilities must be defined in advance, based on a multiannual plan that specifies the
 service goals, total costs, and the cost recovery through tariffs as well as the resources to be provided by
 the Government, which derive from taxes, duties, products, and water use.

 The tariff must reflect, as much as possible, the total cost of the provision of water and sanitation services.
 Sometimes this is not possible due to the socio-economic conditions of some users and the high cost of
 delivering these services, above all the result of obtaining new water supply and wastewater treatment
 sources. In these cases, the federal government must define a subsidy policy in order to help the low-
 income population, together with a financing mechanism that compensates for the subsidy payments,
 and a financing policy based on taxes, aimed at paying for the investments not covered by tariffs.

 The policy of subsidies implicit in the tariffs must be targeted exclusively at the lowest- income users.
 The identification of users who should benefit from the subsidy should be based on a detailed study of
 the socioeconomic conditions of the population. This study should include clearly defined objective and
 transparent criteria for the classification of the population, as well as reliable updating mechanisms.
 The consumptive uses of water that should receive a subsidy should coincide with the minimum level
 for subsistence and the corresponding tariff charged should be enough to at least cover operational
 costs and service maintenance. Some practical examples of identifying users who should benefit from a
 subsidy are: (i) Chile, where selection criteria are based primarily on the level of income and consumption;
 (ii) Colombia classifies users according to their housing situation and location. In both countries, the
 subsidy compensation mechanism is clearly established. In Chile subsidies are compensated with
 federal government tax resources, while in Colombia they are compensated through cross-subsidies
 and/or municipal government tax resources.

 The implementation of the tariff policy will not succeed if it does not go hand-in-hand with mechanisms
 that provide incentives for an efficient service provision and efficient commercial management together
 with high collection, invoicing, and measurement rates.

S
       ince its establishment in 1989, CONAGUA has promoted different policies
       to meet the financial challenges faced by the water sector given the rising
       demands resulting from a growing population and a higher rate of economic
growth. CONAGUA has gained much experience in the design and implementation
of financial instruments that would comply with the long-term vision objective in
water to achieve the sustainable and equitable management of water.


Based on the experience acquired and the current legal framework, a dialogue was started with a
large number of interested parties to discuss how best to structure and implement the SFA.. As a
result of this dialogue, a conceptual framework was developed for the various components of the SFA
and CONAGUA’s legal role in this context as derived from the LAN, which would allow formalizing and
institutionalizing the SFA in the short term. It was argued that CONAGUA has the technical and admin-
istrative capacity to add value to the experience accumulated over more than 20 years by formalizing
the SFA, through the joint efforts of its specialists and the financial and fiscal authorities. To this end, a
series of steps and actions are suggested.
    The second part of our work consisted in identifying a series of initiatives that could be incorpo-
rated into the SFA, alongside existing experiences. Two of these initiatives aim to provide additional
mechanisms to promote additional activities for the modernization and technological upgrading of
irrigation systems; two other initiatives aim to support programs in natural resources response and
prevention. These initiatives undoubtedly require further analysis, in order to determine their feasibil-
ity and a roadmap for their implementation, as well as a methodology to monitor and evaluate their
potential results and impacts.
    One of the core issues that must be addressed is the provision of additional support for the
modernization and technological upgrading of the irrigation districts and units, including the parcel
level. Despite the efforts made to date, especially through the programs and mechanisms instituted by
CONAGUA and SAGARPA, there are still inherent limitations associated with the lack and discontinuity
of budget resources, and with access to financing and producers’ guarantees. The analysis has shown
that FONAGA’s guarantee scheme, strengthened with additional resources provided by CONAGUA,
makes financing more accessible and takes advantage of the management structure of the financial
intermediaries (especially from outside the banking sector), thereby increasing the number of secured
