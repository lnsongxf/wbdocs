EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Technological adoption and innovation will play a crucial role in delivering the
goals laid out in the Government of Ethiopia’s Growth Transformation Plan
(GTP). Innovation is now widely recognized as a major engine for productivity
growth. “Innovation implies technologies or policies that are new to a given country
context or society. They are not necessarily new in absolute terms but can be
technologies and practices that are being diffused or absorbed in that society or
economy1.”This is particularly important for Ethiopia that is aiming to move up the
domestic value chain and move up the quality ladder. The role of government in
fostering innovation is crucial. In addition to facilitation and enhancing enabling
environment, the state may have to play a more active role to address market failures
and coordination across multiple stakeholders.

While the world is becoming increasingly competitive, it is important for many
businesses to be innovative by challenging themselves to come up with new and
different ways of doing things. Innovation is widely regarded as the important
element that enables firms to thrive in today's global business environment.
However, empirical evidence shows that there is a low level technological
innovativeness amongst Ethiopian firms.2

Innovation also plays an important role in the GTP which seeks to transform of
the Ethiopian economy from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized
economy. Ethiopia has not been able to foster and accelerate structural
transformation as envisioned in the GTP. In fact, Ethiopia’s past high growth decade
has been fueled by large services and agricultural sectors. These two sectors are very
important to the economy, together accounting for almost 90 percent of GDP between
2003/04 and 2013/14. At the same time the manufacturing share in GDP is at just
above 4.1 percent of GDP3.

The Government plays a pivotal role in facilitating inclusive innovation as well.
The large size of the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) calls for innovative ways to ensure
that this population has access to basic services such as health and education. 66
percent of the population comprises the BoP in Ethiopia subsisting on less than US$
2 a day. “Inclusive innovation4” is any innovation that leads to affordable access of

quality goods and services creating livelihood opportunities for the excluded
population, primarily at the base of the pyramid and on a long term sustainable basis
with a significant outreach. It seeks to provide better access to essential goods and
services with affordable prices, thereby improving quality of life, and enhancing
economic empowerment of the excluded populations, primarily at the BoP.

With this in mind, this study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze the extent of
innovative activities that formal firms are undertaking in Ethiopia using the World
Bank Enterprise Survey data; (ii) to conduct a review of the existing innovation
landscape; and (iii) to identify challenges and opportunities to foster innovations at
the base of the pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. By drawing on lessons from ongoing
innovation-focused interventions around the world, this study aims to provide
concrete policy recommendations to create an enabling environment for private
firms to undertake innovative activities to increase productivity, as well as to provide
innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty and facilitate more equitable growth in
the economy.

Innovation Performance in Ethiopia

Ethiopia’s innovation performance stifles its overall competitiveness. According
to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), Ethiopia ranks
109th out of 140 countries with a score of 3.7 out of 7.0 in the 2015-16 report. While
the overall score of innovation indicators increased 0.5 points in the past six years
(3.2 in 2015-16 from 2.7 in 2009-10), Ethiopia still lags behind in global
benchmarking on key innovation indicators and has room for improvement.

Increase in the R&D budget was a result of the increased headcount of R&D
personnel5 and not researchers. From 2010 to 2013, Government’s spending on
R&D, increased from 931.3 million ETB to 5,242.6 million ETB. As such, the share of
R&D spending as a share of GDP has increased from 0.24 percent to 0.61 percent.
However, a large share of this increase is on account of the increased headcount of
R&D personnel. The number of R&D personnel in the country has increased to 18,435
in 2013 from 13,095 in 2010, which is approximately a 41 percent increase.
Meanwhile, the percentage of the number of researchers6 that increased during the
same period was about 13 percent (from 7,283 to 8,218). This implies that the



5 R&D Personnel are all persons employed directly on R&D (researchers, technicians and equivalent staff), as well
as those providing direct services such as R&D managers, administrators, and clerical staff.
6 Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes,

methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned (UNESCO Institute for Statistics)

                                                                                               4

majority of the increase of R&D personnel was on account of the increase of personnel
other than researchers.

On the other hand, business sector spending on R&D has sharply declined.
Contrary to higher education and government institutions, the R&D spending by
business sector has decreased from 144.6 million ETB to 61.5 million ETB during the
same period, which accounts for only 1.2 percent of the total R&D spending in 2013.
Given increased global competition, success of Ethiopia’s industrial sector depends
on the firms’ ability to innovate7.

Innovation has a positive correlation to firm performance in Ethiopia. This
study explores the patterns of innovation levels and attempts to establish innovation
correlates in Ethiopia using data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (ES)8.
Innovation is captured by product, process, marketing and organizational changes
and improvements. Firms that have introduced product or process innovations in
Ethiopia show higher sales growth than those that have not. Similarly, process
innovation and spending on R&D appear to be triggers for employment creation in
Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that process innovation and spending on
R&D enhance labor productivity.

Firm level innovation compares less favorably to other comparator countries.
About a third of the surveyed firms report having introduced new products or having
improved their production or business processes (Figure A). However, the country
performs unfavorably vis-à-vis the selected comparators, as the share of firms that
innovate in Ethiopia is about half of the share of the firms that do so in both China and
Kenya.

Larger firms undertake a disproportionately large share of innovative activity
in Ethiopia. Among large firms, the share of firms who do innovate is larger,
especially in Ethiopia where the figure reaches just under 70 percent. In line with this,
smaller firms are less likely to spend in research and development, a fact that is
particularly noticeable in Ethiopia once again, vis-à-vis similar countries. Smaller
firms in Ethiopia report a lower rate of product or process innovation than similar
firms in China and low income countries and almost half the corresponding figure for
Kenya. Also, innovation varies depending on certain firm characteristics, such as the
sector in which the firm operates.

Ethiopian manufacturing firms are more likely to innovate than service firms
are. While this pattern is not specific to Ethiopia, the gap is substantially larger in
Ethiopia than in the comparator countries. This could be due to the fact that services
firms are more heterogeneous than manufacturing firms, pulling the average for the
services sector firms’ down. Another possible explanation is that services firms tend
to be smaller than manufacturing firms. Further, firms in the textile and garment, and
in the food sectors seem to have a higher prevalence of product and process
innovation than firms in other sectors. This is also consistent with the finding that
Ethiopian exports of textiles and apparel goods increased from 0.1% to 3.3 % of total
goods exported between the period 1997 – 2013.

Access to credit and the quality of the human capital, and the firm’s
commitment to invest in developing it, are also important for innovation. The
analysis shows that limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product
innovation in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage
points less likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained
ones, everything else remaining equal. The analyses also shows that providing
training to employees and allowing employees’ time to experiment are both factors

that positively correlate with the probability to engage in product innovation. These
findings corroborate the importance of human capital for innovation.

Role of Government

The Government plays an essential role in ensuring entrepreneurs, financial
institutions, academia and industry create wealth for the society through
innovation. By providing a conducive regulatory and policy environment, promoting
greater competition through openness to trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
and promoting an education system that is responsive to industry needs, the
government plays a central role in promoting innovation. The State will play a
particularly important role in increasing innovation for the BoP before the private
sector is able to build a profitable and scalable business solution. Hence, the
successful implementation of the STI policy would be one of the most critical factors
to ensure that innovative activity is undertaken in the economy and there are returns
to firms on these innovation investments in terms of increased firm level
productivity.

The Government of Ethiopia’s efforts to establish an enabling environment for
innovation have been initiated more than two decades ago, but its weak
implementation has deterred its effective establishment. The national Science
and Technology (S&T) policy of the country was originally adopted by the transitional
Government of Ethiopia in 1993 to boost innovation activities for economic
development through the application of science and technology9. However, it was not
followed up by detailed implementation of strategies and programs aimed at
achieving the envisaged policy objectives. Recognizing the important role and the
urgent need for innovation to increase the country’s sustainable development,
Ethiopia adopted a new Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy in February
201210. In addition, the Government has developed the STI policy implementation
strategy which supports the implementation of strategies envisioned in the GTP.

The implementation of the STI policy is crucial to facilitate linkages between
different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem. Figure B
shows the various actors and institutions relevant to the policy areas envisioned in
the STI policy. The key actors are structured into three broad stakeholder categories
namely: public sector; academic institutions; and industry. The public sector, include

government and its relevant agencies, support the import, adoption, and creation of
innovation knowledge and goods and services. Academic institutions, including
researcher, scientists and engineers affiliated with universities and research
institutions generate innovative knowledge, while industry, including large
corporation, SMEs, and start-up companies, produce goods and services.
Furthermore, academic institutions and industry would need to collaborate to
introduce and create new innovations that contribute to increased industrial
productivity.

Policy Recommendations

Implementation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy

The implementation of the STI policy for Ethiopia is crucial to facilitate linkages
between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem.
While the current implementation arrangement is in line with international practice,
key lessons learned from global experience emphasize the importance of inter-
ministries and inter-agency bodies creating a coordinated and coherent
implementation of STI-policies. A few recommended policy actions that Government
of Ethiopia (GoE) could undertake include:
 Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                            8
 in Ethiopia.


   •   Good Coordination mechanism. Given that the STI policy covers a wide range
       of topics which involve a number of organizations/institutions, a clear
       communication strategy among these stakeholders needs to be developed.
   •   Monitoring & Evaluation mechanism implemented. To monitor the
       progress of STI policy (and implementation strategy), the Key Performance
       Indicators need to be developed in line with GTP, national development
       strategy and disclosed to the public, together with their progress. This could
       potentially help inform future policy making.
   •   Feedback Mechanism from the Private Sector. Given the crucial role that STI
       Policy plays in the move towards an export led industrial growth
       transformation, the implementation of the policy needs to have clear
       ownership from the private sector.
   •   Robust National Quality Infrastructure (NQI). The STI Institutional and
       policy framework needs to support the development strategies for further
       strengthening the NQI which is crucial for the country’s transformation to an
       industrial led economy.
   •   Framework for Inclusive Innovation Policy. The STI Policy has been framed
       under the vision of “alleviating poverty and joining the mid-level income
       earning countries”. Herein lies the clear role for Government to spearhead a
       strategy to develop an adequate policy framework for inclusive innovation.

Promoting Greater Firm Level Innovation

Facilitating Early Stage Financing and Capacity Building

The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a clear
impediment to innovation. Impediments to accessing finance for small and young
firms stem from the demand side of financial markets. Like in other developing
economies, credit in Ethiopia is more readily available to businesses that have fixed
assets such as land or buildings to be used as collateral than to those having movable
assets, as banks strongly prefer property to secure a loan. An increase in the support
in other areas of the economy towards early stage innovation financing would be
beneficial to entrepreneurs who are unable to find sources of financing through
commercial banks.

Facilitating Learning from Exporting and Fostering Backward Links through Foreign
Direct Investment Growth
There is a need to promote linkages with and spillovers from foreign
investments with domestic firms. The Government has adopted policy focused on
the development of the manufacturing sector through the use of industrial parks to

                                                                                                9
     in Ethiopia.


attract FDI and to support SMEs11. It would be beneficial for the investment agency to
work actively with the investor community and seek out input providers and support
services they require that could be provided by domestic SMEs. The Government thus
acts as a facilitator and gathering information on possible opportunities for links,12
assisting in identifying partners (and arrangements) by matching suppliers’
capabilities and buyers’ needs (legal assistance, fairs, missions, conferences and
exhibitions, and so forth), and providing economic incentives to multinationals to
promote training and technology transfer from buyer firms to local supplier firms and
for SMEs to invest in training and capacity building.

Upgrading the National Quality Infrastructure

The government’s continued support to develop NQI is crucial for the country’s
transformation to an export led economy. Access to a good NQI is imperative to
assure that Ethiopian firms are able to enter and be competitive in international
markets by assuring that the quality of their services and products are aligned with
required standards in the international markets. To support innovation in the firm
level, in particular for exports, NQI services should be developed by incorporating
demand from the private sector.

There is a need to develop a long term implementation strategy for the NQI
policy framework in Ethiopia. While the NQI institutions have developed their
strategies, in particular the steps required to obtain international recognition, it is
important to develop a long term strategy which includes the government’s
commitment of budget allocation, as all NQI institutions require long term financial
support from the government. This will ensure that all these institutions can make
medium to long term action plans to implement their strategies.

To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-
driven NQI services. The development of a robust monitoring and evaluation system
is also critical to regularly review the effectiveness of the council and operation of
these NQI institutions.

12 Either directly or by supporting private institutions, governments promote the creation of information
exchanges that could range from lists of inputs and materials available locally—which might include prices and
qualities—to names, locations, and profiles of local suppliers.

     in Ethiopia.


Promoting Effective Industry- Research Linkages

Government can also provide its support to strengthen university-industry
linkages in order to promote innovation. A critical misalignment exists between
the research outputs from academic institutions and the technology needs of
industry. Furthermore, the type of curricula and skills endowments of the graduates
of universities do not match the immediate skill needs of industry13. To promote
collaboration and partnership between university and industry, government
programs; such as mini-grants and matching grants, to increase the incentives for the
cooperation is required. There is a need to better utilize the technology transfer
system that has been initiated in the Institute of Technologies (IoTs). Creating
incentives for researchers to collaborate with industry with this experience counting
towards a tenure track could ensure that researchers would be motivated to work
with industry. Finally, academic institutions should tap into the vast Ethiopian
diaspora to leverage on the global expertise and knowledge that they have by offering
them attractive short term assignments to work in the universities.

The development of the national implementation strategy for the newly
established Ethiopian Agricultural Research Council (EARC) is crucial. While the
development of innovation in agriculture sector has been prioritized, the emphasis
on the effective coordination among the relevant stakeholders and improvement of
the quality of the staff and research needs to be stressed. According to the
Agricultural and Transformation Agency (ATA) annual report, the establishment of
EARC was approved by the government. The EARC will coordinate and oversee the
integration of various research efforts made by the different research institutions. To
support the existing coordination issues, the development of the detailed strategy to
address the existing issues and strengthen the national agricultural research system
is critical. This should be actively coordinated with the National Science, Technology
and Innovation Council that plays an important role in promoting and implementing
the necessary support mechanisms to adopt innovative technologies.

Providing an Incentive Framework to foster Inclusive Innovation

It is important role for the government to increase innovation for the BoP by
addressing their low demand due to limited access to information. Inclusive
innovation can boost the welfare of the BoP by providing innovative products and
finding innovative ways to address their needs. However, several examples show that

research activity at Addis Ababa University found that none of the units at the university had set research
priorities based on national development objectives (Lemma 2008).

low levels of education among the BoP population hinder opportunities to gain
knowledge about potentially useful products. Establishing partnership with local
NGO or intermediaries to reach out to the targeted BoP population will be an
important element. The government has a role to play in developing a market for
inclusive innovation technologies that bear a high upfront cost leading to a lack of
incentives for the private sector to produce. The case of AAKASH Tablets in India
indicates the market for inclusive innovations can be developed by the government,
wherein the Government of India used demand side policies such as public
procurement by creating a market for low cost tablets. The government can also
provide its support to stimulate the adoption, adaptation, and generation of
innovative technologies by entrepreneurs, before the private sector is able to build a
profitable and scalable business solution. Ethiopia can leverage on existing initiatives
around the world by facilitating international linkages with firms and industry-
academia linkages to work on providing solutions.

Raising Awareness

The government has a key role to play in raising awareness of the private
benefits of undertaking innovative activities. This study has elaborated on how
government can facilitate innovative activity both to increase firm level productivity
and provide solutions aimed at addressing issues faced by the base of the pyramid.
Key barriers to inclusive innovation include consumer behavior, traditional business
models and information asymmetries that exist. The low rate of farmers’ adoption
rates of improved seeds is a case in point of risk aversion behavior that exists
preventing farmers from trying out something new. It is thus important for the state
to address this by increasing awareness and showcasing successful pilots to ensure
greater adoption of new technologies and processes. Finally, there is a role for
innovation to be encouraged amongst the young minds and for the school curricula
to encourage an innovation driven culture.

The objective of all the policy instruments reviewed here is to create an ecosystem
that fosters greater levels of innovative activity promoting greater productivity and
increasing Ethiopian firm competitiveness and increasing the supply of innovative
ideas aimed at addressing the needs of the base of the pyramid thus bridging growth
and equity for the Ethiopian economy.

CHAPTER 1: Innovation and Economic Growth in Ethiopia
1. Country Context

1.      Rapid and consistent economic growth of Ethiopia over the past decade
has contributed to reducing the number of people living in poverty. The country
has shown rapid and robust growth at a steady pace of around 9 percent since 2000,
when it was ranked the second poorest in the world, to around 10 percent in the last
ten years. This growth has been accompanied by a consistent decline in poverty rates:
in this same period of time, the proportion of people living under the national poverty
line has dropped from a staggering 44 percent14 to 29 percent. Ethiopia’s
macroeconomic conditions have also improved; deficits have declined and inflation
is lower.

2.     Nevertheless challenges to sustain its economic growth remain. In
relation to other countries in the region, Ethiopia has one of the lowest participations
of industry and manufacturing in GDP. Trade and services and manufacturing have
steadily grown since the 1990s, but remain relatively small when compared to
agriculture: in Gross Value Added (GVA) terms, agriculture represents about 45
percent of the economy, while trade and other services represent 19 and 21 percent,
respectively. Manufacturing, which is often most associated with structural change
only represents 4 percent of total GVA. In employment and productivity terms, the
gaps are spread even further.

3.     As is the case with economic growth, the challenges to reduce poverty
remain. While poverty incidence has declined, it still remains high. The poorest, who
despite being engaged in agricultural activities, tend to be net buyers of agricultural
goods. Productivity rates and exports have performed poorly (in 2013; the trade and
services deficit was around 16 percent of GDP), and the country’s output is highly
concentrated. Indeed, the share of agricultural employment to total employment in
2011 was around 78 percent, while its share in GDP was 45 percent15. Trade, other
services and agriculture are between 3 and 10 times less productive than the most
productive sectors, while employing almost 95 percent of the population16. This
renders Ethiopia both uncompetitive, as its trade deficit continues to creep up, and
highly vulnerable, especially to price shocks and natural phenomena such as
droughts, common in the region.

Plan (GTP)17, focusing on two overarching themes: fostering competitiveness and
employment and enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. This plan
recognizes that for poverty reduction and economic growth to be sustainable, the
Ethiopian economic structure will have to undergo a fundamental transformation.
Workers engaged in low-productivity jobs in the agricultural and informal sector
need to be reallocated to economic activities of higher productivity such as
manufacturing18.

5.     However, there still remains an unfinished agenda for the successful
structural transformation from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized
economy. Economic growth in FY2014, which grew real GDP by 10.3 percent
compared with 9.8 percent in FY2013, was driven mainly by the services sector,
which accounted for 5.3 percentage points of the growth, followed by industry of 2.8
percentage points thanks to a construction boom19. Agriculture, in turn, contributed
2.3 percentage points. However, the manufacturing sub-sector contributed only 0.5
percent to the GDP growth, less than the 0.7 percent contribution of the preceding
year. Moreover, the share of employment in the manufacturing sector has changed
only slightly and is virtually unchanged since 1999 at below 5 percent of total
employment.

6.     In accordance with a focus on poverty reduction and economic growth,
the GTP has identified five main levers for change: public sector investment in
infrastructure to lay the ground for private sector development, enhancement of
policies and regulations to provide an environment conducive to competitiveness and
productivity, expanding access to credit for small and medium size enterprises,
provision of training and education to augment the supply of skilled labor and
improved access to land. While a new GTP, covering FY 2016 and forward will still
consider agriculture as a fundamental element for growth, there will be an added
emphasis to structural change and an additional focus to foster the development of
the private industrial sector.

2. Role of Innovation

7.    Technological adoption and innovation will hence play a crucial role in
delivering the goals laid out in the GTP. Innovation is now widely recognized as a
major engine for productivity growth. “Innovation implies technologies or policies

that are new to a given country context or society. They are not necessarily new in
absolute terms but can be technologies and practices that are being diffused or
absorbed in that society or economy20.” This is particularly important for developing
economies that have potential for tremendous gains from tapping into the global
knowledge pool and adapting these to the local context. This ability will be important
notably in service industries, improving agricultural and industrial productivity and
for increasing service delivery in social sectors such as health and education.

8.     The large size of the BoP calls for innovative ways to ensure that this
population has access to basic services such as health and education. With the
majority of the population residing in the rural areas, agriculture is still the major
source of national income, accounting for about 40 percent of GDP, more than 80
percent of employment, and 70 percent of national export earnings in 2013/14,
according to the African Economic Outlook. 66 percent of the population comprises
the BoP in Ethiopia subsisting on less than US$ 2 a day. Ethiopia ranked 172nd out of
187 countries on the United Nations Development Program's 2013 human
development index, and average per capita incomes are less than half the current sub-
Saharan average21.

9.     “Inclusive innovation22” is important to address the needs of the BoP. It
seeks to provide better access to essential goods and services with affordable prices,
thereby improving quality of life, and enhancing economic empowerment of the
excluded populations, primarily at the BoP. The Government would play a pivotal role
in promoting technology either by directly supporting the development (and
adoption/absorption) of technologies or more indirectly by creating the enabling
environment to foster greater technological capabilities and innovative activity.

10.     Most industrial sectors in Ethiopia are highly fragmented and
characterized by a large number of very small enterprises and a small number
of large firms. This structure favors heavily large businesses, and leaves small and
medium businesses small and uncompetitive, constrained by lack of access to land, to
capital, to inputs and to markets at large23.

22 Inclusive Innovation is any innovation that leads to affordable access of quality goods and services creating

livelihood opportunities for the excluded population, primarily at the base of the pyramid and on a long term
sustainable basis with a significant outreach. Ramesh A. Mashelkar and Vinod K. Goel, “Inclusive Innovation:

11.      This competitive structure inhibits innovation across the economy (see
Aghion et al. 2005). Firms far behind the technological frontier may find investment
in innovation far too costly, while firms far ahead in the technological frontier see
little incentive in innovating, as their technological edge keeps them ahead of their
competitors in their current operating markets without the need for additional
investment.

12.   Promoting competition in the Ethiopian economy would therefore create
greater incentives to innovate. Moreover, further enhancing competition by
promoting openness to trade and FDI would increase the presence of foreign
competitors, which would in turn increase exposure, search and adoption of more
advanced technologies by both export and import competing firms (see Schiff and
Wang, 2006).

13.     Participation in foreign markets also induces firms to become more
innovative, a phenomenon known as “learning through exporting”, as observed
among Ethiopian leather exporters. As firms begin participating in foreign markets,
customers begin providing signals such as quality standards and requirements for
market access, which serve as an incentive to absorb methods and technologies to
become or remain competitive. Lederman (2009) shows using firm-level data from
enterprise surveys in several countries, that a firm’s export status (whether the firm
exports more than 10 percent of its sales) is positively correlated with the probability
that a firm innovates.

14.     Furthermore, research and development (R&D) is also a crucial
determinant of the ability for firms to innovate. In the same study, Lederman
(ibid.) finds evidence that a firms’ investment in R&D is significantly and positively
correlated with the probability that it will innovate. In developing countries however,
R&D falls within what Cohen and Levinthal (1989) refer to as the “second face of
R&D”, that is research and development oriented at absorbing new technologies and
keeping up with existing technologies worldwide, more so than aimed at developing
technologies that are new in absolute terms, an objective mostly limited to innovators
from the developed world.

15.    Another vital determinant of innovative activity is the accumulation of
human capital and the skill level of the workforce. An educated workforce can be
considered a pre-condition for a country to have the capacity for knowledge
acquisition and adaptation, especially in an environment in which firms face
competitive pressures that call for frequent changes in product mix and production

technology24. In his study, Lederman (ibid) finds evidence that the probability that a
firm innovates is related to the level of education of its personnel, and that there is a
link between the firm’s level of training and its degree of technological adaptation. It
follows therefore, that higher levels of skills and training typically will lead a firm to
identify new technologies that need to be adopted, in order to increase
competitiveness.

16.    Ethiopia, not unlike other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa presents
significant potential to vastly increase its output for the manufacturing sector:
a broad base of low-skilled labor and low wages and labor costs relative to
competitors. It also enjoys an abundant endowment of natural resources, and
Ethiopian exports receive preferential tax and tariff-free access to the US and
European markets. The potential is particularly latent in light manufacturing, which,
if spurred by innovation should provide the ideal platform to help Ethiopia move
away from exports of primary commodities and become an export of value added
products. While certainly not the sole substitute to agriculture, light manufacturing
presents the advantage within the context of Ethiopia of not requiring large capital
investments while being able to absorb a large pool if low-skilled laborers.

17.     In pursuing industrial upgrading, Ethiopia can fill the missing links in the
domestic value chain and move up the quality ladder, given the competitive
nature of the globalized economy. Moving up the value chain ladder is instrumental
if the Government of Ethiopia is to capitalize on the country’s comparative advantages
to foment growth and increase welfare. While the process of structural
transformation in many cases has been propelled by the private sector, in a
transitional landscape such as that of Ethiopia, the role of government in fostering
innovation is crucial.

18.    On the other hand, by helping reduce reliance on natural resources,
innovation can also foster resilience, especially among populations in exposed
areas or regions. In agriculture, for instance, innovation can come in the form of
improved crops or irrigation systems to help insulate vulnerable populations from
the effects of weather or plant diseases. In manufacturing, on the other hand
innovation could represent improved production systems, better machinery
improved inputs or new management techniques.

19.    Inclusive innovation however, can only thrive within a supportive
institutional framework. In many cases, institutional reforms are essential in order

to eliminate constraints such as policies that favor rent-seekers, or that favor a
particular social group or a gender over the other. Moreover, inclusive innovation
should needs to be demand-driven and include stakeholder in the business model
design and value chain. Stakeholders have to be involved in the process of identifying
their own needs such that innovation truly adapts to the local realities.

20.    The private sector can play an important role in fostering inclusive
innovation. It could do so by creating and generating products and services that
serve low-income markets, and by integrating small producers into their supply and
distribution chains. In doing so, firms should be encouraged to participate in the
process of identification of challenges of those most in need, and to help in the
creation and dissemination of solutions to these problems, thus bolstering the
participation of the private sector in servicing the needs of the poor.

21.    Enacting public policies that encourage companies to develop and use
technology, along with their marketing and distribution capabilities to provide
goods and services at affordable prices to the poor can have effects in more than
one level: they can help satisfy the needs of the poorest, generate profit for the
companies while spurring growth, and help create jobs. By including the Ethiopian
poor in the value chain, companies are ultimately helping enhance human capital and
increase incomes. This will in turn deepen their own market and increase their
potential for additional business. To this end, government policies should further
focus on removing legal and regulatory constraints while establishing public-private
partnerships that entice investment in the poor.

22.    Within the framework of inclusive innovation, the Government of
Ethiopia could also provide stronger and targeted incentives and funding to
incite public and private institutions and universities to engage in R&D focused
on socially relevant issues. Universities, for instance, can support inclusive
innovation in four specific ways: they can train future creators of innovation, they can
engage in research that develops new systems, products and processes, they can
provide technical assistance to innovators and finally, they can establish network
systems that promote research and development of innovative approaches and
solutions. NGOs, laboratories and research institutions can collaborate in a similar
manner to the process of innovation of the country, provided the government creates
appropriate mandates, grants, and research prizes for pro-poor initiatives to
guarantee the creation and dissemination of pro-poor knowledge.

3. Objective, Scope and Methodology

23.     With this in mind, this study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze the extent of
innovative activities that formal firms are undertaking in Ethiopia; (ii) to conduct a
review of the existing innovation landscape, and (iii) to identify opportunities to
foster innovations at the base of the pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. By drawing on lessons
from ongoing innovation-focused interventions around the world, this study aims to
provide concrete policy recommendations to create an enabling environment for
private firms to undertake innovative activities to increase productivity, as well as to
provide innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty and facilitate more equitable
growth in the economy.

24.   This study seeks to analyze the level of innovative activities that formal
private sector firms are undertaking as well as conduct a review of the existing
innovation landscape with a view to identify opportunities to foster
innovations for the base of the pyramid. To do so, it follows the following
methodology:

25.    The empirical analysis will be conducted using the World Bank
enterprise surveys with the aim of distilling the specific traits that differentiate
innovative private sector firms from those that do not innovate. The analysis will
be conducted at two levels using the World Bank Enterprise Survey (2011) and the
specific Innovation module (2011). The enterprise survey will enable comparison
across a greater number of countries.

26.    The variables in the database that would represent entrepreneurial
activity would include:
    • Introduction of a new or improved product;
    • Introduction of a new or improved process; and
    • Introduction of a new or improved technology.

27.    The objective here would be to determine the variables that are
correlated to innovative activity within these existing private sector firms. The
surveys examine wide range of factors affecting the business environment. These
data possess many indicators of the factors that would enhance the underlying
capability of firms to undertake innovative activities – including, among others, the
skills mix of the workforce, training levels, R&D spending, and measures of
international connectedness and both domestic and international competition. The
data would be used to analyze how innovative firms differ from non-innovative ones
within countries- in terms of age, size, productivity and industry.

28.     At the more detailed level, the innovation module that has been
conducted in Ethiopia will be analyzed to gain greater insights into the
characteristics of innovative firms. The focus of the detailed innovation module
will be to understand better the determinants of innovative activity amongst existing
firms. There will be an attempt to identify in greater detail specific links between the
firm’s exposure to international technical best practices through trade and FDI, its
skill levels, and investments in R&D to the level of innovative activity. The detailed
analysis would help investigate better the incentives for the firms to undertake
innovative activity. However since this was one of the pilot countries and is not a
representative sample, this analysis will not use comparator countries. The empirical
analysis has been conducted in the context of the national innovation ecosystem.

29.     This study is structured as follows: Chapter 2 provides a detailed overview
of the characteristics of growth and innovation, by providing key insights based on
the enterprise survey analysis on the characteristics, motivations, operational and
market environment and constraints of the innovators in Ethiopia. Chapter 3 assesses
the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by looking at the governmental and private
agencies responsible to promote innovation, as well as active programs, and donor
initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level and pro-poor innovations.
Chapter 4 provides policy recommendations to promote innovation in Ethiopia both
at the firm level and in the form of pro-poor initiatives.

CHAPTER 2: Firm Level Innovation in Ethiopia
This chapter uses data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys to analyze innovative
activity in existing private sector firms. Identifying what types of firms undertake
innovation activities, how much they innovate, and how they differ from firms that do
not innovate is essential for policymakers. While average innovation rates among
Ethiopian firms is modest, they are low compared to other comparator countries.
Innovation also has a relationship with firm level performance indicators in Ethiopia.

30.    As discussed in Chapter 1, modern theories of economic growth suggest that
sustained economic growth and improvement in living standards require sustained
technological progress, underpinned by innovation. In developing countries such as
Ethiopia, located well within the global technological frontier, innovation is
incremental and synonymous with adopting and adapting technologies developed in
advanced economies. Such incremental innovation is central to the growth and
survival of firms and to the process of industrialization and structural change.

1. Data and Methodology

31.    This chapter explores the patterns of innovation levels and attempts to
establish innovation correlates in Ethiopia using data from the World Bank’s
Enterprise Survey (ES). Various empirical studies have explored firm-level
determinants of innovation and of technology adoption. Most studies, however, focus
on firms in developed (and upper middle income) countries, mainly because of data
availability but also because innovation is often considered to be the domain of large
firms with intensive R&D structures, located in developed countries. Nevertheless,
growing firm-level data collection has allowed for an increasing number of studies to
explore the rates and the determinants of innovation in developing countries.

32.    Innovation is captured by product, process, marketing and
organizational changes and improvements. Starting in 2011, the ES questionnaire
introduced a section on innovation, designed to collect information about firm-level
innovative activities in selected developing countries. At its core, innovation is
conceptualized by the standard defined in the Oslo Manual (OECD, 2005)25. The
measures used to specify whether innovation activities have taken place are the
following four: i) product innovation, based on the following question in the survey:
“During the last three years, has this establishment introduced new or significantly
improved products or services?”; ii) process innovation based on the following

     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                                22
     in Ethiopia.


question in the survey: “During the last three years, has this establishment introduced
any new or significantly improved methods of manufacturing products or offering
services?”; iii) R&D activity based on the following question in the survey: “During the
last three years, did this establishment spend on formal research and development
activities, either in-house or contracted with other companies?”; and iv) process or
product innovation, indicating whether the firm has answered affirmatively to either
i) or ii) and hence introduced a new or significantly improved product or method of
production/rendering services.

33.     It is important to note that a potential issue with these measures of
innovation is, that for an activity to be considered as innovation, suffice that it
be new or significantly improved to the firm. This means that there is a potential
for measurement error arising from the respondent’s view as to what constitutes new
or significantly improved26. Although the ES questionnaire provides respondents
with lists of examples of new or significantly improved products or processes in order
to minimize this subjectivity, the responses are likely to vary based on the knowledge
and on the judgment of the respondent.

2. Innovation and its Correlates

34.    This section explores innovation by firms in Ethiopia and how its
incidence compares to that of selected comparators27. It further explores how
some of the key firm-level attributes correlate with a firm’s propensity to innovate.
Finally, we look at certain measures of firm performance and how these relate to
whether a firm introduces a new product or introduces changes to its production or
business processes. It is structured in the following way: first we provide
comparisons between the incidences of innovation in Ethiopia and in selected
comparators, followed by a brief discussion of the nature of innovation in the country
using a follow-up innovation survey. We then proceed to present and discuss two sets
of regression analyses; in the first we attempt to establish links between key firm
specific attributes and the likelihood that firms will introduce innovations; followed
by analyses of the potential correlations between innovation and three different
measures of firm performance controlling for the same key firm attributes mentioned
above. The section concludes with a brief summary of the findings.

26 Mairesse and Mohnen (2010) provide an excellent review of the potential issues with these types of
innovation measures.
27 We use two main comparators, Kenya (2013) and a group of low-income countries. The latter consists of low-

income countries for which the latest Enterprise Survey has questions on innovative activities, excluding
Ethiopia (2011), namely: Afghanistan (2014), Bangladesh (2013), Central African Republic (2011), Democratic
Republic of Congo (2013), Kenya (2013), Myanmar (2014), Nepal (2013), Rwanda (2011), Tajikistan (2013),
Tanzania (2013), Uganda (2013) and Zimbabwe (2011). Where data is available, we also include China (2012)
as an additional comparator.or.
     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                                23
     in Ethiopia.



35.    Close to 40 percent of the firms in the country have engaged in either
product or process innovations, but this is lower rate than those of selected
comparators. Figure 2.1 summarizes the incidence of the four measures of
innovation in Ethiopia and in the selected comparators, as collected through the
Enterprise Survey. More than one third of the firms in Ethiopia report having
introduced new products or services during the course of the three years prior to the
time of the survey, while over 40 percent of the firms indicated introducing new
methods of production or new methods of rendering services during this same period
of time.

36.    Only 20 percent of the surveyed firms in Ethiopia indicated spending on
R&D. This low rate of spending on R&D is, however, usual in low-income countries
like Ethiopia where most innovation involves adopting and adapting existing
products and methods of production which require limited R&D activities, if any.

37.    Overall, Ethiopia compares unfavorably to China, Kenya and a group of
low-income countries (LIC) in terms of innovation. The share of firms reporting
process innovation and spending on R&D in China is almost double that of Ethiopia,
and, except for R&D, the portion of firms that innovate in Ethiopia is about 10 to 20
percentage points smaller than that of the LICs. The difference between Ethiopia and
Kenya is particularly stark, as innovation rates in Kenya are almost double those of
Ethiopia in all four observed measures (Figure 2.1).

38.    Innovation varies depending on different firm characteristics, firm size
in particular. Firm size often serves as a proxy for other unobservable firm attributes
that could affect the propensity to innovate, such as access to finance and to product
and labor markets. Figure 2.2 presents shares of firms that have introduced
innovations, disaggregated by firm size using three categories: small (5 to 19
employees), medium (20 to 99 employees) and large (100 and more employees)29.
Results are reported only for two of the four measures of innovation: whether the
firm undertook either product or process innovation and whether the firm spent on
R&D in the three years prior to the survey.

39.    Over two thirds of large firms in Ethiopia undertook either product or
process innovation, that is about 20 percentage points more than the share of
small and medium firms. Moreover, the gap in innovation share between large and
small firms in Ethiopia is 26 percentage points, second only to that of China and 6
percentage points above the sample average. Notwithstanding, large firms in Ethiopia
tend to innovate less than those in the comparator countries: in China and Kenya, over
80 percent of large firms have engaged in either product or process innovation, while
77 percent of firms in the group of LICs have done so.

40.     The share of small sized firms that report introducing product or process
innovation during the three years prior to the survey is 42 percent. This share is
smaller than the share of firms in the same category in China that introduced
innovations as well as the share in the group of low income countries (53 and 56
percent, respectively). The share of firms in this category in Kenya (82 percent),
which have innovated products or processes, is almost double the corresponding
figure for Ethiopia.

41.       Existing evidence indicates that the limited amount of R&D spending in
developing countries corresponds mostly to large firms. In line with this, there is
a clear difference in Ethiopia between small, medium and large firms in terms of their
respective R&D spending: a third of both large and medium sized firms in the country
report having spent on R&D while only 7 percent of small firms report to have done
so (Figure 2.2, Panel B). In fact, the rate of spending on R&D by small firms in Ethiopia
is the lowest, when compared to China, Kenya and the group of LICs, by 24, 14 and 11
percentage points, respectively. The proportion of firms spending on R&D is overall
higher in China than in all the other comparators in all the three size categories,
although the difference in proportions between the size categories is not as stark as
it is in the other three comparator countries (Figure 2.2 Panel B).

42.     The share of firms that report introducing innovations in the
manufacturing sector is larger than the share of firms that do so in the services
sector by between 18 and 20 percentage points. Figure 2.3 provides a closer look
at this, by splitting firms into two broad sectors: manufacturing and services. This
pattern is not specific to Ethiopia, although the gap is substantially larger in Ethiopia
than it is in the comparator countries. The lower rates of innovation in the service
sector could be explained by the fact that product and process innovations naturally
favor the manufacturing sector, while marketing and organizational innovation tend
to be the most common forms of innovation undertaken by firms in the services
sector. It could also be due to the fact that services firms are more heterogeneous than
manufacturing firms, which would pull down the average share of firms who innovate

in the services sector. Yet another possible explanation could be that services firms
tend to be disproportionately smaller than manufacturing firms, and as discussed
above, smaller firms are proportionally less likely to innovate. In Ethiopia for
instance, more than 30 percent of the sampled firms that operated in the
manufacturing sector fall into the “large” category, while only 11 percent of firms in
the services sector do so. Therefore, the lower proportions of innovation by firms in
the services sector is a reflection of the variation in the shares of innovation rates
across firm size.

generated through interactions with the external environment30. Thus, a critical
component of successful innovation is the ability of a firm to source and utilize
external knowledge. To better understand this in Ethiopia, information in a follow-up
survey that focuses on innovation, administered to manufacturing firms selected
from those included in the 2011 Ethiopia Enterprise Survey31 is analyzed.

44.     Through this survey important insights regarding the main sources of
information that drive innovative activities within firms is captured. It is found
that almost one third of interviewed firms cited customer feedback as the main source
(See Table 2.1). The second most important source, according to 17 percent of the
interviewees, were products from other firms that already existed in the domestic
market, corroborating the view that most innovation in developing countries consists
of diffusion of existing knowledge. Transfer of knowledge from parent firms
constitutes the third most important source of information for innovation as cited by
13 percent of the firms. Further, and in line with anecdotal evidence of the limited
interaction between the private sector and formal education and research
institutions in Ethiopia, only 1 percent of the interviewed firms indicated that these
institutions were their main sources of information for innovative activities. Finally,
while not as important as the three main sources of information, still a noteworthy 7
percent of the interviewed firms said fairs, exhibitions and conferences were their
main source of information to innovate.

31This was part of a pilot survey, undertaken in 2011, designed to test an innovation-specific questionnaire. The
survey is not nationally representative and therefore results are not generalizable to all manufacturing firms in
the country. Nevertheless, this survey contains useful information to better understand the nature and process of
innovation taking place within the interviewed firms.

45.    About 47 percent of the firms that had introduced innovations to their
products indicated that they had done so by adapting existing goods. These had
been developed by someone else and were already available in the market32. About
12 percent of the firms recognized entirely reproducing an already existing product.
About a third of the firms reported that the innovation of their product resulted from
an original idea. About 15 percent of the firms said their product was developed
through a blueprint that was purchased or licensed from a third party.

46.    Close to half of the interviewed firms indicated that the innovation
occurred entirely in-house and was developed by the firm, when attempting to
determine who was directly responsible for developing the new product. Meanwhile
a quarter of the respondents indicated that it was developed in collaboration with
other firms. Yet another quarter of the firms indicated that third parties were
responsible for the development of the new product.

3. Correlates of Innovation: Regression results

47.     Relationship between firm characteristics and firm level innovative
activity exist. As discussed in the previous section, there seems to be a relationship
between the size of a firm and the sector in which the firm operates and whether the
firm is or isn’t an innovator. In this section, regression analyses is applied to analyze
some of the key firm-level attributes that appear to be correlated with the propensity

32 Firms that undertook product innovation are further asked questions on how the new or improved product was

developed and who within the firm developed it.

of firms to engage in innovation. Given that the dependent variables of interest are
categorical33, the following probit equation for the conditional probability that a firm
will innovate was estimated:

         Inov = α + β1 ∗ β X + ε ……………………….. (1)

Where i is index for firms, j is index for the covariates,   is one of the four measures
we have established as innovation, namely product innovation, process innovation,
product or process innovations, and spending on R&D. Various firm-level
characteristics that could influence the propensity of a firm to innovate are controlled
for and are represented by the vector X.

48.      Existing studies indicate that firm size and age are among standard
observable covariates associated with various firm-level outcome measures. As
discussed above, the size of the firm may serve as a proxy for various unobservable
firm attributes that might affect the likelihood to innovate, such as the ability to
attract highly skilled workforce and talented managers. Size is measured as the (log
of) a firm’s total employment, and firm age as the (log of) the year of the ES minus the
year in which the firm started operating. The sector in which the firm operates is
another important correlate, as it captures the fact that firms in different sectors have
different needs and capacities to innovate (Agarwal and Gort (2002)). In the
regression, sector is controlled for by disaggregating it into several subsectors: textile
and garments, food, leather, information technology, and retail. A residual category is
included to capture all other subsectors34.

49.     A large body of literature shows that exposure to foreign markets can be
an important determinant of a firms’ need and ability to innovate35. Access to
foreign markets, for instance, may force firms to innovate in order to be competitive
in international markets. Exposure to foreign markets can also enhance firms’
innovative capability by improving their access to better human and better financial
capital. Two proxy measures are used to control for these phenomena: a dummy
variable indicating whether the firm is an exporter or not, and an indicator of whether
the firm is foreign-owned36 or not. The measure of investment in human capital is
controlled for by using a dummy to reflect whether the firm provides training to


33 Equation is estimated using weighted probit to account for the fact that ES data is collected using a stratified

sampling method.
34 The base (excluded) sectors include all other services, except Information Technology; and all other

manufacturing sectors other than the textile & garments, leather and food sectors.
35 For instance, Almeida and Fernandes (2008); Seker (2012); and Alvarez and Robertson (2004).
36 We consider a firm foreign-owned if 10% or more of its equity is owned by foreigners.

employees or not and another dummy to capture firms which give their employees
time to experiment.

50.    A number of theoretical and empirical studies have shown that access to
external finance is one of the most critical factors to spur innovation37. The
dummy variable indicating whether a firm is credit constrained or not is used as a
control, constructed based on a series of finance-specific questions in the ES designed
to capture a firm’s access to external finance38.

51.     Firm size does not matter for innovative activity when controlling for
other firm level attributes. Table A2.1 provides estimates39 of the probit regression
for Ethiopia and for the three comparators. The first three columns of the table show
the estimation results when using product innovation as the dependent variable. The
model shows that firm size doesn’t appear to have a significant correlation with
product innovation in Ethiopia or Kenya, indicating that the importance of size in
these two contexts disappears once we control for other firm-level attributes. In the
group of LIC countries, however, we observe that there is a positive effect of firm-size
over the firm’s propensity to develop new products, albeit small in relative terms.

52.     In Ethiopia, the results show that the older a firm gets, the less likely it is
that it will conduct product innovation. This falls in line with existing evidence that
performance tends to slow down as firms get older. In Kenya, however, the age of the
firm is positively correlated with the probability to innovate, suggesting that older
firms are more likely to engage in product innovation than young firms are. Finally,
the age of the firm is not significantly correlated with product innovation in the group
of low income countries.

53.    The sector of the firm matters when it comes to the probability that a
firm will innovate in Ethiopia. Firms in the textile and garment and in the food
sectors in particular, are more likely to engage in product innovation than do those in
the base category. This is likely due to the recent emergence of the textile and
garment industry in the country as an alternative to traditional activities, and to the
inherent heterogeneity of the food sector. In Kenya, conversely, there doesn’t appear
to be any correlation between the probability that a firm will innovate its product line,
and the sector in which it operates. Lastly, in our group of LICs, operating in the
leather sector increases the likelihood of engaging in product innovation.

 in Ethiopia.


54.    Providing training to employees and allowing employees’ time to
experiment are both factors that positively correlate with the probability to
engage in product innovation. This is not only true for Ethiopia but also in the
comparator group of LICs. In the case of Kenya, providing time to experiment
increases the probability that a firm will innovate, but there is no correlation between
providing training and product innovation. These findings corroborate the
importance of human capital for innovation.

55.     Limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product innovation
in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage points less
likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained ones,
everything else remaining equal. Credit constraint however, does not affect the
likelihood to innovate in the two comparator countries. It is important to note that
practically none of the proxy variables for access to foreign markets predict
innovation, except in Kenya where exporter firms are more likely to innovate than
non-exporters are. In the case of Ethiopia in particular, this may be due to the fact that
exports are highly concentrated in commodities where margins tend to be very low
and value-added very limited.


                            Box 2.1: Ethiopian financial sector
 At present, the Ethiopian financial sector services only a small fraction of the country’s
 population, with some estimates suggesting that less than 10 percent of Ethiopian
 households have access to formal credit (African Economic Outlook, 2013). For firms,
 the main source of funds is loans from banks or MFIs, since capital markets do not
 function effectively and more tailored and sophisticated financing products such as
 leasing and equity funds are not widely available.
  Constraints for ‘Start-up’ and ‘Scale-up’ Innovators
  While access to finance is a major obstacle for all Ethiopian firms, the challenge is
  particularly acute for young firms and small firms, which are most likely to be the sites
  of innovation. According the World Bank’s Enterprise survey data, only 1.9 percent of
  small enterprises have access to a loan or line of credit, compared to 6 percent of micro-
  enterprises and 20.5 percent of medium enterprises. Small firms are also much more
  likely to be rejected for a loan. Young firms, aged five years or less, also face distinctive
  barriers. Only 7.3 percent of young firms have a loan, compared to 14.0 percent of old
  firms. 55.9 percent of young firms have loan applications rejected, compared to 32.6
  percent of old firms.

Impediments to accessing finance for small and young firms stem from the demand
side of financial markets. Like in other developing economies, credit in Ethiopia is more
readily available to businesses that have fixed assets such as land or buildings to be
used as collateral than to those having movable assets, as banks strongly prefer
property to secure a loan. The average value of collateral needed for loans in Ethiopia
(234 percent of the loan amount) is also very high compared to other regions of the
world as well as to other developed economies in Africa.
The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a clear
impediment to innovation. The use of external financing is associated with greater
innovation (GFDR, 2014), because it allows firms to take innovative ideas from concept
to implementation, and to absorb the high-start-up costs related to design and proof-
of-concept stages of an innovative product or service. The constraints to finance not
only prevent innovative ideas from attracting investment to reach scale, they also deter
entrepreneurs from investing in start-up technologies.

                   Online Hisab is an innovative Ethiopian tech start-up which offers
a cloud-based accounting package for Ethiopian SMEs. Online Hisab’s innovative
product offering is premised on the idea that many Ethiopian SMEs don’t use
accounting software because the licenses are too costly, the software is too difficult to
understand, or their computers are too dated to run the programs. Online Hisab allows
Ethiopian SMEs to use simplified, Amharic-language, cloud-based versions of the latest
accounting software developed on a subscription basis, removing the need for upfront
capital investment in terms of hardware and software, as well as upgrade costs.
Online Hisab has generated excitement and attention for its innovative product
offering. It was awarded the Pivot Prize for Innovation, East Africa’s premier award for
innovative start-ups. It was also featured as one of the ‘Top Five Tech Companies to
Watch in Ethiopia’ by Selamta Magazine, and it was selected as one of the top 20
innovative ideas in Africa at this year’s Demo Africa technology conference.

 in Ethiopia.


  Online Hisab’s founder, Asmeret Gebre, describes herself as a ‘childhood
  entrepreneur’, having had an entrepreneurial spirit from her earliest years. The
  expansion of her innovative idea, however, has stalled due to her inability to access
  credit. Asmeret used her own start-up capital to develop and pilot test the product, and
  identified significant market opportunity. She now needs a loan of 2.5 Million Birr to
  market the product, hire sales staff, and fund the scale-up of Online Hisab. She has been
  denied a loan from both commercial banks and MFIs, since the value of her collateral
  is not high enough to secure the loan size she needs. As a result, the scale-up of Online
  Hisab, a promising and tested innovation, seems likely to falter.


56.    In Ethiopia, three of the control variables, sector, measure of credit
constraint, and whether the firm provides employees time to experiment, are
correlated with process innovation. The second set of the three columns in the
Table A2.1 provides estimates for the likelihood of innovation of processes. Firms that
operate in the textile and garments, leather, food and IT sectors, show a significantly
higher likelihood of introducing new or upgrading existing methods of production or
rendering services. Operating in the food industry in particular, increases the
probability of introducing innovative processes by as much as 50 percentage points.
Operating in the IT and textile and garments sectors increases the probability of
process innovation by 36 and 41 percentage points, respectively. Finally, firms in
Ethiopia that offer employees time to experiment are about 40 percentage points
more likely to engage in process innovation than those who do not, while credit
constrained firms are about 17 percentage points less likely to undertake process
innovation.

57.    Firm size, age, and sector have no significant correlation with the
probability of spending on R&D in Ethiopia. Counterintuitively, in the case of
Ethiopia, the fact that the firm is at least partly owned by foreigners lowers the firm’s
propensity to spend on R&D by 6 percent (Table A2.1). This may indicate that foreign-
owned firms in Ethiopia, particularly those that operate as subsidiaries of companies
headquartered in other countries, conduct all the necessary fine-tuning and
adaptation of their product lines or their production processes in their home country
and, therefore, do not need to conduct any R&D activity in Ethiopia. While one would
expect that being an exporter could be correlated to whether a firm would spend on
R&D, this was only the case of firms in the group of low income countries, where being
an exporter increased the propensity to carry out R&D activities by 8 percentage

points. While surprising, further research is required in order to explore the role of
foreign firms in facilitating technological transfer to the host country40.

58.     Based on traditional economic theories human capital would be an
important determinant of the likelihood to undertake R&D activities. In fact one
would expect that it would be a more important determinant for undertaking R&D
activity than it would be to affect the likelihood to generate product or process
innovations. In line with such expectations, the two proxy measures of human capital
have a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of spending on R&D in Ethiopia:
firms that offer training to employees are about 13 and a half percentage points more
likely to spend on R&D, while firms that allow employees time to experiment are 14
percentage points more likely to spend on R&D than are those who don’t provide
either one of these benefits. Similarly, providing training and allowing the employees
additional time to experiment has an effect on the likelihood of spending on R&D in
both Kenya and in the group of low income countries, but the magnitudes of the
coefficients are still larger for Ethiopia than they are for these two comparators.

59.     Finally, in Ethiopia, access to credit is another important predictor of
firms’ propensity to spend on R&D, as credit constrained firms are about 11
percentage points less likely to spend on R&D than non-constrained firms. Similar
results hold for LICs, where credit constrained firms are about five percentage points
less likely to spend in R&D. In Kenya, there does not appear to be any correlation
between access to credit and the likelihood that the firm will spend on R&D.

4. Innovation and firm performance

60.     A stark difference between innovators and non-innovators in terms of
real sales growth is observed in Ethiopia. This section considers the association
between innovation and different measures of annual firm performance, namely:
employment growth, real sales growth and labor productivity growth. Firms that
innovate their product line present on average, annual real sales growth of about 8
percent, compared with a sales decline of 8 percent in those firms that have not
undertaken any product innovation (Figure 2.4, Panel A). A similar pattern holds for
process innovation: firms that have introduced new processes in Ethiopia present
real sales growth of around 9 percent, compared to a 9 percent sales decline in firms
that have not introduced any new processes. Similarly, in the three other
comparators, a similar pattern holds: firms that have introduced new products or

40Almeida and Fernandes (2008) show, using firm-level data for a large set of developing countries, that major
foreign-owned firms are less likely to engage in innovation, perhaps because the firms fear expropriation in the
host country.
 Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                            35
 in Ethiopia.


processes have performed better in terms of sales growth, on average, than those
firms that have not introduced either. In the case of Kenya, however, this translates
into a lower sales decline, as both firms with and without innovations present
negative sales growth, although the extent of the decline is smaller in the case of firms
that have indeed innovated. Notably, the magnitude of the sales growth performance
gap between innovators and non-innovators is considerably higher in Ethiopia than
it is in the comparators.

61.    In terms of employment growth, a similar trend can be observed
between innovating and non-innovating firms in Ethiopia: firms that did innovate
added employment at about 20 percent per annum, 8 percentage points more than
did non-innovators. China and the LICs, show a similar pattern, although the
magnitude of the difference in employment growth between innovators and non-
innovators is less substantial than it is in Ethiopia. In Kenya, the difference between
the two groups is not distinctly clear, as firms that have introduced new products
have increased employment less than one percentage point more than firms that have
not introduced any new products, while firms with and without process innovations
have both presented similar employment growths at 2.4 percent.

62.     In terms of labor productivity, the survey yields interesting results. While
in Ethiopia a similar pattern is observed as that of employment and sales growth, that
is firms that have introduced new products or new processes have outperformed
those that have not introduced a new product or process; the trend is not as cut-clear
across the other comparators except for Kenya. Further, a systematic deterioration is
observed in the labor productivity of firms across most comparators except China. In
the case of Ethiopia and Kenya the situation appears particularly dire, as labor
productivity has in fact declined between 10 and 22 percent per year depending on
whether the firm has introduced any innovations or not. In Ethiopia, Kenya and the
group of LICs, however there was a smaller decline when the firm had introduced
innovations. The difference is largest in Ethiopia, where companies without product
innovations experienced a labor productivity decline of 18 percent, while the decline
for firms with product innovations was of 11 percent. Similarly, Ethiopian firms that
did not introduce any innovations to their processes experienced a decline in labor
productivity of 19 percent, while firms who did introduce new processes only
experienced a 10 percent decline in productivity. In China firms did experience labor
productivity growth, but interestingly enough, firms with new products experienced
a larger productivity growth than firms without new products while firms with new
processes experienced less than half the productivity growth than did firms which
did not change their processes.

     in Ethiopia.



63.    Overall, the association between innovation and firm performance
appears to be stronger in the case of Ethiopian firms. This will be explored in
more detail using regression analyses to see whether this association holds after
controlling for other firm characteristics. For this analyses the following
parsimonious model is estimated:

           Perf = α + β Inov + β X + ε ………………………… (2)

Where i represents firm id, j represents the id of the covariates; Perf represents one
of the three measures of performance; Inov represents one of the four measures of
innovation discussed in earlier sections; and ε is the error term. In addition to
controlling for the four measures of innovation that were introduced in earlier
sections, standard firm characteristics that would affect firm performance are also
controlled for, notably firm sector, age, size, exporting status, foreign ownership
status, and a measure of whether the firm is credit constrained or not. Equation 2 is
estimated using a simple OLS method41 and the results of the model for annual real
sales growth, employment growth and productivity, are presented in Tables A2.2,
A2.3 and A2.4 respectively.

64.    Product and process innovations both show a positive and significant
correlation with sales growth in Ethiopia and Kenya. In Ethiopia in particular,
product and process innovations explain an increase in the sales growth of about 18
percent each, all other factors being constant (Table A2.1). Spending on research and
development, on the other hand, does not present a statistically significant
relationship with sales growth, suggesting either a limited role of R&D in firm sales
performance or possibly the fact that there is a lag between the expenditure on R&D
and it translating into increased sales revenue. In Kenya, product and process
innovations are positively correlated with sales growth as well, although the
magnitudes of the correlation coefficients are almost half of those observed in
Ethiopia. Product innovation accounts for about 8 percent of the change in sales
growth in Kenya, and process innovation for about 11 percent. In LICs, only product
innovation is correlated with sales growth: the fact that a firm has introduced new
products explains about 2 percent of the increase in the firm’s growth in sales. There

                                                                                            38
 in Ethiopia.


is no correlation between sales growth and process innovation nor between sales
growth and spending on R&D.

65.     There is a significant correlation between access to credit and sales
growth in firms in Ethiopia. Access to credit is the only control variable that has a
significant correlation with sales growth in Ethiopia and in all comparators. While in
Ethiopia and in the group of LICs this relationship is negative, it is positive in Kenya.
This means that in Ethiopia and in the group of LICs, credit constraint drives a decline
in the sales growth of the interviewed firms, while in Kenya –surprisingly, lack of
access to credit is responsible for around ten percent of the increase in sales growth.

66.    Firm age, on the other hand, is negatively associated with sales growth.
These associations are significant in Ethiopia and in the group of low-income
countries, and insignificant in Kenya. This would be in line with what one would
expect, that the older a firm is and the longer it has been in the market, the less sales
growth it will experience as revenue will plateau within a captive market. On the
other hand, and although not the case for all model specifications, firms that operate
in Ethiopia and that are owned at least in part by foreigners, present a deceleration
in sales growth of around 20 percentage points indicating that not only do foreign-
owned firms are less likely to spend on R&D, but also that they have a lower sales
growth than do firms that are more than 90 percent owned domestically.

67.     Product innovation is not significantly correlated to job creation in any
of the geographic areas of the study. In table A2.3 the results of the estimations
wherein employment growth is the dependent variable are presented. While
spending on R&D is positively correlated with employment growth across all regions,
it is not clear whether this growth is directly related to additional employees directly
involved with R&D activities. Finally, process innovation is positively correlated to
employment growth only in Ethiopia, where it explains 3 percent of the change in
employment growth, all other things equal.

68.    The rate of employment growth is correlated to firm size. In Ethiopia this
relationship is negative while positive in the LICs. Thus, the larger a firm is in terms
of number of employees in Ethiopia, the slower its hiring rates will be, and possibly
the more jobs it will shed. The opposite occurs in the group of LICs. This further
suggests that labor in Ethiopia is not operating at full productivity, thus presenting an
output gap that results in idle employees. Firms in Ethiopia can thus easily cover
surges in demand, without the need for additional employees, and growth in revenue
would not necessarily translate into additional job creation. In Kenya, firm size and
employment growth appear to be independent.
 Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                            39
 in Ethiopia.



69.    The age of the firm is also correlated with employment growth in
Ethiopia and in the LICs in a similar fashion as the size of the firm is; that is
negatively correlated to employment growth in Ethiopia and positively correlated in
LICs (except for one model specification in which a positive correlation is observed).
In Ethiopia this too may be connected with the productivity levels: as labor costs are
inherently low in the country, it is relatively cheap to start a business with excess
labor capacity. As the firm ages however, some of these extra labor is shed in favor of
more optimal productivity levels, and absent growth, employment growth rates
decline or become negative. There appears to be no correlation between the age of a
firm and employment growth in these model specifications in the case of Kenya.

70.    In Ethiopia, there is a negative correlation between being an exporter
firm and employment growth rate. This could be due to the fact that exporters tend
to be more capital intensive than non-exporters, given the fact that most of the export
portfolio of the country consists on commodities.

71.     There is a positive correlation between labor productivity growth and
innovation activity. When looking at labor productivity growth in the regression
analyses, there is a positive correlation of similar magnitudes with product and
process innovation in both Ethiopia and in Kenya, explaining between 8 and 10
percent of the change in productivity growth rates (Table A2.4), while spending on
R&D doesn’t seem to have an impact over labor productivity in either of the two
countries. None of the three measures of innovation however, appear to be
significantly correlated with labor productivity growth in the group of LICs. Credit
constraint is the only control variable that is correlated with labor productivity
growth, and we find this to be the case in Ethiopia, Kenya and in the LICs. However,
in Ethiopia and in the LICs, the relationship is negative while in Kenya not only is the
relationship positive, but the magnitude of the coefficient in fact larger than observed
on the two other comparators. This suggests that there may be a higher premium to
credit access in Kenya, causing additional pressure on the productivity of the
employees in Kenyan enterprises.

5. Summary and Conclusion

72.   Firm level innovation compares less favorably to other comparator
countries. About a third of the surveyed firms report having introduced new
products or having improved their production or business processes. However, the
country performs unfavorably vis-à-vis the selected comparators, as the share of

 in Ethiopia.


firms that innovate in Ethiopia is about half of the share of the firms that do so in both
China and Kenya.

73.     Among large firms, the share of firms who do innovate is larger,
especially in Ethiopia where the figure reaches just under 70 percent. In line with
this, smaller firms are less likely to spend in research and development, a fact that is
particularly noticeable in Ethiopia once again, vis-à-vis similar countries. Also,
innovation varies depending on certain firm characteristics, such as the sector in
which the firm operates.

74.    Ethiopian manufacturing firms are more likely to innovate than service
firms are. Further, firms in the textile and garment, and in the food sectors seem to
have a higher prevalence of product and process innovation than firms in other
sectors.

75.     The quality of the human capital, and the firm’s commitment to invest in
developing it, are also important for innovation. The analyses conducted shows
that firms that offer employees training and time to experiment tend to be the firms
that introduce new products or that develop new production processes or services.

76.      There is no difference between foreign and domestic owned firms in
Ethiopia, and its likelihood to create new products or new or improved
processes. One of the arguments advanced in favor of foreign investment is not only
that it enhances job creation, but also that it facilitates the transfer of technology. That
doesn’t seem to be the case in Ethiopia, at least based on this data. However, there is
a high possibility that FDI resulted in a one-off transfer of technology at the time of
establishment of a subsidiary which is not captured in the data.

77.    Innovation also has a correlation to firm performance. Firms that have
introduced product or process innovations in Ethiopia show higher sales growth than
those that have not. Similarly, process innovation and spending on R&D appear to be
triggers for employment creation in Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that
process innovation and spending on R&D enhance labor productivity. It is important
to note however, that all these results are associations, and while they do not
necessarily indicate a causal impact of innovations on firm performance they can
enrich future discussions for innovation policy or help guide further research.

CHAPTER 3: Innovation Landscape in Ethiopia
This chapter assesses the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by reviewing the various
governmental and private agencies responsible to promote innovation, as well as active
programs, and donor initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level and pro-
poor innovations, with the aim to highlight some potential gaps that need to be
addressed in order to increase innovation led industrial growth.

1. Ethiopia’s current innovation performance

78.     Ethiopia’s innovation performance stifles its overall competitiveness.
According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI),
Ethiopia ranks 109th out of 140 countries with a score of 3.7 out of 7.0 in the 2015-16
report. The overall score has gradually improved, compared to its performance in
2013-14 and 2014-15 where it ranked 127th with a score of 3.5 and 118th with a score
of 3.6, respectively. However, the comparison of the country’s GCI scores between
2009-10 and 2015-16 reveals significant improvements in the “Macroeconomic
environment” and “Health and primary education” indicators, while progress was
slow in other areas, including Technological readiness, Business sophistication, and
Innovation (see Figure 3.1).

                           Figure 3.1: Ethiopia’s score on GCI




                  Source: The Global Competitiveness Report 2009-10 and 2015-16


79.    Although the overall GCI score of innovation increased 0.5 points in the
past six years (3.2 in 2015-16 from 2.7 in 2009-10), Ethiopia still lags behind in
Global Benchmarking on key innovation indicators and has room for
improvement (see Table A3.1 in annex). Even though the global ranking/score
shows weaknesses and strengths of competitor countries among the selected

                                                                                                42
     in Ethiopia.


indicators, these countries keep and retain their competitive advantage in certain
innovation indicators. For instance, while China ranked lower in the indicators under
“Technological Readiness” than the other four competitors, it is ranked higher in the
indicators “State of cluster development” and “Company spending on R&D” as
compared to others. Development of the innovation capabilities is required to enable
increased innovation led growth in Ethiopia.

80.    Low level of Technological Readiness is indicative of the fact that modern
technology and knowledge, which provide economic benefits to the economy,
are not effectively adapted and utilized. According to the Oslo Manual (OECD,
2005), “an innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved product,
or process, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business
practice”. These new methods or practices are not necessarily new in absolute
terms42. In other words, for developing countries such as Ethiopia, acquiring new
technologies and knowledge plays a crucial role in increasing the competitiveness of
the business sector and the academic institutions. While these latest technologies and
knowledge are usually brought into the country through direct purchase from
overseas and technology transfer to domestic firms through FDI, the GCI rankings
show the lack of adoption and utilization of these in Ethiopia (Table 3.1).

81.    In addition, “Business Sophistication”, which encourages and increases
efficient production of goods and services, needs to be improved. The quality of
a country’s business networks and supporting industries, as measured by the
quantity and quality of local suppliers and the extent of their interconnection (value
chain breadth), are regarded as important factors to foster innovation. Despite its
importance, Ethiopia is ranked poorly in these indicators. In particular, the quantity
and quality of local suppliers are ranked 127th and 125th out of 140 countries.

82.     Adequate private sector R&D spending and the quality of scientific
research intuitions as well as scientists and engineers are critical to increase
Ethiopia’s innovative capabilities. The score of key innovation indicators showed
a significant improvement in the GCI 2015-16 report, compared to that of GCI 2014-
15 report. In the GCI 2015-16 report, “quality of scientific research intuitions”,
“company spending on R&D”, and “availability of scientists and engineers” indicators
were scored at 3.6, 3.5, and 3.8, respectively43, while these indicators in the GCI 2014-
15 report were 3.1, 2.6, and 3.3. This is considered a good trend, but it is also

43   These improvements were achieved partially because of the Government’s investment in R&D.

                                                                                                43

important for the Government and relevant institutions to further strengthen the
foundations that support the innovation capabilities.

The Government’s current investment in innovation (R&D)

83.     The Government’s expenditure on R&D has significantly increased. From
2010 to 2013, Government’s spending on R&D, increased from 931.3 million ETB to
5,242.6 million ETB (see Table 3.1). As such, the share of R&D spending as a share of
GDP has increased from 0.24 percent to 0.61 percent. Ethiopia is thus well positioned
to achieve one percent of GDP share of R&D spending, a target which was endorsed
by the 2006 Executive Council of the Africa Union on Science and Technology held in
Khartoum to introduce and foster innovation in African countries. Although
Ethiopia’s R&D spending to GDP share is smaller than competitor countries, its 2013
R&D spending is similar to the level of Turkey’s R&D spending in 2006 and South
Africa’s R&D spending in 2010 (see Figure 3.2).

84.    Increase in the R&D budget was a result of the increased headcount of
R&D personnel44 and not researchers. In 2013, about three-fourth (74.1 percent)
of Government spending was allocated to higher education, and 24.5 percent went to
government institution’s R&D activities. The number of R&D personnel in the country
has increased to 18,435 in 2013, which is approximately a 41 percent increase,
compared to 13,095 in 2010, according to the 2014 Science Technology Information
Center Report. Meanwhile, the percentage of the number of researchers45 that
increased during the same period was about 13 percent (from 7,283 to 8,218). This

well as those providing direct services such as R&D managers, administrators, and clerical staff.

methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned (UNESCO Institute for Statistics)

implies that the majority of the increase of R&D personnel was on account of the
increase of personnel other than researchers.

85.     In addition, the increase in R&D spending can be explained by the rapid
expansion of the higher education sector and the government’s continued
investment in research institutions, but coordination is critical to use the
limited budget effectively. Since 2000, Ethiopia’s higher education sector has grown
from three public universities to 22 public universities by 201146. At present, there
are 35 public universities47. Many of the new public universities are located in rural
areas, and it often requires new investment both in R&D personnel and facilities.
Moreover, the government has continued providing investment in agricultural
research, given the fact that agriculture is still the major source of national income.
The main governmental agricultural research institute, the Ethiopian Institute of
Agricultural Research (EIAR) has increased its federal research centers from 13 (in
2011) to 16 (as of today). Increasing the number of graduates from universities and
researchers at research institutes is a key component of the country’s development
with skilled personnel. At the same time, however, these efforts will be in vain, if
effective quality assurance of education and research is not implemented.

86.    On the other hand, business sector spending on R&D has sharply
declined. Contrary to higher education and government institutions, the R&D
spending by business sector has decreased from 144.6 million ETB to 61.5 million
ETB during the same period, which accounts for only 1.2 percent of the total R&D
spending in 2013. Given increased global competition, success of Ethiopia’s industrial
sector depends on the firms’ ability to innovate48.

Ethiopia’s Current Research Strengths

87.    Ethiopia ranks 80th out of 239 countries on the measure of scientific
influence of academic journals. According to SCImago Journal & Country database,
which takes into account the number of research articles, total number of citable
documents, number of citations and self-citations, citations per document published
and h-index49 , Ethiopia ranks 80th, while China, Turkey, South Africa, and Kenya are
ranked 2nd, 20th, 35th, and 67th, respectively.

46 Ashcroft and Rayner (2012)
47 According to website of Ministry of Education (MoE), 31 universities are owned by the MoE plus the Ethiopian
Civil Service University, Defense University College, Kotebe College of teacher education, and Telecommunications
and IT College. Also, here were 59 accredited non-government universities or colleges awarding degrees.

received in other publications. The index can also be applied to the productivity and impact of a group of scientists,
such as a department or university or country, as well as a scholarly journal.

 in Ethiopia.



88.    Ethiopia has strengths in two specific research fields which could serve
as the basis for strengthening R&D and applying it towards sectoral
development. In terms of research specification (see Figure 3.3), Ethiopian science,
as measured with quantity and quality of scientific output (i.e., number of citable
documents, citations and h-index) appears to perform well in the following areas:
Medicine and Agricultural and Biological Sciences. Medicine accounts for
approximately 25 percent of academic journals produced by Ethiopia in 2011-12,
while Agricultural and Biological Sciences accounts for about 20 percent. Major
subjects that are written in Medicine are: infectious diseases; and public health,
environmental and occupational health. Under Agricultural and Biological Sciences,
agronomy and crop science and animal science and zoology are leading subjects.
Given the country’s economic conditions, the health and agricultural sectors are
considered primary areas in which advanced research could provide substantial
benefits to the society at large.

2. Enabling Environment - Government’s Policy:

89.   The Government of Ethiopia’s efforts to establish an enabling
environment for innovation have been initiated more than two decades ago, but

                                                                                                46

its weak implementation has deterred its effective establishment. The national
Science and Technology (S&T) policy of the country was originally adopted by the
transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1993 to boost innovation activities for
economic development through the application of science and technology50. The S&T
policy served to provide general directions to guide scientific and technological
activities for innovation. However, the policy was not properly implemented, due to
the fact that it was not followed up by detailed implementation of strategies and
programs aimed at achieving the envisaged policy objectives. Also, there was no
strong and legitimate body that could coordinate the use of limited resources among
key stakeholders.

90.     Recognizing the important role and the urgent need for innovation to
increase the country’s sustainable development, Ethiopia adopted a new
Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy in February 201251. The STI
policy envisaged the establishment of a national innovation system that would
support the building of a sound science and technology foundation in technological
learning, adaptation, utilization, and creation through searching, selecting and
importing effective foreign technologies in manufacturing and service providing
enterprises. In addition, the Government has developed the STI policy
implementation strategy which supports the implementation of strategies envisioned
in the GTP.

91.     The new STI policy has identified direction and major strategies under
11 critical policy areas that the government intends to support. Based on the
analysis conducted by the government, the identified areas include the followings: i)
technology transfer; ii) human resource development; iii) manufacturing and service
providing enterprises; iv) research; v) financing and incentive schemes; vi) national
quality infrastructure development; vii) universities, research institutes, Technical
and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions and industries linkage;
viii) intellectual property system; ix) science and technology information; x)
environmental development and protection; and xi) international cooperation.

92.    The implementation of the STI policy is crucial to facilitate linkages
between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation ecosystem.
While it is true that key changes in society are brought on by innovation deriving from
science and research efforts, innovation driven by sources other than science and

research also have a considerable impact on the origin of new industries, jobs, and
incomes52. Figure 3.4 shows the various actors and institutions relevant to the policy
areas envisioned in the STI policy. The key actors are structured into three broad
stakeholder categories namely: public sector; academic institutions; and industry.
The public sector, include government and its relevant agencies, support the import,
adoption, and creation of innovation knowledge and goods and services. Academic
institutions, including researcher, scientists and engineers affiliated with universities
and research institutions generate innovative knowledge, while industry, including
large corporation, SMEs, and start-up companies, produce goods and services.
Furthermore, academic institutions and industry would need to collaborate to
introduce and create new innovations that contribute to increased industrial
productivity.

93.    Although the policy specifies a major set of directions and strategies, the
inclusion of the BoP into the nation’s innovation system needs to put in place.
While Ethiopia achieved rapid economic growth with an average of 10 percent per
year during the last decade, the country remains the ninth poorest country in the
world (in income per capita), leaving about 30 percent of the population who live

below the national poverty line. 66 percent of the population comprise the BoP
subsisting on less than USD2.0 a day. In 2013, approximately 83 percent of the
population was living in rural areas, where income generation is mainly from
agriculture relying on limited land. The Government’s focus on improved linkages
among various actors under STI can create a foundation of innovation which
contributes to job creation, social development, and export promotion for the
country’s growth. However, this will not be achieved without addressing the need for
improved access to services and improved quality of life for the BoP. Potential areas
of intervention on inclusive innovation are included in Table 3.2.

94.      Inclusive innovation is important to address the needs of the BoP. In
particular, innovative solutions, such as using advanced technologies, can contribute
to filling the shortfalls in critical areas of education, health and social safety net
services in rural Ethiopia. Several attempts have been initiated by the government to
provide better access to public service to the BoP by using technologies such as
mobile phone, laptop, tablet, and other ICT tools.

95.     To deliver quality education in all regions of the country, ICT has been
one of the priority areas for the education sector. Funded in part by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the government has introduced broadband
connections to all government secondary schools in the country in order to provide
nationally broadcasted lessons of about 45 minutes. This approach addresses the
issues of access by enabling the students to use the same material and standards at
all government schools, regardless of their geographic location. It is important to
highlight the need for the content used in these materials to be produced keeping
international standards in mind. Furthermore, the One Laptop per Child (OLPC)
initiative piloted in Ethiopia revealed immediate improvements in the classroom
environment mostly through the utilization of e-books, while showing significant
potential to expand both media and computer literacy among students.

96.    As with the education sector, ICT in the health sector has also
contributed to improving the healthcare delivery for the BoP. Using ICT in supply
chain management allows hospitals and clinics to keep sufficient supplies and
medicines by monitoring the number in the system. Moreover, the government has
supported telemedicine as a tool to provide primary healthcare services to remote
areas. Health extension workers in distant posts can access health information
systems remotely and connect with health professionals and receive information and
assistance to diagnose, treat and refer patients. The patient data can also be collected
by using mobile phones and tablet for records.


                       Box 3.1: Productive Safety Net Program
                 – using electronic payment system for cash transfer –
  The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is a multi- donor financed program, started
  with the aim of shifting focus away from short-term food needs met through emergency
  relief to addressing the underlying causes of household food-insecurity. PSNP IV is the
  fourth phase of the program with an objective to increase access to safety net and

 in Ethiopia.


  disaster risk management systems, complementary livelihoods services and nutrition
  support for food insecure households in rural Ethiopia.
  Under the Program, the government had initiated a pilot program to use electronic
  payment systems to reach to PSNP beneficiaries who did not have access to financial
  services. The electronic payment system required an appropriate technological
  platform which could be used by the selected Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs)
  enrolled in the Program.
  The pilot of the electronic payment system targeted Oromia region, with a total of
  52,000 beneficiaries. An evaluation of the pilot found that the electronic payments
  increased the security and speed of the payment system, with 99% of participants in
  the pilot reporting that the electronic payment system was safer and more secure than
  the traditional manual payment system.
  In addition to increasing security and reliability of transfers, the pilot also revealed
  several other positive results, including increased financial literacy and savings
  amongst beneficiaries. This was achieved, since they became more familiar with
  financial institutions through the mobile transfer process. The pilot also noted the
  significant cost savings that could be realized from an electronic transfer system, which
  would eliminate the need for extensive staffing and local intermediaries. The estimated
  cost per transaction of a scalable electronic payment system would be less than 2% of
  the amount of each transfer, representing significant savings over the current manual
  transfer system.
  Several challenges were also observed during the pilot phase, including the limited
  availability of telecom coverage in rural Ethiopia and the need to develop a sustainable
  business model that is profitable and makes sense for financial institutions and
  technology providers. Based on the largely positive results of the pilot, discussion are
  underway with mobile money provider to further expand the program.


97.    A functional organizational structure is required to implement the STI
policy. The STI policy covers a broad range of areas, government needs to have a
strong and legitimate body that can mobilize the relevant ministries. Currently, the
main actors of innovation system are the National Science, Technology and
Innovation Council (NSTIC), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), and other
related ministries. To facilitate the efficient development of the national innovation
system, these main actors require a clear mandate and increased capacity for policy
implementation. The key roles of these main actors are as follows:

   •   National Science, Technology and Innovation Council. According to the
       policy, the council is the highest decision making body for the STI policy and
       is chaired by the Prime Minister. Participation and active engagement from all
       key ministers, along with top representatives of the business, academic, and

                                                                                                51
     in Ethiopia.


           civil society are required. The council is focused on developing strategic
           policies, priority setting and policy coordination which are articulated in the
           STI policy. The Council’s long-term focus reduces inconsistencies in
           policymaking generated by the political cycle and the subsequent short-term
           horizon of many policy decisions.

       •   Ministry of Science and Technology. MoST serves as a secretariat of the
           NSTIC, and it has the overall responsibility of coordinating, supporting,
           monitoring STI development activities based on the strategic decisions made
           at the NSTIC. MoST plays a pivotal role in the implementation of the STI policy,
           together with other respective ministries. Also, the Science and Technology
           Information Center, established in 2011, will play an important role in
           collecting and disseminating the information gathered.

       •   Other ministers and relevant governmental agencies. It should be noted
           that all science and technology related ministries and their relevant agencies
           have significant roles to play in the national innovation system through their
           active involvement in human resource development, research, and technology
           transfer. These ministries include: Ministry of Finance and Economic
           Development; Ministry of Industry; Ministry of Trade; Ministry of Agriculture;
           Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education; Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs;
           Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, etc.

98.    Given the complex organizational arrangements involving various
stakeholders, strong political leadership is critical to facilitate communication
and collaboration to implement the STI policy. While the current organizational
structure is in line with international practice, key lessons learned from global
experiences emphasize the importance of inter-ministries and inter-agency bodies
creating a coordinated and coherent implementation of STI-policies. These lessons
include: (i) involvement of the right people with the needed qualities (experienced,
and both knowledgeable on content and process) at implementing/coordinating
body; (ii) fairly broad mandates for implementing/coordinating body to enhance
coordination between the various actors involved; and (iii) early identification of
cross departmental themes in order to keep the interdepartmental agenda fulfilled53.

3. Industry-Research Linkages - Effectiveness of academic and research
   institutions

99.    Successful implementation of STI activities also depends on the
effectiveness of the country’s academic institutions: universities; research
institutes; TVET institutions; and industry development institutes (e.g. Leather
Industries Development Institute, Textile Industries Development Institute, etc.).
Strong leadership led by Ethiopian academic institutions plays a central role in
establishing and strengthening the linkages with industry. Effective and well
organized linkages between academic institutions and industry would help Ethiopia
transform its economy from an agricultural led to a knowledge-based industrial led.
For industry, in spite of the fact that integration of innovation into products and
services is critical for their existence and competitiveness, they are often reluctant to
invest their own resources into activities related to innovation, as the result of
acquired innovation is uncertain.

100. Effective and efficient linkages between academic institution and
industry, which contribute to increased industrial productivity have not been
established in Ethiopia. A critical misalignment exists between the research outputs
from academic institutions and the technology needs of industry54. Cooperation with
industry is important for academic institutions to create scientific and innovative
knowledge and address solutions that address industry needs. Research conducted
by academic institutions could increase agricultural productivity and expand
investment in the industrial sector (particularly in small and micro enterprises of
manufacturing industry). These in turn could increase economic growth by providing
solutions for the BoP population. Industry-research linkages can vary ranging from
joint research and consultancy services, to creating opportunities for student
internships, staff exchanges, and curriculum development for students.

Public Universities

101. There has been a steady increase in the number of universities in
Ethiopia. Currently, there are 31 public and approximately 80 private universities in
Ethiopia. The rapid increase of the number of universities is accompanied by a huge
increase in student numbers, teaching staff and administrative personnel. While in
2000 only a few thousand students had a chance to receive a university degree,

research activity at Addis Ababa University found that none of the units at the university had set research
priorities based on national development objectives (Lemma 2008).

mostly at Addis Ababa University (AAU)55, more than 500,000 students were enrolled
in public universities in 2012/13.

102. Some government initiatives that were carried out to facilitate the
university-industry linkage in the past were not continued, due mainly to the
lack of financial support. These initiatives include: i) the cooperation program
between AAU and the Ministry of Industry (1986- 1991), which focused on research
relevant to industry and provided university generated technologies and training to
industry; and ii) establishment of Technology Faculty - Industry Linkage Unit under
Faculty of Technology of AAU in 2000, which provided research, training, and
consultancy services to industry. However, these programs were discontinued when
government’s financial support was terminated.

103. Recent positive fundamental change undertaken by the government was
the establishment of Technology Transfer Office (TTO)56 in the reformed or
newly established Institute of Technology (IoT) across the country. University
Capacity Building Program (UCBP)57 supports the setting up of IoTs in Ethiopia by
converting the Engineering and Technology Faculty of the existing universities or
establishing new IoTs. While remaining accountable to the university, IoTs are
considered as autonomous units which have flexibility in their budgets and programs.
More importantly, the IoTs are allowed to use any unused funds from the State on a
rolling basis, and are allowed to generate revenue from various income activities for
their own purposes, which increase the sustainability of the programs. Under the
organizational structure of IoTs, there are TTOs which are responsible for leading
direct linkage with industry. Selected IoTs established under the UCBP are as shown
in Table 3.3.

   Experience in Bridging the Gap & Increasing Competitiveness of the Textile &
                                 Garment Industry
 Institute of Textile and Fashion Technology (iOTEX) of Bahir Dar University is the only
 higher education institution in Ethiopia focused on the level of 'Institute of Technology'
 to educate specialized professionals in the field of textile, garment and fashion design
 in the country.
 The iOTEX Institute has a history of more than 40 years. Currently, more than 1,300
 students are receiving education through five undergraduate Programs (Fashion
 Design, Garment Engineering, Textile Engineering, Technical and Vocational Education
 and Training (TVET) in Textile Engineering, TVET in Garment Engineering), and one
 graduate programs (Textile Technology).
 The Government of Ethiopia has identified the textile and garment industry as a priority
 industry keeping in view its potential as an engine that generates employment
 opportunities, import substitution, export earnings, and easy linkages to pursuing the
 Agriculture Development Led Industrialization Strategy for the development of the
 country.
 However, the major challenges hampering the competitiveness of the Ethiopian textile
 and garment sector are:
 - Lack of sufficient raw materials;
 - Lack of Qualified Human Resources;
 - Low quality and productivity;
 - Unsatisfactory product development capability;
 - Lack of strategic company and production management philosophies; and
 - Lack of Sustainability
 To address these issues, the following measures have been put in place.
 1) Involvement of industry professionals in restructuring the curriculum at iOTEX - All
    programs in the institute were developed in response to industry needs.
 2) Establishment of Student Industrial Internship through Institute – Industry Linkage
    Office for one semester in all curriculums. This helps the student to understand the reality
    of different kinds of work and allows them to apply what they have learnt.
 3) Established Institute – Industry Linkage Office (Technology Transfer Office) to:
    coordinate the work of student internships; establish a strong relationship between

           industries and the institute for their common benefits; identify core problems of the
           textile and garment industries and research areas through interns and mobilizing iOTEX
           staff members to tackle these problems.
      Some results from the iOTEX’s initiative include the establishment of partnership with
      Bahir Dar and Kombolcha Textile Share Company, state owned fabric manufacturing
      company established in 1961. The company faced some problems, including low
      capacity in management, lack of technical and marketing professionals and a lack of
      maintenance personnel.
      The first initiative for student internship and research collaboration started in 2011.
      Through the collaboration, iOTEX estimated that the company could save as much as
      ETB 10 million/year to ETB 30,493,769 /year only with the implementation of simple
      changes.

104. While university-industry linkages has gradually begun in Ethiopia, new
initiatives to strengthen the direct linkages with industry have been initiated.
These are: technology business incubation at AAU and the establishment of Research
Park planned by Adama Science and Technology University58. The objectives of these
initiatives are to strengthen the local economy through enhanced knowledge and
technology transfer from university research to the industry.

       •   Addis Ababa University – Technology Business Incubation:
           In 2012, the first Technology Business Incubation was launched as a pilot
           program at AAU and admitted a few entrepreneurs from the university. In
           2015, AAU is planning to expand its program by increasing the number of
           entrepreneurs (from AAU academic staff and students) who will receive
           comprehensive incubation support at Technology Business Incubation Center.
           The main activity is classified into the following three: pre-incubation
           activities; activities during incubation; and post-incubation activities59.

       •   Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU) – Research Park:
           With the support of University of Leipzig and Conoscope GmbH, ASTU is
           setting up a Research Park in Ethiopia. According to ASTU, the Research Park
           is intended to be an important mechanism for the interaction between
           academia and industry in terms of transferring academic research findings


58 Establishing a strong tie with German institutions since its inauguration in May 2006 as Adama University, it
has established strengthening on training students in engineering, technology and applied sciences. The
Ministry of Education has nominated the university as Center for Excellence in Technology in 2008.

           and serving as a source of knowledge. It also provides space and facilities and
           other value addition services.

105. Rapid expansion also brings several challenges to universities. University
and research infrastructure has not expanded in response to the increase in the
student numbers. Despite the construction of new buildings there is a shortage of
suitable classrooms and laboratories. Academic staff, particularly in new public
universities, are very young and are often found to be underqualified. Department
heads hold Bachelor or Master degrees only, and in one exceptional case a PhD.
Freshly graduated Bachelors or Masters or even current Master students are
employed as instructors or teachers60. One of the other issues that prevents qualified
personnel from entering the academic profession is the low salary scales for academic
staff leading to low levels of motivation amongst academics. Finally, academia do not
have the incentives to closely interact with industry implying that their research is
often not linked to the industrial needs and on the other hand, industry does not
recognize the potential resource academia can bring to firm capabilities and needs.

Agricultural Research Institutes

106. Significant public efforts have been made in the Agricultural sector.
Recognizing the agricultural sector as a key economic engine to transform Ethiopia
into an industrial led economy and to support the BoP population, the Government
has made significant public efforts in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is the major
source of livelihood for the majority of Ethiopians, and it contributes to
approximately 40 percent to the national GDP and employed over 80 percent of the
population in 2013/14. Since the 1990s, the Government has been implementing
agriculture support programs through various strategies: notably; the adoption of the
Agricultural Development Led Industrialization Strategy in 1994; the Plan for
Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (2005-2010); and the
Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2010-2015).

107. Innovation plays a critical role in addressing issues facing Ethiopia’s
agricultural sector, dominated by small-scale farmers with low productivity. In
spite of the government’s continuous commitment to the development of the sector,
there is still large room to improve its productivity, production processes and market
linkages. By recognizing the importance of innovative technology to support the
growth of the agricultural sector, the Government has invested in the development of
the National Agricultural Research System, which is comprised of the Ethiopian
Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), Regional Agricultural Research Institutes

(RARIs) and Universities/Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs). The research outputs
vary from improved agronomic and protection practices that can be used in crop
diversification and specialization for both traditional food crops, to introducing high
value crops such as vegetables, spices and other horticultural crops61. The
Government established the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) to support
the introduction of innovative technologies into the agricultural sector (Box A3.1 in
annex).

108. Total number of public agricultural researchers has grown significantly
since 2000. While the number of full-time researchers at government agricultural
institutions was 743 in 2000, the number increased to 1,410 personnel in 2008 and
1,876 personnel in 2011. This number is very high compared to neighboring
countries such as Kenya (1,150), Uganda (353), and Tanzania (814). According to the
Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI 2014)62, Ethiopia is considered
to have one of the fastest-growing pools of agricultural researchers in Africa. The
rapid increase has been due to both the increase in the number of universities in the
country which have faculty in agriculture and the government’s decentralization of
the agricultural research system from the mid-1990s, which resulted in the
establishment of RARI administrated by regional state governments.

109. Several initiatives, which adopt and introduce innovation to increase
agricultural productivity, have been implemented. These typically include:
research, product introduction, rural infrastructure, education, improving quality of
inputs, improving land property rights or land distribution, etc. The key initiatives
that have been introduced in Ethiopia are mainly structured around the following
areas: product innovation; process innovation; and knowledge innovation.


            Box 3.3: Pocket sensors for precision agriculture – Product Innovation
      A new pocket-sized sensor could bring precision agriculture within the reach of
      smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Precision agriculture
      uses data from high-tech observations to assess and
      address crop variability and help farmers to employ
      their resources more effectively.
      Crop performance readings from satellite or sensor-
      based technologies are used to “do the right thing, at
      the right place, at the right time.” Marketed by

 handheld crop sensor reads near-infrared and red light reflected from plants to
 measure photosynthesis rates and crop vigor. When used with the normalized
 difference vegetation index, the readings can help farmers decide exactly how much
 nitrogen fertilizer to apply to get the best yields.
 This is especially important in Ethiopia whose soils – like those in many parts of Africa
 – typically lack nitrogen, a highly mobile element whose availability is affected by
 rainfall and soil characteristics. At a cost of about US$500, the sensor could make
 precision agriculture affordable for farmers in Ethiopia. It does not have the accuracy
 of bigger sensors, but is less expensive and better adapted to smallholder
 circumstances.
 Because most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa import fertilizer, this input is relatively
 expensive. On average, farmers in the region apply only 9 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer,
 compared to an average of 100 kg/ha in South Asia or more than 70 kg/ha in Latin
 America. This greatly limits their crop yields. When farmers do apply fertilizer, most
 follow broadly-targeted application rates recommended by extension agents, rather
 than site- or season-specific rates that would make the best use of this costly input to
 raise crop yields.
 CIMMYT agronomists with the Nutritious Maize for Africa project, funded by the
 Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD, formerly CIDA) of
 Canada, have introduced handheld sensors in Ethiopia and are testing them with
 agronomists from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR).

            Box 3.4: Household Irrigation Help Line – Process Innovation
 Typically, extension information is cascaded through various levels of the extension
 systems before reaching its intended recipient. For example, agronomic information is
 developed and crafted by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and the
 federal Ministry of Agriculture for use by smallholder farmers. This information is then
 passed down to regional, zonal and woreda staff during annual training sessions. The
 information will then be delivered to Development Agents (DAs), who will eventually
 disseminate it to smallholder farmers at training meetings. This modality is often
 stretched out over the course of 6-9 months, with many instances when the intended
 information may never actually reach the smallholder farmer.
 In order to enhance the existing approach, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and ATA
 have come up with an inventive way of distributing information to smallholder
 farmers. The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Short Message Service (SMS)
 system is a technology that will allow individuals to call into a hotline and access a wide
 range of relevant agronomic information. Through the IVR/SMS system, once the
 information has been agreed upon and uploaded, smallholders and DAs will have direct

   access to the pertinent agronomic content whenever it is needed. Users will be able to
   access pre-recorded messages, in a wide range of languages, at their own convenience.




   Distributing agricultural extension materials can be costly and time consuming;
   however, through this new system, information will be available around the clock.
   Once the content has been agreed upon, it will be available for anyone to access. Based
   on the user’s responses to various prompts, and information they enter using their
   keypads, the user will get specific, tailored agronomic information, in local languages
   they can understand, thus supplementing the training provided by DAs in the
   traditional approach.
   During 2013, this mobile based IVR/SMS system was piloted with smallholder farmers
   engaged in irrigated agriculture (more details in the Special Projects section of this
   Annual Report). Based on this success, the ATA and MoA have begun to scale up this
   approach to all farmers in Ethiopia.

110. There is an important role for Government interventions to support
agricultural innovation adoption. While there have been various efforts made by
government research institutes to support smallholder farmers to adopt innovative
technologies, all innovation adoption decisions are typically influenced by the
farmers’ individual risk preferences and their ability to bear the risk of a new and
uncertain endeavor. They require certain guarantees that their future access to land,
inputs and outputs will not be a point of uncertainty. Without some level of assurance
that their access to future benefits is not at risk, farmers have little incentive to invest
their time, labor and capital into technology adoption.

   •    Farmer’s adoption rates of improved seeds are low. While Ethiopian seed
        research is quite established and has released hundreds of new varieties,
        farmer adoption rates of improved seeds - even in reliable rain fed areas - are

                                                                                            60

        low. Around 12 to 15 percent of farmers use improved wheat and maize; less
        than 1 percent of farmers use improved seed for teff, barley, and sorghum
        (International Food Policy Research Institute 2010).

   •    The availability of financial services is very much associated with the
        capacity of smallholders and emerging commercial farmers to adopt
        improved agricultural practices. Access to credit or finance is considered a
        major constraint in adopting almost all types of innovative technologies
        (Tiwari 2010, Olaleye 2005, Doss et al. 2003 on production technologies). This
        includes both short term seasonal credit for crop inputs and medium-longer
        term finance for capital investments.

111. In order to transform Ethiopia’s farmers, in particular smallholder
farmers, into innovative and market oriented producers, strengthening the
value chain is critical. The core assumption behind ‘pro-poor’ value chain
interventions is that vulnerable upstream agents (such as smallholder farmers) can
be ‘pulled’ into specific markets, and therefore successfully integrated into economic
dynamics from which they were excluded, or, at best, only participated under very
unfavorable conditions. To service the end market downstream actors need to secure
a regular supply of produce from upstream smallholders. This requires processors,
traders or exporters to invest in the upstream supply side of the chain in order to
secure desired products in the right quantity and quality. Such investments may
include sharing market intelligence with farmers or providing them with specific
services including technical, financial and organizational services.

  The objective of the Wheat Program is to support significant and sustainable increases
  in the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers producing the crop, through
  the promotion of several key interventions, including access to high quality seeds and
  fertilizers, training in new and better agronomic practices (i.e., planting in rows with
  the appropriate seed rate), more efficient post-harvest processing and handling by
  using agricultural machineries, and access to financing resources. The program further

      aims to support the growth of efficient, sizeable, and sustainable markets to help
      farmers convert their increased production into additional income.
      As has now been demonstrated by many farmers in various regions of the country,
      wheat’s national average yield can be easily doubled simply by improving agronomic
      practices, providing improved access to technologies, and addressing market
      problems, such as the price difference between local wheat and subsidized imports. In
      2013, 400,000 farmers were targeted for productivity enhancing training and support.

112. Ethiopia’s agricultural sector continues to face challenges. The
development of Ethiopia’s agriculture sector has been supported by the government’s
strong commitment; however, rapid expansion of the supporting system is
confronted with challenges to maintain its quality. The country’s research system
relies on highly skilled professionals to identify, test, and avail of innovative
technologies and techniques that can help Ethiopian farmers grow a higher volume
of better agricultural commodities more efficiently. However, this system has
suffered from systemic and operational bottlenecks.

       •   Quality of researchers. Although the total number of researchers employed
           at governmental institutions has dramatically increased, many of the new
           recruits are young and only trained to the BSc level (Table 3.4). As of 2011,
           according to ASTI 2014, more than half the country’s agricultural researchers
           held BSc degree, and 48 percent were under 31 years old. Also, the share of
           PhD researchers is significantly low, compared to the neighboring countries63.

   •   High Staff Turnover. Ethiopia’s agricultural research system has suffered
       from high staff attrition rates, negatively impacting the quality of the work and
       its potential to positively contribute to the transformation of the agricultural
       sector as a whole. The primary reasons for the high turnover rates have been
       low researcher salaries, unfavorable working conditions, and dissatisfaction
       with the current career path/incentive structure (ATA Annual Report
       2013/14). Also, since the EAIR’s restructuring process undertaken by the
       government in 2008, a number of long-serving researchers have continued to
       leave EAIR in pursuit of better remuneration and working conditions. During
       2008-2012, 195 researchers, including 38 PhD researchers left the EIAR.
       Though efforts to improve researchers’ salary package have been initiated,
       whether this actions will be sufficient to halt the high rate of staff attrition
       remains uncertain (ASTI 2014).

   •   Coordination among research institutions. Research and extension
       activities are carried out by different organizations without much
       coordination (International Food Policy Research Institute 2010). At least 55
       research centers conduct agricultural research in Ethiopia. While EIAR is
       responsible for the overall coordination, the linkages among research
       institutions are insufficient. In fact, the low quality of researchers and high
       staff turnover often makes it difficult for the EIAR’s coordination mechanism
       to work properly.

   •   Facility of the research institutions. Despite the development of the
       agricultural research system, studies have shown that all the research centers
       are not well equipped or laboratory facilities are not updated. (Dept.
       Agriculture, ESTC, 2005).

4. National Quality Infrastructure

113. A well-functioning National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) supports the
country’s transformation to an industrial led economy. NQI services support the
acquisition, handling and use of, maintenance, and disposal of scientific equipment at
various facilities, including academic and research institutions, where a number of

                                                                                                63
     in Ethiopia.


laboratories exist. Access to a good NQI is imperative to assure that Ethiopian firms
are able to enter and be competitive in international markets by assuring that the
quality of their services and products are aligned with required standards in the
international markets.

114. Recognizing the importance of NQI, significant reforms have been
initiated to modernize Ethiopia’s existing NQI institutional framework and
technical regulations. One of the key reforms undertaken was the MoST’s initiative
in February 2011 that restructured the former Quality and Standards Authority of
Ethiopia into four separate institutions which are responsible for the fields of
metrology, standards, accreditation, and conformity assessment. These are: National
Metrology Institute of Ethiopia (NMIE); Ethiopian Standards Agency (ESA); Ethiopian
National Accreditation Office (ENAO); and Ethiopian Conformity Assessment
Enterprise (ECAE).

115. The reforms contributed to establishing a foundation of NQI institutions
for improved NQI services and international recognition. The reform brought a
clear division of responsibilities among NQI institutions, allowing them to handle
each task efficiently and further meet the pre-conditions for international
recognition. Major responsibility of each NQI institution and their achievements
through the reform are provided in Table A3.2 in annex.64.

Importance of International Recognition

116. Continuous efforts to create internationally recognized NQI institutions
are critical to introduce innovation that supports the integration of Ethiopian
firms into global markets and update the quality of research facilities at
academic institutions. Ethiopian exports are dominated by semi- or un-processed
and undifferentiated agricultural products65. Internationally recognized NQI
institutions can support the Ethiopian firms to improve their competitiveness in
international markets with higher value-added products by ensuring that their
products meet the required quality and standards in international markets. They can
also support the academic institutions’ adoption of innovation by updating the
standards of their facilities, resulting in better research to support the development
of businesses.




64   The reform was implemented through the GIZ programs, which have completed in September 2015

     in Ethiopia.


117. Active engagement in regional metrology organizations and proper
operation of the established laboratories will be required to obtain
international recognition for NMIE. NMIE has the primary responsibility of
ensuring that any measurements made in Ethiopia can be traced to the international
system of units by using international standards. While calibration services provided
by NMIE are not yet internationally recognized, Ethiopia has been an active member
of the continent-wide Intra-Africa Metrology System (AFRIMETS)66. The proactive
engagement with the regional metrology organization is very important for
international recognition, as NMIE’s calibration and measurement capabilities needs
to be recognized through key comparisons and peer evaluations from the AFRIMETS.
Currently, NMIE holds metrology laboratories, which have been accredited by
German accreditation organizations in March 2014, in the following six fields: mass;
temperature; pressure; volume; electricity; and weight. In order to apply for the
international recognition, NMIE’s continued engagement with AFRIMETS and service
provision through its laboratories is critical.

118. Ethiopia’s active membership of international organizations is
important for standards. While there is no formal international recognition system
in standards, becoming members of international organizations is a key element to
adopting international standards. ESA has become a member of the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Codex Alimentarius Commission67. It has
been a member of the African Regional Organization for Standardization since its
beginning, and also has close relations with the International Electro-technical
Commission (IEC)68. Maintaining the active engagements with these international
organizations are crucial for ESA to deliver required services on standardization and
technical regulation for its customers.

119. Gaining international recognition for ENAO is a positive development.
ENAO has already applied for a full membership of the International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and has received its peer evaluation. Availability of
competent accreditation services to local laboratories and certification/inspection
bodies will reduce the requirement for re-testing, re-inspecting, and re-certification
of Ethiopian products in importing countries. Since its establishment, ENAO sets its
target to obtain full membership of ILAC and to be a signatory to the Mutual
Recognition Agreement managed by ILAC and the International Accreditation Forum,

which grant international recognition to ENAO. This can be achieved when ENAO
receives and passes the peer evaluation by an international team at ILAC. As of date,
ENAO is waiting for the feedback and result from the peer review.

120. Recognition of international level of conformity assessment services is
provided by accreditation. ECAE is responsible for inspection, laboratory testing
and certification services. The facilities of ECAE are currently accredited by ENAO.
The international recognition of ENAO will also provide ECAE with access to
international recognition as a competent institution in international markets.

Common Challenges to be addressed

121. To ensure sustainable service, the contributions of the state budget and
financing from NQI services and projects need to be defined. In the case of the
metrology services, the development of the national measurement standards is
usually considered as a public good, and the metrology institutions in almost all
countries are maintained significantly through the state budget. As accreditation is a
fee-based service, an accreditation body can in theory become self-sufficient. While
ENAO has committed to accredit 60 conformity assessment bodies seeking
accreditation, it has been shown empirically that 200 to 250 accredited organizations
are required to be self-sufficient69. Until ENAO becomes internationally recognized
and develops a market, financial support from the state will be required. In most
countries, the national standardization activities are not financially sustainable and
require additional sources of revenue. The government mostly leaves conformity
assessment to the private sector in developed countries, while the state still plays a
major role in developing countries. It is ideal for the government to facilitate the
development of conformity assessment provider from the private sector as well,
while maintaining its services until the market for conformity assessment services
grows.

122. To ensure the provision of qualified services, development of strategies
to further strengthen the NQI institutions is critical. While the implemented
reforms to date were articulated in the NQI strategy for 2009-2015, the development
of another mid- and long-term strategy and time bound action plan is critical to
further strengthen the NQI institutions. It is also important that the new strategy will
be consistent with the vision and goals envisioned in the GTP and relevant sector
strategies.

 in Ethiopia.


123. To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-
driven NQI services. For example, each NQI institution has set up a council for its
fiduciary and strategic responsibilities. Common practice in developing countries is
to fill these with representatives from the public sector, while the private sector
remains underrepresented. In the case of ESA, the Ethiopian National Standardization
Council has one member representing the private sector out of the total of 12
members. It is important to have greater private sector representation such that
client demand feeds into the decision making process as well as the monitoring and
evaluation of the NQI services provided.

5. Government Initiatives to support the development of innovative
   enterprises

124. Several programs to improve the access to finance for entrepreneurs
have been initiated by the government. While access to finance is one of the
pressing issues for the private sector to be innovative, it has been critical for the
government to provide direct and indirect support to the private sector. The most
successful of these interventions are those that have injected much-needed liquidity
into the financial sector, and have targeted the right segment of the client. However,
considering the major limitations of the financial sector in Ethiopia in lending to small
and young entrepreneurs, there remains much need for targeted support to improve
access to finance for innovative firms. The existing programs serve only a fraction of
the enormous demand from innovative enterprises for access to financial services.
Some of the major existing programs are summarized in the Table A3.2 (annex).

125. The World Bank Info Dev’s initiative- Ethiopia Climate Innovation Center
(ECIC), supported through a multi donor trust fund provides entrepreneurial
support to early stage, growth oriented SMEs participating in the clean tech
sector. The ECIC targets early stages of innovation as well as more advanced growth-
oriented entrepreneurs reach their objectives. The types of support provided by the
ECIC includes: i) access to finance, by providing grants up to US$50,000 as well as
investment facilitation for more advanced firms; ii) business advisory support
through mentorship, seminars, and trainings; iii) marketing support, by providing
market studies and case reports relevant to the clean tech sector; iv) networking

opportunities by creating discussion forums and regular meet-ups70; and v)
influencing policy decisions by conducting and sharing research and best practice
data as well as leading policy forums and dialogues with government and
stakeholders. The ECIC’s support has been provided to the following sectors:
agriculture; bio-fuels and bio-mass; transportation technologies; hydropower;
energy efficiency; waste management; and other clean-tech or clean-tech support
businesses.


6. Role of the government to support Innovation in Ethiopia

126. The government’s strong initiative to foster the innovation eco-system
in Ethiopia is crucial, but it requires a lot of coordination among stakeholders.
Promoting innovation for the Ethiopian economy, including the BoP requires more
resources and redistribution of resources to policy implementation and relevant
action plans articulated in the STI policy. Also, policies for innovation cannot be
considered in isolation. They must take into account the entire innovation ecosystem,
market failure affecting the development of inclusive innovations, and the roles
played by different agents in the generation, transfer, and dissemination of
innovations for the country’s development71.

127. The role of the government should be focused on the creation of a
functioning innovation infrastructure. The major role should be to facilitate,
support, incentivize and leverage the strengths of all stakeholders in order to create
sustainable inclusive solutions with significant outreach at maximum efficiency with
the least possible burden on the public resources. Contributions from the private
sector, the research and academic community, NGOs, and global partnerships – as
well as the BoP itself are essential to an effective innovation ecosystem.

CHAPTER 4: Recommendation and Policy Options for
Promoting Innovation in Ethiopia
This study has analyzed the extent of innovative activity that formal firms in Ethiopia
are undertaking and has reviewed the existing innovation ecosystem. The analyses
reviewed the ongoing initiatives to promote innovation in firms as well as those targeted
to the Base of the Pyramid. This chapter informs policymakers on how the environment
can be made more conducive for firms to undertake more innovative activities to
increase productivity as well as to provide innovative solutions to help alleviate poverty
and facilitate more equitable growth in the economy.

128. The Government plays an essential role in ensuring entrepreneurs,
financial institutions, academia and industry create wealth for the society
through innovation. By providing a conducive regulatory and policy environment,
promoting greater competition through openness to trade and FDI and promoting an
education system that is responsive to industry needs, the government plays a central
role in promoting innovation. The State will play a particularly important role in
increasing innovation for the BoP before the private sector is able to build a profitable
and scalable business solution. Hence, the successful implementation of the STI policy
would be one of the most critical factors to ensure that innovative activity is
undertaken in the economy and there are returns to firms on these innovation
investments in terms of increased firm level productivity.

1. Implementation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy

129. The implementation of the STI policy for Ethiopia is crucial to facilitate
linkages between different actors and institutions involved in the innovation
ecosystem. Recognizing the important role and the urgent need for innovation to
increase the country’s sustainable development, Ethiopia adopted a new STI policy in
February 201272. As described in Chapter 3, there are various actors and institutions
relevant to the policy areas envisioned in the STI policy for Ethiopia.

130. Strong political leadership is critical to facilitate the effective
communication and collaboration among key stakeholders, given the complex
organizational arrangements involved in the implementation of the STI policy
(See Figure 4.1). While the current implementation arrangement is in line with
international practice, key lessons learned from European countries emphasize the

importance of inter-ministries and inter-agency bodies creating a coordinated and
coherent implementation of STI-policies. These lessons include: (i) involvement of
the right people with the needed qualifications (experienced, and both
knowledgeable on content and process) at implementing/coordinating body; (ii)
fairly broad mandates for the implementing/coordinating body to enhance
coordination between the various actors involved; and (iii) early identification of
cross departmental themes in order to keep the interdepartmental agenda fulfilled .

131. Based on the key lessons from the European countries and the
importance of the implementation of an effective STI policy, there are a few
recommended policy actions that GoE could undertake.

    •   The development of STI policy implementation strategy. While the policy
        identifies basic objectives and strategies, it is important for all the
        stakeholders to understand a clear path to promote innovation in Ethiopia,
        including the BoP. The development of the implementation strategy for the STI
        policy will also support the identification of the priority sectors and cross-
        cutting areas, such as agriculture and health for this initiative.

    •   Good Coordination mechanism. Given that the STI policy covers a wide range
        of topics which involve a number of organizations/institutions, a clear
        communication strategy among these stakeholders needs to be developed.

                                                                                            70
 in Ethiopia.


   •   Monitoring & Evaluation mechanism implemented. To monitor the
       progress of STI policy (and implementation strategy), the Key Performance
       Indicators need to be developed and disclosed to the public, together with
       their progress. This could potentially be done through the website of MOST
       and can help sensitize the public to developments in the area and initiate
       feedback and discussion from the public including the private sector to help
       inform future policy making.

   •   Feedback Mechanism from the Private Sector. Given the crucial role that STI
       Policy plays in the move towards an export led industrial growth
       transformation, the implementation of the policy needs to have clear
       ownership from the private sector. Ensuring representation from the private
       sector in stakeholder consultation and working groups would be pivotal to this
       exercise.

   •   Robust National Quality Infrastructure. The STI Institutional and policy
       framework needs to support the development of the NQI which is crucial for
       the country’s transformation to an industrial led economy.

   •   Framework for Inclusive Innovation Policy. The STI Policy has been framed
       under the vision of “alleviating poverty and joining the mid-level income
       earning countries”. Herein lies the clear role for Government to spearhead a
       strategy to develop an adequate policy framework for inclusive innovation.

2. Promoting Greater Firm Level Innovation

132. Analyses shows that firms in Ethiopia undertake lower levels of
innovative activities than those in comparator countries. The analysis conducted
in Chapter 2 shows limited access to credit poses a significant barrier to product
innovation in Ethiopia. Firms that are credit constrained are about 14 percentage
points less likely to undertake product innovation than are non-credit constrained
ones, everything else remaining equal. The analyses also shows that providing
training to employees and allowing employees’ time to experiment are both factors
that positively correlate with the probability to engage in product innovation. These
findings corroborate the importance of human capital for innovation.

133. Innovation also has a correlation to firm performance in Ethiopia.
Analyses conducted shows that firms that have introduced product or process
innovations in Ethiopia show higher sales growth than those that have not. Similarly,
process innovation and spending on R&D appear to be triggers for employment
     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                                71
     in Ethiopia.


creation in Ethiopia, and finally, the analysis shows that process innovation and
spending on R&D enhance labor productivity. The government thus has a role to play
in alleviating some of the market failures that exist to ensure that there is adequate
skills and training and there is an incentive for firms to undertake innovative
activities.

134. In particular, a wide range of funding options can be used to stimulate
the supply of the innovation. Government funding for skills development for firms,
early stage technology, and pre-commercialization technology is a vital element of
many innovation systems, including direct funding of public labs and universities;
grants, matching grants, and indirect R&D tax subsidies (which allow firms to choose
the most profitable research opportunities, switching some marginal projects from
being unprofitable to profitable)73.

Facilitating Early Stage Financing and Capacity Building

135. The distinct credit constraints for young and small firms in Ethiopia is a
clear impediment to innovation. Impediments to accessing finance for small and
young firms stem from the demand side of financial markets. Like in other developing
economies, credit in Ethiopia is more readily available to businesses that have fixed
assets such as land or buildings to be used as collateral than to those having movable
assets, as banks strongly prefer property to secure a loan. The average value of
collateral needed for loans in Ethiopia (234 percent of the loan amount) is also very
high compared to other regions of the world as well as to other developed economies
in Africa.

136. Through the Ethiopia Climate Innovation Center (ECIC) the government
provides support to early stage financing in green sectors. The ECICs target early
stages of innovation, they also support more advanced growth-oriented
entrepreneurs reach their objectives. The types of support provided by the ECIC
includes: i) access to finance, by providing grants up to US$50,000; ii) mentoring
through seminars and trainings; iii) marketing support, by providing market studies
and case reports; iv) networking among entrepreneurs by creating regional hubs
within Ethiopia74; and v) policy support which provides advice on policy framework
of climate change to stakeholders. An increase in the support in other areas of the
economy towards early stage innovation financing would be beneficial to
entrepreneurs who are unable to find sources of financing through commercial banks.

     in Ethiopia.


Facilitating Learning from Exporting and Fostering Backward Links
through Foreign Direct Investment Growth

137. Openness to trade is an important source of knowledge transfer and an
important motivation for firms to undertake innovative activities that increase
market share, productivity, and growth. Referred to as “learning from exporting,”
exporting firms are often under pressure to meet quality standards, including safety
and environmental regulations, established by their customers or the regulatory
authorities of destination countries. Such pressures can either strengthen incentives
for exporting firms to upgrade their technology or hinder other firms that lack the
requisites for exporting to more sophisticated markets.

138. There are a few initiatives that have been introduced in Ethiopia to
address this market failure. These include the Ethiopian Competitiveness Facility
(ECF) which is a matching grants program initiated under the World Bank funded
Private Sector Capacity Building project and now further supported under the DFID
funded Private Enterprise Program Ethiopia (PEPE), managed by Ethiopia’s MoI. The
ECF is designed to improve the competitiveness of the Ethiopian private sector, in
particular those focused towards the export market. The facility provides matching
grants up to US$200,000 to qualifying enterprises and funds are channeled through
four windows that include the export development window; the institutional
development window, chamber of commerce and sectoral association window and
domestic firms that are currently not exporting. Exporters were able to access
business development services and training to increase their firm level productivity
and decrease costs by using better production methods. The relative success of the
export window under the ECF led to the introduction of a new window under the
PEPE for the domestic firms that are not exporters which is a positive development
as many SMEs would benefit from the access to these business development service
and training opportunities that can be funded through the ECF. Firms benefit from
not having to bear the entire cost of the investment, and since they match the portion
paid for by the government, the program attracts genuinely committed firms.

139. There is a need to promote linkages with and spillovers from foreign
investments with domestic firms. The GTP for Ethiopia seeks to transform the
economy towards an industrialized economy and to increase per capita income of its
citizens by 2025. To this effect, the Government has adopted policy focused on the
development of the manufacturing sector through the use of industrial parks to
attract FDI and to support SMEs75. It would be beneficial for the investment agency to

work actively with the investor community and seek out input providers and support
services they require that could be provided by domestic SMEs. The Government thus
acts as a facilitator and gathering information on possible opportunities for links,76
assisting in identifying partners (and arrangements) by matching suppliers’
capabilities and buyers’ needs (legal assistance, fairs, missions, conferences and
exhibitions, and so forth), and providing economic incentives to multinationals to
promote training and technology transfer from buyer firms to local supplier firms and
for SMEs to invest in training and capacity building. The Global Supplier Program was
an initiative that was successful in developing SME capabilities in the Malaysian
electronics industry and integrating them into the global value chain (see Box 4.1).


           Box 4.1: Malaysia: Skills Development for SMEs through matching grants
      The Global Supplier Program (GSP) funds training and skill development for SMEs in
      order to make them more innovative firms and to allow them to participate in global
      supply chains. Originally created in 2000 as an initiative by the regional Penang Skills
      Development Center, the GSP was quickly expanded at the country-level. Under the
      GSP, grant which covers up to 80 percent of training cost at a variety of regional centers
      and institutes are provided by government to SMEs. The key element of the GSP in
      terms of linkage creation is that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) representatives
      design the content of the training programs and participants are selected based on MNC
      criteria. Also, the selected SMEs are requested to co-finance at least 20 percent of the
      training cost; thus, acquiring the practical skills through the training is considered as a
      critical financial investment for the companies.
      Within its first year, the GSP had trained 813 employees from 225 SMEs, with the
      involvement of 23 MNCs or large domestic companies. Intel, for instance, has made
      significant use of the PSDC and the GSP.

3. Upgrading the National Quality Infrastructure

140. The government’s continued support to develop NQI is crucial for the
country’s transformation to an export led economy. Access to a good NQI is
imperative to assure that Ethiopian firms are able to enter and be competitive in
international markets by assuring that the quality of their services and products are
aligned with required standards in the international markets. To support innovation
in the firm level, in particular for exports, NQI services should be developed by
incorporating demand from the private sector.

141. There is a need to develop a long term implementation strategy for the
NQI policy framework in Ethiopia. While the NQI institutions have developed their
strategies, in particular the steps required to obtain international recognition, it is
important to develop a long term strategy which includes the government’s
commitment of budget allocation, as all NQI institutions require long term financial
support from the government. This will ensure that all these institutions can make
medium to long term action plans to implement their strategies.

142. There is a need to develop career paths and incentive structures for
skilled staff in NQI institutions. The delivery of NQI service relies heavily on trained
and skilled staff. While international donor agencies spend large amount of time for
training of staff, continued support to develop the necessary skills at each staff level
is required for NQI institutions. Moreover, these skilled people often leave NQI
institutions, because their salary and benefits sometimes do not meet their
expectations. The development of the new career path, including provision of various
training programs, and incentive structures for skilled staff will have a positive
impact on the stable operation of NQI institutions.

143. To increase client satisfaction, the development of demand-driven NQI
institutions is important. NQI institutions need to ensure that firms and academic
and research institutions that receive NQI services are able to market their products
and services successfully. However, weak participation from these key stakeholders
in the governance of NQI institutions often hinders the development of demand-
driven NQI services. For example, each NQI institution has set up a council for its
     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                                75
     in Ethiopia.


fiduciary and strategic responsibilities. It is important to get representatives from key
stakeholders, including prominent industry, and academic and research institutions,
to serve on these councils. This would ensure that NQI institutions obtain direct
feedback from stakeholders, and additionally that these stakeholders act as
marketing agents in their fields. The development of a robust monitoring and
evaluation system is also critical to regularly review the effectiveness of the council
and operation of these NQI institutions.

4. Promoting Effective Industry- Research Linkages

144. Government can also provide its support to strengthen university-
industry linkages in order to promote innovation. There is a need to strengthen
the effective linkages between academic institutions and industry, which contribute
to increased industrial productivity in Ethiopia. A critical misalignment exists
between the research outputs from academic institutions and the technology needs
of industry. Furthermore, the type of curricula and skills endowments of the
graduates of universities do not match the immediate skill needs of industry77.

145. Measures to increase incentives for greater academia-industry
collaboration need to be introduced. Industry-research linkages can vary ranging
from joint research and consultancy services, to creating opportunities for student
internships, staff exchanges, and curriculum development for students. To promote
collaboration and partnership between university and industry including foreign
direct investors, government programs; such as mini-grants and matching grants, to
increase the incentives for the cooperation is required (see Box 4.2). In addition, there
is a need to better utilize the technology transfer system that has been initiated in the
IoTs. The successful operation of technology transfer system is a big task, but it is also
a good opportunity to improve the income situation of staff by generating new
projects and even jobs (see Box 4.3). Measures to include “on the job training” that
contribute towards the credit for a student could provide incentives for students to
take these internships seriously as a source of learning and for firms to benefit from
new ideas and research to help solve real issues that it may face. Creating incentives
for researchers to collaborate with industry with this experience counting towards a
tenure track could ensure that researchers would be motivated to work with
industry. Finally, academic institutions should tap into the vast Ethiopian diaspora to
leverage on the global expertise and knowledge that they have by offering them
attractive short term assignments to work in the universities.

 Box 4.3: Technology Transfer Office: Case of University of Antioquia (Colombia)
 The University of Antioquia (UA) is a public university located in Medellin, Colombia’s
 second largest city. Founded in 1803, it is Colombia’s oldest public university with 12
 regional campuses. The UA is also recognized as Colombia’s highest percentage of
 excellence research group according to the National Board of Science and Technology.
 In 2000, UA recognized the importance of creating the linkage between the University,
 Industry and Government in the region in order to identify and develop business
 partnerships. By April of 2002, UA established “Technological Management Program”
 with the responsibility of developing guidelines and managing policies on R&D
 activities with private partners. This led to an increase in the share of research projects
 being financed by outside sponsors to 60 percent in 2004 from a mere 10 percent in
 1994.
 This positive shift was achieved through the establishment of the University and
 Industry Committee on Research and Technology, which is comprised of University
 board members and successful private businesses in the region. The committee is
 divided by sector and is led by a CEO of a successful private company. The committee
 meets the first Friday of every month at UA’s R&D Headquarters by representing
 strategically chosen sectors in the region, including food, car manufacturer, energy,
 textiles, chemistry, health, wood, and agricultural. The topics discussed at the
 committee include: i) identification of R&D needs of the private sector; ii) interaction
 between university and industrial research groups; and iii) promotion of a risk capital
 fund for R&D projects and new enterprises.

                                                                                            77
 in Ethiopia.


  A key result from this active collaboration with the private sector included the
  Development of a low-cost and effective car paint: While a Colombian enterprise that
  assembles imported RENAULT requested to develop a six-year anticorrosive paint for
  the car manufacturing, a UA professor and the mechanical engineers came up with the
  new design of Surface Treatment Tunnel by which the outer casing of the car is
  submerged in a tunnel where anticorrosive paint is spread over every part of the car
  structure. This new Colombian engineering design was approved by RENAULT and the
  cost for development was half of what it would have cost them to use the available
  foreign technology. Through this development, UA received approximately $200,000
  USD for technology invention and around 13 local small companies benefited with this
  technology.

While the development of innovation in agriculture sector has been prioritized, the
emphasis on the effective coordination among the relevant stakeholders and
improvement of the quality of the staff and research needs to be stressed.

146. The development of the national implementation strategy for newly
established Ethiopian Agricultural Research Council (EARC) is crucial.
According to the ATA annual report, the establishment of EARC was approved by the
government. The EARC will coordinate and oversee the integration of various
research efforts made by the different research institutions. To support the existing
coordination issues, the development of the detailed strategy to address the existing
issues and strengthen the national agricultural research system is critical. In
particular, the national strategy should identify activities which have quick impacts
on increasing productivity, activities which would address medium term (upgrade of
value chain), and long term objectives to support agricultural sector development in
Ethiopia. Brazil was successfully able to develop an agricultural research institute
which served to create solutions that benefited the farmers and were thus readily
adopted (see Box 4.4).

147. Coordination with National Science, Technology and Innovation Council.
There is a need to actively coordinate these initiatives with the National Science,
Technology and Innovation Council that plays an important role in promoting and
implementing the necessary support mechanisms to adopt innovative technologies.

148. Development of career path and incentive structure for researchers.
Currently, MoA is working with Oxfam America and ATA to introduce attractive
career paths and incentive structures in line with international benchmarks. The

                                                                                            78
 in Ethiopia.


development of these new career paths and incentive structures will have a positive
impact in increasing the quality of agricultural research.
   Box 4.4: Public Research Organization and Agricultural Development in Brazil:
                                 Case of Embrapa
  One of the government’s initiatives to strengthen Brazil’s agriculture sector and food
  security was the establishment of an effective and leading agricultural research
  organization, which is Embrapa (Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária).
  Embrapa has succeeded in adapting, creating, and transferring technologies to
  Brazilian farmers for the past 30 years, helping transform Brazil into one of the world’s
  largest food exporters.
  Since its founding in 1973, Embrapa has created and transferred to Brazilian farmers
  more than 9,000 technologies and built an intellectual property portfolio of more than
  350 cultivars and about 200 international patents. It is currently considered as the
  world’s leading tropical research institute. Embrapa generated and transferred new
  technologies and techniques tailored to Brazil’s climate and soil conditions. The use of
  these technologies by Brazilian farmers facilitated the expansion of Brazilian
  agriculture and increased exports at internationally competitive prices.
  The main success factor of the initiatives conducted by Embrapa is Embrapa’s mission
  orientation, focusing from the outset on the improvement of agricultural productivity
  rather than the production of scientific work. Its mission driven culture has been
  supported by various elements, including: i) an open IPR policy and a network of offices
  spread throughout the country which help to facilitate the dissemination of Embrapa’s
  discoveries; ii) adequate level of State funding to support its activities for more than
  two decades; and iii) its priority to invest in the human capital of researchers.
  As a result, researchers worked on finding solutions for the agricultural sector, and
  technology and innovations sourced through Embrapa were quickly adopted by
  farmers. By reacting to market signals and focusing on activities for which demand was
  increasing in international markets, Embrapa avoided being supply driven.

5. Providing an Incentive Framework to foster Inclusive Innovation

149. The government will also play a particularly important role in increasing
innovation for the BoP by addressing their low demand due to limited access to
information. Inclusive innovation can boost the welfare of the BoP by providing
innovative products and finding innovative ways to address their needs (i.e., energy-
efficient cook stoves, water purifiers, or certain vaccines). However, several examples
show that low levels of education among the BoP population hinder opportunities to
     Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                                79
     in Ethiopia.


gain knowledge about potentially useful products and about how best to use them78.
Also, poor individuals’ investment decisions tend to be inefficient, thereby lowering
demand for innovative products.

150. As is the case for Ethiopia as well, the strong community involvement is
critical. For this purpose, it is important to establish partnership with local NGO or
intermediaries which communicate with the targeted BoP population through
regular and well publicized visits about the benefits of adopting innovative products
as well as innovative service delivery. Using the existing community network and
their knowledge; such as door-to-door distribution and advertising strategies, has
been used as successful practices by businesses to reach to the BoP, and this approach
can be replicated for the government initiative. The examples are the followings79:

       •   VisionSpring, a social enterprise, is a network of women in India and El
           Salvador selling eyeglasses at a low price through the Vision entrepreneur
           program;

       •   Hindustan Unilever (India) through the Shakty Initiative trains women to
           become micro-entrepreneurs by selling personal care products. Consumers
           benefit through better personal hygiene and prevention of illness, and the
           women improve their bargaining positions inside their households and their
           communities; and

       •   The NGO Gyan Shala provides primary education in India at low cost by using
           standardized curricula and lesson plans to exploit economies of scale. The
           approach has also made it easier to monitor the quality of the education
           service provided.


151. The government has a role to play in developing a market for inclusive
innovation technologies that bear a high upfront cost leading to a lack of
incentives for the private sector to produce. The case of AAKASH Tablet (see Box
4.5) indicates the market for inclusive innovations can be developed by the
government, wherein the Government of India used demand side policies such as
public procurement by creating a market for low cost tablets.

in Ethiopia.


    Box 4.5: AAKASH Tablet: Bringing Low-Cost Computers to Students in India
 The Aakash Tablet is a good example of how public procurement can help create a
 market for inclusive innovations and of the importance of setting clear procurement
 evaluation to avoid disruptions in the process.
 In 2010, the Indian government announced the development of the Aakash tablet to
 provide low-cost computers to the nation’s growing college student population. It
 assigned the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Rajasthan the task of producing the
 first 100,000 tablets at the US$35 price point. IIT Rajasthan followed an open bid
 process and selected the lowest bidder (DataWind) among all bids deemed eligible. In
 mid-2011, DataWind sent three batches of tablets for testing, all of which did not meet
 the standard required by IIT Rajasthan. Despite these disagreements, the Indian
 government unveiled the manufactured tablet at the scheduled launch in October 2011.
 The government also announced that there would be two versions of the tablet: (i)
 Aakash computers, subsidized by the government and distributed to students at US$35;
 and (ii) the Ubi Slate 7, commercially available at US$60. Continued testing of the
 Aakash tablets by students highlighted the need for several improvements, such as
 longer battery life and a faster processor. In November 2011, the government and
 DataWind agreed that the remaining tablets of its 100,000 order would have such
 upgrades and IIT Rajasthan would send its specific testing criteria. However, the testing
 criteria included measures such as ability to withstand four inches of rain, which Data
 Wind contended was not included in the original specifications.
 While the effort was eventually successful, it was delayed a long time. Quad Electronics,
 Data Wind’s consortium partner, had never manufactured a tablet before and was
 producing fewer than 700 tablets a day. DataWind opened new manufacturing facilities
 in India to raise its productivity and eventually ended its agreement with Quad
 Electronics. Several financial and legal disputes also contributed to the delays. Quad
 Electronics and IIT Rajasthan claimed that DataWind owed them US$1.12 million and
 almost US$500 million, respectively. DataWind in turn claimed that the school owed it
 US$100,000 from a bid deposit. The Indian government maintained that production
 would continue and that Aakash 2 would be unveiled to the rest of the students in
 November 2012. The government and DataWind met that goal. The device was sold at
 US$21 for students of engineering colleges, with the government subsidizing the other
 half of the cost.
 The case of the Aakash tablet provided several lessons:
   • Clear procurement evaluation criteria. First, clear procurement evaluation
      criteria are necessary. Because of the unclear criteria in the initial public
      procurement, expectations were not met. Furthermore, the government chose a
      company that had never produced a tablet before, making timely and cost-
      efficient production difficult.
   • Market Creation. Second, while procurement processes hampered the
      government from providing tablets to students at the price point it wanted, it did
 Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                            81
 in Ethiopia.


        succeed in creating a market. Because DataWind proved it could make a tablet
        for under US$60, more tablet makers entered the market at this price point.
    •   Incorporating customer feedback. Third, the government listened carefully to
        the feedback from customers and endeavored to improve the design based on
        that feedback. Such public procurement of a consumer product, while it was
        delayed by several disputes, represents a first of its kind in India.

152. The government can also provide its support to stimulate the adoption,
adaptation, and generation of innovative technologies by entrepreneurs, before
the private sector is able to build a profitable and scalable business solution. An
example where the government has played a pivotal role in fostering inclusive
innovation is India. A Public-private partnership model, the Inclusive Innovation
Fund (see Box 4.6) in India is built on the principle that innovative enterprises can
profitably, scalably, and competitively engage the BoP: and, in doing so, provide goods
and services that will transform their lives for the better. Ethiopia can leverage on
existing initiatives around the world by facilitating international linkages with firms
(through joint ventures) and industry-academia linkages in other countries to work
on providing solutions relevant for the BoP in Ethiopia. The large Ethiopian diaspora
provides a further opportunity to effectively leverage these linkages.


                         Box 4.6: India Inclusive Innovation Fund:
  India Inclusive Innovation Fund (IIIF) is one of the examples for the government’s
  financial intervention to address social issues by increasing access to finance for
  innovations aimed at tackling inclusive businesses.
  Despite having a large publicly funded science and technology infrastructure and an
  established higher education system, India has not fully exploited its innovation
  potential. While a number of initiatives to enhance the country’s innovation ecosystem
  have been implemented, one of the critical actions undertaken was to establish the
  National Innovation Council in 2010 as a high level coordination body to develop a
  national roadmap for innovation over the next decade and to manage various
  innovation-related activities.
  Inclusive growth has been one of the most important economic strategies of the Indian
  government, being incorporated into its national development strategy – both in 11th
  five year plan 2007-12 and the 12th five year plan, 2012-17. While majority of the labor
  force is in the informal sector, this sector lacks science, technology, and innovation
  support mechanism. In an effort to address more than half of India's population who
  are considered as the BoP, three years after announcing the setting up the IIIF, the
  National Innovation Council and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
 Unlocking firm level productivity and promoting more inclusive growth: The Role of Innovation
                                                                                            82
 in Ethiopia.


  (MSME) officially announced the launch of the IIIF in January 2014 with the initial
  capital of Rs 500 crore. The IIIF would be eventually scaled up to ten (10) times of the
  fund size over the next two years by raising funds from external investors.
  The IIIF’s principle concept is to combine innovation and the dynamism of business to
  solve the problems the BoP is facing in India. The IIIF focuses on creating a new class of
  capital which helps set up and scale entrepreneurial skills and innovation. The fund will
  invest in innovative ventures that are scalable and sustainable, but address social needs
  of the population in areas of agriculture, healthcare, education and skills development,
  energy, financial inclusion, water, sanitation employment generation, etc.
  While conventional commercially-focused companies do have access to finance to some
  extent, ventures and start-ups which focus on BoP business find it much harder to
  access finance, in particular risk funding, ranging from seed to early-stage ideas. The
  IIIF supports the entire ecosystem in this space, including incubators, angel groups, and
  also public research and development programs and laboratories to support the
  commercialization and deployment of socially relevant innovative technologies and
  solutions.

153. At the same time, there are several elements that need to be considered
when it comes to government supported fund for inclusive innovation. Main
issues are: having an appropriate business model and exit strategy. There are
opportunities for for-profit driven inclusive innovation. However, relatively few
companies have so far managed to realize the potential of inclusive innovation for
business growth and development impact at larger scale. While high sensitivity to
price is the most obvious characteristic of the BoP, the appropriate economic model
with reasonable returns is critical for the sustainability and expansion of the business.
Moreover, without clear exist strategies, including valuation of the companies, and
regulatory framework on early stage financing, it would be difficult to justify the use
of the public fund in terms of accountability and transparency.

154. As access to the BoP markets often involve higher costs due to the costs
imposed by intermediaries and other distortions, public intervention for the
inclusive innovation can be effective by supporting the establishment of the entire
ecosystem, including lack of information, access to local resources, distribution
channels, and supportive business regulations.

6. Raising Awareness

155. The government has a key role to play in raising awareness of the private
benefits of undertaking innovative activities. This chapter has elaborated on how

                                                                                            83
 in Ethiopia.


government can facilitate innovative activity both to increase firm level productivity
and provide solutions aimed at addressing issues faced by the base of the pyramid.
Key barriers to inclusive innovation include consumer behavior, traditional business
models and information asymmetries that exist. The low rate of farmers’ adoption
rates of improved seeds is a case in point of risk aversion behavior that exists
preventing farmers from trying out something new. It is thus important for the state
to address this by increasing awareness and showcasing successful pilots to ensure
greater adoption of new technologies and processes. Finally, there is a role for
innovation to be encouraged amongst the young minds and for the school curricula
to encourage an innovation driven culture.

156. The objective of all the policy instruments reviewed here is to create an
ecosystem that fosters greater levels of innovative activity promoting greater
productivity and increasing Ethiopian firm competitiveness and increasing the
supply of innovative ideas aimed at addressing the needs of the base of the pyramid
thus bridging growth and equity for the Ethiopian economy.
