                           Box   The proposed change to the mining tax regime
                           1.1   The proposed change is meant “to achieve a more equitable distribution of mineral wealth between the government and the min-
                                 ing companies.” Historically, the government’s total tax take from the mining sector has not met expectations, for several reasons
                                 including tax incentives granted by the government, large tax “assets” resulting from unredeemed capital redemption allowances, and
                                 overall lower profitability of several mining companies. In addition, the government faced challenges in administering profit-based
                                 taxes. But in the past few years, the mining tax take has averaged around 3 percent of GDP, a level similar to that in other
                                 comparable countries; it was set to grow further in the medium term due to larger inflows of corporate income taxes.
                                      The proposed new regime appears to be designed to circumvent the issues discussed above by avoiding profit-based taxes
                                 altogether. It distinguishes profitability of mines by their mining method—open pit versus underground. A higher royalty rate
                                 for open pits suggests that they are considered more profitable. Yet the method is a rather crude way to distinguish profit-
                                 ability. Zambia has open-pit mines with much higher per unit costs than underground mines, and vice versa.

 Box    Definitions and terminology
2.1     The financial services industry is rapidly changing in terms of innovations and players, and many of the terms are being used
        interchangeably, which can get confusing. For this report, we use the following:
        Mobile banking refers to the ability to access one’s bank accounts via a mobile device, either a phone or a tablet. In many
        regards this is just another form of online banking. It is largely an additive service to existing bank customers.
        Mobile money is the term commonly used to describe prepaid stored value wallets that are accessed via the user’s mobile
        device. This service is commonly offered by mobile network operators or third-party providers and is not generally considered
        a deposit account, although there are growing examples of banks that are offering their customers the ability to link their
        deposit accounts to their mobile wallet accounts.
        Mobile payments refer to the ability to transfer funds, either from one user to another or for making purchases. Mobile pay-

                           Box    Overview of available global financial inclusion data
                           2.2      Global financial inclusion data are available from several sources that can be broadly distinguished along the supply and
                                    demand sides of financial inclusion.

institution                         Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2013) provide a detailed description of the Global Findex database.
                                         Aside from global surveys, there are also country-led efforts to collect data on the use of financial services. Such national
                                    surveys have the advantage that they allow countries to tailor their financial inclusion definitions to the local context—at the
                                    cost of international comparison, however. To improve comparison across countries, countries in some instances have modified
                                    existing surveys or agreed to similar methodologies within a subregion. One such example is FinScope, a survey that measures
                                    the use of financial services by individuals in countries across Africa, including Zambia.
                                         This Brief primarily relies on data from the Global Findex database given that it is currently the only database that collects
                                    data on financial inclusion from the perspective of the user of financial services that allows for consistently benchmarking
                                    Zambia against its neighboring countries, Sub-­Saharan Africa, and developing countries in general. Data from the FinScope survey
                                    is available for Zambia for 2009 and reference is made to how these data compare with the Global Findex data from 2011.

 Box   XacBank’s mobile banking challenges in Mongolia
2.3    In Mongolia, with a lower population density than Zambia, XacBank launched Amar mobile banking in 2009 to reach residents
       outside the capital of Ulaanbaatar. The Amar service is performing well, with over 123,000 clients, who have access to 845
       agents and 1,108 merchants. As of mid-2013, the service was conducting over 50,000 transactions a month, worth $3.5 million.
           Despite its success, however, XacBank failed to understand its customers when it launched Amar and so suffered poor
       uptake. While it established a large agent network to serve customers, the initial service itself had limitations that lowered
       usefulness: it required a bank account to be opened, it imposed transaction limits that did not allow for salary payments, and
       the service did not allow for airtime top-up or bill payments, both of which were important to customers. The bank has since
       addressed these issues and improved service considerably, leading to much greater uptake and use.

 Box    the post office
2.5       Post offices around the world have adopted different business models and different types of financial services. Most of them
          provide some cash-merchant services, including remittance services either on behalf of remittance service providers or using
          their own proprietary product. In some countries, post offices also offer financial services beyond cash-merchant services, includ-
          ing deposit and savings accounts and credit products. To offer those products post offices can either go alone or partner with
          a commercial bank (Berthaud and Davico 2013).
               The most successful postal financial inclusion model on the number of unbanked people eventually entering the formal
          financial system is Banco Postal in Brazil. More than 10 million accounts were opened between 2002 and 2011 after Banco
          Postal was set up under a partnership with an existing financial institution (Ansón and Bosch Gual 2008). This partnership
          model provided Brazilian Post with financial sector expertise and an investor in modernizing its network and infrastructure. It
          also allowed Brazilian Post to earn fees and commissions on financial products offered—without taking on the risk.

 Box    How Kenya’s Equity Bank was successful at reaching the lower end of the market
2.6       Equity Bank was founded as Equity Building Society in 1984. Its transformation from a technically insolvent mortgage financer
          in 1993 into a fast-growing microfinance bank and then a commercial bank now listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange and
          Uganda Securities Exchange has attracted widespread attention.
               Its growth was due to an innovative business model that focused on providing financial services to underserved segments
          largely ignored by traditional commercial banks. It succeeded by tailoring its products to its customers, including being less
          restrictive on collateral for small loans and moving its branches and, later, agents—existing businesses licensed to provide
          selected products and services for the bank—closer to its customers. Refocusing its operations around this new customer base
          and bringing in new standards of service won Equity Bank a large and loyal customer base. In expanding financial inclusion
          across Kenya, it also generates sustainable profits. Equity Bank agents today can perform a range of services on behalf of the
          bank, including opening accounts, accepting deposits, paying out withdrawals, and accepting bill payments.
               In recent years, Equity Bank has expanded beyond Kenya into other East African countries.

(BoZ). It was launched in 2004 to reduce                                        switching through VISA International, with
credit and settlement risks in the banking                                      clearing infrastructure located outside the
sector. But it is not widely used partly because                                country. Monetary and time costs dissuade
of high fees charged by some banks. Zambia                                      larger banks from using this switch. Zam-

It has one daily interaction with ZIPSS, and                                    mobile banking, and branch banking. BoZ
is operated through a manual process leav-                                      estimates to complete these three phases by
