2 Thisoutcomes evaluation followed the definition of “outcome”
used in the outcome mapping methodology: a change in the
behavior, relationships, activities, or actions of the people, groups,
and organizations with whom a program works directly.
3 It is up to the principal evaluation user to decide what

substantiation is needed to make the results credible. In this
case, outcome data was provided nearly exclusively by those the
interventions were seeking to influence and not by the World Bank
or SDC staff. Thus, the outcomes were assumed to be credible,
which substantiation of the nine outcome stories confirmed.

    Example of an Outcome Story: World Bank—Public Procurement Intervention


    The evaluators highlighted key outcomes in outcome stories to communicate specific achievements or lessons in
    a narrative format. They produced nine outcome stories.

    OUTCOME STORY 6—The Ministry of Finance adopted Implementing Rules and Regulations for the monitoring
    of public procurement that reflected suggestions from Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).

    Outcome
    In late 2012, the Ministry of Finance adopted new Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for CSO participation
    in bid evaluation committees that included several requests of the Partnership for Public Procurement (PPP), such
    as the use of specific reporting templates and creation of a web portal for CSOs to use when reporting on the
    performance of bid evaluation committees.

    Significance
    The IRR are significant for being a necessary implementation instrument for the 2011 amendment to the Public
    Procurement Law, which mandated the involvement of civil society in public procurement for the first time. This
    was the first time that CSOs working on procurement in Mongolia successfully collaborated to advocate for regu-
    latory changes as a partnership network.

    Contribution
    Financial and technical support for the creation and strategic development of the PPP has been provided by the
    World Bank since 2012 through the Governance Partnership Facility it administers.
       The PPP provided coordinated inputs during the policy dialogue with the Ministry of Finance over the summer
    and autumn of 2012. N. Otgonjargal, chair of the PPP, led and coordinated the contributions of PPP members to
    the drafting of the rules and regulations. The Bank supported the Governance Partnership Facility in developing a
    united message to engage constructively with the government. Bank support included coaching, network build-
    ing and technical advice on procurement monitoring.
