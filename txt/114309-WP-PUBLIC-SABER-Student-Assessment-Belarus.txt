   Key Policy Areas for Student Assessment                                                                Status
   1. Classroom Assessment
        Classroom assessment in Belarus is supported by formal, system-level documents that
        provide comprehensive information on what students are expected to learn and how
        classroom assessment should be conducted by teachers. Mechanisms are in place to
        monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices, and teachers engage in positive
        assessment practices in the classroom. At the same time, there is a need to improve the
        quality and availability of resources that support teachers ’ classroom assessment practices
        and to ensure that high-quality training opportunities are available to teachers on a regular
        basis.

   2.   Examinations
        Centralized Testing is an examination program that is used to select students into higher
        and specialized secondary education in Belarus. The program is overseen by the Republic
        Institute for Knowledge Control (RIKC), is adequately staffed, and is well resourced through
        government funding. The examination is well aligned with other assessment activities in the
        country, and extensive quality assurance procedures are used to help ensure its technical
        quality. At the same time, there is a need to better ensure equitable access to the
        examination, including by students with disabilities, and to introduce mechanisms to monitor
        the impact of the examination on the education system and on students.

   3. National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)
        Belarus’s National Large-Scale Assessment exercise—the Republican Monitoring of
        Education Quality (“Republican Monitoring”)—has been administered annually since 2003.
        The Republican Monitoring exercise aims to assess the degree to which students have
        acquired the content taught under the formal educational program. The Republican
        Monitoring exercise is fully standardized at the system level, and sufficient funding is
        provided through national and local budgets to cover all core assessment activities. The
        Department of Education Quality Monitoring, which oversees the assessment, has most of
        the necessary resources to carry out its responsibilities, although there is room for
        improvement in the availability of computers for technical staff, software, and servers.

   4. International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)
        Belarus has never participated in an ILSA but is taking active steps to participate in the 2018
        administration of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). RIKC will be
        responsible for PISA 2018 activities in the country. RIKC has extensive experience carrying
        out assessments within Belarus. RIKC specialists, as well as staff from the National Institute
        of Education who will help with PISA 2018 activities, are well prepared to commence work
        on the ILSA. To maximize the benefits of participating in PISA 2018, the country may wish to
        consider doing a detailed needs assessment and developing a plan to address areas where
        they will need particular technical support.

The key considerations when evaluating a student
assessment system are the individual and combined
quality of assessment activities in terms of the
adequacy of the information generated to support
decision making. There are three main drivers of
information quality in an assessment system: enabling
context, system alignment, and assessment quality.


Enabling context refers to the broader context in which
the assessment activity takes place and the extent to
which that context is conducive to, or supportive of,
the assessment. It covers such issues as the legislative
or policy framework for assessment activities;             The indicators are identified based on a combination of
institutional and organizational structures for            criteria, including the following:

Assessment quality refers to the psychometric quality

that can be used to review assessment systems and

                                                           standardized questionnaires. The goal of the rubrics is
                                                           to provide a country with some sense of the

performance that can inform further education
reforms and policies.

Detailed information was collected on Belarus’s
student assessment system using the SABER–Student
Assessment questionnaires and rubrics to benchmark
it against best practices. Specifically, a local consultant
with in-depth knowledge of, and experience with, the
education system in Belarus oversaw the completion of
the four SABER-Student Assessment questionnaires:
one questionnaire each for Classroom Assessment,
Examinations, National Large-Scale Assessment, and
International Large-Scale Assessment. The data to
complete these questionnaires were obtained through
interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders 1
and a review of existing official and technical
documents. The information in the completed
questionnaires was then applied to the SABER–Student
Assessment rubrics (one rubric for each assessment
type), and the conclusions of this report were
determined on the basis of this analysis. It is important
to remember that these tools primarily focus on
benchmarking a country’s policies and arrangements
for assessment activities at the system or macro level.
Additional data would need to be collected to
determine actual, on-the-ground practices in Belarus,
particularly by teachers and students in schools.


The following sections discuss the findings by each
assessment type, accompanied by suggested policy
options. The suggested policy options were
determined in collaboration with key local
stakeholders based on Belarus’s immediate interests
and needs. Detailed, completed rubrics for each
assessment type are provided in appendix 5.

for teachers to discuss various topics in education, such
as methodological approaches in various subject areas
and assessment of student learning.

A number of systems are in place to monitor the quality
of classroom assessment practices, including as a part
of school inspection and teacher supervision and
performance evaluation. In addition, high-level
reviews of the quality of education in Belarus include a
focus on classroom assessment, and government
funding is awarded to researchers and practitioners for
research and development on classroom assessment
practices. An external moderation system consists of
subject-area commissions at the district level that
objectively evaluate teachers’ review of examination
questions of students who are being considered to
receive an attestation of general secondary education
with an award of a gold (or silver) medal. At the same
time, a more wide-reaching moderation system, or a
moderation system where teachers from different
schools meet to review assessment tasks, scoring
criteria, and students’ work, with the purpose of
ensuring the validity and comparability of student
scores and grades, is not in place.

Suggested policy options:

1. Increase the quality and availability of resources
   that support teachers’ classroom assessment
   practices. For example:
   a. Improve the quality of student textbooks that
       provide support for classroom assessment.
2. Ensure that high-quality training opportunities
   are available to all teachers on a regular basis. For
   example:

Development Levels                                          the score for these key dimensions. These key variables
                                                            include formal policy, regular funding, having a
1. The country team or consultant collects information      permanent assessment unit, and the quality of
about the assessment system in the country.                 assessment practices.


2. Based on the collected information, a level of
development and score is assigned to each dimension
in the rubrics:


    x   Latent = 1 score point
    x   Emerging = 2 score points
    x   Established = 3 score points
    x   Advanced = 4 score points

3. The score for each quality driver is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
dimensions. For example:


The quality driver “Enabling Context,” in the case of
ILSA, has three dimensions on which a hypothetical
country receives the following scores: Dimension A = 2
points; Dimension B = 2 points; Dimension C = 3 points.
The hypothetical country’s overall score for this quality
driver would be (2+2+3)/3 = 2.33.


4. A preliminary level of development is assigned to
each quality driver.


5. The preliminary development level is validated using
expert judgment in cooperation with the country team
and the World Bank Task Team Leader.


For scores that allow a margin of discretion (e.g., to
choose between two levels of development), a final
decision has to be made based on expert judgment. For
example, the aforementioned hypothetical country
has an “Enabling Context” score of 2.33, corresponding
to a preliminary level of development of “Emerging or
Established.” Based on qualitative information not
captured in the rubric, along with expert judgment, the
country team chooses “Emerging” as the most
appropriate level.


6. Scores for certain key dimensions under “Enabling
Context” (in the case of EXAM, NLSA, and ILSA) and
under “System Alignment” (in the case of CLASS) were
                                                                                                                   20

Classroom Assessment: Development-level rating justifications

    1. “Educational Standards for School Subjects, 2009” is an official learning standards document at the system level that outlines what students at different
       grade or age levels are expected to learn, but does not specify the desired performance level. The document covers subjects such as language (Belarusian
       and Russian), mathematics, biology, geography, world history, history of Belarus, Russian literature, Belarusian literature. Official system-level documents
       also include “Educational Standards for School Subjects” (2012, 2015), which outlines what students at different grade or age levels are expected to learn
       and the desired performance level, and the “Educational Programs for Extracurricular Subjects, 2009–2013,” which outlines what students at different grade
       or age levels are expected to learn but does not specify the desired performance level.

    2. Formal, official documents at the system level that provide guidance for classroom assessment and are available to the general public include:
          - “Assessment Norms for Outcomes of Educational Activity of Students in Educational Subjects”: this document describes (a) what should be assessed,
             (b) criteria for scoring student work, (c) formats and methods for carrying out classroom assessment activities, (d) description of significant and
             insignificant errors in student responses, (e) performance evaluation of students on a 10-point scale, (f) assessment tests and tasks scale to translate
             points for the test into marks, (g) mechanisms for issuing test scores for subjects.
          - Instructions and methodological letter “On Organization of Work of General Secondary Education Institutions to Monitor and Evaluate the Outcomes
             of Learning Activity of Students during the Ungraded Learning Stage I of General Secondary Education”: this document describes (a) what should be
             assessed, (b) principles of ungraded training, (c) a mechanism to evaluate the learning process, (d) types and forms of control under ungraded
             training, (e) methods of formation of adequate student self-esteem, (f) record keeping by teachers and students, and administration of educational
             institutions, (g) rights and responsibilities of students and teachers, and the legal representatives of pupils.
          - “Rules for Certification of Pupils at Mastering Content Educational Programs of General Secondary Education”: this document describes (a) uses of
             assessment information, (b) the form of certification in secondary education institutions, (c) procedure for promotion to the next grade, (d) procedure
             for revising the annual grade.

    3. Extensive resources are available to teachers in the system for their classroom assessment activities.

      Available resources include:
          A. A document that outlines what students are expected to learn in different assessment domains at different grade/age levels
          B. A document that outlines the performance level(s) that students are expected to reach in different assessment domains at different grade/age
              levels
          C. Student textbooks that provide support for classroom assessment (all teachers receive textbooks that contain questions and sample material for
              conducting classroom assessment activities).
          D. Teacher guides (compilations of materials to be used for conducting continuous, intermediate, and final assessment have been published for all
              school subjects in grades 1–11 and are available for purchase; all subject teachers receive funds specifically to acquire the methodological literature).
          E. Scoring criteria or rubrics for grading student work (diagnostic assessment modules for all subjects in grades 1–11 are available on the national
              education portal). All participants in the education process, including students, parents, and teachers, have access to these resources.
                                                                                                                                                                    28

          G. Computer-based classroom assessment resources (diagnostic assessment modules have been development for all subjects in grades 1–11 and made
             available on the national education portal. All stakeholders in the education process, including students, parents, and teachers, have free access to

   4. Extensive high-quality mechanisms are in place at the system level to support the development of teachers’ competencies in classroom assessment and are
      available on an annual basis.

      Available mechanisms include:
          A. Preservice teacher training that addresses competencies in classroom assessment. This mechanism is available to all or almost all teachers, although
              not on an annual basis. This mechanism is considered to be of medium quality.
          B. In-service teacher training that addresses competencies in classroom assessment. This mechanism is available to all or almost all teachers, though
              not on an annual basis, and is considered to be of high quality.
          C. Online resources on classroom assessment. This mechanism is available to all or almost all teachers on an annual basis and is considered to be of
              high quality.
          D. Opportunities to participate in conferences and workshops on classroom assessment. This mechanism is available to all or almost all teachers on an
              annual basis and is considered to be of medium quality.
          E. Opportunities to participate in the development or scoring of test questions for large-scale assessments. This mechanism is considered to be of high
              quality but is available to only a marginal number of teachers and not on an annual basis.
          F. Implementation of experimental and innovative projects on piloting and introduction of new technologies for evaluation of students’ achievements.
              This mechanism is considered to be of high quality but is available to only a marginal number of teachers and not on an annual basis.
          G. Distance learning for teachers in classroom assessment. This mechanism is considered to be of high quality and is available to only a marginal
              number of teachers on an annual basis.
          H. Self-education of teachers in classroom assessment. This mechanism is available to all teachers on an annual basis but is considered to be of medium
              quality.

      Although all or almost all (more than 90 percent) teachers can participate in A, B, C, D, and H, a marginal number (less than 10 percent) of teachers can
      participate in E, F, and G.

                                                                                                                                                               29

   5. Formal mechanisms exist at the system level to monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices. Four mechanisms are found, which is less than
      extensive (five or six mechanisms) and more than minimal (one or two mechanisms).

       Mechanisms include the following: (a) Classroom assessment is a required component of school inspection/teacher supervision, (b) classroom assessment
       is a required component of a teacher’s performance evaluation, (d) regular, high-level reviews of the quality of education include a focus on classroom
       assessment, and (e) government funding is awarded to researchers and practitioners for research and development on classroom assessment practices. An
       external moderation system that consists of commissions in educational subjects at the district level that objectively evaluate the assessment of written
       examination questions of those students who are being considered to receive an attestation of general secondary education with an award of a gold (or
       silver) medal is also in place. At the same time, a more wide-reaching moderation system, or a moderation system where teachers from different schools
       meet to review assessment tasks, scoring criteria, and students’ work, with the purpose of ensuring the validity and comparability of student scores and
       grades is not in place, is not in place.

   6. All or almost all schools report individual student performance on classroom assessment in all subject areas to students and their parents through school-
      wide and class-specific parent-teacher conferences. Student grades are recorded in a classroom journal and in the student’s grade journal (dnevnik). Parents
      are required to review the student’s grade journal every week and every quarter. There is currently a move toward maintaining the classroom journal and
      the student’s grade journal in electronic form. Schools are not required to report to school district, Ministry of Education, or equivalent.

   7. Schools are required to report individual student performance in all subjects, including language and mathematics.

   8. Schools report individual student performance on classroom assessment in all subject areas to students and their parents through schoolwide and class-
      specific parent-teacher conferences. Student grades are recorded in a classroom journal and in the student’s grade journal (dnevnik). Parents are required
      to review the student’s grade journal every week and every quarter. There is currently a move toward maintaining the classroom journal and the student’s
      grade journal in electronic form. Schools are not required to report individual student performance information to school district, Ministry of Education, or
      equivalent entity in any format, including written and electronic.

   9. Classroom assessment is required to be used in an extensive number (four) of ways by teachers, specifically, to:
          - Diagnose student learning issues
          - Provide continuous feedback to students as part of instruction
          - Plan the next steps in instruction
          - Evaluate student performance

   10. Classroom assessment information is required to be used for certification and as an input for selection to the next level within the education system.


                                                                                                                                                                30

   11. Classroom assessment information is used in positive ways by most (50–90 percent) teachers. Specifically, teachers use classroom assessment information
       to:
           - Diagnose student learning issues (most teachers)
           - Provide continuous feedback to students as part of instruction (most teachers)
           - Plan the next steps in instruction (most teachers)
           - Evaluate student performance (all or almost all teachers)

   12. Overall, a marginal number of teachers engage in poor classroom assessment practices.

      No teachers use assessment tools that are not aligned with the pedagogical/curriculum framework; a marginal number of teachers (less than 10 percent)
      apply uneven standards for grading student work; some teachers inflate grades; some teachers overemphasize memorization/recall of information; a
      marginal number of teachers (less than 10 percent) overemphasize the use of multiple choice/selection-type questions; an insignificant number of teachers
      (less than 5 percent) make errors in the scoring or grading of student work.

Examinations: Development-level rating justifications

   1. “Centralized Testing” is an examination program that exists at the system level. This examination was administered for the first time more than 10 years ago (in
      2003) and has since been administered annually.

   2. Results from Belarus’s national examination program, “Centralized Testing,” are used to select individuals into higher and specialized secondary education
      institutions. Centralized Testing can be taken by those individuals who have completed the educational program of general secondary education, of the
      professional-technical education that provides vocational qualification and general secondary education, or of specialized secondary education as confirmed by a
      document of completion of such education. Centralized Testing is also used to inform policy and for evaluating interventions aimed at improving student learning.

   3. The Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus no. 714, “On Approval of the Regulation on the Procedure for Organizing and Holding
      Centralized Testing” (June 6, 2006), is the formal, publicly available, system-level policy document that authorizes the examination program.

   4. A number of formal, publicly available system-level documents provide guidelines on the examination, including what should be assessed, who should be assessed,
      and how the results should be communicated to stakeholders. These documents include the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus no.
      714, “On Approval of the Regulation on the Procedure for Organizing and Holding Centralized Testing” (June 6, 2006); “Rules of Admission of Persons for the 1st
      Stage of Higher Education (as amended by Presidential Decree of 03.20.2014, no. 130)”; the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus no. 19,
      “On Conducting the Centralized Testing in Academic Subjects in 2015” (April 13, 2015); and the Order of the Minister of Education of the Republic of Belarus no.
      323, “On Organization of Centralized Testing in 2015” (April 22, 2015).

   5. The unit with primary responsibility for running the examination program is the Republican Institute for Knowledge Control (RIKC), a permanent agency that took
      charge of the examination more than 10 years ago. Specifically, since 2000, RIKC has been responsible for examination design, administration, project management,
      data processing, and research and development. RIKC is accountable to the Ministry of Education.

       The Ministry of Education also provides guidance on the rules of computing examination scores and the organizational rules at the centers carrying out the Centralized
       Testing. The Ministry of Education is subordinate to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus.

   6. RIKC, which has the primary responsibility for running the Centralized Testing program, is accountable to the Ministry of Education, from which it is institutionally
      separate.

   7. RIKC currently has all of the appropriate resources, including appropriate computers for all technical staff, software, building security, storage facilities, computer
      servers, and communication tools (phone, email, Internet).

                                                                                                                                                                                39

   8. All or almost all (more than 90 percent) of the individuals currently responsible for completing key examination activities have relevant qualifications.

       Individuals responsible for completing key examination activities include:
           - Permanent staff from the examination unit
           - Temporary staff hired to support a particular examination cycle (e.g., examination administrators)

   9. No issues are found with the effectiveness of any of the staff, or else minor issues were identified that have had no consequences for the quality of specific
      examination activities or for the overall quality of the examination.

   10. Funding is available for examination activities. The source of funding for the majority of examination activities is government funding.

       Funding for examination activities supports examination design, administration, data processing, data reporting, project management, and research and development
       activities. These activities are supported by the government budget. Data processing is further supported by RIKC extra-budgetary funds.

   11. Funding is sufficient to cover all core examination activities as well as research and development.

   12. There are sufficient opportunities to learn about the examination. Opportunities to learn did not include university graduate programs.

       Opportunities to learn about examinations include university courses/workshops on the content and skills measured by the examination; non-university
       courses/workshops on examination topics; funding for attending international programs/courses/workshops on student assessment that cover topics relevant to the
       examination; presentations; instruction and methodology meetings with members of organizing committees working in venues of centralized testing; publications
       (articles, collections of materials for centralized testing).

       According to the data provided in the completed SABER–Student Assessment questionnaire, opportunities are generally of high quality and are available to students
       studying in higher education institutions, existing full-time staff in the examination unit (RIKC), university professors, general secondary school educators, and
       specialists in the education management bodies.

       The following opportunities were not available in the system to learn about the examination: university graduate programs (master’s or doctorate level) on student
       assessment that include topics relevant to the examination (e.g., test design, administration); non-university courses/workshops on the content and skills measured
       by the examination (e.g., courses on curriculum); university courses/workshops on examination topics other than the content and skills measured by the examination
       (e.g., test design, administration); internships/short-term employment in the unit running the examination.

   13. Teachers do not perform examination-related tasks.
                                                                                                                                                                       40

   14. The Centralized Testing program is intended to measure official learning standards and curriculum. In practice, the examination is very aligned with what it is
       intended to measure. Officially mandated reviews to ensure that the examination measures what is intended to measure take place in the form of regular external
       reviews and regular internal reviews, both of which take place in all or almost all examination rounds (more than 90 percent).

   15. The Centralized Testing program is closely aligned with Classroom Assessments and National Large-Scale Assessments in Belarus in terms of the content being
       measured.

   16. Materials were available to students to prepare for the examination. On average, these materials were available to most (50 to 90 percent) students.

       Available materials included (a) the official framework document explaining what was measured on the examination; (b) examples of the types of questions that were
       on the examination, provided by RIKC; (c) examples of the types of questions that were on the examination, provided by an entity other than RIKC; (d) information
       on how to prepare for the examination, provided by RIKC; and (e) information on how to prepare for the examination, provided by an entity other than RIKC, such as
       by higher education institutions.

       A, b, and d were available to all or almost all students; c and e were available to some students.

   17. Although the number of materials available to prepare for the examination was extensive, material content was of “medium” quality overall.

   18. Individuals with the following profiles do not face barriers that might prevent otherwise eligible individuals from taking the examination: ethnic, racial, or linguistic
       group identification; gender; or location (e.g., rural or hard-to-reach areas). Individuals with vision, hearing, or musculoskeletal disorders do not take part in the
       Centralized Testing program. Instead, such individuals can participate in entrance examinations in the institutions where they would like to be considered for
       admission, with the format of the examination being determined by the institution taking into account the psychological development of the candidate.

   19. Formal quality assurance procedures were in place to ensure the quality of the examination. These procedures were extensive in number (six or seven), and all
       procedures were required to take place every examination round.

       The following formal quality assurance procedures were in place to ensure the quality of the examination:

           -   A process was outlined by which control of the organization and conduct of Centralized Testing is performed by the State Control Commission for the
               preparation and conduct of entrance examinations to institutions of higher and secondary specialized education, as approved by a Presidential Edict.

       No double processing of data was in place.

   20. The examination was fully standardized at the system level. Assessment design, administration, scoring, and reporting were the same (or equivalent) for all
       students in the examination round.

       Extensive procedures (five or six) were in place to ensure the standardization of the examination at the system level including:
           - Examination papers and tasks were the same or equivalent for all students
           - Examination administrators were trained to ensure that all students took the examination under the same conditions
           - Quality control monitors/observers were used to ensure the same administration conditions in all locations where the examination was administered
           - The same scoring criteria were used to correct the examination questions/items/tasks
           - Examination results were computed using the same procedures for all students
           - Examination results were reported to all students in the same way

   21. No issues affected the examination round. There were instances of errors in the printing of test booklets; however, this did not affect the examination round.

   22. Although the use of unauthorized materials such as prepared answers and notes as well as collusion among candidates via mobile phones, passing of papers, or
       equivalent did take place, the credibility of the examination was not compromised at all because of these inappropriate behaviors.

   23. All or almost all stakeholder groups perceive the examination results as credible.

   24. Students’ Centralized Testing results were kept confidential, in line with official policy.

   25. Examination results were not officially recognized by educational institutions or employers in other countries.

   26. Sufficient options are available to students after they take the examination and receive their results. Students can apply to tertiary education institutions, secondary
       specialized institutions, or vocational education institutions. Individuals may also retake the examination in a future year.

   27. There was documentation on the methods and procedures used during the examination. This documentation was sufficient and for the most part available to the
       general public.

       Documented procedures include:
                                                                                                                                                                            42

       The minimum scores for the Centralized Testing (which allow for individuals to apply to intuitions of higher education) are provided on an annual basis by the Ministry
       of Education. The following aspects of the examination are not documented: pilot testing of questions/items/tasks; analysis of piloted questions/items/tasks;
       marking/scoring of open-ended questions/items/tasks.

   28. To monitor the impact of the Centralized Testing, RIKC produces an Annual Report for all examination rounds. Additionally, the Order of the President of the
       Republic of Belarus provides for the creation of a commission on the control of the preparation and implementation of entrance examinations into institutions of
       higher and secondary specialized education. The commission oversees the preparation and implementation of Centralized Testing every year.

National (of System-Level) Large Scale Assessment (NLSA): Development-level rating justifications

   1. The Republican Monitoring of students’ learning achievement in school subjects was first implemented in 2003, and until 2011 it covered grades 4, 9, and 11. In
      the 2012–13 and 2013–14 school years, it covered grades 3, 8, and 10. Between 2003 and 2014, students’ knowledge and skills were assessed in the subjects of
      mathematics and Belarusian and Russian languages. The assessment also covered biology, chemistry and physics in grades 9 and 11 (in 2003–11) and in grades 8
      and 10 (in 2012–14). In 2012 and 2013, knowledge and skills in social studies were assessed in grades 9 and 10. In the 2014–15 school year, students’ knowledge
      and skills were assessed in the following subjects and grades: grade 6: mathematics, world history; grade 7: physics, biology; grades 5 and 8: reading. From 2003
      to 2006, Republican Monitoring was regulated on an annual basis by the Minister of Education of the Republic of Belarus, and since 2007, it has been regulated
      by the Program on the Development of General Secondary Education for 2007–16.

   2. The policy-mandated purposes of this assessment include informing policy and pedagogy, as well as monitoring education quality and evaluating interventions
      aimed at improving student learning. This assessment is also used to evaluate the extent to which student learning is aligned with the national education
      standards and syllabi requirements.

   3. The Belarus secondary education development program for 2007–16 (Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, 2007) is the formal/official publicly
      available policy document that authorizes the Republican Monitoring.

   4. The decree “On Organization and Carrying Out Monitoring in Secondary Educational Institutions” (Ministry of Education of the Republic of Belarus) provided
      guidelines on the Republican Monitoring, including on its governance, frequency of administration, who should be assessed, what should be assessed, how the
      results should be used, and how stakeholders should be informed of assessment results (including through publication of assessment materials in scientific-
      methodological subject journals, in the magazine Vesnik Adukatsii, and on the national education portal). Guidelines on the confidentiality of results are not
      provided by official documents.

   5. The Department of Education Quality Monitoring was established at the National Institute of Education as a permanent unit with the responsibility for
      scientific-methodological and organizational support of the Republican Monitoring of Education Quality. Five assessment programs fall under the Republican
      Monitoring, including the assessment of:
          a. Students’ learning achievement in school subjects (the assessment program that is the subject of this report)
          b. Student fatigue and efficiency (study of student functional status as well as factors such as the motivation to learn, the level of general learning abilities,
               academic load, compliance with sanitary requirements as to teaching arrangements, etc.)
          c. Student personal development and “educatedness” (study of student perceptions of moral and legal norms in social life; student value system, behavior
               attitudes, level of student professional identity, student social adjustment degree, their awareness of help lines, etc.)
          d. Quality of education services (study of organization efficiency of optional classes, industry-oriented teaching, extra school day, family-school
               interaction, etc.)
                                                                                                                                                                               52

           e. Teachers’ professional competency (study of teachers’ proficiency, their educational orientation) is conducted by the Department of Education
              Sociology and Continuing Education of the Academy of Postdiploma Education.

       The Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the National Institute of Education has had the primary responsibility of overseeing key national large-scale
       assessment scientific-methodological and organizational activities as related to the Republican Monitoring since 2003. The unit is responsible for assessment
       design, administration, data processing, and data reporting, including the preparation of data analysis and reporting of assessment results as well as for providing
       recommendations on the basis of the assessment results.

       The Ministry of Education oversees the project management activities of the assessment and ensures the quality of the assessment materials.

       In accordance with the Order of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Belarus, committees that are responsible for education management in an oblast (1)
       select the coordinator for conducting the Republican Monitoring in institutions of general secondary education; (2) organize the participation of external observers
       (specialists from the rayon/city educational and methodological departments, specialists from the institutes of educational development) and the carrying out of
       the Republican Monitoring in regional education institutions; (3) organize technical support for the implementation of the Republican Monitoring in education
       institutions in the region (copying of materials, scanning of materials, carrying out a survey on the computer); and (4) provide verification and assessment of
       student responses in educational institutions and in the institutes of education quality. School coordinators, who are appointed by the director of an educational
       institution, are responsible for the implementation of assessment activities in the educational institutions. Temporary subject commissions, comprising subject
       teachers with the highest qualifications and teacher-methodologists (at the rayon level and in the institutes of educational development), are formed for the
       purposes of verification and evaluation of students’ work.

       Various departments and regional authorities, including those overseeing education at the oblast level and city (for example, the committee on education of the
       city of Minsk) and departments of education, sport, and tourism, conduct an external review of carrying out the assessment in the education institutions.

   6. The Department of Education Quality Monitoring is part of the National Institute of Education, which is accountable to the Ministry of Education.

       The Ministry of Education is accountable to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, and the Department of Education with oblast (rayon) executive
       committees is accountable to the oblast (rayon) executive committee.

       No unit with assessment responsibility is accountable to an autonomous board or committee that is institutionally separate from units in charge of the NLSA.

   7. The budget for Republican Monitoring was provided by national and local government funding sources and covered assessment design, administration, data
      processing, data reporting, and project management. Research and development activities on the topic of assessment of the quality of education are also
      financed through other government sources.

                                                                                                                                                                              53

   8. Funding was sufficient to cover all core assessment activities.

   9. The NLSA unit has most of the appropriate resources. Appropriate storage facilities and communication tools were the most readily available resources, while
      computers for all technical staff, software, and servers as well as building security were generally widely available.

   10. Individuals responsible for completing key assessment activities included the permanent staff from the Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the
       National Institute of Education, permanent staff from the Research and Development Centre of the National Institute of Education (who carry out research on
       assessment issues, perform external review of diagnostic materials for monitoring, and develop educational standards and syllabi), experts from local
       educational authorities or local institutions of education development are involved as external observers, and teachers (teacher-methodologists of the highest
       qualification who work on subject commissions). All of the individuals responsible for completing key assessment activities had relevant qualifications for their
       roles.

   11. Individuals responsible for completing key assessment activities included permanent staff from the Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the National
       Institute of Education, permanent staff from the Research and Development Centre of the National Institute of Education, and education specialists hired to
       support the assessment cycle. Generally no issues were found with the effectiveness of these individuals. Subject-matter teachers of the highest qualification
       are also invited to work on subject commissions. Experts from the Department of Education Quality Monitoring developed scoring guides to facilitate teachers’
       review and evaluation of students’ tests. The subject committees include only top-ranked teachers and supervising teachers. Some issues were found with the
       effectiveness of these teachers (for example, some teachers overlooked errors, which was noted by the Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the
       National Institute of Education) specialists; however, the quality of the assessment overall was not compromised as a result.

   12. There were sufficient opportunities to learn about the NLSA. Opportunities included:
          a. University graduate programs (master’s or doctorate level) on student assessment that include topics relevant to the NLSA (e.g., test design, reporting).
              “Monitoring of the quality of knowledge on the subject” courses are organized in higher pedagogical educational institutions.
          b. University courses/workshops on the content and skills measured by the NLSA (e.g., courses on curriculum). In higher pedagogical educational
              institutions, as part of pedagogy and methods of teaching courses, topics include subject syllabus and learning outcomes to be measured in the course
              of education (as well as monitoring). For example, “Monitoring of the Quality of Knowledge on the Subject” courses are made available.
          c. Nonuniversity courses/workshops on the content and skills measured by the Republican Monitoring (e.g., courses on curriculum). In continuing
              education institutions (Academy of Postdiploma Education, regional education development institutions) advanced training course syllabi cover topics
              such as learning outcomes and measurement approaches. For example, the National Institute of Education carries out live and distance-learning
              courses and methodological workshops for subject teachers on the topic of “Teacher and Student Control and Assessment.”



                                                                                                                                                                           54

           d. Nonuniversity courses/workshops on Republican Monitoring topics other than the content and skills measured by the assessment (e.g., test design,
              reporting). The Republican Institute of High School (RIHS) runs advanced training courses on the “Basic Theory and Methods of pedagogical
              measurements.”
           e. Funding for attending international programs, courses, and workshops on student assessment that cover topics relevant to the Republican Monitoring
              Education. Quality assessment system experts participate in education quality assessment training courses (including carrying out monitoring research)
              in the Russian Training Centre of the Institute of Education of NRU “Higher School of Economics” and in the Eurasian Association of Educational
              Assessment (EAOKO) and participate in international expert consultations on student academic achievement assessment.
           f. Opportunities to participate in webinars, distant learning courses, and online student academic achievement conferences. Specifically, education
              experts participate in online student academic achievement conferences, in webinars of the Russian Training Centre of the Institute of Education of
              NRO “Higher School of Economics,” and benefit from the study materials published on the Eurasian Association of Educational Assessment (EAOKO)
              website.

       Opportunity (a) is available only to those studying in higher education institutions. Opportunities (b), (c), and (e) are available only to existing full-time staff at the
       NLSA unit, university professors, and primary and secondary school teachers and educators. Opportunities (d) and (f) are available only to existing full-time staff
       of the NLSA unit, other specialists of the National Institute of Education, and specialists of RIKC.

       University courses/workshops on NLSA topics other than the content and skills measured by the Republican Monitoring (e.g., test design, reporting),
       internships/short-term employment in the unit running the Republican Monitoring, or presentations about the Republican Monitoring (e.g., test design,
       administration) are not made available.

   13. The Republican Monitoring is intended to measure official learning standards and the official curriculum, with which it is closely aligned. Officially mandated
       reviews ensure that the Republican Monitoring measures what it is intended to measure as part of the Republican Monitoring, including regular internal and
       external reviews that take place during all or almost all Republican Monitoring rounds. Specifically, diagnostic tools for the Republican Monitoring are subject
       to:
           a. Internal review in the Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the National Institute of Education
           b. Informal external review in laboratories of the Research and Development Centre of the National Institute of Education
           c. Formal external review in the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Belarus (in accordance with the decrees of the Minister of Education, all
               diagnostic and instruction materials for carrying out the Republican Monitoring are to be coordinated in the Departments of the Ministry of Education).

   14. Although the format of the questions across assessment types may different, classroom assessment and examinations are closely aligned with the Republican
       Monitoring.


                                                                                                                                                                                     55

   15. Public school educators provide students with the opportunity to be exposed to the content and skills measured by the Republican Monitoring.

       School educators provide all or almost all students with the opportunity to be exposed to the content and skills measured by the Republican Monitoring through
       regular course instruction at school.

       Students can also access samples of previously administered Republican Monitoring assessments.

       Students in private institutions of general secondary education comprise 0.07 percent of students in institutions of general secondary education in the Republic
       of Belarus and are therefore not included in the Republican Monitoring sample. Thus, although public schools are covered in this review, private schools are not.

   16. During meetings with coordinators of the assessment in institutions of general secondary education in the regions, which take place on an annual basis at the
       National Institute of Education, information on the main areas of the assessment, the objectives and content of the assessment in the given year, and the types
       of questions that will be on the assessment are discussed. Similar meetings are held immediately before the implementation of the Republican Monitoring in
       every region for coordinators in those institutions where the Republican Monitoring will take place (those institutions that are include in the sample).

   17. Sufficient formal quality assurance procedures were in place to ensure the quality of the Republican Monitoring. Procedures that were required to take place
       every assessment round include:
           a. All proctors or administrators were trained according to a protocol
           b. There was a standardized manual for NLSA administrators
           c. All answer sheets were numbered
           d. There were external observers (e.g., specialists from the rayon or city teaching offices of institutes of educational development)
           e. There were internal observers (e.g., NLSA staff observing at administration sites)
           f. Double data scoring (conducted by rayon subject commissions and subject commissions formed on the basis of the oblast institute of educational
                development; in cases of discrepancies in scoring, National Institute of Education specialists conduct a review as well).

       Procedures that were not required to take place every assessment round include:
           a. Piloting of questions/items/tasks before the official NLSA administration
           b. Training of scorers to ensure high interrater reliability
           c. Double processing of data.

   18. The Republican Monitoring is fully standardized at the system level. Assessment design, administration, scoring, and reporting are the same (or equivalent) for
       all students in the same assessment round. Specifically:
            a. Republican Monitoring papers and questions/items/tasks were the same or equivalent for all students
                                                                                                                                                                           56

           b.   Republican Monitoring administrators were trained to ensure that all students took the NLSA under the same conditions
           c.   Quality control monitors/observers were used to ensure the same administration conditions in all locations where the NLSA was administered
           d.   The same scoring criteria were used to correct the Republican Monitoring questions/items/tasks and
           e.   Republican Monitoring results were computed using the same procedures for all students.

       Republican Monitoring results are not reported to all students in the same way.

   19. A representative random sample of public school students in the target grades is selected to participate in the Republican Monitoring.

       Students in private institutions of general secondary education comprise 0.07 percent of students in institutions of general secondary education in the Republic
       of Belarus and are therefore not included in the Republican Monitoring sample.

   20. The Republican Monitoring is administered to students studying in secondary schools under the secondary school curriculum. All eligible students can take part
       in the Republican Monitoring. Starting in 2014, students from all rural schools have an equal opportunity to be included into the Republican Monitoring sample.
       This required increasing the number of external observers by employing specialists from the rayon and city teaching offices of the institutes of education
       development.

   21. Errors in item/question/task development and errors in scoring student responses did occur; however, these did not affect the Republican Monitoring.

       To avoid incorrect instructional wording in diagnostic materials used on the Republican Monitoring, a decision was made to carry out pilot research to test the
       diagnostic materials before the administration of the assessment. Additionally, to avoid scoring errors, a decision was made to brief the subject committee
       members in charge of checking students’ tests to provide additional guidance on the scoring procedures.

       The following issues did not occur: errors in test design; delays in test design; delays in item/question/task development; errors in administering the NLSA; delays
       in administering the NLSA; poor training of NLSA administrators; delays in scoring student responses; errors in data processing; delays in data processing; errors
       in reporting results; delays in reporting results; results not being reported.

   22. The only inappropriate behavior that took place was students copying from other students. This inappropriate behavior did not affect the credibility of the
       Republican Monitoring, and a decision has been made to increase the number of different versions of the assessment from two to four to address this issue.

       The following inappropriate behaviors did not occur: leakage of the content of the NLSA paper or part of a paper before the NLSA administration; students being
       trained to answer specific questions on the NLSA; students being excluded from taking the NLSA; providing student assistance via teachers, supervisors, mobile
       phone, or equivalent during the administration of the NLSA; changing students’ responses after they have submitted their NLSA papers; changing students’ results
       (e.g., score points) after their papers have been scored.
                                                                                                                                                                              57

   23. Information on the evaluation and assessment of all questions is provided in the “Recommendations for Evaluation and Assessment of Students’ Work” document
       that is made available on the website of the management of the monitoring of the quality of education at the National Institute of Education on the day that the
       Republic Monitoring takes place. This information is made available to assessment coordinators in those educational institutions that took part in the monitoring.
       The following methods and procedures are not documented: construction of questions/items/tasks; pilot testing of questions/items/tasks; analysis of piloted
       questions/items/tasks; test assembly; reliability; scaling; setting cutoff scores.

   24. An official report on the results of the Republican Monitoring is submitted to the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Belarus (in accordance with the
       decree of the Minister of Education). Based on the report, recommendations on enhancing the quality of secondary school education are prepared and
       published on the national educational portal and in research and methodological journals. The report provides information about the number of students who
       acquired the content of the taught (and assessed) subject at a high, sufficient, average, acceptable, and low level. Official results of the Republican Monitoring
       are made available at the Ministry of Education and in education-specific scientific-methodological journals, as well as on the national education portal, which
       publishes a summarized version with recommendations on how to improve the management of education quality. Results are communicated at the collegium
       of the Ministry of Education, at meetings of specialists of the education system, and as part of seminars for increasing teacher qualifications. National results at
       the question/item level are also available through the newspaper Nastaunitskaya Gazeta. Teachers of general secondary education, parents, and the local
       authorities have access to this information.


   25. Most stakeholder groups perceive the Republican Monitoring results as credible.

   26. The impact of the Republican Monitoring on the education system is studied by experts of the Department of Education Quality Monitoring of the National
       Education Institute through:
           a. Focus-group studies involving secondary school teachers at the premises of local education development institutes (at advanced education courses,
               methodological workshops, and meetings) (which occurs during most NLSA rounds) as well as individual and group discussions with secondary school
               teachers at the later monitoring rounds (which occurs during most NLSA rounds)
           b. Benchmarking of student academic achievement level for school subjects of various target groups (based on the results of various monitoring rounds)
               (which occurs during some NLSA rounds)
           c. Content analysis of republished syllabi and textbooks (which occurs during some NLSA rounds).

       The following mechanisms are not in place to monitor the impact of the NLSA: oversight committee; expert review groups; funding for independent research on
       the NLSA; studies (e.g., effect on school practices) on the NLSA.

       Over the past six assessment rounds, Republican Monitoring results have informed:
          a. Syllabi adjustment for school subject upon republishing in 2009 and 2012
                                                                                                                                                                              58

International Large Scale Assessment (ILSA): Development-level rating justifications

   1. Belarus has not participated in an international large-scale assessment exercise.

   2. Belarus is planning to take part in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2018). Funding support for PISA 2018–related activities in Belarus
      will be provided through a World Bank project loan.

       The Republican Institute for Knowledge Control (RIKC) will be responsible for PISA 2018 activities in the country. RIKC has prior experience carrying out
       assessments because its main function is to carry out the Centralized Testing in Belarus. Specialists who work at the National Institute of Education, the Academy
       of Post-diploma Education, institutes of educational development, and local educational authorities are also prepared to work on PISA 2018, mainly because of
       their previous experience working on the Republican Secondary Education Quality monitoring program. These experts have degrees in pedagogy, social studies,
       and psychology, and many of them have completed training courses relevant to PISA, including a “Basic Theory and Methods of Pedagogical Measurements”
       course. National education quality assessment system experts regularly participate in webinars conducted by the Higher School of Economics Russian Training
       Centre at the Institute of Education in Moscow and receive information on education quality assessment from Eurasian Association for Educational Assessment
       (EAOKO) news bulletins.

       Experts from the National Institute of Education also have experience conducting research in the area of educational assessment. In 2013 the institute, in
       association with the Russian National Training Foundation, conducted research to measure the information and communication competencies of grade 9 students
       in Belarus. The “Information and Communication Competence Assessment of Grade 9 Students in the Republic of Belarus” project was implemented within the
       framework of a small grants program implemented by the Russian Centre for International Cooperation in Education Development (CICED).

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results
       (SABER) initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on
       education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping
       countries systematically strengthen their education systems.
       SABER evaluates the quality of education policies against
       evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic tools and
       detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers,
       and parents to policy makers and business people—an
       accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of
       their country’s education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of student
       assessment.
