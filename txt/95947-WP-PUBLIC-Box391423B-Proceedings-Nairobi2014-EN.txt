1.         INTRODUCTION


1.1.       Context and Objectives

The General Assembly of the Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP) was held in
Nairobi, Kenya, on October 31, 2014. It was preceded by meetings of the SSATP
working groups on urban mobility and on integration, connectivity and cohesion
together with the Transport Coordination Committee of the Regional Economic
Communities (REC-TCC) on October 27, 2014.

These events took place around the first Conference of the Africa Sustainable
Transport Forum (ASTF) on October 28 to 30. The Conference was sponsored by the
SSATP together with the Government of Kenya through the Ministry of
Infrastructure and Transport, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
the World Bank and the United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-
Habitat). The proceedings of the ASTF are the subject of a separate document.




The objectives of the meetings on October 27 were:

          Urban mobility working group: validate the urban mobility and accessibility
           policy paper prepared by the SSATP;
          REC-TCC: Reach a consensus among stakeholders on its role and
           institutional framework; and review the lessons learnt through the regional




                                                                                    1
           integration activities of the current SSATP Second Development Plan (DP2),
           notably on the trucking industry and the transport observatories;
          Urban mobility and integration, connectivity and cohesion working groups:
           define the work program of the SSATP Third Development Plan (DP3) for
           2015; and review the governance of the SSATP during the DP3.
The road safety pillar of the DP3 was discussed in Addis Ababa in June 2014 prior to
the October meetings. The outcomes of the discussions were presented during the
General Assembly and are included in the proceedings.

The objectives of the SSATP General Assembly on October 31 were:

          Endorse the annual report of the DP2;
          Endorse the statutes and the governance framework of the SSATP for the
           DP3;
          Endorse the 2015 work program of the SSATP DP3;
          Illustrate the need to proactively drive the sustainable transport agenda and
           point out the critical roles of SSATP and its key stakeholders: the ministers
           of transport.




1.2.       Participation in the Annual Meeting

Overall, 25 ministers and delegates from 42 countries, three regional economic
communities, one African organization, the private sector, seven development
partners and representatives from academia, civil society and NGOs attended the
events during the week including the Africa Sustainable Transport Forum.
Participants in the ASTF represented both the transport and the environment sectors.
Participants in the SSATP events represented the transport sector with experts
attending the working groups and the ministers and other members in accordance
with the SSATP statutes attending the SSATP General Assembly. The list of
participants is attached in Annex F.

2.       SSATP WORKING GROUPS AND REC-TCC


2.1.     Urban Mobility and Accessibility Working Group

Urban Mobility and Accessibility Policy Paper
The working group reviewed the urban mobility and accessibility policy paper
prepared by the SSATP based on literature review, data collection in 20 cities, field
visits in eight cities and stakeholder consultation. A first version of the paper was
discussed during the stakeholders’ workshop organized by the SSATP in Dakar in
December 2013. After the workshop, significant work was done in particular to
structure the recommendations into a clear understandable and easy to use
framework.

The paper identified ten key issues that impact on accessibility and mobility in the
context of strong growth of urban areas in Africa.




                                                                                   3
Recommendations to address these issues aim at achieving a vision of sustainable
mobility and accessibility with well-performing transport systems in urban areas
providing all inhabitants adequate access to essential services and social and
economic opportunities, a key contribution to decent living conditions:

    •   Users and economic stakeholders have universal access to an efficient
        transport system, are aware of their rights and obligations when using public
        space, are conscious of the risks and effects of their travelling, especially
        those related to public health and the environment, and are provided with
        the possibility to participate/contribute to the development of the transport
        system.
    •   The urban territory is laid out in such a way as to bolster accessibility, quality
        of life, economic competitiveness and social inclusion, while at the same
        time preserving natural resources. Urban form and land use minimize the
        number of passenger and commercial trips, travel distances; as well as all
        costs associated with transport infrastructure and transport services.
    •   Public space allocated to mobility is equitably shared among the various
        transport modes, with particular care given to pedestrians and public
        transport services. In the developing areas of the agglomeration, enough
        public space is allocated for predictable increase in traffic volumes for all
        transport modes, and for parking needs.
    •   Transport infrastructure (roads, streets, railways, bus-exclusive infrastruc-
        ture, waterways, transport interchanges, etc.) allows for safe and efficient
        travel (continuity and fluidity), while at the same time preserving the sur-
        rounding living environment. Transport infrastructure is resilient to climate
        change.
    •   Transport services are efficient and financially viable, and provide access for
        all to the entire urbanized territory, in particular for the most vulnerable us-
        ers.
    •   Safe and clean vehicles display low energy consumption and low carbon
        emissions, and reduce road safety-related risks to vehicle occupants and to
        all other users.
    •   All above mentioned components maximize positive social and economic
        impacts while minimizing negative impacts, thanks to coherent, efficient and
        well-funded interventions and regulation ensured by knowledgeable and ac-
        countable public institutions serving the general interest.

In order to give effect to this vision, the EASI conceptual framework for action has
been developed to ground and guide public action towards enhanced accessibility and
sustainable mobility in African urban areas. The framework integrates two main
dimensions: the governance system and the urban transport system itself. Synthetized
by the verb “Enable”, the first component of the framework focuses on the enabling
environment for a sound urban transport governance system. The other three
elements of the framework are “Avoid”, “Shift” and “Improve”, and they refer to the
main levers of intervention on the urban transport system.

The four elements are associated to the following set of objectives:

    •    ENABLE - To establish an efficient and responsible governance system, ca-
         pable of anticipating needs, guiding action and ensuring integrated man-
         agement and development of the urban transport system.
    •    AVOID - To minimize the need for individual motorized travel and promote
         public transport and non-motorized mobility through better urban forms
         and land use.
    •    SHIFT - To increase or maintain the modal shares of public transport and
         non-motorized transport modes, such as walking and cycling.
    •    IMPROVE - To improve the efficiency and safety of transport modes while
         minimizing their environmental footprint.
The EASI conceptual framework is schematically presented below.

  Figure 1: EASI, a conceptual framework to steer public action towards sustainable
                   accessibility and mobility in African urban areas




                                                                                      5
                A set of 20 policy recommendations has been then developed associated to the
                framework aimed at policy and decision-makers in charge of urban areas and
                transport systems in Africa.

                With more than 40 participants, the working group confirmed the pertinence of the
                EASI concept and its applicability to urban areas in Africa. SSATP will now finalize
                the paper and disseminate it to stakeholders. The proposed work program for the
                Third Development Plan of the SSATP will focus on the policy recommendations
                proposed in support of the EASI concept.


                         2015 Work Program

                The working group identified priorities for 2015 within the 4-year program
                developed around the EASI concept. The program is built around a sub-set of seven
                policy recommendations selected based on their consistence with the vision
                underpinning the DP3, the mission of the SSATP, the field of interventions of the
                SSATP in the policy development cycle, and their relevance and added value in terms
                of most effective outcomes, best complementarity with other programs/initiatives and
                visible impact within the limited timeframe of the DP3. Reviewing the 4-year
                program, the working group commented that it may be overambitious and that it
                should be reviewed regularly and adjusted as necessary.

                The working group recognized that the four aspects of the EASI framework are
                important for SSATP but that the “Enable” component should be given priority in
                the early years of the DP3. In particular there is a strong demand for activities which
                strengthen management capacity. The following five activities were recommended as
                priority for 2015:

                     • Develop and publish guidelines to support the establishment of an entity in charge of urban
                       transport planning, management and coordination with all stakeholders.
 Knowledge
                     • Develop and publish guidelines to support the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms
  creation             for urban transport systems.
                     • Develop and publish guidelines to support planning and implementation of efficient traffic and
                       parking management.

 Capacity
 Building            • Guidance on the establishment of a multimodal approach to the development and management of
                       urban transport systems (1-2 cities).


 Advocacy &          • Organize a conference and workshop cycle to build ownership of policy measures and support the
Dissemination
                       dissemination of the guidelines and the results of research projects.




                6
2.2.       Integration, Connectivity, Cohesion Working Group

The integration, connectivity, cohesion Pillar of the DP3 has three objectives: (i)
promote effective policy and strategy formulation and implementation for corridor
development at country and regional levels; (ii) develop capacity among institutions
(RECs, countries, corridors, industry associations, etc.) for inclusive policy dialogue
on regional integration; and (iii) promote efficient logistics services. The activities will
consist of assessments and case studies, reviews of capacity building needs and
capacity building support, dissemination of best practices and advocacy and support
to knowledge application.

The working group prioritized the work program for 2015 starting from the
programs of the RECs and the corridor management authorities (CMAs), to ensure
that policies developed under the DP3 will be then actually implemented through the
ongoing programs. The second parameter in the choice of priority activities was the
geographical coverage and the need to involve all regions of Africa to ensure sustained
interest of regional economic communities (RECs) and CMAs. In particular, more
consultation is needed with West and North Africa. The meeting also suggested
targeting implementation of the pillar during a 2-year rather than a 3-year period.

The following expressions of interest were received during the meeting:

       •   The East African Community (EAC) has identified the need to evaluate the
           impact of the construction of the one-stop border post (OSBP) at Rusumo
           and Namanga funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
           The evaluation ex-ante could be based on assumptions of improvements in
           terms of traffic and time and cost of cross-border movements. A more com-
           prehensive methodology would be proposed including monitoring require-
           ments to evaluate the impact ex-post when actual data become available af-
           ter construction.
       •   The Intergovernmental Authority on development (IGAD) reminded that
           SSATP had included support to the Djibouti corridor under the current Sec-
           ond Development Plan but no work was carried out. SSATP will contact
           IGAD to identify the specific needs and the support that can be provided
           under the DP3.
       •   The Northern Corridor Transit Transport Coordination Authority
           (NCTTCA) would like support to integrate the load control charter out-
           comes into its observatory, and in its Strategic Plan. This is a continuation of
           the support provided to EAC and NCTTCA under the current Second De-
           velopment Plan.




                                                                                          7
       •    EAC requested assistance in managing public private partnerships (PPPs) for
            road infrastructure development and also for performance-based contract-
            ing for roads. This type of activity is not included under the DP3, but the
            African Development Bank indicated that this is an area where it could pro-
            vide support.
While more work is needed to finalize the work program, the following guiding
structure was agreed:

The meeting designated a task force 1 to finalize the work program in consultation
with the RECs, CMAs, AUC, Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) and regional
organizations by mid-December.

2.3.        Road Safety Working Group

The objectives of the road safety pillar of the DP3 are to: (i) enable the African Union
Commission (AUC) and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)
to encourage countries to achieve the goals of the UN Decade of Action for Road
Safety and Africa Road Safety Plan of Action 2011-2020; (ii) promote effective policy
and strategy formulation and implementation at country level; (iii) stimulate good
practice in Road Safety Management (Pillar one of the UN Decade of action) by
promoting systematic implementation of the Africa Plan of Action; and (iv) better
integrate road safety policy and pillar-based interventions in locally and externally
funded road developments.

2.4.     REC-TCC

The session reviewed the lessons from the recent SSATP work on corridor
observatories and trucking services. The session also discussed the role and structure
of the REC-TCC.


         Institutionalization of the REC-TCC

The REC-TCC was created in 2005 with two objectives: knowledge sharing and
coordination of regional integration programs. The meeting in Nairobi discussed the
achievements in those two areas. It found that knowledge sharing was successful and
beneficial although resource constraints forced to reduce over the years the amount
of time allocated to sharing of knowledge in the meetings. On the other side, regional
coordination was less successful because of the uneven participation of the RECs
themselves in the REC-TCC, the meetings being more regularly attended by corridor
management authorities, the private sector, representatives from regional programs
and development partners.

The meeting recommended in the future to strengthen the knowledge sharing aspects
of the REC-TCC by disseminating information on regional integration programs and
good practices across the stakeholders. Rather than organizing costly bi-annual
meetings, it was suggested to use ICT to organize more frequent meetings based on
the demand (webinars, virtual meetings, etc.)

The following needs for further exchange of experiences were identified:

          tools for the transport observatories (SSATP Transport Observatory
           Guidelines notably); and
          experience of corridors and industry organizations in using the infor-
           mation from observatories in the policy dialogue.
The form of webinars targeting a wider audience will be experimented for these
exchanges.
The meeting recognized the need for coordination, and distinguished two levels of
coordination: regional, and continental. The RECs may give priority to the
coordination within their own regions and not among RECs. Some RECs have
developed successful coordination mechanisms, notably the EAC with MoUs with
Corridor Management Institutions. At continental level, coordination exists through
the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa of the African Union
Commission. The Chair of the REC-TCC was mandated to approach all RECs to
discuss their views on the coordinating role of the REC-TCC, taking into




12
consideration that in itself, exchange and sharing of experience plays an important
role in the coordination of the nature of the response to regional integration
challenges across RECs.

         Corridor observatories

Corridor performance monitoring is important to guide the policy dialogue and to
improve corridor efficiency. Setting up corridor observatories provides the
monitoring capacity but using the results of the observatories to further the policy
dialogue requires in general the existence of corridor management institutions, which
are not yet in place in some regions or for some corridors.
Monitoring data can be obtained from two main sources. Data provided by public
agencies such as ports and customs, or by private logistics operators are available
continuously and can be used to analyze trends, to benchmark performance and
identify issues. Dedicated surveys provide the additional information that is necessary
for a deepened analysis and a detailed understanding of specific issues. This emerging
dual model of monitoring is used by the NCTTCA.

Reporting mechanisms can be used as instruments to engage with regulatory
institutions as practiced for road blocks and delays by IRTG in West Africa or for
non-tariffs barriers by FESARTA and Borderless Alliance. They can also feed into
operational entities such as for the weekly meetings of the port community in Kenya
or into policy agencies (Regional Economic Communities or corridor management
authorities).

         Trucking Services

The session illustrated how surveys are useful as an entry point for the development
of trucking policies. Surveys enable a better understanding of the constraints for the
operators, and the impact on their profitability, and therefore on costs and prices. In
East Africa, the surveys carried out by the Corridor Management Authorities with the
support of TFF-SSATP became the foundation for a dialogue between the East
African Community, the Northern Corridor Transportation and Transit
Coordination Authority, the government of Kenya and the trucking industry. The
dialogue culminated in the signing of a self-regulatory axle load charter for Kenya
with efforts underway to replicate the charter in other countries along the Northern
corridor and other EAC countries. Similar surveys in West Africa are used to
underpin the dialogue on the professionalization of the trucking industry in support
of the programs developed by the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

2.5.     Joint Session

The joint session with both working groups reviewed the new governance framework
proposed for the DP3. The framework has been designed based on the lessons learned
from the mid-term review of the current development plan and reflects six guiding
principles: ownership and inclusiveness, demand-driven program, focus on results,
sustainability, transparency and accountability. In particular, as practiced since 2012,
the representation of countries in the governance framework of the SSATP has been
elevated at the level of Permanent Secretaries or equivalent in the Ministries in charge
of transport. This allows inputs into the program from representatives who have the
mandate and the authority to decide on policies and strategies in the transport sector
in Africa and also provides a relay for the program to feed into policies and strategies
developed by the countries. Other changes in the governance framework compared to
the current development plan are an increased number of African representatives in
the Executive Committee of the SSATP, an independent panel of experts to assess the
performance of the program and the actual achievements compared to the objectives
of the results framework, and the creation of thematic working groups to be the
working counterpart to the SSATP team. The governance structure is detailed in the
statutes of the program and is summarized in the following figure.
                      Figure 2: Governance structure of the DP3




14
The roles of the various components of the governance structure will be:

       General Assembly: approve the statutes, endorse SSATP members, endorse
        development plans, work programs and annual reports. Outside the General
        Assembly, its members will also have an important role to champion the
        SSATP products as inputs into the development of policies and strategies.
        Members of the General Assembly will designate their representatives in the
        working groups.
       Executive Committee: approve development plans, annual work programs
        and budgets, oversee DP3 implementation and report to the General Assem-
        bly on activities of the committee and achievements of the SSATP. The
        members of the Executive Committee are expected to be the champion of
        the SSATP within their constituencies and also with other potential financi-
        ers of the program.
       Independent Panel of Experts: evaluate the results of the DP3 compared to
        the results framework and advise the Executive Committee on consistency
        between the vision, mission, strategic orientations and actual activities and
        results. The members of the panel report to the Executive Committee.
       Working groups: identify annual work programs, advise the SSATP Program
        Management Team at all stages of product developments from planning un-
        til completion, convene in-country/region events to present and discuss
        knowledge generated by the SSATP.
The session also discussed the proposed changes in the definition of SSATP
membership. Under the previous development plans, membership was based on the
expression of support to the declaration adopted by the Ministers of Transport
during the 2005 SSATP annual meeting. Under the DP3, membership is proposed to
become the expression of an interest in the themes of the DP3 and a commitment to
act at some level (from awareness creation to implementation of policies) in the
policy areas developed by the SSATP. Membership means the right to vote in the
SSATP General Assembly, to be a core member of the SSATP working groups, to
benefit from SSATP support through the activities of the program and in particular
during knowledge application and capacity development activities, and to attend
SSATP events as sponsored participant.




                                                                                        15
Parties interested in becoming members of SSATP (and eligible in accordance with
the SSATP statutes) would express their commitment covering the following areas:

        confirm knowledge of SSATP mission and support to its mission;
        confirm knowledge of the DP3 and understanding of its goal: “efficient, safe
         and sustainable transport for the people in Africa”;
        identify specific areas of interest in the DP3;
        confirm understanding of the terms of reference of the working groups and
         commitment to contribute;
        agree to have an advocacy role or make use of SSATP products; and
        agree to define annually how the commitment is implemented in the area(s)
         of interest

3.         GENERAL ASSEMBLY


The General Assembly (GA) was a critical milestone for both the DP2 and the DP3
with the presence of 12 ministers and 25 countries. This was the first opportunity
since the Bamako meeting in 2005 to have the ministers of transport around a table
discussing the SSATP, countries being represented usually at the level of Permanent
Secretaries or equivalent. The interest shown by the ministers and the pertinence of
the comments and recommendations, similarly to the high level of discussions during
the Africa Sustainable Transport Forum during the week, bode well with regard to the
support from the countries to the policy agenda of the DP3 and their commitment to
act and achieve results in the focus areas of the program.

The GA reviewed the progress in the implementation of the DP2 during the past year
since the 2013 annual meeting in Dakar, the governance framework and the statutes
for the DP3 and the proposed work program for the DP3 in 2015.

3.1.       DP2 Progress

The GA endorsed the progress report of the DP2 with the following comments:

          The progress should be presented in comparison to the results framework of
           the program. This has been done in the 6-months progress reports and will
           be added in the annual reporting.
          SSATP should consider disseminating among its members products in the
           focus areas of the SSATP but originating outside the program. This would be
           indeed the objective of the SSATP Community of Practice launched prior to
           the October annual meeting.
          The islands members of the Indian Ocean Commission requested a better
           integration with the SSATP. SSATP will explore with the members of the
           commission how to respond to this request.




                                                                                    17
          SSATP should provide support to SSATP representatives in the General As-
           sembly and the working groups to carry out country/regional activities
           which result from being members of the SSATP.SSATP should consider
           playing a role in the monitoring and evaluation of results of policies pro-
           moted by the SSATP. Results are indeed the measure of the relevance of the
           SSATP and the policies it promotes. Implementation of the recommenda-
           tion will be discussed within the working groups.

3.2.       DP3 Governance

The GA endorsed the proposed governance framework for the DP3 and the SSATP
statutes with the following comments:

          Ownership of the SSATP is critical for the success of the program. SSATP
           should work with the countries to increase the institutional anchorage of the
           program in the countries. Linking this recommendation to the sustainability
           guiding principle of the SSATP, this institutional anchorage should use as
           much as possible coordination mechanisms which may exist already in the
           focus areas of the SSATP. This is the case in many countries with trade facili-
           tation committees which could become the coordination committee for the
           integration, connectivity and cohesion pillar of the DP3. In the road safety
           area, many countries have also such coordination mechanisms. In the urban
           mobility area, an objective of the DP3 is to strengthen coordination which if
           often weak. This recommendation will be included in the agenda of the
           SSATP working groups.
          Answering to a question from one country, the SSATP team clarified that
           each member of the General Assembly designates her or his representatives
           in the working groups.

3.3.       DP3 and 2015 Work Program

The GA endorsed the preliminary work program for the DP3 during 2015. Some
additional work is required and the SSATP team will consult with the working groups
in the coming months to finalize the list of activities. One participant commented on
the importance of Monitoring and Evaluation, in particular the progress in the policy
areas of the DP3 beyond the countries or regions where SSATP is directly involved,
and recommended to replicate the M&E activities of the road safety pillar in the two
other pillars of the DP3. In response to other comments, the SSATP management
team confirmed that the integration, connectivity and cohesion pillar includes




18
   activities to promote efficient logistics in addition to the work on the management
   and institutional aspects of corridors. One participant commented that the countries
   are experiencing capacity constraints at policy level following road sector reforms in
   the past and that SSATP could advise countries on how to rebuild this capacity. The
   team also confirmed that the geographic scope of the pillar will be established based
   on the demands received from the countries and regional institutions.

   The relationship between the Africa Sustainable Transport Forum (ASTF) and the
   SSATP should be clarified as both cover similar areas. The institutional framework for
   the ASTF is being finalized and this should help clarify the role that SSATP can play
   in support of the forum.

   Participants requested to receive the final version of the results framework of the DP3
   as elements were still discussed during the working groups at the beginning of the
   week. The framework is provided in Annex D to the proceedings.

                            Box 1: Road management and rural transport


The question was asked about the absence of road management and rural transport in the DP3, two areas where
SSATP has been heavily involved in the past. The SSATP Program Manager explained that the decision had been
taken during the DP2 to give the leadership to the African organizations in these sectors. As the policy principles in
both areas are well defined, the added value for continuing SSATP involvement in policy development in road
management and rural transport is relatively low compared to the focus areas of the DP3 where SSATP can have a
greater transformational impact.

However, the SSATP Program Manager recognized that the institutional memory of the road management reforms
is starting to disappear, that some countries are questioning the rationale for the institutional framework that
resulted from the reforms and that a new advocacy effort should take place to avoid a reversal of the reforms. This
should be accompanied by efforts to build capacity in the Ministries in charge of roads in the area of policy
development as this has often been ignored at the time reforms were implemented. Similarly, the road
management institutions should start a new round of reforms to improve their performance as some may be
gradually operating in a routine mode closer to the bureaucracies that they were supposed to replace. The time has
come to modernize these institutions with a greater emphasis on good governance, transparency and
accountability, and more modern management methods.

The SSATP Program Manager expressed the concern that the rural transport policy principles developed by the
SSATP have been adopted in a few countries only in Africa. As a result, most countries don’t have appropriate rural
transport policies and poor rural accessibility remains a critical obstacle to economic development, touching the
poorest populations in the countries and in particular women. There is a need to understand why these policy
principles are not adopted and what actions need to be taken to make actual progress in the rural transport policy
area. SSATP would be interested to contribute to the reflection if countries are willing to launch an initiative in this
area. The Second Africa Access Program being launched by DFID may be the opportunity for such initiative.




                                                                                                           19
In terms of timetable, the DP3 is expected to be launched during the second quarter
of 2015 after the closing of the DP2 and implementation to start mid-2015.

Several participants confirmed their support to the SSATP and expressed their
intention to capitalize on the SSATP work at country or regional level. As a
demonstration of this commitment, five countries volunteered to become champions
in the following two areas of the DP3:

       •   Urban mobility: Senegal, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire;
       •   Road safety: Lesotho and Cameroon.
The SSATP management team will contact the champions and coordinate with them
the launching of the DP3. Further contacts will be taken with the members of the
integration, connectivity, cohesion working group as part of the process to finalize the
work program of this pillar.

3.4.       Miscellaneous

The General Assembly welcomed Tunisia as the 40th member of the SSATP.
The SSATP Program Manager explained that the decision to hold the General
Assembly in Kenya was taken to have a synergy with the ASTF in addition to reducing
costs. This gave the opportunity to members of the SSATP working groups to attend
the ASTF and at the same time to the ASTF to reach a larger community of transport
practitioners. This is the reason why the General Assembly did not take place in
Nigeria who, in 2013 in Dakar, volunteered to host the GA in 2014 and confirmed
their expression of interest later. For 2015, no decision on the location of the General
Assembly has been taken. This will be coordinated with the ASTF, potential other
events with the option also of being organized separately.

      Pillar B – Urban Transport and Mobility
      Pillar B is based on the urban mobility and accessibility policy developed during
      the SSATP Second Development Plan. The goal of the policy is the transport
      target to support Sustainable Development Goal 11 - Make cities and human
      settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. While the policy has four
      objectives (Enable/Avoid/Shift/Improve), countries and municipalities are
      expected to adopt a holistic approach and implement all aspects of the policy. As
      a result, indicators were not identified for each objective of the policy but will
      measure how the policy as a whole is adopted and implemented.

                                                Objective/Outcome
Secure universal access by sustainable transport for urban populations by 2030
