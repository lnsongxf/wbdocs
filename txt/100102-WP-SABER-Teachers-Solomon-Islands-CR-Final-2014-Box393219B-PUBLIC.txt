    1. Setting Clear Expectations for Teachers
        Clear expectations have been established for what students should learn and
        what teachers should do in Solomon Islands.

    2. Attracting the Best into Teaching
       Existing policies on salary and career structure may appeal to talented
       candidates, but school conditions may serve as a deterrent. Creating a
       permanent alternative pathway to attract mid-career professionals could help
       increase the number of qualified teachers.

    3. Preparing Teachers with Useful Training and Experience
       The minimum education qualification required to become a teacher is lower
       than that required by most effective education systems. However, pre-service
       training does offer some practical professional experience to teacher
       candidates.

    4. Matching Teachers’ Skills with Students’ Needs
       While incentives for working in remote areas may equalize teacher availability
       between schools, no incentives exist to redress teacher shortages by subject.

    5. Leading Teachers with Strong Principals
       Principals are required to monitor teacher performance and support teachers
       in improving instructional practice, but these school leaders lack the skills
       necessary to do so. Moreover, no policy mandates training for school
       principals.

    6. Monitoring Teaching and Learning
        While multiple mechanisms exist for monitoring teachers, and student
        assessments track student achievement at the national level, current
        assessments provide limited feedback to help teachers customize their
        instruction.

    7. Supporting Teachers to Improve Instruction
        Teachers are not required to complete a minimum amount of professional
        development. There is no evidence that professional development in Solomon
        Islands is collaborative or that it focuses on instructional improvement.

    8. Motivating Teachers to Perform
        Promotion decisions are informed by teacher performance and teachers must
        meet minimum accountability requirements. Recent graduates (though not all
        recent hires) who become teachers also undergo a probation period.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative produces comparative data and knowledge on education
       policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries
       systematically strengthen their education systems.          SABER
       evaluates the quality of education policies against evidence-based
       global standards, using new diagnostic tools and detailed policy
       data. The SABER country reports give all parties with a stake in
       educational results—from administrators, teachers, and parents to
       policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth
       learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of teacher
       policies.
