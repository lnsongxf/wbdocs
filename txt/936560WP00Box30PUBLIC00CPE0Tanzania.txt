1 Main Conclusions and Recommendations


1.1 Background
1. Country Portfolio Evaluations (CPEs) are one of the main evaluation streams of work
   of the GEF Evaluation Office1. By capturing aggregate portfolio results and
   performance of the GEF at the country level they provide useful information for both
   the GEF Council and the countries. CPEs’ relevance and utility will increase in GEF-5
   with the increased emphasis on country ownership and country driven portfolio
   development.
2. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council has requested that the Evaluation
   Office conduct Country Portfolio Evaluations (CPEs) every year. The overall purpose
   of CPEs is to provide the GEF Council and the concerned national governments with
   an assessment of the results and performance of GEF-supported activities at the
   country level, and of how these activities fit into national strategies and priorities as
   well as within the global environmental mandate of the GEF. In fiscal year 2013, the
   United Republic of Tanzania2 was selected for evaluation.
3. As detailed in the Terms of Reference (Annex F), Tanzania was selected based on its
   diverse portfolio in almost all GEF focal areas (biodiversity, climate change,
   persistent organic pollutants, land degradation and multi focal area). There are also
   a number of completed/closed projects with significant emphasis on biodiversity
   and climate change, giving broader scope for reviewing sustainability and progress
   towards impact. Finally, Tanzania includes several projects that are under
   implementation or are on the verge of implementation.
4. Tanzania is a country with good potential for delivery of global environment
   benefits. In view of the combination of national and global environmental challenges
   facing the country, national and international stakeholders have committed efforts
   and invested resources to promote sustainable patterns of development, aimed at
   protecting and managing the natural resource base and at improving and
   augmenting Tanzania’s contribution to the global environment. In view of the
   importance of the environment and the Government’s commitment to conserving it,
   the country is signatory to many international Conventions and Agreements.
1.2 Objectives, Scope and Methodology
5. The Tanzania CPE was conducted between December 2012 and September 2013 by
     an evaluation team comprised of staff from the GEF Evaluation Office and a team of
     consultants. A quality assurance panel provided feedback to the team on quality
     aspects related to evaluation products.
6. The overall objective of the Tanzania Country Portfolio Evaluation (Tanzania CPE)
     was to assess the performance of GEF portfolio in Tanzania in terms of relevance,
     efficiency, effectiveness, and results of the GEF activities and processes in Tanzania;
     and the factors contributing to its performance. The evaluation of GEF support to

1Acomplete list of countries having undergone CPEs can be found on the IEO website (www.gefieo.org).
2TheRepublic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the merger of Tanganyika and the archipelago of Zanzibar,
made up of two main islands and several smaller ones Hereafter, the Republic will be referred simply as Tanzania.


                                                                                                               5
      Tanzania had the following specific objectives:

      (i)     Evaluate the effectiveness and results of GEF support in the country, with
              attention to the sustainability of achievements at the project level and progress
              toward impact on global environmental benefits.
      (ii)    Evaluate the relevance and efficiency of GEF support in Tanzania from
              several points of view: national environmental frameworks and decision-
              making processes, the GEF mandate of achieving global environmental
              benefits, and GEF policies and procedures.
      (iii)   Provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its
              decision making process, (2) Tanzania on its collaboration/participation in the
              GEF, and (3) the different agencies and organizations involved in the
              preparation and implementation of GEF support.
7. The focus of the CPE is the 28 national projects implemented within the Republic of
      Tanzania (including Zanzibar). One regional project was also reviewed due to its
      major geographical and project management presence within Tanzania.
8. The methodology used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection
      methods and standardized CPE evaluation tools and review protocols, with adaptation
      to the Tanzanian context.
9. Results reported come from triangulation of various sources including: Literature
      review; Country Environmental Legal Framework analysis (CELF)3; Global
      Environmental Benefits Assessment (GEBA)4; Project Review Protocols (PRP);
      Tanzania GEF Portfolio Analysis; original evaluative research conducted through
      interviews and stakeholder consultation, Reviews of Outcomes to Impact studies
      (ROtIs); and Small Grants Programme (SGP) portfolio analysis. SGP projects were
      visited on an opportunistic basis with site visits made to 3 projects.
National Projects supported by the GEF in the period 1992-2012
10. Since 1992, 28 national projects have been supported through the GEF national
      portfolio. Information about global and regional portfolios is also presented in Table
      1.1 below. A full list of national projects reviewed is presented in Annex B.

11. The GEF grants indicated in Figure 1.1 the overall GEF contribution has been
   $78.9m, which constitutes 17.7 % of the intended overall funding, including
   committed co-financing. The various Focal Areas are summarized as follows:

      Biodiversity (12 projects totalling $36.3m, or 46% of total GEF funding)
      Climate Change (10 projects, totalling $26.3m or 33% of the GEF funding)
      Multi-Focal area (3 projects totalling $12.9m or 16.4% of GEF funding)
      POPs (2 projects at $0.7m, 1% of GEF funding)
      Land degradation (1 project at $2.6m or 3% of GEF funding).

12. In terms of the overall financial investment for national projects (GEF + committed
   Co-financing), climate change has received the highest funding ($209.6 m), followed
   by biodiversity ($130.8 m), multi focal area ($ 79.5 m), land degradation ($ 24.3 m),
   and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) ($ 0.9 m). Although biodiversity has had
   more projects than Climate Change, the overall expenditure on the latter has been
   far higher.
13. Several Agencies have implemented GEF funded projects in Tanzania. The United
   Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has implemented the most projects (13),
   UNEP implemented five projects, while UNIDO and the World Bank each
   implemented four projects; the World Bank additionally has two projects, with one
   jointly implemented by UNDP/WB and one by WB/IFC. Most of the reported co-
   financing allocations are from the GEF’s implementing agencies; with $159.1m from
   the World Bank (43%), $102.1m from UNDP, (28%), $68.5m from UNEP (19%),
   and $36.4m from UNIDO, (10%).

    * The GEF funds and co-financing amount given for the Global and Regional projects corresponds to the overall figures
    for all the participating countries together. As Tanzania is a participant in these projects in varying amounts the % or a
    dollar allocation for activities executed in Tanzania is not directly attributable


    1.3 Small Grants Programme

    15. Since 2006 the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) in Tanzania has received
        financial support totaling US$ 7.727 Million, covering the four focal areas of
        biodiversity, climate change, land degradation and multifocal areas. It leveraged an
        intended US$ 2.253 Million in cash co-financing and US$1.944 Million in in-kind
        resources for 279 projects executed by civil society and community-based
        organizations.
    16. The largest focal area supported under SGP has been biodiversity, which accounts
        for 38.6 percent of the GEF funds for 109 activities supported. The next highest focal
        area is climate change mitigation, which accounts for about 26.2 percent of GEF
        funding on 74 projects. Land degradation accounts for about 24.4 percent of funds
        for 66 projects. International Waters projects have received 9.93 percent of GEF SGP
        funds for 28 projects and 1.8 percent of funds have been used to support chemicals
        and adaptation projects.
    1.4 Limitations
    17. The evaluation experienced a number of limitations, some of which are generic to
        CPEs, while others were country-specific. Evaluation of overall GEF results has been
        primarily undertaken on the basis of project-specific evidence, triangulated with an
        assessment of aggregate achievements based on stakeholder inputs and the
        evaluation team’s judgement.
    18. There are many national and international stakeholders active in environmental
        management in Tanzania. Caution must therefore be exercised in attributing any


                                                                                                                            9
   changes to the interventions of the GEF, while assessments of contribution need to
   take realistic account of the number and scale of other inputs. This is particularly the
   case for macro-level changes in the field of environmental policies, strategies and
   national plans.
19. GEF projects in Tanzania have been implemented over a twenty-year period. The
   evaluation team experienced difficulty in obtaining readily available and accurate
   data on some of GEF’s earlier activities. Furthermore, the quality of evaluative
   evidence, particularly quantitative trends data, relevant to completed projects is
   variable, posing significant challenges to building a comprehensive overview of
   results and contribution.
20. Several of the specific GEF CPE methods and approaches, such as the Review of
   Outcomes to Impacts (ROtI) were new and introduced to the national evaluation
   team. The exercise proved to be a significant learning opportunity for local partners
   and the GEF Evaluation office but with associated implementation delays and the
   need to strengthen some products through supporting inputs.
1.5 Conclusions
EFFECTIVENESS, RESULTS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF GEF SUPPORT

Conclusion 1: Overall, GEF-supported projects and Enabling Activities have delivered
results in a satisfactory manner.

21. GEF support has played an important role in creating the enabling framework
    necessary to underpin the creation of environmental policy and legislative
    development in Tanzania. As outlined in Section 3.4 Environmental Legal Framework
    in Tanzania, and illustrated in Figure 3.1 which overlays the key environmental
    policies and regulations with timing of GEF projects, key guidelines and even
    institutions, such as the Biosafety Guidelines and the Deep Sea Fishing Authority
    (DSFA) are borne directly from GEF intervention. GEF has also supported the
    development of numerous communications, national plans and strategies, such as
    National Reports to the Conventions, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
    Plan, the National Adaptation Plan of Action, National Action Plan (NAP) t combat
    desertification, etc, which were necessary precursors for implementation of
    Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs).
22. At the project level, among the 14 completed activities for which a final evaluation is
    available, two (15%) were rated highly satisfactory, ten (71%) were rated
    satisfactory, one (8%) was rated moderately satisfactory and one was rated
    unsatisfactory.

Conclusion 2: GEF Projects in Tanzania have delivered results in several Focal
Areas, both at field level and in the “enabling environment;” including through
enhanced institutional capacity at national and local levels. In several instances,
projects have made progress to long term impacts.

Results have been delivered in all supported Focal Areas:
Biodiversity
23. In terms of the enabling environment for biodiversity protection, the GEF is widely


                                                                                        10
   recognized as having made a vital and effective contribution. A detailed discussion of
   GEF’s contribution can be found in the Country Environmental Legal Framework
   (CELF) (Volume 2: Technical Document). GEF’s support has enabled the country to
   deliver four National Reports to the CBD, with explicit GEF support to the second
   report. These reports have provided the basis for the preparation of national
   strategies, plans and programmes in the area. Results reported at field level have
   included the protection of habitats of ecological importance, of globally significant
   biodiversity and of rare and endangered species.For example, in the last five years,
   conservation efforts in Jozani Park, Zanzibar, (Project ID 803) have led to a significant
   increase in the population of Red Colobus monkeys; at the Eastern Arc Nature
   Reserve, the conservation efforts have led to the return in increasing numbers of bird
   species endemic to that region. A similar trend was observed in the number of
   monkey species endemic to the Kilombero reserve.
Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation
24. GEF has supported 10 projects in Climate Change mitigation and adaptation, 7 EA, 6
   MSPs and 15 FSPs. As expected the early portfolio supported the preparation of
   National Communications to the UNFCCC and preparation of an Adaptation Plan as
   well as capacity building. Subsequent projects began to lay the foundations for
   transforming markets for renewable energy and improved electricity distribution.
25. An early example of Climate Change mitigation by the GEF was a project aimed at
   transforming the market for rural photovoltaic systems (GEF ID 1196), for which
   substantial potential demand was anticipated in view of the extremely low
   electricity coverage of rural areas of Tanzania.
26. At the time of its commencement, the project was a pioneer for this technology but
   unfortunately had low recognition nationally, in terms of immediate scale-up. The
   project catalysed the sale of an additional 7,500 solar PV units in the Mwanza region,
   which was its main focus. These provided power for such institutions as schools,
   clinics, small businesses such as battery charging for mobile phones and a limited
   number of domestic users. The project also established national solar equipment
   standards.
27. This contribution of the project to the “enabling environment” for solar PV in
   particular was visible only upon evaluation and deemed to be substantial. Over time
   project stakeholders, in particular the Tanzanian Renewable Energy Association
   (formerly the Tanzania Solar Power Association), lobbied the Government to
   provide fiscal incentives for solar PV, which eventually led to the decision to waive
   VAT and custom duties on solar and wind technology, a decision credited with
   removing a substantial barrier to wider adoption of renewable energy. Furthermore,
   because the project helped promote national quality standards for solar technology,
   it also contributed to the development of a vocational and technical training
   curriculum and trained a substantial number of technicians in installation and
   maintenance of such systems.

International Waters
28. Tanzania has participated in a number of international waters projects, with varying
   degrees of engagement. The Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (GEF
   ID 88) has been included in this CPE, in view of the major activities supported in the
   country during and after its implementation. The main recorded field level result of

                                                                                         11
      the project is the reduction of the lake area affected by water hyacinth infestation by
      some 1,500 sq. km., out of the baseline area of 15,670 sq. km. Further, in Tanzania
      55 community groups planted some 2.5 million trees, which are intended to help
      reduce clearing of existing forests, while an additional 100 village communities have
      been trained in soil and water conservation.
29. In terms of the enabling environment for managing Lake Victoria and other water
      bodies, the project also made a substantial contribution. It catalyzed the creation of
      the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, which is housed in Kisumu, Kenya, and remains
      the specialized body of the East African Community charged with coordinating the
      sustainable development of the basin. The project also established two specialized
      laboratories. The Fisheries Laboratory has since been approved and certified by the
      Government of Tanzania and the EU to ensure that fish exported from the country
      meet export quality standards imposed by the EU.
Land Degradation
30. There is currently only one land degradation project in the Tanzania national
      portfolio, ‘SIP-Reducing Land Degradation on the Highlands of Kilimanjaro’(GEF ID
      3391), which is supported by $2.6m of GEF support and $21.6m of cofinancing, and
      is still under implementation. This Project is collaborating with the Small Grants
      Kilimanjaro COMPACT Project within the region to deliver the community based
      components of the project. For instance, the COMPACT project has supported
      community-based organizations for tree-planting, shade-grown coffee and bee-
      keeping, which are in keeping with both the SGP and the FSPs objectives. At last
      supervision, the project reported progress in a number of areas including farmer
      training and amount of land under sustainable management. While there is only 1
      labelled project, Land Degradation was also addressed in the BD Eastern Arc Forests
      project (GEF ID 1176) and the MFA Sustainable Management of the Miombo
      Woodland Resources of Western Tanzania (GEF ID 3000). Tanzania is also involved
      with three regional LD projects with elements in the country, with total GEF funding
      of around $130.3m and cofinancing of around $1,134.5m.
Persistent Organic Pollutants
31. The GEF supported “Enabling Activities to Facilitate Early Action on the
      Implementation on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.” The
      results in terms of the enabling environment are discussed below. This activity made
      a significant contribution to laying the foundation for the Africa Stockpile Program
      (GEF Regional Project) through which the country was enabled to dispose of 575
      tons of obsolete polluting pesticides and 392 tons of heavily contaminated soils.
      Other results that built on the work of the Enabling Activities include significant
      reductions in the release of PCBs and POPs, the phasing out of industrial use of PCBs
      and the removal of toxic and persistent pesticides from the list of those approved for
      use in the country6.

32. In terms of the enabling environment, a GEF project laid the groundwork for the
      National Implementation Plan (2005), which specified the existing situation with
      regard to POPs and outlined the country’s commitments and intended actions for

                                                                                          12
   control and management of POPs over a 15 year period. Under the project, national
   capacity was strengthened and awareness raised among decision makers, private
   sector managers, NGOs and the general public. A number of important systems were
   established, including: an Obsolete Pesticide Database and an inventory and risk
   assessment of freestanding pesticides, contaminated sites, soils, buried pesticides
   and contaminated equipment. The evaluation found that the capacity and resources
   supported by the GEF laid the foundation for the measurable reduction of POPs in
   the country.

Multi-Focal Area
33. The MFA portfolio is made of 2 Enabling Activities and 3 FSP, one of which is
   recently completed. This is the Marine and Coastal Environment Management
   Project (MACEMP – GEF ID 2101). Specific results include:

      Protection of habitats of ecological importance: About 13% of territorial seas
       area of has been brought under effective protection and management, divided
       evenly between the Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar
      127 conservation committees have been established and are involved in
       mangroves management, leading to the replanting of 3, 527 ha. of mangrove
       forests.

34. A strong legacy of this project is the policy environment which has been
   strengthened by the project in a number of ways including it facilitating a the
   common governance regime: “The Deep Sea Fishing Authority” (DFSA) through the
   2007 amendments to the Deep Sea Fishing Authority Act No 1 of 1998 (Act No.4 of
   2007) and DFSA Regulations of 2009. The DFSA is tasked to ensure sustainable
   management of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
35. The other full size MFAs are early in their implementation and yet to demonstrate
   outcomes.

Small Grants Programme
36. SGP project have been creatively used in a variety of ways. In particular, many have
   been implemented in parallel with FSPs and MSPs to provide community stimulus to
   participate in environmental management by supporting Income Generating
   Activities. The evaluation team visited 3 SGP projects:
37. The SGP Sustainable Land Management and Improvement of Livelihoods through
   Establishment of Rainwater Harvesting Dam project in Nyashimo Mwanza, improved
   communities’ livelihood through promoting sustainable agricultural practices,
   notably through the introduction of irrigation.
38. The SGP Amani Butterfly Farming Project in Amani, Tanga promoted butterfly
   farming in the Eastern Usambara Mountains. This has resulted in conservation of
   biodiversity in East Usambara Mountains, since butterfly farmers and their
   communities are now conserving natural forests to protect host plants for their
   butterfly farming. This butterfly activity has been successfully replicated near
   Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park in Zanzibar.
39. The SGP project Installation of Solar PV Systems in Schools and Dispensaries around


                                                                                     13
   Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park, Zanzibar has resulted in improved access to
   electricity and lighting through the installation of PV systems in dispensaries and
   Secondary Schools.
Conclusion 3: The GEF has been partially effective in disseminating results and
lessons learned from projects: but has over-concentrated on English language
documentation and web-based means, neither of which is widely accessible.
40. A number of GEF-supported activities, including enabling activities, have targeted
   the preparation of important documents for dissemination and use nationally and
   internationally. Lessons shared directly with communities and groups have included
   conservation and restoration know-how, organizational improvement, technology
   adoption, up scaling and marketing.
41. Stakeholders reported that almost all recent GEF project documents and reports
   (hard and soft) in Tanzania are written in English (understood by less than 20% of
   the population) and highly technical. This means many project participants and
   environmental stakeholders can neither understand nor share the content.
Conclusion 4: The GEF has supported many measures intended to facilitate
sustainability of environmental results. This has often been achieved, although
not necessarily at the same level as during project funding.
42. Specific measures taken to provide a basis for sustainability include capacity and
   institutional development and the development and implementation of
   environmental management systems. For example, institutional development of the
   Jozani-Chwaka Forest Reserve, allowed it to be upgraded to a national park, and the
   development of a management plan in consultation with local stakeholders. These
   outcomes have been maintained and in some case expanded. There are now 736
   savings and credit (S&C) groups compared with 47 at project completion, reported
   to stimulate income generating activities. Conversely, the Eastern Arc Mountain
   Project’s gains, at a period of time well after project close, were thought to be under
   threat due to its failure to implement a sustainable financing strategy to secure
   funding for its long term objectives. More recently, however, evidence suggests that
   the sustainability of the fund set-up may be better than anticipated, with the
   Government of Germany recently providing Euro 2 million for conservation efforts.
   In the Rural Photovoltaics Project, sustainability of the outcomes was at one point at
   risk due to concerns with quality assurance, affordability, complimentary financial
   mechanisms and market penetration. However, market penetration of PV in
   Tanzania is now promising.
43. Another important approach to sustainability has been through efforts to link local
   community benefits to improved environmental management. For example, in the
   Eastern Arc Mountain Conservation project, support for local livelihoods helped to
   generate support for environmental management.
44. The MACEMP Project facilitated important changes to the legal framework,
   institutions such as the DSFA, coastal management strategies and plans, sustainable
   community-level investments, and community capacity building have continued to
   develop.
45. Of note, is the sustained progress made with regard to POPs. These are no longer
   produced or imported in Tanzania and further regulations are being prepared, along
   with significant awareness raising on health issues conducted. Unfortunately, DDT is


                                                                                       14
   being reconsidered for use in tackling malaria due to its efficacy and cost-
   effectiveness. Sustainability of outcomes from the Lake Victoria Environmental
   Management Project is mixed. Whilst some institutions established under the
   project continue to operate, others have since become less well-used, affecting the
   environmental status.
Conclusion 5: Several GEF-supported activities have contributed towards Global
Environment Benefits by fostering sustainable livelihood and development
approaches.
46. Livelihoods options have been factored into GEF projects in different ways and at
   different levels. They have included: the creation of new jobs (e.g. the tourism
   industry in Jozani-Chwaka); promotion of income generating activities through skills
   development (e.g., technical and marketing skills in Solar PV equipment in the
   Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaic Market); improving livelihoods through
   promoting sustainable consumption of resources, including by reduction on the
   stress on forests and protected areas species conservation, reduction of destructive
   livelihoods such illegal hunting, fishing and tree felling, and improving existing
   livelihoods, through such practices as improved terraced agriculture to reduce land
   degradation (e.g., Mnazi Bay, Jozani-Chwaka, Eastern Arc Mountain Forests Project).
47. In Shigala Village, a CBO under the LVEMP has helped to control soil erosion and
   improve water harvesting. As a result, crop yields have increased and so the local
   community’s living standards have improved. Furthermore, the CBO has begun
   spreading the techniques used based on demand from adjacent villages. However,
   generating support for environmental management through Income Generating
   Activities is not without challenges, as illustrated from the MACEMP Project. In this
   case, insufficient funds and community competition and in-cohesion posed real
   challenges.
48. A particularly effective approach has been to link SGPs, with their emphasis on
   support to locally based activities, to MSPs and FSPs, which generate opportunities
   for such activities but may not have sufficient resources to support them. A good
   example is the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor project, which obtained support from
   the SGP to finance local initiatives to promote Income Generating Activities in a
   broad range of villages in the project area. Similarly, the Eastern Arc Mountains
   Project obtained SGP funding to promote Butterfly Farming as an IGA around Amani
   Nature Reserves, in order to reduce pressure on forest products.
Conclusion 6: GEF activities have contributed to facilitating broader adoption
through a combination of mainstreaming, replication, scaling up and market
change.
49. Major means of mainstreaming approaches have been achieved through:
      Assistance with National Communications, Reports, Plans and Programmes in
       association with Global Conventions
      Development of a cadre of trained professionals in environmental fields
      Successful lobbying for fiscal incentives for Solar PV
      Support for creation of environmental management institutions in region: e.g.
       Lake Victoria Basin Commission, Deep Sea Fishing Authority.

50. Some aspects of the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics Market Project, such


                                                                                     15
   as the Installation of Solar PV Systems in Schools and Dispensaries around Jozani-
   Chwaka Bay National Park, Zanzibar were replicated in subsequent SGPs. The
   overall project approach was also replicated in three other regions (Mara, Shinyanga
   and Kagera).
51. Scaling up has also been achieved by a number of projects. For example, the Jozani-
   Chwaka Project developed a programme to enable sustainable increases in income
   in communities around the Forest Reserve. This has been considerably expanded
   from its original scope since project completion
52. The GEF contribution to catalyzing market change has also been significant. The
   efforts of the same PV project promoted a reduction in tariffs on panels (which can
   be seen as mainstreaming), which had an effect in reducing market barriers to PV
   projects, particularly in rural areas.

RELEVANCE
Conclusion 7: GEF support has been and remains relevant to the national
Sustainable Development and Environmental Management priorities
53. Over the last twenty years, GEF support has played a significant role in helping to
   raise awareness on the environment as a vital cross cutting issue for the sustainable
   development of Tanzania. It has also laid the foundations for the mainstreaming of
   environmental issues into a range of sectoral policies and plans.
54. The CPE found that most projects in the GEF Tanzania portfolio are well-aligned to
   national priority areas as delineated by the Government. More specifically, GEF
   support is contributing to the national sustainable agenda stated in NSGRP II and
   MKUZA II by contributing to activities that have a positive impact on biodiversity
   conservation, restoration of ecosystems, demonstration of green energy sources,
   improvement of health care and primary and secondary school education (solar PV),
   irrigation to increase agricultural productivity and production levels and other
   income generation activities which are important to communities and national
   welfare.
55. The relevance of the Small Grants Programme (SGP) is demonstrated by strong
   ownership by the Government, even though its activities are executed by civil
   society organizations, NGOs and community groups with the assistance of UNDP.
   This ownership was re-confirmed under the Tanzania National Portfolio
   Formulation Exercise, during which the sum of $3.6 million was suggested as an
   appropriate amount for the SGP out of Tanzania’s allocation through STAR (System
   for Transparent Allocation of Resources) of 27.43m.
56. CPE discussions with key stakeholders found a consistent viewpoint that, under
   GEF-5, as a result of the STAR the Government’s ownership of the portfolio has
   increased and Tanzania has become more empowered in setting priorities and
   decisions on funding its environmental priorities, where these overlap with global
   environment issues.
Conclusion 8: GEF support in Tanzania has been relevant to a variety of objectives
linked to Global Environmental Benefits (GEBs) related to biodiversity, climate
change, international waters, land degradation and chemicals focal areas
57. The CPE has verified that many project outcomes are in line with Global


                                                                                     16
   Environmental Benefits across GEF focal areas. Some specific examples include:
   restoration of endangered Kihansi toads, conservation of globally significant forests
   biodiversity to increase the carbon dioxide sink potential, mitigation of GHG
   emissions in terms of reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, increased use of
   renewable energy and decreased use of fossil energy resources, sustainable use of
   the components of globally significant biodiversity, multi-state cooperation to
   reduce threats to international waters, reduced pollution load in international
   waters from nutrient enrichment and other land based stresses, and restored and
   sustained freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems goods and services.
58. Field visits confirmed specific result relevant to GEBs. Some examples include: a
   significant increase in Red Colobus monkeys in Jozanzi Park (to the extent that it
   population may be detrimental to native species), the return in increasing numbers
   of bird species to the Eastern Arc Nature Reserve, and a similar trend in the number
   of monkey species in the Kilombero Reserve.
Conclusion 9. The Government of Tanzania Mainland and the Revolutionary
Government of Zanzibar have been supportive of the GEF activities across focal
areas, as demonstrated by the use of Government’s own and donor funds to
continue environmental protection initiated with GEF support.
59. Evidence for this finding is provided by the support given by the Government for
   GEF projects (initially mainly in kind) and the measures it has taken to help ensure
   the sustainability of the results of completed projects, notably by allocating funds to
   maintain key activities. Whilst many such funds are obtained from international
   partners, it is also important to note, that there has been a substantial increase in
   the budgeted commitment of national funds dedicated to addressing environmental
   issues: from Tsh. 28.4 billion in 2006/2007 to Tsh. 151.7 billion in 2009/2010.
60. A notable example of sustainable funding commitment concerns the Eastern Arc
   Conservation and Development Project, where though risks to sustainable funding
   existed, new support was obtained from the German Government. Similarly, NORAD
   provided support for the Eastern Arc Endowment Fund to maintain operations
   during the financial crisis, and SIDA helped the Rural PV project to continue
   replication to other regions. Though the Government’s resources are strained, it
   does provide funds of its own towards various institutions which contribute to
   global environmental benefits. However, in some cases, the increased management
   requirements that often follow GEF projects and the over-reliance on external funds,
   pose real challenges.
EFFICIENCY
Conclusion 10: Projects consistently have a greater implementation over-run with
few exceptions. National stakeholders perceive the GEF project processes to be
time-consuming and complex.
51. Project document review found that EAs, MSPs and FSPs have consistently run over
    their original intended. A more detailed review of FSPs suggested over-ambitious
    objectives, leading to substantial time over-runs. In Tanzania, the project cycle
    reforms introduced through the GEF-4 cycle will take time to be realized in the
    performance of GEF projects.
52. Prevalent national views suggest that even with project formulation support,
    processes of preparation are complex and time consuming. Local institutions face


                                                                                       17
   challenges in understanding and meeting the “opaque nature” of co-financing, which
   stakeholder indicate, on occasion, threatens the “grant” nature of GEF funding.
Conclusion 11. Mechanisms for more networking among GEF Implementing
Agencies, national institutions, GEF projects and other donor-supported projects
and activities exist; however, they have not been fully effective for better
synergies in GEF project programming and implementation.
53. Networks have been developed between GEF projects, national institutions and
    other donor-supported projects, for example, GEF National Steering Committee
    members are selected from across the public sector, Civil Society Organizations, the
    private sector, Academia and other international partners. This gives the potential
    for good communication and synergy across related activities in the environmental
    sector, for example, the coordinated successful lobbying of the Government to
    provide fiscal incentives for solar PV technology. The meetings, however, of this
    National Steering Committee are not regular and opportunities for more synergy are
    lapsed.
54. The possibility of developing a fully coordinated and synergistic national portfolio is
    undermined by the “background” position of the Focal Point in the GEF system.
    Some symptoms of this problem are: the length and complexity of GEF processes
    make them less accessible to OFPs than to GEF Agencies; the more frequent
    communications between the GEF and Agencies requires less input from
    Governments; lack of GEF country offices means that the Focal Point has fewer
    resources and opportunity to oversee GEF activities and meet with GEF/EO staff
    than do the Agencies; there is little involvement of OFPs in projects after the
    implementation stage; Agency project management and M&E lacks complete
    transparency with OFPs; Regional projects lack a lead OFP to coordinate
    communications and are therefore largely communications are controlled by the
    implementing bodies.
Conclusion 12. There has been no major coordination between national budget
procedures and the preparation and funding of GEF project proposals
55. The co-financing available from the Tanzania national budget for either Medium or
    Full Size GEF Projects has so far been slight. National budgetary procedures have
    had little effect on GEF project funding which has been largely dependent on
    Agencies (rather than Government) for co-financing. However, national budget
    disbursement processes have affected completed and on-going projects in which the
    Government has committed substantial in kind contribution.
56. Government has broadly managed to keep pace with its in-kind commitments in
    terms of staff salaries and other routine requirements, but has been less effective in
    finding potential additional or future sources of Government funding to ensure
    sustainability of the many new or re-profiled institutions, which have been
    developed during project implementation.
Conclusion 13. Monitoring and Evaluation Systems of a number of GEF projects
were weak, whilst others are reported to have been satisfactory.
57. Despite such efforts in specific projects, it is clear that M&E systems are not yet
    uniformly regarded as an important asset to the design, management and adaptation
    of projects, and that more emphasis needs to be placed on M&E by national partners,
    and project managers.


                                                                                        18
58. In the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests Project, the M&E system was weak and failed to
    facilitate adaptive management of the “problem” project. The Jozani -Chwaka Bay
    Conservation Project, the interests of multiple financiers resulted in a confusing and
    “top-heavy” M&E system. Issues in the Mnazi Bay Project included, managers
    ignoring recommendations from the Midterm Review, lack of a coherent M&E
    framework, and an untouched Logframe.
59. In other projects, substantial efforts have been made to strengthen both current and
    future M&E capacity. During the Pangani Basin Water Management Project, an M&E
    study was undertaken which lead to a series of recommendations for skill building
    surrounding M&E tasks. The integration of M&E into the project’s work plan is seen
    as an important achievement.
1.6 Recommendations
Recommendations to the GEF:
Recommendation 1: The GEF should encourage efforts to engage the GEF
Operational Focal Point (OFP) into Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) related
activities.
60. In Tanzania, M&E of the GEF portfolio is largely fragmented among Agencies and
    project management offices. The disparate data and systems do not allow for a
    holistic perspective of the overall status and results of the GEF portfolio. There are
    dissenting views on the degree to which the OFP is kept informed of M&E-related
    activities by Agencies, as per the minimum requirement. Currently the GEF has
    funding available for strengthening M&E capacity in countries (if identified in the
    NCSA) but no funding for recurrent costs, which would need to be met by regular
    government budgets, in this case the United Republic of Tanzania.
61. Knowledge of M&E activities in the national portfolio would enable the OFP to more
    effectively mainstream results into national strategy and decision making with other
    Tanzanian government offices (Energy, Tourism, Finance, etc.) for planning and
    managing globally significant environmental resources, particularly at this
    important time in Tanzania’s broader economic development.
62. Future updates to the GEF Monitoring and Evaluation Policy should consider GEF-5
    experiences, as gathered in this Tanzania, and other Country Portfolio Evaluations,
    in the application of Minimum Requirement 4, concerning the engagement of the
    Operational Focal Point in M&E-related activities.


Recommendations to the Small Grants Programme (SGP) Steering Committee:
Recommendation 2: The GEF SGP Steering Committee should pursue, where
appropriate, the institutionalization of a role for national SGP programmes to
function as service provider to deliver community level support activities for FSPs
and MSPs.
63. In Tanzania, the SGP has a high profile for its successful work in linking communities
    to environmental management, particularly through Income Generating Activities.
    The program has been so effective that there have been many SGP projects, which
    have been integrated into the overall activities of MSPs and FSPs, with the SGP


                                                                                       19
      delivering the community based component of the FSP/MSP project.
      Institutionalization of this approach would enable systemic use of accumulated SGP
      expertise and experience to effectively deliver community level activities for GEF
      projects/programs while optimizing the use of GEF resources (cost saving due to
      the pre-existence of SGP structures, staffs and work procedures
64. From a global perspective, SGPs represent a highly successful stream of work, but
    are also perceived as having diverted resources away from the development of
    stand-alone projects. Integration of SGP to deliver community-level components of
    FSP and MSP projects would allow maintenance of both the standalone activities of
    the SGP as well as introduction of role as an implementer of components of larger
    GEF projects. It is therefore recommended that the SGP in Tanzania, and other
    countries, where appropriate, be structured so that it can more formally receive
    funding from the budgets of larger GEF projects to deliver the community-based
    activities, which are essential to broader success.
Recommendations to the Government of Tanzania:
Recommendation 3: The Operational Focal Point Office should pursue ways of
ensuring greater coordination and synergies among all parties engaged in the GEF
portfolio, including synergies for M&E of the portfolio.
65. As a starting point, the GEF Project Steering Committee in Tanzania should revive
    regular meetings in order to have a more active role in portfolio oversight through
    (at least) semi-annual meetings at which key M&E progress reports are presented
    by GEF Agencies and discussed by the Committee.
      Regular communications to GEF stakeholders via the OFP office should be amongst
      the items explored by the Committee to keep partners abreast of activities in the
      portfolio. Sharing of results and lessons through regular communication is also
      needed to allow participating parties to be up to date for future portfolio planning.
Recommendation 4: Lessons and knowledge from GEF projects should be enhanced
amongst GEF and other sustainable development stakeholders, and in particular
vis-à-vis translation of knowledge management (KM) materials into Kiswahili, the
local language, to ensure the broadest distribution.
66.   Effective communication and outreach facilitates broader adoption of GEF supported
      technologies and mechanisms. Key M&E progress reports, project newsletter or
      other KM documents from GEF Tanzania projects should be disseminated broadly
      through more focused communication channels and using a variety of media. In
      most cases GEF documentation is in English. Language barriers could be overcome by
      requiring that project design includes adequate budget allocations for translation of
      relevant knowledge products and other project documentation into Kiswahili for
      maximum public.

2 Evaluation Framework

68. This chapter presents the background information, objectives and methodology
    related to and used in the GEF Tanzania Country Portfolio Evaluation (CPE).
2.1 Background
69. The Tanzania CPE aims to provide the GEF Council and the United Republic of
    Tanzania (URT) with an assessment of results and performance of GEF supported
    activities in the country, and to examine how GEF supported activities fit into
    Tanzania’s national strategies and priorities as well as within the global
    environmental mandate of the GEF. The CPE assesses the performance of the overall
    GEF Tanzania portfolio; but does not evaluate the performance of individual GEF
    implementing partners, national entities (agencies/departments, national
    governments or involved civil society organizations), or individual projects.
70. From among 160 GEF-eligible countries, a country is proposed for portfolio
    evaluation based on criteria that include size, maturity, diversity and coverage
    through past work of the GEF Evaluation Office. The key factors in selecting
    Tanzania for a CPE were its relatively large, mature and diverse portfolio. Also,
    Tanzania had not been adequately covered by the Evaluation Office through its past
    work.
71. The GEF Evaluation Office proposed the Country Portfolio Evaluation for Tanzania
    (Tanzania CPE) to the Government of Tanzania. The GEF Operational Focal Point, on
    behalf of the Government of Tanzania, accepted this proposal. A team from the
    Evaluation Office visited Tanzania in September 2012 to discuss the modalities for
    the evaluation and meet with other national stakeholders. Based on these
    discussions, the Evaluation Office determined the general modalities for and
    structure of the evaluation team.
72. Thereafter, based on an open and transparent multi-stage selection process, the
    Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) was selected as the national
    institution for execution of the evaluation. Considering the suggestions received
    from the national stakeholders, the Evaluation Office appointed three experts as the
    members of a quality assurance panel: Dr. Bakari Asseid, Deputy Principal Secretary
    (Natural Resources) – Ministry of Agriculture and Natural ResourcesMr. Ekingo
    Magembe, Poverty Reduction Monitoring Office and Professor Amos Majule
    (Institute for Resource Assessment, University of Dar es Salaam).
73. In November 2012, the first consultation meeting with the stakeholders was
    organized in Dar-es-Salaam to scope the evaluation. Based on the inputs received
    during this consultation, the standard terms of reference for CPE was revised to
    make it Tanzania specific. Thereafter, the evaluative phase of the Tanzania CPE
    started in January 2013, and ended in July 2013.
74. The preliminary emerging findings of the evaluation were shared with the national
    stakeholders in a workshop held in Dar-es-Salaam in September 2013. This draft
    report incorporates the feedback received during the workshop and also inputs
    from the Quality Assurance Panel.




                                                                                     21
2.2 Objectives
75. The purpose of the GEF Tanzania CPE is to provide the GEF Council and the
    Government of Tanzania with an assessment of how the GEF-supported activities
    are implemented in-country, a report on results from projects and an assessment of
    how these activities are linked to the national sustainable development agenda, as
    well as the GEF mandate of generating Global Environmental Benefits (GEBs) within
    its focal areas. Based on the overall purpose of the GEF CPEs, the Tanzania CPE
    aimed at contributing to the following specific objectives (refer Annex F for the
    complete terms of reference):

        a. Evaluate the effectiveness and results7 of GEF support in a country, with
           attention to the sustainability of achievements at the project level and
           progress toward impact on global environmental benefits.
              b. Evaluate the relevance and efficiency8 of GEF support in Tanzania from
                 several points of view: national environmental frameworks and decision-
                 making processes, the GEF mandate of achieving global environmental
                 benefits, and GEF policies and procedures.
              c. Provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its
                 decision making process, (2) Tanzania on its collaboration/participation
                 in the GEF, and (3) the different agencies and organizations involved in
                 the preparation and implementation of GEF support.
76. The Tanzania CPE aims to bring to the attention of Council different experiences and
    lessons on how the GEF support is implemented in Tanzania. It seeks to analyse the
    performance of individual projects as part of the overall GEF portfolio. The Tanzania
    CPE is not aimed at evaluating or rating the performance of GEF Agencies, national
    entities (agencies/ departments, national governments or civil society organizations
    that are involved), or individual projects.
2.3 Scope
77. The Tanzania CPE is aimed at covering all types of GEF-supported activities in the
    country at different stages of the project cycle (completed, under implementation
    and pre-implementation) and implemented by all the GEF Agencies in all the focal
    areas. The GEF portfolio assessed in this evaluation is focused on national projects
    and the SGP and also considers the global and regional projects. Project proposals
    under consideration were not explicitly part of the evaluation, although those that
    have gained the GEF Council approval are listed and discussed, as appropriate. The
    cut-off date for analysis was June 30, 2012.


7The  following definitions are applied in the GEF Monitoring and Evaluation Policy, 2010: Effectiveness: the extent to
which the GEF activity’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative
importance; Results: in GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short- to medium-term outcomes, and
progress toward longer term impact including global environmental benefits, replication effects, and other local
effects; Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended period of
time after completion; projects need to be environmentally as well as financially and socially sustainable.
8Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national environmental priorities and policies and

to global environmental benefits to which the GEF is dedicated; Efficiency: the extent to which results have been
delivered with the least costly resources possible.


                                                                                                                    22
2.4 Methodological Approach

78. The Tanzania CPE was conducted between December 2012 and September 2013 by
    an evaluation team comprised of staff from the GEF Evaluation Office and the national
    consultants, the Economic and Social Research Foundation. The key evaluation
    questions are contained in the terms of reference (Annex F) and the associated
    evaluation matrix (Annex G).
79. In the evaluation matrix, each of these key questions is complemented with a list of
    relevant indicators, potential sources of data and the methodology – tools and
    methods –used to answer the key questions. The key questions of the evaluation were
    to be answered based on the analysis of the data collected during the evaluative phase
    of evaluation.
80. The Tanzania CPE has been able to answer the key questions, with some reservations
    concerning information available on the impact of GEF support. This is because such
    information is not routinely collected as part of the M&E systems of Implementing
    Agencies and requires the use of specific impact evaluation methods. Although limited
    work in this area was conducted by the CPE team through the conduct of three
    Reviews of Outcomes to Impact (ROtIs), the results of this were not sufficient to give a
    broad understanding of GEF impacts, because (a)the ROtIs proved difficult for the
    consultancy team to implement effectively and (b) they covered only 3 projects.
81. The methodology used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection
    methods and standardized analytical tools. Several sources of information from
    different levels both in Tanzania were used. Stakeholders that were consulted
    included national, regional, and district authorities, sectoral ministries and agencies,
    academia, GEF Agencies (WB, UNDP, UNIDO), the GEF Focal Point (Division of
    Environment, Vice President Office, DoE-VPO), Civil Society Organizations, Business
    Community, along with GEF beneficiaries and supported institutions, associations,
    local communities and authorities.
82. The primary focus of the CPE is the 28 national projects implemented exclusively
    within the boundaries of Tanzania.9 An additional one regional project, in which
    Tanzania participated, was reviewed. A full assessment of the regional projects’
    aggregate results, relevance, and efficiency was beyond the scope of this CPE national
    and regional project proposals under preparation were also not part of the evaluation.
83. Projects for field visits were selected based on several criteria, including: i) whether
    they had been completed and had a technical evaluation or were nearing completion;
    ii) representation within the portfolio by focal area, agency, modality and status; iii)
    accessibility to project activities and sites; and iv) resources and time to conduct the
    evaluation. Six representative completed national projects were visited during the
    evaluation (five national and one regional)10: two in the biodiversity focal area, two in
    climate change and one project in a multifocal area. The regional project visited was
    for the international waters focal area. In addition, three GEF Small Grants Projects
    (SGPs) were visited.
84. Two Reviews of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI)11 field studies were completed. This

                                                                                                         23
       method uses a Theory of Change (TOC) approach to identify the project’s progress
       towards its intended impact and to evaluate the overall performance of GEF projects
       through an in-depth analysis of project documentation coupled with field verification.
       Data were collected at the project site to verify and then assess the project’s progress
       along the component results chain that is intended to guide project performance and
       thereby contribute to the achievement of the project’s eventual impacts. The two
       projects had been completed for at least two years prior to the time the CPE were
       undertaken and are: i) Conservation and Management of the Eastern Arc Mountain
       Forest in Iringa, Morogoro and Tanga (Amani) regions (GEF ID: 1170); and ii) Jozani
       Chwaka Bay National Park Development project in Zanzibar (ID: 803). In each case,
       interviews with the project’s stakeholders were held and relevant information and
       data collected. A third ROtI was attempted for the Removing Barriers to the
       Transformation of the Rural PV Market in Tanzania; however insufficient data
       gathering in the terminal evaluation prevented the appropriate analysis from taking
       place.
85. Triangulation of the results was conducted12. Triangulation refers to the review, in
    parallel, of the combination of several research methodologies and/or data sources
    in the study of the same phenomenon. The purpose of triangulation in this
    evaluation was to increase the credibility and validity of the results. Results reported
    below come from triangulation of various sources drawn from: Literature review;
    Country Environmental Legal Framework (CELF) analysis; Global Environmental
    Benefits Assessment (GEBA); Project review protocols; Tanzania GEF portfolio
    analysis; original evaluative research conducted through interviews (stakeholder
    consultation - individual interviews, focus groups); project field visits; Reviews of
    Outcomes to Impact studies; and SGP portfolio analysis.
86. This report presents the findings of the GEF Country Portfolio Evaluation (CPE) for
    Tanzania over the period 1992–2012. A preliminary set of these findings was
    presented in the form of an Aide Memoire, which was discussed with national
    stakeholders at a workshop held in Dar es Salaam on September 5th, 2013. Feedback
    from the workshop and from the CPE’s Quality Assurance Panel has been
    incorporated into this document.
2.5 Limitations of the Evaluation
87. The evaluation faced a number of limitations, some of which are generic to CPEs,
    while others were country-specific. Evaluation of overall GEF results has been
    primarily undertaken on the basis of project-specific evidence, triangulated with an
    assessment of aggregate achievements based on stakeholder inputs and the
    evaluation team’s judgement.
71. There are many national and international stakeholders active in environmental
    management in Tanzania. Caution must therefore be exercised in attributing any
    changes to the interventions of the GEF, while assessments of contribution need to
    take realistic account of the number and scale of other inputs. This is particularly the
    case for macro-level changes in the field of environmental policies, strategies and
    national plans.



12   Triangulation workshop held on May 7-8 , 2013


                                                                                            24
88. GEF projects in Tanzania have been implemented over a twenty-year period. The
    evaluation team experienced difficulty in obtaining readily available and accurate
    data on some of GEF’s earlier activities. Furthermore, the quality of evaluative
    evidence, particularly quantitative trends data, on completed projects is variable,
    posing significant challenges to building a comprehensive overview of results and
    contribution.
89. Several of the specific GEF CPE methods and approaches, such as the Review of
    Outcomes to Impacts (ROtI) were new and introduced to the national evaluation
    team. The exercise proved to be a significant learning opportunity for local partners
    and the GEF Evaluation office but with associated implementation delays and the
    need to strengthen some products through supporting inputs.

3 Context


3.1 Tanzania: General Description

90. The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the merger of
    Tanganyika and the archipelago of Zanzibar, made up of two main islands and
    several smaller ones. Centrally placed in East Africa, Tanzania has eight
    neighbouring countries and 1400 kilometres of Indian Ocean coastline. It is a
    member of the East African Community (EAC) and Southern African Development
    Community (SADC). As a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania, Zanzibar has its own
    government, known as the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, with a President,
    First Vice President, Second Vice President and cabinet.
91. Tanzania is divided into thirty regions: five on the semi-autonomous islands of
    Zanzibar and twenty-five on the mainland, the former Tanganyika. The population of
    the country is 44.9 million (2012 national census). Out of these, approximately 43
    million reside in mainland Tanzania and 1.3 million in Zanzibar.
92. The Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.466 giving the country a rank of 152 out
    of 187 countries, which, although below the World’s average, is above the regional
    average13. Over the past two decades, economic reforms have improved the
    economic status of the country. The economic growth rate in 2012 has been
    estimated to be 6.9% in real terms, higher than the target of 6.8%, but lower than
    the 7.0% recorded in 2010. According to a World Bank study the living conditions in
    rural areas of Tanzania have not improved because many households have not been
    included in the economic growth patterns.14
93. The economy is based primarily on agriculture, which accounts for more than half of
    the GDP ($23.71 billion in 2011) provides 75% (approximately) of exports, and
    employs approximately 75% of the workforce. Tourism accounts for around 16% of
    the GDP and nearly 25% of total export earnings. Topography and climate, though,
    limit cultivated crops to only 4% of the land area. The nation has many resources
    including minerals, natural gas, forests and tourism.
94. The country's landscape spans from east coast shores to a mountainous northeast,
    which is dominated by Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro. Tanzania borders
    with Lake Victoria in the north and Lake Tanganyika to the west. The center of the
    country consists of a large plateau with plains and some arable land. About a third of
    Tanzania is covered by forests and woodland, on the plains, populations of African
    wildlife thrive in well-known areas, such as the Serengeti, which remain mostly
    unspoilt. In the marine realm, the country's mangrove forests have several
    ecosystem functions including as nursery areas for fish and prawns. There are also
    extensive sea grass areas, an important food and habitat. Coral reefs are located
    along about two thirds of Tanzania's coastline15.

3.2 General Description of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
95. The GEF provides funding to achieve global environmental benefits in biodiversity,
    climate change, international waters, depletion of the ozone layer, POPs, and land
    degradation, according to their respective international agreements.

96. GEF activities are carried out through its Agencies: the World Bank, UNDP, UNEP,
    regional development banks (African Development Bank, Asian Development, Bank,
    European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Inter-American
    Development Bank), FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and
    UNIDO. GEF support modalities include the following:

             a. Full-size projects, which have funding of more than $2 million
             b. Medium-size projects, which now have funding of $2 million or less,
                which has been raised from earlier limits of $0.5 million and later $1
                million.
             c. Enabling activities, which are intended to help countries meet their
                obligations under the various conventions for which the GEF serves as a
                financial mechanism; these provide support for developing environment
                policies, strategies and action plans and the formulation of NCSAs
             d. Project Preparation Grants (PPGs), formerly known as project
                development facility (PDF) grants, which provide funding for the
                preparation and development of projects
             e. Small grants, which have funding of less than $50,000 and are directed at
                NGOs and local organizations; small GEF grants are structured into the
                SGP which is administered by UNDP
97. The GEF officially began with a two-year pilot phase from 1992 to 1994. This was
    followed by four regular four-year replenishment periods: GEF-1 (1995–98), GEF-2
    (1999–2002), and GEF-3 (2003–06). GEF-4 (2007-2010) and GEF-5 continues
    through 2014. Until and including GEF‑3, there were no country allocations and
    eligible GEF member countries submitted their requests to the various windows
    through the different GEF Agencies on a demand basis.
3.3 Environmental Resources in Key GEF Focal Areas

Environmental Threats and Challenges

98. The six major environmental threats identified by the United Republic of Tanzania
    Government are: land degradation; lack of accessible, good quality water for both
    urban and rural inhabitants; environmental pollution; loss of wildlife habitat and
    biodiversity; deterioration of aquatic systems and deforestation.16 These threats
    result in the loss of important social and economic benefits, through reduced soil
    productivity, inadequate water for washing, cooking, drinking and hygiene and
    potential damage to national heritage and tourism. The loss of these benefits has
    been associated with an increase in poverty in the country. Underlying reasons for

16http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/nationalenvironmentalpolicy.pdf,   Website access: 15th November, 2012.


                                                                                                        27
    these adverse trends include inappropriate land and water management, inadequate
    financial and human resources, inequitable terms of international trade, the
    vulnerable nature of some local environmental niches, rapid growth of both rural
    and urban population, and inadequate institutional coordination among key
    stakeholders. Other challenges include ineffective monitoring and information
    systems, weak capacity to implement programs, insufficient involvement of major
    stakeholders (local communities, non-governmental organizations and the private
    sector) and poor integration of conservation measures into planning and
    development of programs.17
99. Zanzibar and its islands are facing several environmental challenges. These include
    deforestation caused mainly by settlement expansion, agricultural activities,
    firewood collection, and uncontrolled harvesting of trees for building materials.
    Other challenges are loss of terrestrial and fresh water species, soil erosion, over-
    exploitation of marine resources, urban desertification, limestone quarries and sand
    mining18 (URT, 2012a). Zanzibar faces another serious environmental challenge of
    sea level rise. The climate models predict significant increase in temperatures for
    Zanzibar with maximum monthly temperature projected to increase from 1.5o to 2oC
    by 2050s and 2o to 4oC by 2090s (RGoZ, 201219). Rising temperatures, associated
    with ocean expansion and ice melt, is responsible for sea level rise (ibid). The IPCC
    (2007) projected global average of between 0.2 meters to 0.6 meters of sea level rise
    over the next century. There is a strong projected trend of increasing sea level which
    will have potential effects for many areas of Zanzibar (RGoZ, 2012).
100. The United Republic of Tanzania aims to promote and enable a sustainable
   development pathway through facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration
   and restoration of biodiversity, and resilience in the face of new and emerging
   challenges, such as deforestation, land degradation, desertification, and climate
   change20.
101. In the last few decades, the country has witnessed substantial increase and
   expansion in various socio-economic activities, such as agriculture, commercial
   tourism, oil and gas, mining, fishing, manufacturing, trade and other production
   activities at homestead, community, and national levels. With time, these resource-
   consuming activities, the rising population and climate related effects have put
   pressure on the environment, resulting in declining environmental health in parts of
   the country21.
102. The most recent Global Benefit Index (GBI) scores for Tanzania are relatively
   higher compared to other East African countries, particularly Kenya and Uganda
   (See Technical Document – Global Environmental Benefits Assessment). This
   indicates that Tanzania is a country with high significant global resources and with
   tremendous potential for delivery of global environment benefits. In the fifth
   replenishment cycle of the GEF, Tanzania was allocated $27.43 million ($13.95

103. In view of the combination of national and global environmental challenges
   facing the country, national and international environmental stakeholders have
   committed efforts and invested resources to promote sustainable patterns of
   consumption, aimed at protecting and managing the natural resource base and at
   improving and augmenting Tanzania’s contribution to the global environment.

Biodiversity
104. The United Republic of Tanzania is categorized as one of the 14 biodiversity hot
   spot countries in the world22. About 43% of the country’s land area is covered by
   important ecosystems, included in national parks, game and forest reserves: as well
   as a number of key wetlands that are designated as Ramsar sites (URT, 2012b).
105. Out of 34 globally known biodiversity hotspots, six are found in Tanzania (URT,
   2013b). They include the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests (Usambara west and east,
   Pare north and south, Nguru, Uluguru, Ukaguru Rubeho and Udzungwa Mountains);
   the Coastal forests; the Great Lakes for Cichlid fishes (Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika
   and Nyasa); the marine coral reef ecosystems; the ecosystems of the alkaline Rift-
   Valley Lakes (e.g. Natron and Eyasi); and the grassland savannas for large mammals,
   including the Serengeti National Park. Tanzania’s exceptional biodiversity provide
   multiple benefits to society with economic benefits that are rarely captured by
   market analysis (URT, 2012b).
106. The ecosystem services include provision of food, supporting services such as
   nutrient recycling, regulatory services, flood protection, recreational and cultural
   services, as well as tourism (Devisscher, 2010). They are integral to the national
   economy and underpin large parts of GDP, foreign revenue (including through
   tourism revenue) and export earnings, and sustain a very large proportion of the
   population (URT, 2012b). This implies that sustainable development in the United
   Republic of Tanzania is highly dependent on conservation and on appropriately-
   controlled utilization of biodiversity to ensure its continuing contribution to socio-
   economic development, as well as towards attaining the Tanzania Development
   Vision 2025 and Zanzibar Development Vision 2020 (URT, 2013b).
107. Tanzania has seven protected areas listed as World Heritage sites. They include
   Kilimanjaro National Parks, Kilwa Kisiwani Historical Site, Kondoa Rock Art Sites,
   Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Selous Game Reserve, Serengeti National Park and
   Zanzibar Stone Town.23Tanzania’s protected areas are estimated to sequester 2,019
   million metric tons of carbon in living biomass (FAO, 201024). From a socio-
   economic perspective, the protected areas play an important role for the rural and
   urban population, where they support 87% of rural livelihoods, and provide more
   than 70% of the national energy supply and 75% of construction materials (URT,
   2012b).

108. Tanzania is home to more than 14,000 known species of plants, amphibians,
   birds, mammals, reptiles and several invertebrates, of which 20% are endemic,
   (including the African violet flowers), meaning they exist in no other country, and
   6% are threatened; while 5% of the species are protected under IUCN categories I-V
   (Gideon et al.,201225). The Eastern Arc Mountain Forests have the highest known
   number of plant and animal species of any region in Tanzania. Approximately 27
   percent of the plant species, 63 percent of the linyphiid spider species, 43 percent of
   butterfly species, 33 percent of amphibian species, 37 percent of the reptile species,
   37 percent of the bird species, and 34 percent of the mammal species found in
   Tanzania occur in the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests (World Bank, 201026).
109. Zanzibar alone is home to 4,000 plants species including the important tourist
   attracting spice plant species such as cardamom, cinnamon and cloves; 54 terrestrial
   mammals including the famous endemic red Columbus monkey; 252 bird species;
   over 400 fish species; 58 sea grass species and many invertebrates 27, (BirdLife
   International, 201328). Red Colobus monkey (Procolobus kirkii) are the common
   inhabitants of Jozani forest and occupy a remarkable array of habitats including the
   ground water forest, coral rag forest, fruit tree gardens and mangrove forest (RGoZ,
   2009). Their population numbers to about 1500 moving in groups of 10-30
   individuals.29 This species of mammal is only found in Jozani-Chwaka bay National
   Park and its surrounding (ibid). Zanzibar has a number of threatened species
   including four species of bird, Red Columbus monkey, the coconut crab, Zanzibar
   Galago (Galagoides zanzibaricus), shark fish. Zanzibar Leopard (Panthera pardus
   adersi) is believed to extinct. 30
Climate Change
110. Tanzania’s economy is very dependent on the climate, because a large
   proportion of GDP is associated with climate sensitive activities, particularly
   agriculture. Rain-fed agriculture is still the backbone of the Tanzanian economy and
   accounts for more than 25% of the GDP.
111. In 2010, a study conducted by the Heinrich Boll Foundation31 found that overall,
   Tanzania’s economy, the wellbeing of its population and its recent, positive
   economic development trajectory are particularly vulnerable to climate change as
   evidenced by the widespread damage and hardships imposed by regular drought
   and extreme rainfall events under current climate variability. The same report found
   the capability of Tanzania to adapt to climate change as severely limited.
112. Flooding and drought incidences will continue to affect natural resources and the
   Tanzanian environment due to a projected rise in the mean daily temperature by

      3ºC-5ºC (on average), throughout the country, and a rise in the mean annual
      temperature on average by 2ºC-4ºC. Rainfall is also projected to increase in some
      parts of the country, but decreases in other parts such that areas with a bimodal
      rainfall pattern are projected to have increased rainfall ranging from 5 percent to
      45%, while areas receiving uni-modal rainfall reduced rainfall ranging from 5 to
      15% by 2030.
113. There are potential threats from climate change to coastal zones (sea-level rise),
   health, energy supply and demand, infrastructure, water resources, agriculture and
   ecosystem services, with potentially high impacts and economic costs across these
   sectors. The issue of climate change has risen up the political and development
   agenda in Tanzania over the past three years reflecting heightened global attention
   on the issue.
114. As for the energy mix, currently about 90% of energy consumed in Tanzania is in
   form of biomass, 8% is in form of oil and natural gas, 1.5% is in form of electricity.
   Coal, solar and wind account for the remaining 0.5% of the energy sources (URT,
   2012b). Heavily reliance on biomass as the main energy source by more than 80% of
   Tanzanian population (URT 2012b), has had a negative impact to climate change as
   the contributor of greenhouse gasses. Recent estimate on national emissions from
   deforestation and net degradation is 126 million tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
   (Zahabu, 2008). In fact, CO2 has large share (60.7%) of all greenhouse gas emitted to
   the atmosphere followed by methane (38.1%) and nitrous oxide (1.2%) (Table 3.1).
   Agricultural activities, land-use changes and deforestation account for the majority
   of emissions (Table 3.1).

International Waters
115. Tanzania shares eleven international lakes and rivers with other nations
   including the three great lakes (Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa), two small lakes
   (Chala and Jipe) and such rivers as Kagera, Mara, Pangani, Ruvuma and Songwe
   (URT, 2012d). Each of these bodies exhibits unique characteristics and a complex
   range of water resources management as well as development issues and challenges
   (ibid). The country has 1,420 kilometers of Indian Ocean coastline with a rich
   diversity of tropical marine and coastal systems including coral reefs, sea-grass
   beds, mangrove stands and sand dunes (URT, 2012b). These marine and coastal
   resources are critical to Tanzania’s economic and social development and underpin
   the livelihoods of coastal communities who rely heavily on the sea for their food and
   income (ibid).
116. The Lakes are ecologically sensitive and important biodiversity zones providing
   habitat for hundreds of endemic species of fish (ibid). Environmental challenges
   facing the lakes and its basin are as follows (URT, 2009a, 2009c): Exploitative and
   unsustainable use of fishery resources; Wetland encroachment and degradation and
   reduction in biodiversity; Discharge of untreated industrial and urban solid and
   liquid wastes leading to deterioration of water quality; Discharge of untreated
   sewage into the lake leading to nutrient increases and resultant phytoplankton
   bloom and oxygen depletion; Infestation by weed and exotic species such as water
   hyacinth and Nile perch; Deforestation, overgrazing and increased runoff of water
   and eroded topsoil together with organic matter and nutrients contributing to algal
   growth and eutrophication of the lake; and

117. All of these international waters are used for economic activities such as
   maritime transport, fishing, mangrove forest harvesting, and tourism. These
   activities may have negative effect on freshwater and marine ecosystems and their
   biodiversity. The government of Tanzania included the sustainable water
   management as a major component of its 2004 National Environment Management
   Act (URT, 2004 ) and Water Resources Management Act of 2009 (URT, 2009b).
118. One important regional convention to which Tanzania has made commitment is
   the Convention for the protection, Management and Development of the Marine and
   Coastal Environment of the Easter African Region (the Nairobi Convention).
   Tanzania acceded the convention on 1 March 1996.

Land Degradation

119. Land degradation is a serious problem in Tanzania (Mongi, 2008). While soil
   erosion (occurring in 61% of the land area), desertification, and salinization are
   fundamental features characterizing land degradation, desertification is the most
   severe form of land degradation (URT, 2013b). According to the United Nations
   Sudano-Sahelian Office (UNSO), about 33% or 115,029 square kilometres of
   Tanzania land area is prone to desertification (Mongi, 2008). The most affected
   regions are Dodoma and Singida and parts of Mwanza, Shinyanga, Mara, Iringa and
   Arusha (URT, 2012b). Sea level rises due to climate change are projected to result in
   up to 82 square kilometres of land area loss by 2100 (Global Climate Adaptation
   Partnership and partners, 2011).
120. Its major causes include deforestation; overgrazing; wild fires; cultivation in
   marginal land inappropriate agricultural practices and poor agricultural practices
   such as shifting cultivation (URT, 2012b). Others include unsustainable mining;
   degradation of water resources; inadequate agricultural technology and land
   husbandry techniques; inadequate alternative energy sources and rapid population
   growth resulting in pressure on land resources (ibid). Included here as the causes of
   land degradation are cultivation on steep slopes and river banks and unsustainable
   irrigation that leads to water loss and soil erosion, severe beach and coastal erosion,
   and poor waste management (URT, 2012b).
121. International efforts to combat desertification and land degradation started way
   back in the seventies when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
   held an international conference on desertification (UNCOD) in Nairobi, Kenya, in
   which a action plan to combat desertification (PACD) was adopted (URT, 1999 ). In
   1992 the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)
   noted that desertification was still a major problem and supported a new integrated
   approach to the problem (URT, 2012b).
122. The National Action Plan to combat desertification (NAP) and Strategy for Urgent
   Actions on Land Degradation and Water Catchments which seeks to halt land
   degradation and conserve water catchments (URT, 2013b) are two national
   initiatives since the ratification of the UNCCD to address land degradation. The
   purpose of these action plans is to identify factors contributing to desertification and
   practical measures necessary to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of
   drought (URT, 2012b).

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)

123. POPs are one of the major problems threatening human health. Twelve specific
   POPs have been identified as being most harmful to humans and the ecosystem.
   These can be placed in three categories: pesticides, industrial chemicals, and
   industrial by-products. It has been widely accepted that their elimination should be
   a high priority for Tanzania. Tanzania ratified the Stockholm Convention on POPs in
   2002 with the objective of protecting human health and the environment, and
   focusing on eliminating or reducing the release of POPs. The National
   Implementation Plan (NIP) for POPs identified sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-
   paradioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in
   the country (URT, 2005).
124. Through the Africa Stockpiles Programme, GEF through the World Bank is
   helping Tanzania to get rid of tons of environmentally-unsafe pesticides (World
   Bank, 2012b). This programme which is undertaken in Ethiopia, Mali, Morocco,
   Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia and Tanzania aims to eliminate existing stockpiles of
   POPs and other obsolete pesticides in Africa, and put measures in place to ensure
   new stockpiles don’t take their place (ibid).
125. According to URT (2012b), currently there is no production or importation of
   POP Pesticides in the country. However, eliminating DDT is a major challenge as the
   country intends to reintroduce DDT to fight against malaria (ibid). Due to a
   resurgence of the disease in these areas the government has reintroduced DDT for
   public health purposes, against malaria vectors particularly in Zanzibar and the
   northwest part of the country (ibid). The use has been restricted for indoor
   application in accordance with WHO Guidelines (URT, 2012b). In this regard,
   training on DDT use; research on alternatives and dissemination of available
   alternatives; and strengthening of institutional capacity for monitoring DDT imports,
   use and disposal are mandatory (ibid).
126. Other additional actions being undertaken include strengthening the
   management of industrial chemicals. Accordingly, the following legislative tools with
   impact on POPs have been developed (URT, 2012b): The Chemicals Act; increasing
   the public awareness on the issues related to POPs and its health and environmental
   effects; a Review of the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute Act, 1986; research
   into the levels of these substances in water bodies and sites where they were
   used/warehoused; Mainstreaming POPs command and control instruments in
   respective industries and strengthening monitoring of production, importation and
   use of agricultural, livestock, health, and industrial chemicals; Review of the
   Agricultural and Environmental Policies; Strengthening Tanzania’s position in
   international POPs and environmental negotiations.
3.4 The Environmental Legal and Policy Framework in Tanzania
127. In mainland Tanzania, The Environmental Management Act (EMA) of 2004
   provides the legal framework for the implementation of the National Environmental
   Policy of 1997, repealing the EMA of 1983. The EMA includes provisions for
   environmental impact assessment and audits. It also provides for the prevention and
   control of pollution, waste management, environmental quality standards, public
   participation, and compliance and enforcement, along with resource management
   and biodiversity conservation.

                                                                                     34
128. More recently, the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) of 1994, and more
   recently the new NEAP of 2012, builds on the recommendations from Rio in 1992.
   The EMA provides for NEAPs with a lifespan of five years, after which period the
   NEAP is subject to review. The NEAP’s main purpose is to mainstream
   environmental concerns into development policies, plans, and strategies. In
   addition, Sector Ministries and Local Government Authorities are obliged to prepare
   EAPs, which are in conformity with the NEAP and form a basis for environmental
   mainstreaming in the respective sectors.
129. In Zanzibar, the Environmental Management for Sustainable Development Act of
   1996 was enacted to, among other things, implement the National Environmental
   Policy. It is the framework environmental law in Zanzibar and its provisions
   override those of sector laws in case there is a conflict between the two. The Act
   provides institutional arrangements for environmental conservation in Zanzibar.
   The Act is also a means of domestication of environmental international treaties. It
   contains sections that are meant to enforce its provisions and uses a combination of
   strategies to induce compliance.
130. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio
   made it urgent for Tanzania to establish an action plan at the national level because
   the Rio Declaration referred to international conventions to which Tanzania is a
   signatory party.
131. Table 3.3 lists the key international conventions and treaties to which Tanzania
   is a party. Figure 3.1 illustrates the connections between the timing of national laws
   and regulations, the ratification of international environmental treaties and
   conventions, and the implementation of GEF projects. The timeline shows the timing
   of GEF projects vis-à-vis the ratification and development of treaties, national laws,
   and policies. The timeline suggests that the GEF contribution to the development of
   legal and policy frameworks on the environment in Tanzania has been positive.
   Further substantiation of this finding, along with other results, can be found in
   Chapter 6, Relevance of GEF-Supported Activities in the Republic of Tanzania.

Biodiversity

132. Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar are rich in biodiversity and the country is
   committed to ensuring that its renewable resources are well conserved for the
   benefit of present and future generations.
133. In support of this goal, the United Republic of Tanzania, following the Rio
   Summit in 1992, signed the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which it
   later ratified in 1996. As a Contracted Party, Tanzania is required to develop
   strategies, action plans, and programs for conservation and sustainable utilization of
   biodiversity. Accordingly, with support from the GEF, the National Biodiversity
   Country Study (NBCS) was undertaken between 1995 and 1996. The study aimed at
   establishing the basis for preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and
   Action Plan (NBSAP), which was adopted in 2001.
134. Tanzania has also accepted the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety which entered
   into force in 2003. The GEF supported enabling activities that resulted in a draft of
   the National Biosafety Framework. Following adoption in 2005, the GEF also
   supported implementation of the framework, which resulted in the development


                                                                                      35
   and adoption of the Biosafety Guidelines in 2009.
135. Furthermore, Tanzania has adopted several other MEAs such as: The Convention
   on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in
   1979; the regional Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations
   directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora, in 1994; The Convention on the
   Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in 1979; The Convention
   Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural Heritage in 1987.

Climate Change

136. Tanzania became a party to the UNFCCC on June 12, 1992. It was later ratified on
   April 17, 1996 and entered into force on July 16, 1997. The country went on to ratify
   the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC on August 26, 2002, which then entered into force
   on February 16, 2005.
137. In 2007, with support from the GEF and the UNEP, Tanzania developed its
   National Adaptation Plan for Action (NAPA). The Plan identifies priority activities
   that address adaptation to adverse impacts of climate change, and was prepared in
   line with the aspirations of the National Development Vision 2025 and as an
   integrated national plan towards sustainable development.
138. In 2012, Tanzania developed its National Climate Change Strategy, which
   identifies climate risks and provides a strategic framework for mitigating those
   risks.
139. The GEF has so far provided support to Tanzania in preparing its Initial National
   Communication to the UNFCCC, its NAPA, the Country Case Study on GHGs and
   Capacity Building activities. Looking forward, the GEF is in the process of arranging
   financial and technical support for the preparation of Tanzania’s second National
   Communication to the UNFCCC, with one aim being to integrate climate change
   priorities into development strategies and relevant sector programs.

International Waters
140. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was ratified by Tanzania in
   1985. Other relevant Conventions or Treaties to oceans and coastal area
   management in Tanzania include: the Convention on the Continental Shelf, adopted
   in 1958; The Convention on the High Seas, adopted in 1958; the International
   Convention for the Protection of Pollution from Ships, adopted in 1973; and the
   International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation,
   adopted in 1990 (UN). The Convention for the Protection, Management and
   Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region
   (the Nairobi Convention), was adopted in 1985 and acceded to in 1996.

141. The laws and policies in mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar relevant to coastal and
   marine resources are relatively comprehensive. However, their implementation was
   rather uncoordinated and efforts were focused on harmonizing legal instruments.
   The Deep Sea Fishing Authority Act No. 1 of 1998 and 2007 Amendments provided
   provisions for the establishment of the Deep Sea Fishing Authority (DSFA), which
   regulates, monitors and promotes fishing in the EEZ. The authority was established
   under the GEF-funded Marine and Coastal Environment Management Project

                                                                                     36
   (MACEMP) and will contribute to the long-term sustainable use and management of
   EEZ resources. The MACEMP project has also facilitated the country to initiate the
   process of preparing Trans-frontier Marine Protected Area network.
142. The GEF also funded the Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway Development
   and Coastal and Marine Contamination Prevention Project with the goal of
   contribute to protect the region’s coastal and marine environments and rich
   biodiversity from damage due to accidental spills and illegal discharges from ships
   and from illegal exploitation of marine and coastal resources. A key objective was to
   assist countries to undertake the technical work needed to ratify conventions and to
   translate their provisions into national laws and regulations.

Land Degradation

143. Tanzania is one of 195 parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat
   Desertification (UNCCD), which it signed on June 19, 1997. The convention was
   developed in 1994, shortly after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, and provides a
   framework to combat desertification. In Tanzania, dry-lands are estimated to cover
   around two thirds of the mainland area.
144. Under the UNCCD and with support from the GEF, Tanzania developed a National
   Action Programme (NAP) to combat desertification in 1999. However, it appears
   only a few activities identified under this NAP have been supported and
   implemented. In 2006, the government developed the Strategy for Urgent Actions on
   Land Degradation and Water Catchments. The strategy identified immediate, short-
   term, medium term and long-term actions to reduce and control the adverse impacts
   of land degradation. The actions in the strategy were also included and the designed
   to be implemented in parallel with NAPA. This strategy on land degradation is
   complemented by other sector strategies such as Agricultural and livestock Policy of
   1997 and Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001, which both
   emphasize on sustainable land use practices.
145. Looking forward, the GEF is providing support to integrate Tanzania’s
   obligations under UNCCD into its national development and sectoral planning
   frameworks and align its NAP in a manner that is in line with the UNCCD 10-Year
   Strategy and UNCCD reporting and review process.

Persistent Organic Pollutants

146. Tanzania signed the Stockholm Convention on POPs in 2001 and ratified in 2004.
   In response to the requirements of the convention, Tanzania prepared its POPs
   National Implementation Plan (NIP) in 2005, which has provided the basis for
   monitoring progress in addressing the problem of POPs as well as an opportunity
   for creating awareness and participation of various stakeholders. The NIP sets out
   the country’s major commitment and actions to be undertaken for management and
   control of POPs for duration of 15 years commencing in 2006.
147. The GEF supported enabling activities for the development of the NIP between
   2002 and 2007. Further GEF-funded enabling activities have been approved in 2012
   and will support the review and update of the NIP.
148.   The country is also a signatory to the Bamako and Basel Conventions, on the


                                                                                     37
      control and management of trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes. In
      2003, Tanzania passed the Industrial and Consumer Chemicals (Management and
      Control) Act which provides for the management and control of the production,
      importation, transportation, export, storage and disposal of industrial and consumer
      chemicals. It also establishes a board which is responsible for the management and
      control of all chemicals in Tanzania and removed POPs from the register of legal
      pesticides.

4 The GEF Portfolio in Tanzania

149. This chapter presents an overview of GEF support to Tanzania in terms of
   financial resources and number of projects, by project modality, focal area, Agency
   and/or national executing agency, and phase.
4.2 Defining the GEF Portfolio
150. The evaluation estimates that, as of the end of FY2013, Tanzania had received
   about $78.8 million for 28 national projects and about $7.7 million for the national
   component of the SGP. GEF Agency fees are not included in these figures.
151. Since it commenced supporting the country in 1992, the Global Environment
   Facility has made significant investments towards the sustainability of Tanzania’s
   environmental management. In the fifth replenishment cycle of the GEF (GEF-5),
   Tanzania received a STAR allocation of $27.43 million ($13.95 million for
   biodiversity, $7.86 million for climate change, and $5.61 million for land
   degradation). This allocation is higher than that for other East Africa countries such
   as Kenya ($18.21 million) and Uganda ($10.69 million). It is also an increase on the
   GEF 4 allocation of $13,250,000 for Biodiversity and $5,350,000 for Climate Change.
4.3 Activities in the GEF Tanzania Portfolio
152. Since 1992, 28 national projects have been supported through the GEF national
   portfolio. Of these, 14 projects have been completed (3 full-size projects, 5 medium-
   size projects and 6 enabling activities); 9 projects are under implementation (8 are
   full-size projects and 1 medium size); and 5 projects have been approved by Council
   (4 full-size projects and 1 enabling activity), with one full size project pending
   approval. The breakdown of GEF support to these projects by type (modality) is
   given in Table 4.1 below. The number of regional projects supported by the GEF in
   the Tanzania portfolio is 39, whilst the number of relevant global projects is 14.

The GEF investment in different Focal Areas is summarised as follows:
          Biodiversity (12 projects totalling $36.3m, or 46% of total GEF funding)
          Climate Change (10 projects, totalling $26.3m or 33 percent of the GEF
           funding)
          Multi-Focal Area (3 projects totalling $12.9m or 16% of GEF Funding)
           POPs (2 projects at $0.7m, 1%)
          Land Degradation (1 project at $2.6m or 3%).


                                                                                      42
153. The overall GEF contribution has been $78.8m, which constitutes 17.7 % of the
   intended overall funding, including committed co-financing. In terms of the overall
   financial investment for national projects (GEF + committed Co-financing), climate
   change related projects have received the highest funding ($209.6 m), followed by
   biodiversity projects ($130.8 m), multi focal area ($ 79.5 m), land degradation ($
   24.3 m), and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)($ 0.9m). This is shown in Figures
   4.1 and 4.2. It can be seen that, although biodiversity has had more projects than
   Climate Change, the overall expenditure on the latter has been far higher. This is
   because of two major co-financing allocations: firstly, the association of the
   Tanzania Energy Development and Access Project (TEDAP) with a major World Bank
   loan35 and secondly a large allocation from the Least Developed Countries Fund
   (LDCF) to co-finance activities under the UNEP project, Developing Core Capacity to
   Address Adaptation to Climate Change in Productive Coastal Zones.

 In 2011, the World Bank approved an additional IDA credit of US$27.88 million to support the TEDAP,
35

which adds to the original WB/IDA credit of US$105 million and GEF grant of $6.5 million.


                                                                                                 43
4.4 Evolution of GEF Support by Focal Area and by GEF Agency
154. As shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4 and Table 4.2, the GEF funded projects have been
   implemented in Tanzania by several Agencies. The United Nations Development
   Programme (UNDP) has implemented the most projects (13), UNEP implemented five
   projects, while UNIDO and the World Bank each implemented four projects; the World
   Bank additionally has two projects, with one jointly implemented by UNDP/WB and
   one by WB/IFC. Most of the reported co-financing allocations are from the GEF’s
   implementing agencies; with $159.1m from the World Bank (43%), $102.1m from
   UNDP, (28%), $68.5m from UNEP (19%), and $36.4m from UNIDO, (10%).

155. Figure 4.4 summarises the financing provided by both GEF grants and co-
   financing arrangements to projects in the GEF portfolio. First, it highlights
   Biodiversity and Climate Change as the two main focal areas for funding, with USD
   130.5 million and USD 209.6 million in total financing respectively. It is worth noting
   that, whilst GEF funding for CC is 27% less than for BD, cofinancing is actually 94%
   higher, possibly indicating the differing priorities between GEF and other funders.
   Second, the graph illustrates the relatively small amount of funding that the GEF has
   provided to the areas of LD and POPs. Third, in terms of cofinancing provided by IAs,
   the UNDP and the World Bank provided the largest overall shares. However, it is the
   UNEP with the highest ratio of cofinancing at 14.6 compared with UNDP ratio of 3.5.

156. Figure 4.5 gives an overview of projects implemented by different agencies in
   each focal area. The major implementing agency under Biodiversity has been the
   UNDP. Under Climate Change the main IA, in terms of number of projects, has been
   UNEP, closely followed by UNDP and UNIDO. Figure 4.5 shows the status of projects
   by focal area.

4.5 Regional and Global Program
157. In addition to national projects, Tanzania has been a participant in part of several
   GEF regional and global projects. The distribution of the regional portfolio among
   Focal Areas has been as follows: International Waters (16 projects), Climate
   change (8), Biodiversity (6), POPs (5), Land degradation (3) and MFA (4).

Figure 4.7: Number of Regional Projects by Focal Area




158. The total reported investment including co-financing was $2,663.5m; with GEF
   funding being US$ 441.2m or 16.6 percent of the total. The overall funding
   distribution (including co-financing) of regional projects by focal area was: land
   degradation ($1,134.5m, 43%), international waters ($678.5m, 25%), climate
   change ($355.5m, 13%), POPs ($235.2m, 9%), multi focal area ($205.1m, 8%) and
   biodiversity ($54.8m, 2%). GEF projects implemented by the World Bank usually
   present a share of a World Bank loan as co-financing, so that this agency emerges
   as the dominant co-financer.
159. In terms of the allocations of only GEF resources by Focal Area for regional
   projects, the international waters focal area attracted the largest share ($152.6m,
   35% of all GEF funds), followed by Land degradation ($130.3m, 30%), Climate
   change ($41.6m, 9.4%), Biodiversity ($34.8m, 7.9%), Multi-focal area ($30.9m,
   7.0%) and POPs ($50.9m, 11.6%).
160. In the case of regional projects, it is often impossible to determine how much
   funding benefitted any individual country. Whilst a country may participate
   substantially in some of these projects (for example, where it has a pilot project or
   operational project office), in others it may be very lightly involved. The figures for
   regional projects therefore simply show that the country has had some level of
   participation in a range of more or less major international projects.
161. Tanzania has also participated in several GEF Global projects. The available
   figures for these projects are even more loosely related to actual support received
   by the country than those of the regional projects. With this caveat in mind, an

    4.6 Small Grants Programme
    162. The GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) was launched globally in 1992 to
       complement other GEF grants by providing support to non-governmental
       organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) in developing
       countries. It is executed by UNDP on behalf of the GEF. SGP in Tanzania has been
       working directly with communities, through provision of small grants of US Dollars
       (US$) 50,000 or less to NGOs and CBOs for projects they have designed and
       developed themselves.
    163. Since 2006 the GEF Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP) in Tanzania has received
       financial support totalling US$ 7.727 million, covering the four focal areas of
       biodiversity, climate change, land degradation and multi-focal areas. It leveraged an
       intended US$ 2.253 million in cash co-financing and US$ 1.944 million of in-kind
       resources for 279 projects executed by civil society and community-based
       organizations36.
    164. The largest focal area supported under SGP has been biodiversity37, which
       accounts for 38.6 percent of the GEF funds for 109 activities supported. The next
       highest focal area is climate change mitigation, which accounts for about 26.2
       percent of GEF funding on 74 projects. Land degradation accounts for about 23
       percent of funds for 66 projects. International Waters projects have received 9.93
       percent of GEF funds for 28 projects and the remaining 1.8 percent of funds has been

165. The distribution of the SGP portfolio among Focal Areas (Figure 4.8) has been
   as follows: International Waters (28 projects), Climate change mitigation (74),
   Biodiversity (109), Chemicals (2), Land degradation (66) and Community Based
   Adaptation (3).

5 Results from GEF-Supported Activities in Tanzania

166. This chapter examines key questions on the results of GEF support to Tanzania
   in terms of effectiveness, results and sustainability. Evidence on progress toward
   impact of GEF support comes from the ROtI studies conducted on three projects in
   the Tanzania portfolio. Information on results achieved on other completed
   FSP/MSP and enabling activities comes from triangulation of data from various
   sources, including desk reviews, interviews, and field visits. These assessments were
   completed where possible by meta-evaluation analysis of existing evaluative
   evidence and reports.

167. For the ongoing activities, the evaluation assessed the likelihood for achievement
   of results based on the review of project documents and on informed comments
   offered by key stakeholders regarding ongoing processes and activities.

168. The analysis does not attempt to directly attribute results to GEF activities.
   Rather, it assesses the contribution of GEF projects, along with other factors, to the
   achievement of expected results.

5.1 Global Environmental Benefits
169. The CPE has verified that many project outcomes are in line with Global
   Environmental Benefits (GEBs) across GEF focal areas. Some specific examples
   include:

           restoration of endangered Kihansi toads (GEF ID 4855);
           conservation of globally significant biodiversity to increase the carbon
            dioxide sink potential (GEF ID 1949, 3012, 3965, 5034 and 803);
           mitigation of GHG emissions in terms of reduction of carbon dioxide
            emissions (GEF ID 1196, 2903 and 4004);
           increased use of renewable energy and decreased use of fossil energy
            resources (GEF ID 1196, 2903 and 4004);
           sustainable use of the components of globally significant biodiversity (GEF
            ID 803, 1498, 2151 and 3428);
           multi-state cooperation to reduce threats to international waters (GEF ID
            88);
           reduced pollution load in international waters from nutrient enrichment and
            other land based stresses (GEF ID 88);
           and restored and sustained freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems
            goods and services (GEF ID 2101 and 780).

170. CPE field visits verified specific results relevant to GEBs. For example, in the last
   five years, conservation efforts in Jozani Park, Zanzibar, (Project ID 803) have led to
   a significant increase in the population of Red Colobus monkeys, to such an extent
   that they are negatively affecting the park flora (population of trees that they feed
   on). At the Eastern Arc Nature Reserve, the conservation efforts have led to the
   return in increasing numbers of bird species endemic to that region. A similar trend
   was observed in the number of monkey species endemic to the Kilombero reserve.



                                                                                       50
171. These achievements with regards to the GEF contribution towards GEBs received
   additional verification through discussions with a broad range of stakeholders.
   These gave information on the perceptions of stakeholders representing the
   Government of Tanzania, Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, local and
   International NGOs, civil society organizations and local authorities where GEF
   projects are located
172. However, generating support for environmental management through Income
   Generating Activities has also faced challenges, as illustrated from the MACEMP
   Project in Box 1 below.
 Box 1: Some challenges and barriers to project implementation in the MACEMP
 project

 Respondents contacted during site visits to the MACEMP reported the following
 challenges faced during project implementation:

 i.   Insufficient funds to cover IGAs in all community groups formed (e.g., in Lindi
      Municipality 96 groups were formed, but only 21 succeeded to attain support from
      MACEMP)
 ii. Inadequate funds for supervision and monitoring of activities under
      implementation
 iii. Lack of power of group members to control equipment facilitated/provided by
      MACEMP to community groups, (e.g. fishing gear and boats)
 iv. Enrolment of people outside target groups: (e.g., some fishing groups included non-
      fishing individuals). In such groups, non-fishing members sold the fishing gears,
      which resulted in failure or poor performance of the project activities.
 v. Inadequate funds to cover transport, food and beverage costs for capacity building
      training sessions of communities. This resulted in poor attendance.
 vi. Failure of some individuals to work together as a group due to misunderstandings
      and inappropriate individual behaviour.

5.2 Catalytic and Replication Effects
173. The GEF Evaluation Office distinguishes between the following means of
   enhancing the results from projects:

         Mainstreaming: Information, lessons, or specific results of the GEF are
          incorporated into broader stakeholder mandates and initiatives such as laws,
          policies, regulations, and programs.

         Replication: GEF-supported initiatives are reproduced or adopted at a
          comparable administrative or ecological scale, often in another geographical area
          or region.

         Scaling-up: GEF-supported initiatives are implemented at a larger geographical
          scale, often expanded to include new aspects or concerns that may be political,
          administrative, or ecological in nature.



                                                                                        51
         Market change: GEF-supported initiatives catalyze market transformation by
          influencing the supply of and/or demand for goods and services that contribute
          to global environmental benefits.

174. In Tanzania, GEF activities have contributed to enhanced results through all of
   mainstreaming, replication, scaling up and market change. Major means of
   mainstreaming approaches have been through:

               Assistance with National Communications, Reports, Plans and Programmes
                in association with Global Conventions
               Development of a cadre of trained professionals in environmental fields

175. Some aspects of the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics Market Project,
   such as the Installation of Solar PV Systems in Schools and Dispensaries around
   Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park, Zanzibar were also replicated in subsequent
   SGPs. The overall project approach was also replicated in three other regions (Mara,
   Shinyanga and Kagera). In other cases, specific activities have been replicated
   elsewhere within the country. For example, the Jozani-Chwaka Project (ID 803)
   created service and credit programmes, which were later replicated within the
   entire region of Unguja. Other projects evaluated have been less successful in
   replicating their activities in areas away from the original projects areas. However,
   many have enhanced their effects through the capacity building and skills and
   knowledge generated: (e.g., Project IDs 780 and 1734).
176. Scaling up has also been achieved by a number of projects. For example, the
   Jozani-Chwaka Project developed a programme to enable sustainable increases in
   income in communities around the Forest Reserve. This has been considerably
   expanded from its original core since project completion, with the reported number
   of savings and credit groups rising from 47 in 2004 to 736 in 2013. Similarly, the
   Conservation Endowment Fund created under the Eastern Arc Mountains Project,
   which supported activities in four sites in 2009, was reaching nine sites within the
   existing project area by 2013. The Fund had received donations of more than $12
   million by the end of 201238. As a result of the Forests Strategy developed by the
   project, Government elevated several areas to the status of Forest Nature Reserves
   (FNRs). These included Kilombero (over 100,000 ha.) Uluguru (over 20,000 ha.) and
   Nilo (over 6,000 ha.). After these Reserves were gazetted by the Government of
   Tanzania, the Government of Germany (in collaboration with UNDP), provided over
   Euros 2 million specifically to enhance the conservation capacities of the three FNRs.
   Within a number of project supported areas, results were achieved at a higher scale
   than planned. For example, an agriculture and agro-forestry improvement
   programme in Uluguru targeted 600 households, but by 2008 nearly 1,400 had
   adopted the new practices.
177. Another example of the scaling up of benefits initially developed in one project
   area comes from the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaic (PV) project (ID 1196).
   This originally upgraded the skills levels of technicians in Mwanza. However, many
   of its trainees later moved on to establish enterprises in other regions such as
   Shinyanga, Mara, Kagera, and Dar es Salaam. This can be seen as both scaling up of

38   As recorded on the Fund website; http://www.upeo.omis.co.tz


                                                                                      52
       the results of project activities and as a form of mainstreaming through enhancing
       the technically-specialised human resource base in the country. It is an example of
       spontaneous development efforts of individuals originally benefitting through
       training from the project.
178. The GEF contribution to catalysing market change has also been significant.
   The efforts of the same PV project promoted a reduction in tariffs on panels (which
   can be seen as mainstreaming), which had an effect in reducing market barriers to
   PV projects, particularly in rural areas. Other projects contributing to market change
   included: the SGP Amani Butterfly Farming Project, which provided training in
   marketing as well as technical aspects and also opened up markets in Europe and
   the US; and the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project, which established
   a Fisheries Laboratory, which has since been EU-certified, thereby enabling the
   country to export fish to that important market.
5.3 Institutional Sustainability and Capacity Building
179. The GEF has supported many measures intended to facilitate sustainability of
   environmental results. Specific measures taken to provide a basis for sustainability
   include capacity and institutional development and the development and
   implementation of environmental management systems. For example, the early
   Mnazi Bay Marine Park Project helped develop the Mnazi Bay Ruvuma Estuaries
   Management Plan, which was supported by Village Environmental Management
   Plans. These contributed to the protection of habitats of ecological importance and
   the protection of rare and endangered species.
180. Similarly, institutional development of Jozani Chwaka Forest Reserve enabled it
   to be upgraded to the status of National Park; for which a Management Plan was
   developed in collaboration with the relevant Government Department and local
   communities and remains active. Among local communities, the programme to
   develop sustainable increases in income, in order to reduce reliance on forest
   resources, has been maintained and expanded since project completion. For
   example, the number of savings and credit groups has grown from 47 (GEF, 2004)
   to 736 in 201339, which is reported to have stimulated Income Generating Activities,
   as well as improving food security and access to basic health and education.
181. Important measures to facilitate institutional sustainability for the Eastern Arc
   Mountains Project included upgrading some important areas to the status of Forest
   Nature Reserves and the creation of a Conservation Environment Fund to support
   conservation activities and attract new funds to support continuation of project
   goals. The Implementation Completion Review of this project cast some doubt
   concerning the possibility of sustaining the gains it had made. It notes that, based
   “on achievements made toward the project Global Environment Objective with
   respect to i) establishing of the Eastern Arc Mountain Conservation Endowment
   Fund (EAMCEF); ii) selecting and implementing of a sound capital investment
   strategy; as well as iii) GoT’s commitment in supporting the EAMCEF operation as
   well as its grant facility, its outcome could be considered Satisfactory. Thus, the
   failure to ensure the development and implementation of an effective fundraising
   strategy to secure necessary financing to implement its long-term strategies resulted


39   As reported to the CPE team on the basis of local records.


                                                                                       53
       in an overall GEO rating of Moderately Satisfactory”. 40
182. However, evidence collected by the CPE team suggests that the sustainability of
   benefit flows has been better than the ICR anticipated. Whereas, up to 2009, the
   EAMCEF had supported activities in four sites, this figure had risen to nine in the
   Financial Year 2012/13. The reputation of the Fund enabled UNDP to collaborate
   with the Government of Germany, which has provided over Euro 2 million through
   the Fund to enhance conservation efforts in the Reserves since project closure41.
   This positive assessment is in line with recent evidence provided by the Fund, as
   shown in Box 2.


 Box 2: Eastern Arc Endowment Fund: The Insider’s View

 The Fund website currently gives the following information on its origins and
 progress. “EAMCEF was officially registered in Tanzania on 6th June 2001, under the
 Trustees’ Incorporation Act Cap. 318 R. E. 2002 of the Laws of Tanzania. It was
 originally conceived as a joint initiative of the Government of the United Republic of
 Tanzania, the Board of Trustees (BOT), the World Bank (WB) and the Global
 Environment Facility (GEF). The Trust Fund operates as a Not-for-Profit Non-
 Governmental Organization (NGO). Initially, EAMCEF operated as a component of the
 WB financed project (TFCMP) under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism
 (MNRT) whereby a total of US$ 2.4 Mil. credit facility was used to finance activities and
 operations of its 7 years first phase (2002-2009), the establishment phase. Funding of
 the second phase (the permanent phase) was initially planned to come mainly from
 incomes generated from the investment of the endowment capital secured from the
 GEF commitment of US$ 7.0 mil. as well as additional resources acquired from other
 sources through fundraising activities. The Goal of the Project is: ‘Through improved
 operations of EAMCEF achieve enhanced conservation of the forests within the Eastern
 Arc Mountains in Tanzania’ and the Purpose is ‘Allow existing $7.5 million endowment
 to grow through funding EAMCEF operations in the office and in the field for 5 years,
 permitting EAMCEF to function as a long term funding mechanism for conservation of
 the Eastern Arc Mountains’. Throughout its existence, EAMCEF has obtained funding
 from numerous sources, including World Bank, Ministry of Natural Resources and
 Tourism, Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project, GEF, European
 Community and Royal Norwegian Government. Other partners include CEPF, WWF and
 UNDP”.

183. Another important approach to institutional sustainability has been through
   efforts to link local community benefits to improved environmental management.
   Several GEF-supported activities have generated improved environmental
   conservation (contributing towards Global Environment Benefits) by fostering
   sustainable livelihood and development approaches into GEF projects in different
   ways and at different levels. They have included: the creation of new jobs (e.g., in the
   tourism industry in Jozani-Chwaka); promotion of income generating activities
   through skills development (e.g., technical and marketing skills in Solar PV
   equipment in the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaic Market); improving

       livelihoods through promoting sustainable consumption of resources, including by
       reduction on the stress on forests and protected areas species conservation,
       reduction of destructive livelihoods such illegal hunting, fishing and tree felling, and
       improving existing livelihoods, through such practices as improved terraced
       agriculture to reduce land degradation (e.g., Mnazi Bay, Jozani-Chwaka and Eastern
       Arc Mountain Forests Project).
184. A successful example of such support as part of the Lake Victoria Environmental
   Management Project is provided in Box 3.
 Box 3: The Shigala Village Soil Conservation and Water Harvesting Under the LVEMP

 The soil conservation activity in Shigala village is carried out by the Shigala Soil
 Conservation Community Based Organization, which consists of 19 members. The
 Shigala CBO involves itself in making contours/tie ridges and terraces to prevent soil
 erosion, and which enable them to harvest water in between tie ridges and therefore
 prevent land degradation. Where there is stream water, the community builds ridges
 of cement to check the speed of water.

 The place where the community has controlled soil erosion and harvested water, the
 land has become very fertile prompting the group to plant trees and cultivate food
 crops such as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes and other crops.

 The CBO benefits from the project in that it earns good income through yields from
 farming activities. The group now gets about 15 bags of maize per hectare, as against
 4-5 bags they used to get before controlling soil erosion and harvesting water. The
 cassava and sweet potatoes’ yields have also increased to about ten bags per hectare.
 The group has been able to sell these crops and improve the members’ income. In this
 way, group members have been able to reduce their poverty, by constructing houses,
 eating well, paying for their medical treatment and so on.

 The training the CBO received has helped members to acquire knowledge on soil
 conservation and water harvesting, which has helped them improve their farming and
 increase yield per hectare. The CBO has also acquired capacity by procuring equipment
 such as ploughs and bulls, which they use to plough the fields. An interesting factor
 about the CBO is that it has been hired by adjacent villages to teach them the
 techniques of controlling soil erosion and water harvesting. They are paid for this
 work. Some of these fees go to the village government, while the group retains the
 balance, which they share among themselves. So, while assisting adjacent villages, the
 CBO has been able to spread the knowledge generated by the project and other villages
 have emulated the Shigala village.

185. In the Ulluguru component of the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Strategy,
   training and financial assistance enabled the development of effective livelihood
   improvement programmes, the results of which helped generate long-term support
   for environment management42.
186.       As with the Eastern Arc Project, doubts were expressed concerning some aspects

                                                                                            55
       of the sustainability of the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics (PV) Market
       Project. According to a Project Implementation Review: “The main concerns with
       regards to the replication/sustainability of project results and the long-term
       development of the sector concern the issues of quality assurance, affordability and
       market penetration and the establishment of financial mechanisms. There is no
       viable financing modality currently in place for the scheme (whether supply chain or
       end user based). The number of systems sold and customers is still very low
       compared to potential demand. As noted in the terminal report, the current PV
       market is very much focused on a small high-income category who affords to pay in
       cash up-front for the system with low-income consumers excluded from the market
       because of a lack of consumer financing schemes. The low-level of quality of many of
       the systems sold (leading to system failure and high maintenance costs) is also a risk
       for the sustainable development of the sector”43.
187. Many of the institutions, facilities and activities established or strengthened
   under the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project remain active. The Lake
   Victoria Fisheries Organisation has become one of the East African Community
   institutions, responsible for coordinating fisheries research and development. The
   Fisheries Laboratory continues its research activities, focusing particularly on
   ensuring the quality of export fish. On the other hand, since the project closed, no
   new research has been undertaken to determine the numbers and prevalence of fish
   species in the lake. The wastewater treatment plant at Mwanza is still used to treat
   wastewater before it is released into the Lake and the water quality laboratory
   continues to measure the quality of the Lake water by taking daily samples.
   However, since the LVEMP closed, there has been a resurgence of water hyacinth,
   which has been widely noted but not accurately measured. One reason for this that
   was observed by CPE field visits is that the 12 water hyacinth weevil rearing centres
   are no longer well used, leading to a dropping off of efforts to control the hyacinth44.
188. A number of national institutions in the environmental field expressed the view
   to the CPE team that, after 20 years of GEF support (which has included substantial
   institutional strengthening/capacity building), there is sufficient technical capacity
   for them to independently receive and utilise GEF funds. According to their
   perception, disbursement could now bypass the implementing agencies and go
   directly to national executing agencies as a means of increasing country ownership.
   Evidence cited focuses on continuing progress made after completion of such GEF
   projects as the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics (PV) Market, Jozani
   Chwaka Bay National Park Development, and Mainstreaming Climate Change in
   Integrated Water Resources Management in Pangani River Basin. Additional support
   might be gained from the UNEP evaluation of the Enabling Activities for the First
   National Communication to the UNFCCC. This found that the Technical Reports
   produced were of good quality and had used no international support in their
   production. However, it also noted delays in their delivery, suggesting that further
   attention may be needed to project management skills in order to strengthen
   national capacity to deliver on time.

5.4 Results by Focal Area

189.   Results have been delivered in all supported Focal Areas, as discussed below.

Biodiversity

190. Results reported at field level have included the protection of habitats of ecological
   importance, of globally significant biodiversity and of rare and endangered species (as
   noted, for example, for projects in Mnazi Bay, Jozani-Chwaka, Selous-Niassa and the
   Eastern Arc Mountains). Tracking and measurement of results in the GEF biodiversity
   portfolio has improved over time, so that more specific details have become
   increasingly available. Whilst some species level data are recorded (e.g., the
   substantial increase in the numbers of Red Colobus monkeys under protection by the
   Jozani-Chwaka project), a variety of other means is now also used to verify results. For
   example, application of the GEF Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool has shown
   that the Eastern Arc Mountain Forest project has generated improved biodiversity
   management, which has in turn led to specific reductions in threats (such as footpaths,
   pit sawing and traps) and reduced rates of annual forest loss.
191. The one project which did not deliver as expected was the IFC-implemented
   Boundary Lodge Lokisale Project. This sought to establish an eco-lodge through
   collaboration with a local private sector company and the creation of a Trust Fund.
   The terminal evaluation suggests that the Conservation Trust Fund was not designed
   properly and capacity of the communities was limited for follow up with the
   continuation and registration of the Trust Fund when funds from the project were
   exhausted. The Lodge, which was not part of the GEF project, and funded with
   separate IFC support has now been built.
192. In terms of the enabling environment for biodiversity protection, the GEF is widely
   recognised as having made a vital and effective contribution. Much of this has not
   been formally recorded; but it is noted by informed stakeholders that in the early
   years of its activities in Tanzania, the GEF supported fundamental processes such as
   the translation of key biodiversity documents into Kiswahili, training of Government
   staff at all levels and broad awareness-raising among the public and special interest
   groups, such as Members of Parliament. These measures enabled the country to begin
   to formulate its approaches towards biodiversity, a process to which the GEF later
   provided additional specific support that led to Tanzania’s Second National Report to
   the CBD, which has provided a sound basis for the preparation of national strategies,
   plans and programmes in the area.

Climate Change
193. GEF has supported 10 projects in Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. As
   expected the early portfolio supported the preparation of National Communications
   to the UNFCCC and preparation of an Adaptation Plan as well as capacity building.
   Subsequent projects began to lay the foundations for transforming markets for
   renewable energy such as Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics (PV) Market.
   (GEF ID 1196). An initiative for which site visits took place. This early GEF project
   aimed to target the market for rural photovoltaic systems, for which substantial




                                                                                        57
       potential was anticipated in view of the extremely low mains electricity coverage of
       rural areas of Tanzania.
194. At the time of its commencement, the project was a pioneer for this technology
   but unfortunately had low recognition nationally, in terms of immediate scale-up.
   The project catalysed the sale of an additional 7,500 solar PV units in the Mwanza
   region, which was its main focus. These provided power for such institutions as
   schools, clinics, small businesses such as battery charging for mobile phones and a
   limited number of domestic users.
195. However, the contribution of the project to the “enabling environment” for
   renewable energy in general and solar PV in particular was visible only upon
   evaluation and deemed to be substantial. Over time project stakeholders, in
   particular, the Tanzanian Renewable Energy Association, lobbied the Government to
   provide fiscal incentives for solar PV, which eventually led to the decision to waive
   taxes and duties on this technology, a decision credited with removing a substantial
   barrier to its wider adoption.
196. Furthermore, the project helped promote national quality standards for the
   technology, supported development of a vocational and technical training
   curriculum and trained a substantial number of technicians in installation and
   maintenance of such systems. Although there is no formal tracking study of the
   technicians trained by the project, the evaluation was reliably informed that many
   have established independent solar PV businesses, both in Mwanza region and more
   widely in the country leading to the market for national solar technology to increase
   15 times over.
197. The Tanzanian government continues to promote private sector, renewable
   energy approaches to rural electrification and today, the once small Tanzanian solar
   market is growing exponentially, from 100kWp in 2005 to over 5 MW in 2012. Still,
   capacity is small relative to the size of the country and the needs of the rural
   population.
198. Another GEF project (GEF ID 4004)) Min-Grids Based on Small Hydropower
   Sources to augment rural electrification is another initiative to meet the rural
   electricity demands in the country. This project has not yet demonstrated outcomes
   due to delays in implementation caused by delays in procuring equipment. The
   project’s last PIR indicated a satisfactory implementation progress rating.
199. More recently, GEF has supported climate change adaptation through 2 projects:
   The earlier one (recently completed) aimed to mainstream CC into Integrated Water
   Management in Northern Tanzania (GEF ID 2832)45 and more recently, Building
   Core Capacity to Address Climate change Adaptation in Coastal Zones (GEF ID
   4141),. Although it is difficult to specify the results in terms of heightened ability to
   adapt to CC, the Pangani River Basin project successfully supported the
   establishment of Water User Associations (with about 30% female membership),
   which have been trained to manage water resources in order to reduce the potential
   impacts of adverse climatic events. In terms of the enabling environment, the project
   is also known to have made a contribution, as noted in Box 4.

 “The tools and understanding developed during the project speak directly to the
 requirements of the water policy and NEMA. One scenario analysed in this study
 prioritised the environment above other water-use sectors (agriculture and
 hydropower) by explicitly allocating water to maintain the river ecosystem at a high
 level of health, as required in terms of NAWAPO. Optimising the distribution of existing
 flows to improve the existing river condition was also evaluated in further scenarios.
 Through these scenarios, water volumes and water-quality requirements to support
 healthy river, wetland and the estuarine ecosystems were clearly articulated, and the
 costs and benefits of allocating water to the environment were also made clear”.

International Waters
200. Tanzania has participated in a number of international waters projects, with
   varying degrees of engagement. The regional Lake Victoria Environmental
   Management Project has been included in this CPE, in view of the major activities
   supported in the country during and after its implementation. The main recorded
   field level result of the project is the reduction of the lake area affected by water
   hyacinth infestation by some 1,500 sq. km., out of the baseline area of 15,670 sq. km.
   Further, in Tanzania 55 community groups planted some 2.5 million trees, which are
   intended to help reduce clearing of existing forests, while an additional 100 village
   communities have been trained in soil and water conservation. A variety of
   measures has been taken to reduce over-fishing in the lake, but the results of these
   have not been specified.
201. In terms of the enabling environment for managing Lake Victoria and other
   water bodies, the project made a substantial contribution. It catalysed the creation
   of the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, which is housed in Kisumu, Kenya, and
   remains the specialized body of the East African Community charged with
   coordinating the sustainable development of the basin. The project also established
   two specialised laboratories. The Fisheries Laboratory has since been approved and
   certified by the Government of Tanzania and the European Union to ensure that fish
   exported from the country meet export quality standards imposed by the EU. The
   Water Quality Laboratory continues to take daily samples from the lake and advises
   Government of any issues arising. In 2004, the project supported construction of a
   wastewater treatment plant in Mwanza City, which previously had no facility for
   treating industrial and municipal wastes before they are released into the lake. A
   further important result of the project was the raising of national capacity in the
   fields of water quality management, fisheries and related areas. As a result of this
   support, 15 Ph.D. and 25 M.SC. degrees were obtained, while more than 50
   stakeholders attended short courses or study tours. Although no formal tracking has
   been undertaken, it is reported that some of the trainees are currently employed by
   the University of Tanzania, the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute and the
   Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. The broad range of capacity development
   provided can be seen as an important element of sustainability, although it is
   difficult to specify achievements in this respect.


                                                                                      59
Persistent Organic Pollutants
202. The GEF supported “Enabling Activities to Facilitate Early Action on the
   Implementation on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.” The
   results in terms of the enabling environment are discussed below. Specific results, to
   which this activity made a significant contribution, were later achieved under the
   Africa Stockpile Program (GEF Regional Project). The country was enabled to
   dispose of 575 tons of obsolete polluting pesticides and 392 tons of heavily
   contaminated soils. Other results that built on the work of the Enabling Activities
   include significant reductions in the release of PCBs and POPs, the phasing out of
   industrial use of PCBs and the removal of toxic and persistent pesticides from the list
   of those approved for use in the country46.
203. In terms of the enabling environment, the GEF laid the groundwork for the
   National Implementation Plan (2005), which specified the existing situation with
   regard to POPs and outlined the country’s commitments and intended actions for
   control and management of POPs over a 15 year period. Under the project, national
   capacity was strengthened and awareness raised among decision makers, private
   sector managers, NGOs and the general public. A number of important systems were
   established, including: an Obsolete Pesticide Database and an inventory and risk
   assessment of freestanding pesticides, contaminated sites, soils, buried pesticides
   and contaminated equipment. The capacity and resources supported by the GEF laid
   the foundation for the measurable reduction of POPs in the country.
Multi-Focal Area
204. One Multi-Focal Area project is complete, and has a draft Terminal Evaluation as
   of August 201347. This is the Multi-Focal Area Marine and Coastal Environment
   Management Project. Specific results have been reported in earlier Project
   Implementation Reviews, including the following:

              127 conservation committees have been established and are involved in
               mangroves management, leading to the replanting of 3, 527 ha. of mangrove
               forests
              Patrolling the coastline and mangrove reserves has minimized illegal
               dynamite fishing and has protected mangrove reserves in Lindi
              Alternative income generating activities such as poultry keeping, seaweed
               farming, aquaculture, pearl jewellery making and bee keeping have
               minimized the involvement in illegal fishing and destruction of biodiversity
               by communities in Lindi, Mtwara, Mnazi Bay and Mafia Island Marine Parks.
              Protection of habitats of ecological importance: About 13% of territorial seas
               area of has been brought under effective protection and management,
               divided evenly between the Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar.
              The enabling environment was strengthened by the project in a number of
               ways. MACEMP facilitated the common governance regime “The Deep Sea
               Fishing Authority” (DFSA) through the 2007 amendments to the Deep Sea

           Fishing Authority Act No 1 of 1998 (Act No.4 of 2007) and DFSA Regulations
           of 2009. The DFSA is tasked to ensure sustainable management of the
           Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
          MACEMP also helped the country to initiate the processes involved in
           preparing Trans-frontier Marine Protected Area network (between Kenya
           and Tanzania, and between Tanzania and Mozambique). Integrated Coastal
           Zone Management (ICZM) Strategies and an Action Plan for Zanzibar (July
           2009), as well as ICZM Regulations (2011) were developed and
           operationalized with assistance from the project.
          Other enabling environment results to which MACEMP has contributed
           include the empowerment of coastal communities in all benefitting local
           government authorities to be able to develop and implement:
          Surveys on the status of Zanzibar costal resources
          Reviews of Environmental Legal Notices, which supported development of a
           draft Non-Renewable Natural Resources (NRNR) and Environmental Impact
           Assessment regulations;
          Land use planning through support for nine Participatory Land Use
           Management Committees (PLUM)
205. The project has also raised the capacity of the Mafia Island Marine Park (MIMP)
   by providing the Park’s management with a hostel and office, transport (1 car and 5
   motorcycle), patrol boats (1 district office and 1 Park) and by assisting with the
   training of Park staff at postgraduate levels (2 M.Sc. and 1PhD).
Small Grants Programme
206. In view of their small size, individual SGP activities are not individually
   evaluated. The CPE conducted limited field reviews of three of the projects so far
   supported: Management and Conservation of Mangrove Forest at Bumbwini-
   Mkokotoni Bay (Zanzibar), Butterfly Farming around Amani Nature Reserves and
   Climate Change Adaptation and Improvement of Livelihoods through Establishment
   of Rainwater Harvesting Dam in Nyashimo, Nassa. Magu District. Other SGP
   activities were assessed in relation to FSP or MSP projects under review, notably the
   Solar PV project (ID1894).
207. The SGP Sustainable Land Management and Improvement of Livelihoods through
   Establishment of Rainwater Harvesting Dam project in Nyashimo Mwanza, improved
   communities’ livelihood through promoting sustainable agricultural practices,
   notably through the introduction of irrigation. This improved access to water for
   domestic, agricultural and livestock keeping activities. The initiation of the project
   also created jobs in water vending and helped to expand crops and horticultural
   produce. The participating communities were able to realise increased production of
   maize, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, onions, cabbages, and leafy vegetables.
   Consequently, the project has resulted in improved food and nutrition security, as
   well as additional income from the sale of various produce. The project results have
   been positively assessed by several neighbouring communities, which have
   replicated activities using their own resources.
208. The SGP Amani Butterfly Farming Project in Amani, Tanga promoted butterfly
   farming in the Eastern Usambara Mountains. This was achieved through training in
   butterfly farming and the provision of marketing services, which together aimed to
   shift dependence from unmanaged exploitation of forest products to the adoption of


                                                                                      61
     butterfly farming as an income generating activity. The Project buys pupae from
     member farmers and sells them primarily to live butterfly exhibits in European the
     US, with lesser sales of dried specimens to internet specimen dealers. Its finances
     and marketing are managed by project staff members employed by the Tanzania
     Forest Conservation Group, while the project’s policies and prices are determined by
     an elected committee of butterfly farmers48.This has resulted in conservation of
     biodiversity in East Usambara Mountains, since butterfly farmers and their
     communities are now conserving natural forests to protect host plants for their
     butterfly farming. This butterfly activity has been successfully replicated near
     Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park in Zanzibar. Despite the promising results of the
     project, a CPE field visit noted current major gap in terms of the lack of marketing
     planning and skills of participants.
209. The SGP Installation of Solar PV Systems in Schools and Dispensaries around Jozani
   Chwaka Bay National Park, Zanzibar has resulted in improved access to electricity
   and lighting through the installation of two PV systems of 250Wh in dispensaries
   and two PV systems of 3KWh to Secondary Schools in Ukongoroni and Charawe.
   Local perceptions reported to the CPE team state that the availability of power has
   resulted in improved health care, especially during childbirth and to improved
   student performance in secondary and primary schools due to the possibility of
   studying during the night-time.
210. While most of the reported outcomes of SGP activities are limited in scale,
   broader adoption of the promoted knowledge, technologies and approaches could
   facilitate scaled-up results. A particularly effective existing approach has been to link
   SGPs, with their emphasis on support to locally based activities, to MSPs and FSPs,
   which generate opportunities for such activities but may not have sufficient
   resources to support them. A good example is the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor
   project, which obtained support from the SGP to finance local initiatives to promote
   Income Generating Activities in a broad range of villages in the project area.
   Similarly, the Eastern Arc Mountains Project obtained SGP funding to promote
   Butterfly Farming as an IGA around Amani Nature Reserves, in order to reduce
   pressure on forest products.
Knowledge Generation and Learning

211. GEF-supported activities have specifically targeted the preparation of important
   documents for dissemination and use nationally and internationally. These have
   included several enabling activities, which have facilitated the preparation of such
   documents as the National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment and Action Plan, Initial
   National Communication to the UNFCCC and Assessment of Technology Needs
   (TNA), National Adaptation Programme of Action, POPs National Implementation
   Plan (NIP); and a variety of situation analyses and project feasibility studies. CPE
   interviews and document review shows that many of the concepts, proposed
   strategies and approaches and recommendations in the documents were used in the
   formulation of national policies, strategies, laws and regulations. Specific examples
   include the Strategy for Urgent Actions on Land Degradation and Water Catchments,
   National Biosafety Framework and the National Climate Change Strategy.

212. Lessons shared directly with communities and groups have included
   conservation and restoration know-how, organisational improvement, technology
   adoption, up scaling and marketing. Knowledge has been disseminated at field level
   through training sessions, technology and practices demonstrations, awareness
   meetings, publications, exchange visits and demonstrations, environmental
   competition exercises and environmental education excursions. More broadly, the
   dissemination of lessons learnt has been achieved through flyers, documentaries,
   leaflets, stakeholder report presentations, awareness meetings, media campaigns
   (radio and television), toolkits/handbooks, publications and websites.
213. Several projects have taken measures to disseminate lessons learned during
   and/or after implementation. These have included: Marine and Coastal
   Environmental Management Project; The Lake Victoria Environmental Management
   Project; The Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaic (PV) Markets Project; The
   Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park Development Project; The SGP Amani Butterfly
   Farming project in Amani, Tanga; and the SGP Sustainable Land Management and
   Improvement of Livelihoods through Establishment of Rainwater Harvesting Dam
   Project. In some cases, the lessons shared have been transferred and incorporated
   into future project designs in other areas, as was the case with the Amani Butterfly
   Farming project that was replicated in the Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park in
   Zanzibar.
214. Stakeholders reported that almost all recent GEF project documents and reports
   (hard and soft) in Tanzania are written in English (understood by less than 20% of
   the population) and highly technical. This means that most project participants and
   environmental stakeholders can neither understand nor share the content. So, while
   the GEF has been partially effective in disseminating results and lessons learned
   from projects: it has over-concentrated on English language documentation and
   web-based means, neither of which is widely accessible.
215. It appears that the GEF activities have in some regard moved backwards on this
   dimension, since it has been noted that in its early efforts, the GEF played an
   important role in translating biodiversity terms into Kiswahili. Another issue is that
   projects have an increasing focus on uploading information onto websites, which are
   inaccessible to most national stakeholders, due to lack of internet access49.




49Access   to internet is mainly in urban centers and less than 20% country wide. Lowest levels are in rural Tanzania.


                                                                                                                    63
6 Relevance of GEF-Supported Activities in The United
  Republic Of Tanzania

6.1 Relevance of GEF Support to the Country’s                            Sustainable
    Development Agenda and Environmental Priorities
216. Over the last twenty years, GEF support has played a significant role in helping to
   raise awareness on the environment as a vital cross cutting issue for the sustainable
   development of Tanzania. It has also laid the foundations for the mainstreaming of
   environmental issues into a range of sectoral policies and plans. Some specific
   examples include contributions towards the following: Preparation of the National
   Capacity Needs Self-Assessment and Action Plan of 2007, which laid the foundations
   for capacity development across a broad range of environmental areas and
   specialisations; plans and strategies for implementation of the National Biosafety
   Framework, 2012; and development of the National Adaptation Programme of
   Action, 2006.
217. The CPE found that most projects in the GEF Tanzania portfolio are well-aligned
   to national priority areas as delineated by the Government. GEF support is relevant
   to the national sustainability development agenda and environmental priorities,
   specifically to the Tanzania’s Development Vision 2025, Zanzibar Development
   Vision 2020, economic development, growth and poverty reduction strategies and
   targets (NSGRP II for the Mainland) and (MKUZA II for Zanzibar), the current Five
   Year Development Plan (FYDP, 2011-2015) and the National Climate Strategy 2013.
218. More specifically, GEF support is contributing to the national sustainable agenda
   stated in NSGRP II and MKUZA II by contributing to activities that have a positive
   impact on biodiversity conservation, restoration of ecosystems, demonstration of
   green energy sources, improvement of health care and primary and secondary
   school education (solar PV), irrigation to increase agricultural productivity and
   production levels and other income generation activities which are important to
   communities and national welfare.
219. Specific project-related dimensions of the relevance of GEF support in
   accelerating the national sustainable development agenda have been identified in
   the following representative areas:
         Enhancing access to renewable energy and in areas without access to grid
          power (Mini-Grids Based on Small Hydropower Sources to Augment Rural
          Electrification (Project ID 4004), Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics
          (PV) Market (Project ID 1196)
         Provision of income generating activities such as fishing (MACEMP, project ID
          2101) and marketing and maintenance of solar PV systems (Project ID 1196)
         Supporting irrigation activities for sustainable land management (LVEMP I
          project )
         Conservation of forests (Conservation and Management of the Eastern Arc
          Mountain Forests project, Project ID 1170)



                                                                                     64
         Sustainable exploitation of forest resources (Sustainable Management of the
          Miombo Woodland Resources of Western Tanzania (Project ID 3000),
          Lalkisale Biodiversity Conservation Support Project (Project ID 1491)
         Strengthening and creation of national parks (Jozani Chwaka Bay National
          Park Development (Project ID 2101), Strengthening the Protected Area
          Network in Southern Tanzania: Improving the Effectiveness of National Parks
          in Addressing Threats to Biodiversity (Project ID 3965), Novel Forms of
          Livestock & Wildlife Integration Adjacent to Protected Areas in Africa (Project
          ID 2151).
6.2 Relevance of GEF Support to the Country’s Development Priorities
    and Challenges
220. CPE discussions with key stakeholders found a consistent viewpoint that, under
   GEF-5, as a result of the STAR, the Government’s ownership of the portfolio has
   increased and Tanzania has become more empowered in setting priorities and
   decisions on funding its environmental priorities, where these overlap with Global
   Environment issues. Under the recent National Portfolio Formulation Exercise, after
   a consultative process, indicative allocations for proposed projects were suggested
   by the GEF National Steering Committee, the high level body incorporating (25)
   Government, Non-Government, the Private Sector and international development
   partners. The CPE team found during interviews with a broad range of stakeholders
   that some also perceived that this exercise did not really introduce a new portfolio,
   but rather decided among options, which had already been proposed.
221. An additional dimension of relevance cited by several stakeholders to the CPE
   team concerns the engagement with GEF projects of a number of research
   institutions and public agencies; such as TAFORI, TAWIRI, TPRI, TAFIRI, TALIRI,
   TATEDO, SUA, TANAPA, UDSM, Forestry and Beekeeping Division (MNRT) and
   NEMC. These bodies have been able to mainstream the results of their GEF activities
   into their ongoing research work, helping to ensure that the relevance of GEF
   activities is increased and sustained.
222. The relevance of the Small Grants Programme (SGP) is demonstrated by strong
   ownership by the Government, even though its activities are executed by civil
   society organizations, NGOs and community groups with the assistance of UNDP.
   This ownership has been recently re-confirmed under the National Portfolio
   Formulation Exercise, during which the sum of $3.6 million was suggested as an
   appropriate amount for the SGP out of Tanzania’s STAR Allocation of 27.43m.
223. Informed national stakeholders contacted by the CPE team also identified some
   emerging priority areas where they believe that GEF support has not yet fulfilled its
   potential. These include climate change adaptation (particularly in the broad
   Agricultural Sector as per the National Agricultural Policy, 2013) and energy access
   priorities (as outlined in the draft Power System Master Plan 2013-2035, Integrated
   Industrial Development Strategy, 2025, (URT 2009) and in the Long Term
   Perspective Plan (URT 2011).




                                                                                      65
6.3 Relevance of GEF Support to the Achievement of Global
    Environment Benefits
224. GEF support in Tanzania has been relevant to a variety of objectives linked to
   Global Environmental Benefits (GEBs) related to biodiversity, climate change,
   international waters, land degradation and chemicals focal areas. The GEF support
   has had an important role in creating the enabling framework necessary to underpin
   the creation of environmental policy and legislative development in Tanzania 50 to
   underpin the framework for the generation of GEB. GEF supported the development
   of numerous national plans and strategies, which were necessary for the
   implementation of Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs). These included
   the National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment for Global Environmental Management
   (NCSA); National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (NBSAP); National
   Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA); Initial National Communication under the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); National
   Action Plan to Combat Desertification (NAP); POPs National Implementation Plan
   (NIP); the review and update of the NIP for the Stockholm Convention on POPs; and
   the National Climate Change Strategy51. In the area of biodiversity, these plans and
   reviews were relevant to enabling Tanzania to identify critical ecosystems and
   species for conservation actions. With regard to climate change, GEF support was
   relevant in the country to develop appropriate legislative frameworks and policies,
   as well as adaptation strategies aimed at addressing its impacts at national level as
   well as to build local capacity to address environmental vulnerability. Some specific
   projects, which have contributed to the development of national approaches include:

             National Communication to the UNFCCC (GEF ID 182)
             Second National Report on the Implementation of the Convention on
              Biological Diversity (GEF ID 1468)
             National Implementation Plan (NIP) for the Stockholm Convention on
              Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) (GEF ID 1510)
             National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) (GEF ID 1996)
             National Capacity Self-Assessment (NCSA) (GEF ID 1949)


6.4 Relevance of the GEF Portfolio to Other Global and National
    Institutions
225. GEF activities, across focal areas have supported the United Republic of Tanzania
   national environmental protection initiatives and institutions, often supported by
   the use of Government’s own and donor funds to continue activities initiated with
   GEF support. It is also important to note, that there has been a substantial increase

     in the budgeted commitment of national funds dedicated to addressing
     environmental issues: from Tsh. 28.4 billion in 2006/2007 to Tsh. 151.7 billion in
     2009/2010.
226. An important area of relevance concerns the Government’s substantial efforts to
   meet its obligations to a range of international conventions, several of which are
   supported under GEF mandates. GEF support has played an important role in
   creating the enabling framework necessary to underpin the creation of
   environmental policy and legislative development in Tanzania52. GEF supported the
   development of numerous national plans and strategies, which were necessary for
   the implementation of Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs) and which are
   therefore also relevant to the Global Institutions managing those agreements. These
   included the National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment for Global Environmental
   Management (NCSA); National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (NBSAP);
   National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA); Initial National Communication
   under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC);
   National Action Plan to Combat Desertification (NAP); POPs National
   Implementation Plan (NIP); the review and update of the NIP for the Stockholm
   Convention on POPs; and the National Climate Change Strategy53.
227. A specific example of support for a national initiative/institution concerns the
   Eastern Arc for Conservation and Development Project. The World Bank
   Implementation Completion Report assessed a “substantial risk” to the
   sustainability of the GEF-supported outcomes. However, after GEF funding ceased,
   new support was obtained from the Federal Government of Germany. This enabled
   continuation of many activities, through the provision of equipment, infrastructure
   and transportation. Further, when the Eastern Arc Endowment Fund suffered losses
   during the recent financial crisis, NORAD support was obtained to help keep the
   parks operational until the Fund can recover.
228. Similarly, after the completion of the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaic
   (PV) Project (ID 1196), SIDA funding was mobilised to continue with the replication
   of the outcomes in other regions. The Government of Tanzania contributes its own
   resources towards sustainability through the funding of a range of institutions
   engaged in the management of protected areas, national parks, water bodies and
   institutions engaged in the conservation of natural resources of global
   environmental significance. However, its resources are strained by the need to
   continue with the substantially increased management requirements, which often
   follow from GEF Full Size Projects. Furthermore, as noted by some respondents in
   Ministries, which have participated in the GEF programme, there has to some extent
   been an over-reliance on external funds to enable activities to be continued in the
   absence of sufficient recurrent Government funding.

7 Efficiency of GEF Supported Activities in The United
  Republic Of Tanzania

      The efficiency of the overall support provided through GEF-financed activities
       depends on many factors, including the GEF Activity Cycle, Agency systems,
       government ministry and agency procedures, and the role of other stakeholders.
       Given the fact that GEF operates as a partnership institution and all the factors
       that need to be taken into consideration, it can be anticipated that the overall
       path of a GEF project will be long and that there may be considerable variation
       among projects. These aspects are explored in this chapter.
7.1 Time, Effort and Financial Resources Required for Project
    Formulation
229. The GEF project cycle has evolved over the years. Following the GEF Evaluation
   Office’s 2006 Joint Evaluation of the GEF Activity Cycle and Modalities, the GEF
   project cycle underwent a revision in 2007 (at the beginning of GEF-4), and
   processing time frame limits were adjusted. For example, a limit of 22 months for
   project development was imposed during GEF-4. This limit has been further
   reduced to 18 months for GEF-5. This section reviews the efficiency of GEF-
   supported activities in Tanzania, measured through the time and money it takes to
   process a project through the GEF Activity Cycle.
230. This CPE refers to this new GEF project cycle and assigns dates of previous
   projects, enabling activities, medium-size and full-size projects to the 5 major steps
   (A to E) in a way to allow comparison over time. Figure 7.1 describes a summary
   overview of the project cycle before 2007.
231. The Project Management Information System (PMIS) provided, in a few cases,
   inconsistent information, which had to be cross-checked with information collected
   from GEF Agencies and national executing agencies. Estimating these figures raises
   several problems, mostly related to the lack of full and reliable information, which
   resides in different places (GEF Secretariat, Agencies, and focal point mechanisms).
   However, in general terms information up to the approval and disbursement of GEF
   funds to GEF agencies is accurate. Information on the full costs supported by project
   components or implementers in the formulation phase, particularly government and
   civil society organizations, are not always available. In some cases, information on
   dates is incomplete or unreliable.




                                                                                      68

233. Historically, the GEF project cycle has been renowned for being particularly long
   and cumbersome. The evaluation of the GEF Activity Cycle and several CPEs
   originated reforms going in the direction of simplification and streamlining of the
   project cycle, which was renewed in 2007. In discussing the project cycle during the
   Tanzania CPE, prevalent views emerging from stakeholder interviews were that,
   even with project formulation support from the GEF, processes of project
   preparation are complex and time-consuming. Further, the concept and definition of
   co-financing are “opaque” and difficult to understand and which stakeholders
   suggested, on occasion, threatens the “grant” nature of GEF funding because it
   cannot be met by some institutions which would like to participate in the GEF
   program.
234. Analysis of the project cycle duration determined that although Full Size Projects
   take much longer to plan and gets started than Medium Size Projects; they still have
   a much greater implementation over-run (see Figures 7.4 and 7.5). However, some
   caution should be exercised in interpreting these data in view of the relatively small
   number of projects in each GEF Fund cohort.
235. The greater duration of planning and approval processes for Full Size, compared
   with Medium Size, Projects does not generate greater implementation efficiency.
   Although MSPs under-estimate how long it will take to complete, their degree of
   inaccuracy is far less than for FSPs. On further analysis, FSPs had consistently over-
   ambitious objectives, which lead them to incur substantial time over-runs. In
   Tanzania, the project cycle reforms introduced during the GEF-4 cycle will take time
   to be realized in the performance of GEF projects.

7.2 Coordination and Synergies
236. There have been synergies for GEF project programming and implementation
   among GEF Implementing Agencies, national institutions, GEF projects and other
   donor-supported projects and activities. However, these synergies have not been
   fully effective.
237. Synergies have been developed between GEF projects, other national institutions
   and other donor-supported projects. For example, GEF National Steering Committee
   members54 are selected from across the public sector, Civil Society Organisations,
   the private sector, Academia and other international partners. In this way there is a
   good communication and synergy across related activities in the environmental
   sector. This mix of capacities of key actors helps GEF projects to produce results. For
   example, the Transformation of the Rural Photovoltaics (PV) Market project (ID
   1196) was able to draw on a body of technical expertise in support of its lobbying
   for the waiving of tariffs on Solar PV equipment, which were seen as posing a critical
   barrier to the expansion of the market for this environmentally sustainable
   technology. Similarly, those steering the Marine and Coastal Environment
   Management Project (MACEMP, ID 2101) successfully lobbied for its approaches to
   be replicated in other areas.



54The GEF National Steering Committee is a high level body incorporating (25) Government, Non-Government, the
Private Sector and international development partners, which has overall responsibility for approving activities,
which the country will propose for GEF funding and for monitoring progress of activities.


                                                                                                             71
238. One area in which several stakeholders expressed dissatisfaction concerns the
   possibility of establishing synergies among different stakeholders, where there is a
   perceived lack of transparency on the part of Implementing Agencies in sharing
   financial information with Executing Agencies. This needs to be resolved in future
   projects if the possibilities for synergies are to be maximized.
239. The possibility of developing a fully coordinated and synergistic national
   portfolio is undermined by the relatively weak position of the Focal Point in the GEF
   system. Some of the symptoms of this are:
          GEF processes are long and complex and Agency offices have more access to
           and understanding of them than the Focal Point Office can attain
          The GEF has an established and close relationship with Agencies, which
           allows little room for national Governments
          Since the GEF has no country offices, this role is largely played by Agencies
          The partner and institutional role offered to Governments is minimal
          The FP Office has almost no engagement with projects once they are started.
           Its main engagement with IAs is during the project preparation and
           endorsement stages. After this, there is little transparency and the Agencies
           conduct their own project management and M&E, without contact with the
           FP Office
          Management of projects involving several countries is difficult and there is no
           lead Focal Point held responsible

240. The co-financing available from the Tanzania national budget for either Medium
   or Full Size GEF Projects has so far been slight. There has also been no major
   coordination between national budget procedures and the preparation and funding
   of GEF project proposals. Therefore, the national budgetary procedures have had
   little effect on GEF project funding, which has been largely dependent on
   Implementing Agencies (rather than Government) for co-financing. However,
   national budget disbursement processes have affected completed and on-going
   projects in which the Government has committed to a substantial in kind
   contribution; such as MACEMP, Kihansi Catchment Conservation and Management
   Project, Mnazi Bay Conservation Project, Conservation and Management of the
   Eastern Arc Mountain Forests and Mini-Grids Based on Small Hydropower Sources
   to Augment Rural Electrification.
241. Evidence from available Terminal Evaluations (TEs) has not highlighted
   coordination (or lack thereof) with national budget procedures as a major issue.
   Rather, the overall picture is that Government has broadly managed to keep pace
   with its in-kind commitments in terms of staff salaries and other routine
   requirements, but has been less effective in finding potential additional or future
   sources of Government funding to ensure sustainability of the many new -profiled
   institutions, which have been developed during project implementation.
242. The CPE discovered one measure, which many national stakeholders feel could
   promote greater efficiency and coordination across the portfolio. National
   institutions perceive that the capacity, which has been developed with GEF support,
   could now be used to enable the country to directly implement some GEF activities
   without an Implementing Agency. A number of national institutions in the
   environmental field believe that there is now sufficient technical capacity for them


                                                                                       72
   to independently receive and utilize GEF funds. According to their perception,
   disbursement could now bypass the implementing agencies and go directly to
   national executing agencies as a means of increasing country ownership. Progress
   has indeed been made in several projects, resulting in improved technical reporting,
   for example in national communications to international conventions. However,
   there are still some questions surrounding the national level of project management
   skills, which may limit the capacity to deliver.
243. It was reported to the CPE team that national institutions, which wished to
   register to become accredited GEF partners were discouraged by the US$25,000
   application fee, so that none are registered. This is an area, which the national
   stakeholders felt should be an important issue on the GEF Council agenda, since
   according to their experience and perceptions, the ownership, coordination and
   efficiency on the Tanzania programme is being limited by the challenges facing
   potentially qualified national institutions, which wish to play a more active role in
   the GEF programme.
7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation for Project Adaptive Management
244. There have been weaknesses in the Monitoring and Evaluation Systems of a
   number of GEF projects, whilst others are reported to have been satisfactory.
   Although a number of TEs does not address the role played by M&E in project
   development and management, several do. The ICR for the Conservation and
   Management of the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests Project notes that M&E was weak
   from the outset and failed to prevent the project from rapidly slipping into a set of
   “unsatisfactory” ratings from World Bank Supervision Missions. Even though the
   project had a “problem” status for 30 months, no steps were taken to revise its
   Global Environment Objective, which would have indicated effective adaptive
   management.
245. The Jozani-Chwaka Bay Conservation project was financed by several
   international stakeholders, resulting in an M&E system, which was rated by its TE
   as “Top Heavy” and confusing, as each stakeholder insisted on its own monitoring
   requirements being met, including for Mid Term Reviews (MTR). In view of the
   number of MTRs already completed, the project’s own MTR was not given due
   attention or resources and therefore missed the opportunity to recommend
   necessary changes to the strategic direction of the project. In another example, the
   TE of the Mnazi Bay Project noted that project managers received and accepted a
   substantial set of recommendations from its MTR, but then ignored them all in
   implementation. The TE also reports that “lack of a coherent M&E framework
   resulted in a diminished project capacity for adaptive management”. Furthermore, it
   notes that the Logframe, intended to be an important part of the M&E system, was
   “untouched” throughout the project.
246. One project in which M&E did play an active role is the Selous-Niassa Wildlife
   Corridor. Here, the M&E Plan was implemented and the MTR gave substantial advice
   on changing directions, which were largely followed. Baseline data were somewhat
   belatedly gathered and the project revised its objectives to a less ambitious level. An
   important suggestion of the MTE was that the project should engage with the SGP to
   promote Income generating Activities to a broader range of villages. This was done,
   leading to improved income from such activities as fish farming and bee keeping,
   which in turn improved the acceptability of heightened wildlife management.

                                                                                       73
247. Some projects have made substantial efforts to strengthen M&E capacity, both
   during implementation and for the future. An example is the Pangani Basin Water
   Management Project, as illustrated by Box 5.
248. Despite such efforts in specific projects, it is clear that M&E systems are not yet
   uniformly regarded as an important asset to the management and development of
   projects and that more emphasis needs to be placed on them by project managers
   and supervisors.

 Box 5: Strengthening M&E in the Pangani Basin Water Management Project

 The Project fielded an M&E consultancy which described the background: “the
 challenge in articulating M&E components such as the indicator matrix is for instance
 that most of the water users and their organizations have inadequate knowledge of
 M&E specific skills. They should be further trained on all the skills areas depending on
 their intended role. Issues such as determining impact, outcome, outputs, targets,
 indicators that are keys to the process are a problem. This situation calls for a strategy
 for M&E beyond merely providing templates to apply M&E but also to determine the
 skills required and to train on these”. The M&E study was undertaken in 2010 and the
 joint PSC decided to - at this late stage of the Project – to focus on the PBWB’s (Pangani
 Basin Water Board) monitoring of future work plans.

 The following areas were identified where skill building was deemed necessary and
 should be part of the M&E capacity building plan: Basic skills such IWRM and Climate
 Change, M&E specific skills, professional skills such as creating knowledge narratives
 on impact, and cross cutting issues such as gender. The M&E study recommended at
 the onset that the skills building shall be part of the process of M&E system
 implementation in the future as an initial stage setting even before training on
 applications of the templates on M&E system.

 The TE team observes as a great achievement that this process has now started for the
 PBWB and now an indicator matrix is integrated in the PBWB’s action plan for
 Financial Year (FY) 2010/11.

                   STATEMENT FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE


This statement presents my views on the final report on the GEF Tanzania Country Portfolio
Evaluation report which covers a period between 1992 and 2012. It highlights some major areas
of observations and the results thereof as follow:
      As member of the Quality Assurance Panel (QAP) I was involve in the process right from the drafting of
       the Terms of Reference for the QAP. Indeed, all suggestions were incorporated in the final terms of
       reference and affectively engaged the QAP member in the process of seeing the final output of the
       evaluation.
      One of the most interesting observations is the use of multiple methods with triangulation, making the
       methodology so robust to warrant the result achieved, with evidences and without contention. The most
       effective method however, is the involvement of stakeholders and incorporation of their ideas and
       observations.
      The final report has incorporated all recommendation, making the report excellent, in my views. This is
       evident as can be seen in the Conclusions and Recommendations of the report.

Terms of Reference
GEF Country Portfolio Evaluation: Tanzania
(1992-2012)
Approved by GEF Evaluation Office Director on March 26, 2013


Background and Introduction
1.      Country Portfolio Evaluations (CPEs) are one of the main evaluation streams of work of
the GEF Evaluation Office.55 By capturing aggregate portfolio results and performance of the
GEF at the country level they provide useful information for both the GEF Council and the
countries. CPEs relevance and utility will increase in GEF-5 with the increased emphasis on
country ownership and country driven portfolio development.
2.      GEF eligible countries are chosen for portfolio evaluations, based on a selection process
and a set of criteria including the size, diversity and maturity of their portfolio of projects.56
Among several considerations, Tanzania was selected based on its diverse portfolio in almost all
GEF focal areas (biodiversity, climate change, persistent organic pollutants, land degradation
and multifocal area) and because it has many completed/closed projects with significant
emphasis on biodiversity and climate change, giving broader scope for review of sustainability
and progress to impact. Furthermore, Tanzania includes several ongoing projects as well as
those that are on the verge of implementation.
3.      The Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the merger of Tanganyika and
the archipelago of Zanzibar, made up of two main islands and several smaller ones. Centrally
placed in East Africa, Tanzania, has eight neighboring countries and 1400 kilometers of Indian
Ocean coastline. It is a member of the East African Community (EAC) and Southern African
Development Community (SADC). As a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania, Zanzibar has its own
government, known as the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, with a President, First Vice
President, Second Vice President and cabinet.
4.      Tanzania is divided into thirty regions: five on the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar
and twenty-five on the mainland, the former Tanganyika. The population of the country is 44.9
million (2012 national census). Out of these, approximately 43 million reside in mainland
Tanzania and 1.3 million in Zanzibar.
5.      The Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.466 giving the country a rank of 152 out of
187 countries, which, although below the World’s average, is above the regional average57. Over
the past two decades, economic reforms have improved the economic status of the country. The
economic growth rate in 2011 has been estimated to be 6.4% in real terms, higher than the
target of 6.0%, but lower than the 7.0% recorded in 2010. According to a World Bank study the
living conditions in rural areas of Tanzania have not improved because many households have
not been included in the economic growth patterns.58

6.       The economy is based primarily on agriculture, which accounts for more than half of the
GDP ($23.71 billion in 2011) provides 75% (approximately) of exports, and employs
approximately 75% of the workforce.Tourism accounts for around 16% of the GDP and nearly
25% of total export earnings. Topography and climate, though, limit cultivated crops to only 4%
of the land area. The nation has many resources including minerals, natural gas, and tourism.
7.      The country's landscape spans from east coast shores to a mountainous northeast,
which is dominated by Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro. Tanzania borders with Lake
Victoria in the north and Lake Tanganyika to the west. The center of the country consists of a
large plateau with plains and some arable land. About a third of Tanzania is covered by forests
and woodland, on the plains, populations of African wildlife thrive in well-known areas, such as
the Serengeti, which remain mostly unspoilt. In the marine realm, the country's mangrove
forests have several ecosystem functions including as nursery areas for fish and prawns. There
are also extensive sea grass areas, an important food and habitat. Coral reefs are located along
about two thirds of Tanzania's coastline59.
8.       The six major environmental; threats identified by its Government are land degradation;
lack of accessible, good quality water for both urban and rural inhabitants; environmental
pollution; loss of wildlife habitat and biodiversity; deterioration of aquatic systems and
deforestation.60 This results in reduction of soil productivity, lack of availability of good quality
water for washing, cooking, drinking and bathing and threats to national heritage and tourism.
All these factors have also been associated with increase in poverty in the country. The reasons
for the above have been identified as inadequate land and water management at various
management levels, inadequate financial and human resources, the inequitable terms of
international trade, vulnerable nature of some local environment, rapid growth of rural and
urban population and inadequate institutional coordination. Apart from these, other factors
include inadequate monitoring and information systems, inadequate capacity to implement
programs, inadequate involvement of major stakeholders (local communities, non-
governmental organizations and the private sector) and inadequate integration of conservation
measures in planning and development of programs.61
9.      GEF has been active in Tanzania since 1992 with 29 national projects. The portfolio62
includes 11 climate change projects, 12 projects in biodiversity, 3 multi focal area projects, 2 in
POPs and 1 in land degradation (Table 1). The total GEF grant is approximately $79 million with
$366 million of co-financing. The Tanzania projects are evenly spread within the GEF project
cycle with 14 projects completed, 9 projects under implementation and 6 pending (these
include CEO, Council and Agency approved).
10.     The portfolio in Tanzania is split as follows: UNDP has been a main channel for support
with 13 projects totaling over $29 million in GEF budget; World Bank has implemented $36
million in GEF support through 6 projects; UNIDO has 5 projects with a total GEF budget of $9.3
million and UNEP also with 5 projects having GEF budget of $4.7 million. Respective co-
financing amounts by focal area are indicated in Table 1.

Objectives of the evaluation
11.      The purpose of the Tanzania CPEs is to provide the GEF Council with an assessment of
results and performance of the GEF supported activities in the country, and of how the GEF
supported activities fit into the national strategies and priorities as well as within the global
environmental mandate of the GEF. Based on this overall purpose, the Tanzania CPE will have
the following specific objectives:
         1. Evaluate the effectiveness and results of GEF support in a country, with attention
            to the sustainability of achievements at the project level and progress toward
            impact on global environmental benefits.63
         2. Evaluate the relevance and efficiency64of GEF support in Tanzania from several
            points of view: national environmental frameworks and decision-making processes,



63
  From the GEF Monitoring and Evaluation Policy, 2010: Effectiveness: the extent to which the GEF activity’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance; Results:
in GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short- to medium-term outcomes, and progress toward
longer term impact including global environmental benefits, replication effects, and other local effects;
Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended period of time
after completion; projects need to be environmentally as well as financially and socially sustainable.
64Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national environmental priorities and policies

and to global environmental benefits to which the GEF is dedicated; Efficiency: the extent to which results have
been delivered with the least costly resources possible.


                                                                                                                 79
           the GEF mandate of achieving of global environmental benefits, and GEF policies and
           procedures.
       3. Provide feedback and knowledge sharing to (1) the GEF Council in its decision
          making process, (2) Tanzania on its collaboration/participation in the GEF, and (3)
          the different agencies and organizations involved in the preparation and
          implementation of GEF support.
12.     The Tanzania CPE will also be used to provide information and evidence to other
evaluations being conducted by the Office; for example the Biodiversity Impact Evaluation, Mid-
Term Review of the National Portfolio Formulation Exercise and overall the second report of the
Fifth Overall Performance Study (OPS5) to the GEF Replenishment Committee.
13.      The Tanzania CPE will analyze the performance of individual projects as part of the
overall GEF portfolio, but without rating such projects. CPEs are conducted to bring to the
attention of Council different experiences and lessons on how the GEF is implemented at the
national level from a wide variety of countries. CPEs do not aim at evaluating the performance
of GEF agencies, national entities (agencies/departments, national governments or involved
civil society organizations), or individual projects.
Key Evaluation Questions
14.     GEF CPEs are guided by a set of key questions that should be answered based on the
quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluative information and perceptions collected
during the evaluation exercise. The Tanzania CPE will be guided by the following key questions:
   Effectiveness, results and sustainability
       a) Is GEF support effective in producing results at the project level, aggregate level
           (portfolio and program) by focal area, and at the country level; and are project level
           results sustainable?
       b) Is the GEF support to Tanzania effective in creating individual capacity and
          strengthening institutions at national, regional and local levels?
       c) Is GEF support effective in producing results related to the dissemination of lessons
          learned in GEF projects and with partners, and if so, how are such lessons shared in-
          country?
       d) Has GEF support led to progress toward impact over an extended period of time
          after completion?
       e) Is GEF support effective in replicating/up-scaling the successful results it has
          demonstrated in its projects?
       f) Is the GEF support effective in linking environmental conservation measures with
          compatible sustainable livelihood and development activities for achieving global
          environmental benefits?
       g) Has the GEF support to Tanzania facilitated the channeling of additional resources
          for preventing land degradation efforts for achieving global environmental benefits?
   Relevance
      a) Is GEF support relevant to the Tanzania sustainable development agenda and
         environmental priorities, to the country’s development needs and challenges, and to
         national GEF focal area action plans?
       b) Is GEF support relevant to the objectives linked to the different global
          environmental benefits in the climate change, biodiversity, international waters,
          land degradation, and chemicals focal areas?




                                                                                               80
        c) Are GEF and its Agencies supporting environmental and sustainable development
           prioritization, country ownership and decision-making process in Tanzania, and if
           so, how has this evolved over time?
        d) To what extent have GEF- supported activities also received support from the
             country and/or from other donors?
        e) Are there tradeoffs between the relevance of GEF support to Tanzania's national
           priorities versus the relevance to global environmental benefits?
        Efficiency
         a) How much time, effort and financial resources (including co-financing) does it take
             to formulate and implement projects, by type of GEF support modality?
         b) What are the roles, types of engagement and coordination among different
            stakeholders in project implementation?
         c) Are there synergies among GEF agencies, Tanzania national institutions and other
             donors in support of GEF programming and implementation?
         d) What role does Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) play in project adaptive
            management and overall efficiency? Are results based on defined tracking tools and
            monitoring and evaluation data?
         e) Is the necessary capacity available, created and remaining within national
             institutions to more independently receive GEF support?
         f) How do the national budget procedures affect GEF project proposals preparation
             and funding?

15.   Each of these questions is complemented by indicators, potential sources of information
and methods in an evaluation matrix, which is presented in Annex 1.
Scope and Limitations
16.     The Tanzania CPEs will cover all types of GEF supported activities in the country at all
stages of the project cycle (pipeline, on-going and completed) and implemented by all active
GEF Agencies in all active focal areas, including applicable GEF corporate activities such as the
Small Grants Programme (SGP) and a selection of regional and global programs that are of
special relevance to these countries. However, the main focus of the evaluation will be the
projects implemented within the country boundaries, i.e. the national projects, be these full-size,
medium-size or enabling activities. 65The stage of the project will determine the expected CPE
focus (see Table 2).

  The review of selected regional projects will feed in the aggregate assessment of the national GEF portfolio
described above.


                                                                                                          81
17.      The GEF does not establish country programs that specify expected achievements
through programmatic objectives, indicators, and targets. However, since 2010 the GEF has
started supporting countries in undertaking national portfolio formulation exercises on a
voluntary basis. These exercises serve as a priority setting tool for countries and as a guide for
GEF Agencies as they assist recipient countries. These country programming efforts are rather
recent, which limits their usefulness in country portfolio evaluations that look back up to the
start of GEF operations, i.e. sometimes 20 years back. This is why generally CPEs entail some
degree of retrofitting of frameworks to be able to judge the relevance of the aggregated results
of a diverse portfolio of projects. Accordingly, the CPE evaluation framework described here will
be adapted along with the other relevant national and GEF Agencies’ strategies, country
programs and/or planning frameworks as a basis for assessing the aggregate results, efficiency
and relevance of the GEF portfolio in Tanzania.
18.      GEF support is provided through partnerships with many institutions operating at many
levels, from local to national and international level. It is therefore challenging to consider GEF
support separately. The Tanzania CPE will not attempt to provide a direct attribution of
development results to the GEF, but address the contribution of the GEF support to the overall
achievements, i.e. to establish a credible link between what GEF supported activities and its
implications. The evaluation will address how GEF support has contributed to overall
achievements in partnership with others, through analysis on roles and coordination, synergies
and complementarities and knowledge sharing.
19.     The assessment of results will be focused, where possible, at the level of outcomes and
impacts rather than outputs. Project-level results will be measured against the overall expected
impact and outcomes from each project. Special attention will be paid to the identification of
factors affecting the level of outcome achievements and progress to impact, as well as to the
risks that may prevent further progress to long term impacts. Outcomes at the focal area level
will be primarily assessed in relation to catalytic and replication effects, institutional
sustainability and capacity building, and awareness.
20.     Progress towards impact of a representative sample of mature enough projects66 (i.e.
completed at least since 2 years) will be looked at through field Reviews of Outcome to Impact
(ROtI) studies. Expected impacts at the focal area level will be assessed in the context of GEF
objectives and indicators of global environmental benefits.
21.     The inclusion of regional and global projects increases the complexity of this type of
evaluations since these projects are developed and approved under different context (i.e.
regional or global policies and strategies) than national countries. However, a representative
number of regional and global projects will be included based on criteria such as the relevance
of the regional project for the country, the implementation unit being located in the country,
among others.
22.      Within the national portfolio, 14 projects are completed (3 full-size projects, 5 medium-
size projects and 6 enabling activities); 9 projects are under implementation (8 are full-size
projects and 1 medium size) and 7 pending (includes CEO, Council and Agency approved – 6
full-size and 1 enabling activity). The context in which these projects were developed, approved
and are being implemented constitutes another focus of the evaluation. This includes a historic
assessment of the national sustainable development and environmental policies, strategies and
priorities, legal environment in which these policies are implemented and enforced, GEF
Agencies country strategies and programs and the GEF policies, principles, programs and
strategies.




66
  It is expected that at least 3 ROtI would be conducted. Opportunities to conduct more will be sought in
consort with other evaluations taking place in the Evaluation Office.


                                                                                                     82
Methodology
23.    The Tanzania country portfolio evaluation will be conducted by staff of the GEF
Evaluation Office and staff and consultants from the Economic and Social Research Foundation
(ESRF). The team includes technical expertise on the national environmental and sustainable
development strategies, evaluation methodologies, and GEF.
24.     ESRF staff qualifies under the GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines, and have signed
a declaration of interest to indicate no recent (last 3-5 years) relationship with GEF support in
the country. The Operational Focal Point in the country will act as resource person in facilitating
the CPE process by identifying interviewees and source documents, organizing interviews,
meetings and field visits.
25.    The methodology includes a series of components using a combination of qualitative
and quantitative evaluation methods and tools. The expected sources of information include:
         Project level: project documents, project implementation reports, terminal
          evaluations, terminal evaluation reviews, reports from monitoring visits, and any
          other technical documents produced by projects;
         Country level: national sustainable development agendas, environmental priorities
          and strategies, GEF-wide, focal area strategies and action plans, global and national
          environmental indicators;
         Agency levels: country assistance strategies and frameworks and their evaluations and
          reviews;
         Evaluative evidence at country level from other evaluations implemented either by the
          Office, by the independent evaluation offices of GEF Agencies, or by other national or
          international evaluation departments;
         Interviews with GEF stakeholders, including the GEF Operational Focal Point and all
          other relevant government departments, bilateral and multilateral donors, civil
          society organizations and academia (including both local and international NGOs with
          a presence in the country), GEF Agencies, SGP and the national UN conventions’ Focal
          Points;
         Interviews with GEF beneficiaries and supported institutions, municipal governments
          and associations, and local communities and authorities;
         Surveys with GEF stakeholders in the country;
         Field visits to selected project sites, using methods and tools developed by the Office
          such as the or the Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) Handbook;
         Information from national consultation workshops.
26.     The quantitative analysis will use indicators to assess the relevance and efficiency of
GEF support using projects as the unit of analysis (that is, linkages with national priorities, time
and cost of preparing and implementing projects, etc.) and to measure GEF results (that is,
progress towards achieving global environmental impacts) and performance of projects (such
as implementation and completion ratings). Available statistics and scientific sources, especially
for national environmental indicators, will also be used.
27.     The Evaluation Team will use standard tools and protocols for the CPEs and adapt these
to the national and regional context. These tools include a project review protocol to conduct
the desk and field reviews of GEF projects and interview guides to conduct interviews with
different stakeholders.
28.      The Tanzania CPE will include visits to project sites. The criteria for selecting the sites
will be finalized during the implementation of the evaluation, with emphasis placed on both


                                                                                                       83
ongoing and completed projects. The evaluation team will decide on specific sites to visit based
on the initial review of documentation and balancing needs of representation as well as cost-
effectiveness of conducting the field visits.
29.     Quality assurance will be performed at key stages of the process by a Quality Assurance
Panel composed by three independent national experts67. The expertise provided covers the
relevant scientific and technical aspects of the peer review function related to the GEF focal
areas as well as to evaluation.
a) The Evaluation Team will also present a separate analysis of the Zanzibar GEF portfolio, i.e.
   those GEF supported projects implemented in Zanzibar. While these projects will remain
   within the broader Tanzania portfolio for analysis; the separate analysis will benefit from,
   and benefit, the GEF Evaluation Office’s experience with evaluation of GEF programming in
   small island development states such as those recently undertaken in the Caribbean, Cuba,
   East Timor and the ongoing Vanuatu and SPREP Portfolio Evaluation. The Zanzibar analysis
   will present the portfolio distribution and discussion of its relevance, efficiency,
   effectiveness and results.
Process and Outputs
30.      These country-specific TOR have been prepared based on two GEF Evaluation Office
visits to Tanzania in September and November 2012. The first mission was conducted with the
purpose of assessing institutional and human capacity for joint management, quality assurance
and national conduct of the evaluation. The 2nd mission was for scoping the evaluation and
identifying key issues to be included in the analysis. The scoping mission was also an
opportunity to officially launch the evaluation and introduce the selected consultants to GEF
national stakeholders. These TOR conclude the preparatory phase, and set the scene for the
evaluation phase, during which the Evaluation Team will collect information and review
literature to extract existing reliable evaluative evidence and prepare specific inputs to the CPE,
including:
        -    the GEF Portfolio Database which describes all GEF support activities within the
             country, basic information (GEF Agency, focal area, implementation status), their
             implementation status, project cycle information, GEF and co-financing financial
             information, major objectives and expected (or actual) results, key partners per
             project, etc.
        -    Country Environmental Legal Framework which provides an historical
             perspective of the context in which the GEF projects have been developed and
             implemented in Tanzania. This document will be based on information on national
             environmental legislation, environmental policies of the government administration
             (plans, strategies and similar), and the international agreements signed by The
             Tanzania presented and analyzed through time so to be able to connect with
             particular GEF support.
        -    Global Environmental Benefits Assessment which provides an assessment of the
             country’s contribution to the GEF mandate and its focal areas based on appropriate
             indicators, such as those used in the System for the Transparent Allocation of
             Resources (STAR) (biodiversity, climate change and land degradation) and others
             used in projects documents.

67The   following individuals comprise the Quality Assurance Panel: Prof Amos Enock Majule, Director -
Institute for Resource Assessment, University of Dar-es-Salaam; Dr. Bakari Asseid - Deputy Principal Secretary
(Natural Resources) – Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Zanzibar and Technical Advisor to the
Society for Natural Resources and; Mr. Ekingo Magembe, Head of the Poverty Monitoring Office in Ministry of
Finance, unit responsible for implementation of MKUKUTA (Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan) Monitoring
Master Plan.


                                                                                                          84
        -   Review of Outcomes to Impact (ROtI) Field studies of three projects completed
            since at least 2 years, selected in consultation with the Evaluation Office staff, which
            will contribute to strengthen the information gathering and analysis on results.
        -   The Evaluation Team will also conduct additional field visits of other (3-5)
            ongoing and/or completed national and regional projects, including those from the
            Small Grants Programme (SGP) Portfolio of projects68, selected in consultation with
            the Evaluation Office staff, which will contribute to strengthen the information
            gathering and analysis on results.
        -   Conduct the evaluation analysis and triangulation of collected information and
            evidence from various sources, tools and methods. This will be done during a
            mission to Tanzania by the Office’s Task Manager working with the ESRF team. The
            aim will be to consolidate evidence gathered thus far, identify missing information
            and analysis gaps and arrive at preliminary findings. These will be summarized in a
            concise Aide Mémoire, which will be distributed to stakeholders one week prior to
            the final consultation workshop.69 During this mission, additional analysis, meetings,
            document reviews and/or field work might be undertaken as needed.
        -   Conduct a Stakeholder Consultation Workshop for the Government and national
            stakeholders, including project staff, donors and GEF Agencies, to present and gather
            stakeholders’ feedback on the GEF Tanzania CPE key preliminary findings, contained
            in the Aid-Mémoire and circulated prior to the workshop. The workshop will be an
            opportunity to verify eventual errors of facts or analysis in case these are supported
            by adequate additional evidence brought to the attention of the Evaluation Team.
            The workshop will also aim at identifying potential areas of recommendations and
            verify their concreteness and feasibility;
        -   Prepare a Draft GEF Tanzania CPE Report, which incorporates comments received
            at the final consultation workshop. The draft report will be sent out for factual error
            checking as well as errors of analysis to stakeholders;
        -   Consider the eventual incorporation of comments received to the draft report and
            prepare the Final Tanzania CPE Report. The GEF Evaluation Office will bear full
            responsibility for the content of the report.
