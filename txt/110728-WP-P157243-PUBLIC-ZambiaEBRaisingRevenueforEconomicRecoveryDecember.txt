A. REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity in the SSA region continues to be subdued in 2016, with GDP expansion expected
to stall to its slowest pace in over two decades. The region continues to confront tough global con-
ditions; notably low global growth, weak global trade, and low commodity prices. Economic perfor-
mances remained divergent across countries, with slowdown concentrated in the largest commodity
exporters. For countries that have stronger fiscal and monetary policies, a better regulatory environ-
ment, a more diverse structure of exports, and more effective public institutions, growth remained
resilient.

                        the region’s commodity-exporting countries and countries that depend on external
                        borrowing and capital flows have been hit hardest. The situation has been exacerbated
                        by domestic headwinds from policy uncertainty, droughts, weak policy buffers, and po-
                        litical and security concerns which continued to weigh on activity across the region. The
                        slowdown in growth implies that GDP per capita will contract by 0.7% in 2016, further
                        complicating the challenge of accelerating poverty reduction in the region.

                                            contraction will continue through the second half of 2016. In South Africa, a declining
                                            mining sector and poor rains led to a GDP contraction of 0.1% in Q1 2016, although
                                            growth since then has picked up following improved performance in manufacturing
                                            and financial services.

                                            Elsewhere, growth continued to stall in oil-exporting countries (e.g. Angola, Chad, Ga-
                                            bon, and Equatorial Guinea). Non-energy mineral exporting economies, including Bot-
                                            swana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Zambia
                                            have also continued to struggle, despite benefiting from lower oil prices. In some coun-
                                            tries domestic challenges amplified the impact of external headwinds. For example, El
                                            Niño-related poor rainfall in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons curtailed agricultural
                                            production and hydroelectricity generation across the Southern African region.

                                            Despite a slowdown of the regional economy, some countries continued to experience
                                            robust GDP growth. These include Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania,
                                            and Senegal. According to the World Bank’s Africa’s Pulse (October 2016), most coun-
                                            tries that remained resilient to a weak global growth environment have stronger fiscal
                                            and monetary policies, a better regulatory environment, a more diverse structure of
                                            exports, and more effective public institutions.

                                            Recent improvements in commodity prices have not been large enough for commodity
                                            exporters to rebuild their eroded policy buffers. Consequently, internal and external
                                            imbalances are expected to remain elevated in most commodity-exporting economies.
                                            Furthermore, capital inflows into the region have stalled, indicating tightening external
                                            financing conditions. This has put pressure on the balance of payments. With tight fi-
                                            nancing conditions, increased external strains have been met, in part, by reserve draw-
                                            downs to support currencies. This has substantially weakened the reserve positions
                                            across commodity-exporting economies.

                                            In 2016, currencies in the region have continued to perform differently. The currencies
                                            of Angola, Mozambique, and Nigeria weakened substantially, while South Africa and

                       in metal and mineral exporters (figure 2). This is because some countries undertook
                       fiscal and structural reforms to cut expenditure and increase revenue. These include

                       (Kenya, Zambia, and Togo) or widened (Ethiopia, Mali, Rwanda, and Uganda).

                                           The outlook for 2016 is expected to remain somber, reflecting the effects of weak global
                                           growth, low commodity prices, and tough domestic conditions. The growth projection
                                           for 2016 has been halved to 1.6% from 3.2% since the March 2016 issue of the World

                                           in 2017 (2.9%) and 2018 (3.6%). Growth rates will continue to be divergent across the

                     The balance of risks to the outlook remains slightly tilted to the downside. The global
                     risks include:

                     i.         a sharper than expected slowdown in China (as the country rebalances growth to
                                ward consumption and services),

                     ii.        political uncertainty following Brexit and the results of the USA election, and

                     iii.       an earlier-than-anticipated tightening cycle in the USA and the Euro Area which
                                could trigger a strong decline in capital flows to emerging and frontier markets of
                                SSA, leading to increased sovereign spreads and the volatility of heavily traded cur-
                                rencies.

                     On the domestic front, delays in adjustment to external shocks in affected countries
                     would create policy uncertainties that could weigh on investor sentiment and weaken
                     the recovery. For most countries in the region, adjusting to the low commodity prices
                     will need to include stronger efforts to strengthen domestic resource mobilization to
                     reduce the overdependence on revenue from the resource sector.

B. THE STATE OF THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY
Zambia continued to face slower growth in 2016. Tough global conditions have combined with do-
mestic challenges including power outages, tight liquidity, and limited appetite for economic reform
during the first half of 2016. Implementation of the 2016 budget has been characterized by weak
commitment control and deteriorating budget credibility. As revenues fell below target, Government
did not make the necessary expenditure adjustments, resulting in a substantial build-up of arrears.
Monetary policy has helped moderate inflation and supported exchange rate stability, but at the
price of an increased cost of borrowing, low availability of credit, and a drawdown in reserves, all of
which have added an extra drag on growth. The 2017 budget and Economic Recovery Program pro-
vide a framework to support a return to faster and more inclusive growth.



                                             Slower growth has persisted in 2016
                                             Zambia has faced tough global and domestic conditions for growth since mid-2015.
                                             Real GDP grew at a lackluster 2.9% in 2015 (figure 5), well below the average growth
                                             of 7.4% experienced between 2004 and 2014. This recent rate of expansion is also
                                             just above population growth, meaning that on average, Zambia’s per capita income
                                             growth has been flat. The tough conditions have continued in 2016 and real GDP
                                             growth is expected to remain close to 3.0% (figure 5) as both external headwinds and
                                             domestic pressures remain.

2016.
                                             Copper production picked up by 8.3% to 575,014 metric tons (mt) in the first three
                                             quarters of 2016, from 531,140 mt in the corresponding period in 2015. This was on

                                             copper mines9 (figure 6). However, production declined at the Mopani copper mine
                                             following the suspension of activities from 2015 to allow for refurbishment and the
                                             completion of expansion projects. The improved performance of the mining sector
                                             followed an easing of domestic constraints, particularly electricity. Electricity plays a
                                             strategic role in mining, while the sector consumes 54% of power supply in Zambia.

                                             The improved copper production came in spite of copper prices remaining well below
                                             their 2011 peak. In January 2016, copper prices were at US$4,471 per mt, 54.7% lower
                                             than their peak in February 2011 (their lowest since April 2009). However, since Febru-
                                             ary 2016, copper prices have recovered to US$4,726 per mt in October 2016 (figure 6).
                                             Copper prices also experienced rapid gains in November 2016 with the rally following

                     The kwacha has stabilized and slightly appreciated in recent months
                     The kwacha has continued to fluctuate against its major trading currencies, but was
                     stronger and less volatile in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 (figure
                     7). Between January and end-November 2016, the kwacha has appreciated by 10.4%
                     against the US$, 13.2% against the Euro, and 2.1% against the South African Rand.

                     Four factors have contributed to the strengthening and relative stability of the kwacha.
                     First is tight monetary policy measures introduced by the BoZ in November 2015, which
                     continued to have an impact on the market during 2016. Second is reduced demand
                     for imported goods, resulting in less demand for foreign currency. Foreign currency in-
                     flows in the first half of 2016 were US$397 million, 20.3% less than the level in the same
                     period in 201510. Third is the return of foreign interest in kwacha-denominated bonds
                     at the August 2016 auction. Fourth is a perception that the economy has weathered
                     the toughest part of the shocks and that an IMF-supported economic recovery plan is
                     likely.

                                            domestic challenges (e.g. the power crisis). Total credit extension was US$8.0 billion
                                            in the first three quarters of 2016, compared to US$8.5 billion in the same period in
                                            201512. Meanwhile, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased to 11%
                                            in June 2016 from 10% in March 2016. The most severe impact of the liquidity squeeze
                                            has reportedly been on small and medium size firms13.

                                            The BoZ has in November 2016 responded to falling inflation by introducing some

                                            lending rates unchanged. The liquidity measures include removing a once-a-week limit
                                            on commercial banks’ access to the BoZ’s overnight lending facility, ensuring that any
                                            intra-day credit automatically becomes an overnight loan, thus allowing banks to calcu-

                           While revenue collections were just a little below what was targeted in the 2016 budget,
                           there has been considerable pressure on Government’s cash flow. Implementation
                           of the 2016 budget has been characterized by weak commitment control and dete-

                           88% of budgeted levels over the first nine months of the year, this could not prevent
                           the need to make cuts to goods and services expenditure across spending agencies
                           of 20% on average. Government’s social cash transfer program, one of the key means
                           in which it can support the poorest households, was also subject to severe cuts. After
                           nine months of 2016, only 43% of budgeted resources had been received.

                           Furthermore, multi-year commitments to infrastructure spending, especially for the
                           construction of roads, could not be honored and public investment expenditure fell to
                           half the budgeted level between January and September 201615. This has stalled many

                           The expenditure pressures came in the form of election expenditures (budgeted for),
                           an unbudgeted US$350 million fuel subsidy that averaged US$39 million per month
                           in the first nine months of 2016, and an unbudgeted US$100 million subsidy to keep

                           insufficient cash available to meet planned expenditures, there has also been a huge
                           build-up of unpaid bills or arrears, as central systems to control commitments in line
                           with cash availability have been lacking (box 1). The IMF in November estimated that
                           the stock of arrears would increase by ZMW 10 billion in 2016 to approximately 9% of
                           GDP16, although the Ministry of Finance followed this statement by suggesting that a
                           verification process is required to ensure all payment claims are valid.



 Box    Large accumulation of spending arrears
 	1     Arrears had previously been an issue in Zambia, but until recently the situation had improved. For
 example, arrears reached an average of 12% of annual expenditure between 2002 and 200417, but were
 brought back under control and fell to just 1.9% of expenditure in 2009. Arrears increased again to 4.3% in
 2011, and since then have re-emerged in large amounts.

 By the end of 2015, the stock of arrears had increased to approximately ZMW 10 billion (equivalent to al-
 most 20% of spending). In 2016, the stock is estimated to have doubled to ZMW 20 billion18. The arrears
 build-up in 2016 is largely due to the late payment of road contractors, Government’s pension contribu-
 tions, and delayed payments for imported fuel and electricity. There are also unpaid VAT refunds that have
 been excluded from the ZMW 20 billion estimate.

 In addition, arrears attract interest costs, leading to Government paying increased interest bills. Arrears can
 also affect the broader economy by reducing the credit worthiness of government suppliers, which in turn
 imposes difficulties in accessing credit, thus reducing economic and employment growth.

 Zambia can work to reduce the accumulation of arrears by strengthening the legal and regulatory frame-
 work relating to commitment control, improving budget credibility, strengthening the oversight of state-
 owned enterprises, ensuring the full implementation of the IFMIS, and ensuring that the Treasury Single
 Account moves from being a statement to concrete action.19

                                           needed to ensure that once active, projects are implemented at the expected cost, on

 Box           Making every kwacha count
 	2            According to the 2015 Auditor General’s report released in October 2016, wasteful spending in-
               creased by 59.6% (in nominal terms) to ZMW 879 million (or 2.0% of the total actual spending) from
 ZMW 550 million in 2014. The wasteful spending included government payments made without a payment
 voucher, irregular payments and payments where goods and services were not delivered, failure to account
 for revenue, failure to follow procurement procedures, wasteful payments, and overpayments. This is for
 a second successive year that wasteful spending has risen following a 102.6% increase in 2014. The report
 also points to issues including outstanding arrears, failure to meet revenue targets on individual tax types,
 failure to recover domestic tax debt and failure to collect ground rent among others.23

                                            too loose and monetary policy had to shoulder the burden of adjustment, putting a

                           To support economic recovery, the Minister of Finance launched Government’s eco-
                           nomic recovery program on October 20, 2016. The plan was dubbed ‘Zambia Plus’
                           because it is being led by Zambia with support from cooperative partners (box 3). The
                           first bold action was to remove the costly subsidy on fuel prices by increasing the pump
                           prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene for the first time since July 2015. This subsidy
                           was mostly of benefit to the richest segments of society, and had become a huge drain
                           on resources, crowding developmental expenditure, including in key sectors such as
                           health and education25.




 Box     Zambia Plus
   3     The economic recovery program targets five pillars:

 Pillar 1: Moving back to a sustainable fiscal path by improving domestic resource mobilization (by strength-
 ening tax policy and administration), and cutting (and reforming) expenditure on subsidies and reallocating
 it towards productive sectors as well as to poor households.

 Pillar II: Increasing allocation to social protection including to pensioners to ensure a soft-landed transition
 to cost-reflective pricing.

 Pillar III: Cutting wastage through improved economic and fiscal governance by improving transparency
 and enforcing more punitive measures to abusers of public funds.

 Pillar IV: Improving budget credibility: Over the past few years, the variation of actual expenditures from the
 planned level has been as high as 25%, leading to over-spending in some budget lines, especially subsidies,
 and under-spending in others, particularly social protection.

 Pillar V: Promoting greater economic stability to boost market confidence and reduce constraints to pri-
 vate sector development, for example, by investing in energy and transport infrastructure; reducing costs of
 doing business; facilitating better access to credit; clearing arrears and diversifying the economy.




                           The expectation was that the 2017 budget, guided by the ‘Zambia Plus’ plan, would be
                           an austerity budget, where the amount of expenditure would be reduced26. However,
                           2017 expenditure is set to increase to ZMW 61.4 billion from ZMW 50.4 billion budg-

2017 (on a cash
basis).                    The Minister of Finance stressed the need to curb the accumulation of arrears and to
                           start dismantling the stock. It is for this reason that there will not be a larger reduction
                           in the fiscal deficit in 2017 on a cash basis). The plan hints at a move to ‘fiscal fitness’

                                            The macroeconomic targets set in the 2017 budget include a fiscal deficit of 7% (cash
                                            basis), end-year inflation of 9% and domestic revenue of at least 18%. Further, Govern-
                                            ment plans to limit domestic borrowing to 2% of GDP and increase foreign exchange
                                            reserves to three months of import cover. Despite the widespread talk of austerity, the
                                            national budget provided additional resources for education, health, social protection
                                            and agriculture.

(FSIP).               Agriculture received a substantial increase in resources via an expansion of the Farm-
                      ers Input Support Program (FSIP) to provide ZMW 1,700 to 1.6 million farmers at the
                      start of the 2017-18 farming season. To finance this, the FSIP budget is being increased
                      by 160% to ZMW 2.86 billion. Crucially, the increased FSIP resource allocation coincides
                      with a full shift to the electronic voucher system that is intended to allow farmers to
                      select the inputs they would like, and to support farming beyond maize. A recent pilot
                      suggests there are still challenges to overcome, including targeting, but there is poten-
                      tial for large financial savings when compared to the traditional system where Govern-
                      ment procured and transported inputs directly to famers27. The allocation for the Food
                      Reserve Agency is also up by 14% to ZMW 942 million in 2017.

                      sides have been eliminated and Government has re-announced its intention to remove
                      the electricity subsidy. The remaining financing gap is filled by borrowing and an in-
                      crease in domestic revenue collection. New revenue measures have been introduced
                      to bring greater fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Tax policy changes include

                      derpinnings to these reforms can be legislated on a timely basis. At least ten pieces of
                      legislation require adjustment to permit these reforms to move forward.

                      Public debt levels remain elevated
                      During the budget address, the Minister stated: “We cannot spend what we do not have.
                      We cannot borrow beyond our ability to repay”28. This is because debt levels remain el-
                      evated in 2016, as repeat fiscal deficits between 2012 and 2015 were financed by ex-
                      ternal non-concessional borrowing. In July 2015, Zambia issued its third Eurobond for
                      US$1.25 billion (with an average tenor of 11 years) at a considerably higher cost than
                      previous issues (the yield at issue was 9.375%). The Eurobond issues now total US$3
                      billion and have sharply increased overall debt levels. The Eurobonds are associated
                      with repayment risks, given the bullet structure of the first two bonds (they each need
                      to be repaid in one single year) and foreign currency risks29.

                      Large exchange rate depreciations carry the risk of balance sheet effects, especially
                      where there is substantial offshore foreign currency borrowing by Government and
                      corporations. Foreign currency risks became a reality in Zambia in 2015, as a weaker

                                            However, non-bank financial institutions increased their participation in Q1 2016 and

                                            May 12, 2016. Overall, Treasury Bills were undersubscribed by 52.2% between January

                                            than their level at the same time in 2015. As a result, total trade (exports plus imports)
                                            over the first three quarters of 2016 was US$9,751 million compared to US$11,334 mil-

                                            Zambia has recorded quarterly trade deficits since Q1 2015, but the trade deficit has
                                            narrowed by 14% in the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the same period
                                            in 2015. This has come about through a painful adjustment where imports have de-
                                            creased in 2016 and an overall reduction in trade volumes.

                                            Falling exports have also reduced the inflow of foreign currency. Data from the BoZ
                                            suggest that the inflow of foreign currency in the first half of 2016 was US$397 million
                                            compared to US$499 million during the same period in 201532. On the other hand, the
                                            outflow of foreign currency was US$1,065 million in the first six months of 2016 com-
                                            pared to US$829 million in 2015. Of the outflows, 34.0% relates to external public debt
                                            servicing, 4.5% to other uses by Government (including the importation of electricity
                                            and fuel), 33% to transactions by non-government entities, and 28.1% was used by BoZ

C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, RISKS AND POLICY CHALLENGES
Given the tough global conditions for growth and domestic challenges, GDP growth is forecast to
remain close to 3.0% in 2016, before improving in 2017 (4.0%) and 2018 (4.2%). The 2017 forecast
assumes progress with the economic recovery plan, a better electricity situation than in 2015/2016
and improved copper exports. For the medium term, it assumes even higher copper production, that
copper prices will recover marginally, and that progress is made with structural reforms identified in
the 2017 budget. To shift to faster and inclusive growth, efforts are needed to overcome a set of in-
terlinked economic policy challenges – if progress is made on only some of them, and not on others,
the desired outcomes will not be achieved. The sequencing and coordination of measures are key in
2017 and over the course of a medium-term economic recovery plan.

D. REVENUE PERFORMANCE

Both public spending and revenues have grown considerably since 2010, but in recent years the pace
of expenditure has exceeded that of revenue. If current levels of government expenditure are to be
maintained in a sustainable manner, then higher domestic revenue collections are essential. After
ten years of rapid growth Zambia has emerged from being a country with a high aid dependency to
one where in 2015 grants provided just 1.4% of revenue compared to 98.6% domestic revenues.

                        The 2017 budget and ‘Zambia Plus’ economic recovery program have put an emphasis
                        on the need to improve domestic revenue collection. Repeat and large fiscal deficits

                        There are mixed perceptions about taxation and public spending in Zambia. One view
                        is that taxes are too high, while another is that expenditure should not be reduced and

                                             Zambia needs to calibrate carefully how much revenue is required for its development
                                             goals and to ensure this analysis feeds into the revenue policy and the administra-

                                             responsible for revenue collection and policy (box 4). This sort of assessment needs
                                             to feed into Zambia’s development planning, and the expenditure needs matched to
                                             realistic revenue scenarios. The current target is ‘at least 18%’ of GDP, but there is no

 Box      Who manages domestic revenue?
 	4       The Zambia Revenue Authority is tasked with tax collection, administration, compliance and enforce-
 ment via its operations and inspections. Operations are split into Domestic Taxes and Customs Services. The
 ZRA is governed by an Act of Parliament, Chapter 321 of the Laws of Zambia enacted in 1993. Under this
 law, it produces an annual report for Parliament. A few large taxpayers, especially from the mining sector,
 dominate collection in Zambia and consequently the ZRA has a large taxpayers unit.

 The Ministry of Finance is responsible for formulating revenue policy (both tax and to some extent non-tax
 revenues). Each year, tax policies are reviewed by a Tax Policy Review Committee, brought together by the
 Ministry of Finance, with the aim of optimizing revenue collection in the most cost-efficient and professional
 manner possible. The revenue targets are set by the Minister of Finance and approved by Parliament.

 The following laws govern the collection of revenue:
 •	      Income Tax Act, Chapter 323 of the Laws of Zambia;
 •	      Customs and Excise Act, Chapter 322 of the Laws of Zambia
 •	      Value Added Tax Act, Chapter 331 of the Laws of Zambia;
 •	      Property Transfer Tax Act, Chapter 340 of the Laws of Zambia; and
 •	      Mines and Minerals Development Act, No. 7 of 2008.

                                             As revenue collection has improved, it has also become more cost-effective. Since
                                             2013, the ratio of the ZRAs budget to total revenue collected has decreased from ZMW
                                             2 spent for every kwacha collected, to ZMW 1.4 in 2015, in spite of the slower economic
                                             growth that year.

                                             2017 budget revenue targets
                                             The Minister of Finance set a revenue target of at least 18% of GDP in 2017, with the
                                             aim of limiting the fiscal deficit to 7% of GDP while dismantling some of the arrears that
                                             built up in 2015 and 2016. This target removes the ambition of the previous budget
                                             to increase revenues as a percentage of GDP, and instead settles for a similar level of
                                             collection recorded in 2014 and 2015. Non-revenue targets for 2017 are much more
                                             realistic than for 2016 (down by nearly ZMW 4 billion) and an increase of ZMW 4.8 bil-
                                             lion or 16% is expected from tax revenue, via new tax measures and efforts to improve
                                             compliance (table 4)39.

                                             To achieve this target, the allocation of resources to ZRA is being increased from ZMW
                                             427 million in 2016 (which appears as if it will be received in full) to ZMW 769 million in
                                             2017; an increase of 80%. However, only ZMW 100 million is expected to be available to
                                             fund new operational capacity. Much of the increase relates to the establishment of a
                                             pension fund and a gratuity fund (ZMW 150 million) and to cover exchange rate losses

E. MINING REVENUE

The absence of good data on mining companies has helped support a common perception that not much
revenue is being collected from them in Zambia. The reality is that the mining sector (which includes quarry-
ing and cement production) contributed ZMW 8.8 billion in 2014, equivalent to 28% of total domestic revenue,
up from ZMW 7.7 billion in 2013 and ZMW 7.6 billion in 2012. There remains a pressing need for an improved
flow of information and transparency to ensure the contribution of the sector is better understood. Efforts are
also needed to improve the monitoring of the country’s mineral value chain from exploration to export, and to
ensure that at the given rates, Zambia collects the revenues it is due.


                          The lack of quality data has been a huge barrier to an improved understanding of the
                          contribution made by the mining sector in Zambia. However, the Zambia Extractives

F. PLANNED REVENUE REFORMS AND CHALLENGES
There have been many revenue related reforms over the past few years, and some are still ongoing
or planned for the future. The reforms are aimed not only at increasing revenue collection, but also
ensuring that collection is efficient and free from corruption. A recent assessment cites compliance
as one of the weakest areas in Zambia’s tax administration system. Key efforts to tackle this problem
include the TaxOnline system, more enforcement measures and audits, and the introduction of Elec-
tronic Fiscal Devices (EFD) that link retailers directly to the ZRA.

                        The tax administration system has been improving
                        At the request of the ZRA, an assessment of Zambia’s tax administration system was
                        undertaken in May 2016. The Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT)
                        was used45. The aim of the assessment was to help determine reform priorities and

                        The study also listed a number of areas where reform should be targeted. The assess-

                        refund claims. They also found that the database of registered taxpayers contained
                        inaccuracies, including a large number of inactive taxpayers. These issues point towards
                        generally low taxpayer compliance. Furthermore, the systems used to manage and ana-

                                            While the ZRA is making an effort to improve taxpayer education, taxation remains
                                            complicated and insufficiently understood in Zambia. From a survey conducted in 2014
                                            (including 22 large tax payers), ZIPAR concluded that tax literacy is low. They found that
                                            the respondents interviewed had limited knowledge of tax and the tax system in Zam-

                                            cation is effective46. ZIPAR suggested that more workshops and seminars are needed
                                            and that the ZRA website needs to be improved as a source of information and guid-
                                            ance. The more complicated and difficult it is to assess tax obligations, the more likely
                                            they will be evaded. Communication is very important when it comes to tax systems
                                            and can be a key driver of improving compliance.

                                            via exemptions from indirect taxes, while goods that harm people’s health, such as
                                            cigarettes and alcohol, can be made more expensive as a disincentive for consumption.
                                            Fourth is representation. The payment of taxes is more likely to motivate citizens to
                                            hold Government accountable for the resources it manages on behalf of its people, as
                                            well as the spending it carries out on their behalf.

                                            Tackling compliance
                                            The TADAT assessment cites compliance issues as one of the weakest areas in Zambia’s
                                            tax administration system. Efforts have been made to try and improve compliance, but
                                            a large gap remains. In 2015, the ZRA undertook various enforcement activities and
                                            managed to increase the number of compliance issues it detected, as well as the value
                                            of these cases (up by 234% to ZMW 899 million in 2015). The majority of cases handled

                                            dominate revenue collections, providing 80% of revenues. Medium taxpayers (around
                                            10,000) typically provide a further 15% of revenues. Small taxpayers (over 100,000) typi-

                       Efforts to improve tax collection are more likely to yield substantial resources if they

                       taxes; this is two places down from its rank of 56th in 2016, but the scoring remains
                       very similar (i.e. other countries have improved)48. A gain has been made since 2014
                       because Zambia has simplified its tax system to improve tax compliance, although it still
                       remains relatively complex. An important development has been TaxOnline. However,
                       the compliance rate for using TaxOnline needs to be tackled if the full benefits are to
                       be realized.

                       A key reform to support the collection of revenues from medium-size taxpayers regis-
                       tered for VAT purposes is the use of EFD that are linked via a SIM card to the ZRA. This

Zambia.                ramp up, and revenue flows results may only improve considerably over the medium
                       term.

                       New revenue areas
                       Road tolls were recently introduced in Zambia, and in November 2016, Government
                       announced that the toll rate would be doubled and additional roads would be tolled.
                       The premise for this is that the funds collected can be channelled towards road mainte-
                       nance activities to increase the life of the road, as well as to provide a potential revenue
                       stream for road expansion via public private partnerships.

                       Another key area that remains in its infancy is property tax. Very little property tax is
                       being collected in Zambia, as is the case in many other African countries (box 5). While
                       the 2016 budget did target increased revenue from property tax, no systems were put
                       in place to reach the targets. There remains a need to value properties and to do so
                       every five years, especially in a rapidly growing city like Lusaka. Property tax in Zambia
                       is administered by local councils and levied on the value of capital-improved land. This
                       is an important revenue source for local councils, but the collection and enforcement
                       of property tax has been poor. The reasons cited for this are a lack of capacity, unclear
                       property rights, and an old value base49.

  Box Challenges with Property Tax	
    5
              Property tax as a percentage of GDP averages 0.6% in developing countries, and 0.5% in Sub-Saharan
  Africa51; while in Zambia just 0.1% of GDP is collected. This suggests that there are gains to be made, but
  expectations need to be managed given the challenges developing countries face in this area.

  There are three common challenges. First is resistance by vested political and economic elites, and investors
  in property markets. Fair enforcement is key to improving property tax collection. Residents are unlikely to
  comply if they are not confident that their neighbor pay their fair share, irrespective of their political affili-
  ation and economic influence. Persuasion can also enhance compliance. For example, Rwanda, Tanzania,
  and Uganda hold annual taxpayers’ appreciation week, when the benefits of paying tax are communicated
  to the public.

  Second is inefficiency, which results from the level at which the taxes are collected or the methods of collec-
  tion. In Botswana, Malawi, and Tanzania, property tax assessment and collection has been sub-contracted to
  the private sector. This often improves collection, but at the expense of building amicable community rela-
  tions and state-building. Implementing the use of technology, such as mobile payments, can also increase
  collection, as has been the case in Kenya and Tanzania.

  Third is the low level of land titling. In Africa, land is largely owned by the state or is under customary land
  rights, making it difficult to tax. In Zambia, only 200,000 land titles exist. In 2017, Government will begin a
  pilot program to title land in Lusaka. A good example to emulate is Rwanda, where between 2008 and No-
  vember 2016, 8.4 million titles had been created and digitalized.

                                            Are tax incentives being used effectively?
                                            Tax incentives have been used in Zambia with the intention of attracting foreign direct
                                            investment (FDI) to generate employment and enhance economic growth. The Zambia
                                            Development Agency (ZDA) is responsible for promoting investment in the country, and
                                            administers the investment with other Government entities. For a firm to receive a tax
                                            incentive in Zambia, the Ministry of Finance (with the mandate for tax policy) makes
                                            a decision that is processed via a Statutory Instrument, or approved via the national
                                            budget. Both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry
                                            are empowered with respect to tax incentives via their respective legislation. There is

G. IDEAS TO IMPROVE TAX POLICY AND REVENUE ADMINISTRATION
Efforts are needed to ensure there is sufficient revenue to fund Government spending. There are two
key areas in which Government is working. The first is on improving tax policy, which falls under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and the second is improving tax administration, which falls
under the responsibility of the ZRA.


                        Extensive advice can already be found in the numerous documents and briefings pro-
                        vided on the Zambian revenues situation (many of which are quoted in this Brief). This
Communication           section does not aim to include them all, but does suggest that the priority issues could
is very important       be guided by the following.
when it comes
to tax systems          Many of the planned reforms and other compliance drives are expected to yield results,
and can be a key        but this expectation should be cautioned by the reality that activities often take time to

                        Improved tax policy ideas
                        By using the revenue data available, tax policy can become much better informed.
                        There is much more data available since TaxOnline has been established, and it can be
                        interfaced with other sources of data, such as the Labour Force Survey or Living Con-
                        ditions Monitoring Survey, to better understand what types of households are being
                        taxed and at what levels.

                        Three important studies for 2017 to inform tax policy are:

                        i.     Tax gap study: Carry out a full review of tax base erosion to understand the extent
                               of the tax gap and whether it is driven by non-filing or underreporting. This will then
                               inform the most appropriate policy response to address the tax gap.

                        ii.    Tax exemptions analysis: List and evaluate the costs and benefits of current
                               incentives. This analysis can be used to develop an incentive policy framework (as
Efforts to improve             part of a broader investment strategy) that is made public and that lists the differ-
monitoring of the              ent incentives offered. The results of the analysis should feed into a clear and

exploration to
export need to be
expanded.               iii.   Marginal Effective Tax Rates (METR) study: Carry out a study aimed at un-
                               derstanding whether the revenue gains from a marginal tax increase would
                               outweigh the potential loss of revenue.

                        Improved tax administration ideas
                        Four ideas for improving tax administration are as follows:

                        i.     Provide a strategy to increase tax compliance: The large payers unit in ZRA
                               is already making good progress, so one of the core areas for attention for im-
                               proving compliance relates to medium-size tax payers. Here the planned in-
                                troduction of Electronic Fiscal Devices and wider use of electronic filing via the Tax-
                                Online system is expected to yield results in 2017 and over the medium term.
                               However, a clear strategy would help guide the use of resources, make compari-
                               sons between competing ideas to ensure the most cost-effective option is pur-
                               sued, and might also motivate increased resources and staffing for revenue col-
                                lection.

                        ii.    Scaling up taxpayer-focused public education campaigns: While the ZRA is
                               making an effort to improve taxpayer education, taxation remains complicated and
                               insufficiently understood in Zambia. Communication is very important when it
                               comes to tax systems and can be a key driver of improving compliance. To encour-
                               age citizens to pay taxes there needs to be better understanding, and a sense of
                               trust that public resources are being used effectively. Government can partner
                               with civil society organizations in these campaigns.

                                                                                                                                                     33

                                             iii.          Design and build an effective system for property tax: It is not enough
                                                           to simply target increased revenue in this area; efforts are needed to build a
                                                           system. For example, much work is needed related to land titling and valuation.
                                                           A good starting point is to review how other countries have progressed.

                                             v.           Improving transparency in reporting mineral revenue: Efforts to improve
                                                          monitoring of the country’s mineral value chain from exploration to export need
                                                          to be expanded. This will ensure that at the given rates, Zambia collects the
                                                          revenues itis due.
