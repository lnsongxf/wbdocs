      Background


      infoDev, a global trust fund program in the World Bank Group, supports
      growth-oriented entrepreneurs through creative and path-breaking
      venture enablers such as incubators and accelerators. It also assists
      entrepreneurs with securing appropriate early-stage financing and
      convenes entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, mentors, and other
      key innovation ecosystem stakeholders for dialogue and action.

2. LEARNING OBJECTIVE




 The objective of this practical guide is to provide a
 tool for interested parties on how to plan, organize,
 implement, and evaluate a Mobile Innovation
 Roadshow. The guide presents a generic methodology
 that can be used in any country context. It provides
 lessons and best practices based on the experiences
 of implementing Mobile Innovation Roadshows in four
 countries in Southern Africa: Mozambique, Botswana,
 Namibia, and Zambia. While this guide can be used
 as a foundation for all countries, the planning and
 implementation should always be adapted to the
 local situation, as each country context is unique and
 requires tailor-made solutions.

 After studying this guide, the reader should:

     know what a Mobile Innovation Roadshow is
  and what its components are;
     understand the specific objectives of a Mobile
  Innovation Roadshow;
     be aware of the organizing framework of a
  Mobile Innovation Roadshow and the necessary
  planning steps;
     know how the different events of a Mobile
  Innovation Roadshow are implemented;
     have knowledge of the options for evaluating
  the events of a Mobile Innovation Roadshow and
  for organizing follow-up events to increase the
  effectiveness and impact on the local mobile
  innovation ecosystem.

Mobile Innovation Bootcamp

To provide complementary support to Hackathon
participants as well as to stimulate their continued
interest in mobile innovation and entrepreneurship,
a one-day training is organized for registered
participants prior to the Hackathon. The training
focuses on the following key topics:

  global/local mobile market: current opportunities
  and growth potential;
  “you have an idea. Do you have a mobile application?”
   —how to turn ideas into apps;
   building a team;
   bringing your app to market;
   understanding your business model.

Technical training on mobile programming and design
can potentially be organized as follow-up activities
with longer duration and comprehensive training
curricula. The Bootcamp should be delivered by a
serial entrepreneur and/or recognized mentor with
hands-on experience working with technology/mobile
startup companies. The trainer can be identified at
in-country level (for instance, a local tech community
leader), or at the regional or international levels (e.g.,
from among regional or international experts).



Mobile Innovation Hackathon

The Hackathon sums up the Roadshow and focuses on
achieving the following goals:

   converting promising ideas into mobile application
    prototypes;
  further increasing awareness amongst the technical
   community, especially youth, with regard to the
   opportunities for mobile entrepreneurship;
   providing a general overview of the mobile
   innovations talent pool.

It consists of a two-day event where participants work
on the development of a concrete idea for a mobile
application with the aim to bring it to the market. The
first day is organized as a developer contest and the
second day focuses on idea pitching.

        METHODOLOGY

     This guide is based on the results of the Mobile Innovation Roadshow Outcome
     Assessment, background documents provided by infoDev as well as various
     lessons learned from interviews with relevant stakeholders such as the local
     SAIS managers. The Outcome Assessment was conducted in order to identify
     and analyze the effects of the Mobile Innovation Roadshows implemented thus
     far, including direct short-term and mid-term effects on participants and the
     mobile innovation ecosystem of participants’ countries of origin. You will find the
     Outcome Assessment as an Annex to this guide.
