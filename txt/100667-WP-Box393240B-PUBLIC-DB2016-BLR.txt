THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 9,470,000

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 44

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 43*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

                    capital deposit at a bank before registration.
                    Belarus made starting a business simpler by expanding the
DB2016              geographic coverage of online registration and improving
                    online services.

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?
Underlying the indicators shown in this chapter for
                                                               STANDARDIZED COMPANY
Belarus is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Private Limited Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and             Paid-in minimum capital requirement: EUR 1
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available           City: Minsk
information on business entry in that economy.
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Business registration with the State Registry

       In order to register a new business entity it is necessary to apply to
       State Registration Authority with an application form and Articles of
       Association. The application form includes proposed company name (3
       variants), as well as, biographical data on company directors and other
       company particulars. A Private Limited Company is no longer required
       to have a Memorandum of Association.

       The registration may be submitted either in person or electronically.
       Following 2014 reform of company registration procedures, in person
       applicants are registered online by government personnel. Registration
       must be completed within 1 day by law.

       Online business registration is free of charge, but in order to submit a                     BYR 540,000

       registration application via web portal, it is necessary for the applicant
       to have a pre-approved electronic signature, which carries an additional
       expense. As such many companies chose to register in person. In
       person registration costs 3 base units. Since January 2015 the cost of
       the base unit is BYR 180,000, therefore in person registration costs BYR
       540,000.

       The State Registration Authority automatically informs state agencies -
       tax agencies, state insurance agency RUP "Belgosstrakh", statistics
       agency, Social Security Fund - of new company's registration within 5
       working days (7 calendar days).

        Open a regular bank account and deposit statutory funds

        Most new businesses elect to open a bank account as part of starting a
        business process in Belarus. By Law, companies must deposit any
        amount of funds as share capital in a corporate bank account. And, as
        of May 01, 2013, based on Article 7 of Regulations on State Registration
        of Entrepreneurs, adopted by the Decree of the President of the
        Republic of Belarus No 2. dated January 24, 2012, the share capital of
        the Company shall be paid in full within a period of 12 months from the
        date of company registration.

        Under Article 2.4 of the Regulation on State Registration of
        Entrepreneurs, after opening the regular bank account, the Company
        shall not submit any notices (with bank account details) to Social
        Security Fund, Insurance and Tax authorities. It is the bank that should
        notify the aforesaid agencies about the Company's opening of a bank
        account.

        Make a company seal

        There are no laws requiring a business to purchase company seal.
        However, the company seal is required for consignment notes and for
        certain bank transactions and power of attorney. Government agencies,
        such as the tax authority, would have no legal grounds for refusing
        documents that do not have a company seal. Nevertheless out of habit,                  BYR 100,000-

        most limited liability companies would purchase a seal. In addition, for                 200,000
        the purpose of opening a bank account, it is required to make a
        company seal.

        Obtain a decision of the Minsk City Executive Committee
        permitting project design and construction works on a given
        land plot

        To start construction, BuildCo must receive the Minsk City
        Executive Committee’s decision to elaborate on design
        documentation. The permission letter states the main
        requirements for the intended building and lists the agencies
        and the institutions where additional technical requirements
        must be obtained. The request form must contain a brief
        description of the intended building project and company
        documents.

        On April 26, 2007 the Minsk City Municipality passed Decision #
        859 according to which applicants can choose to obtain technical
        conditions or request the Centre of Engineering Services to
        obtain them on behalf of the applicant. Prior to this reform, the
        Centre used to be under the Department of Technical Conditions
   1    of the Committee of Architecture and City Construction. Now the          30 days              no charge
        Centre operates as a semi-private entity and if the work load
        increases, it can recruit additional human resources.

        After the documents are submitted to the Reception Desk they
        are forwarded to the respective departments, and if the applicant
        wishes to obtain the technical conditions through the Centre, the
        documents are directed internally to the Centre.

        All service providers that issue technical conditions have a time
        limit of 7 working days during which the approvals must be
        granted. All the approvals can be obtained in parallel. The
        services that are involved and would be required for BuildCo’s
        case are: water/sewage, telephone, sanitary epidemiological
        authority, ecological department and fire safety. By law all
        technical conditions are granted free of charge. However, if it is
        done through the Centre for Engineering Services there is a fee -
        - for BuildCo's case, it would be approximately BYR 1,000,000.00.

      works. The following documents must be submitted:

      •        Decision of Minsk City Executive Committee on
      permission of construction;
      •        Positive conclusion of the state examination of the

      •        Decision on the approval of the project documentation;
      •        Payment order confirming the transfer of the fees
      payable from the cost of construction and installation work.

      The construction permit is granted within 3 working days
      according to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of Belarus
      No.156 of February 17, 2012 "On approval of a single

      of the construction and engineering works for projects with
      private sector financing. For construction projects with an
      estimated duration of 12 months or less, an advance payment of
      50% of the total estimated amount of the payment must be paid
      during the application for construction permit. The remaining
      50% of the fees is paid before obtaining the occupancy permit.
      The payment is done at the bank, and a receipt is submitted to
      the Inspection. The duration of the construction works for the
      case study warehouse is assumed to be 30 weeks; therefore, 50%
      of the construction and installation costs have to be paid at the

        New buildings cannot be registered without first receiving an
        inspection from a technical inventory specialist who completes a
        technical passport. There are approximately 120 technical
        inventory specialists in the city of Minsk.

        To register the building upon completing construction, BuildCo
        must apply to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar authenticates
        the documents and issues a decision.

        The registration of the warehouse and the title on the warehouse
        are governed by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the
        Republic of Belarus of 17.02.2012 № 156 "On Approval of the
        unified list of administrative procedures carried out by public
        bodies and other organizations in relation to legal entities and

        State registration of a title over constructed buildings is a
        separate administrative procedure from the state registration of
        the new building. BuildCo can apply for it whether
        simultaneously with registration of building or after the building
        has been properly registered. In practice, it is common to bring
        an application for both building registration and registration of a
        title over it.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                    creditor rights in bankruptcy.

                    to pay for the registration.
                    Belarus improved its insolvency process through a new

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
