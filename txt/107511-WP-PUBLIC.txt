               TOWARD DEVELOPING UNSUITABILITY GUIDELINES FOR CREDIT PROVISION




1. 	   Overview
Consumer lending in India has rapidly expanded in the past decade and has been motivated by a strong
focus on financial inclusion, services a large number rural, low-income clients with little former formal
financial sector experience. There is a strong imperative for customer protection norms to accompany this
rapid growth, to sustain the benefits of financial inclusion that accrue to customers, communities, and the
larger economy. Through this research we seek to inform and facilitate the development of guidelines for
suitable credit delivery to low-income households—guidelines that will help to prevent adverse outcomes
to borrowers that might arise from an unsuitable sale.

We collect rich primary data through repeated structured interviews with 411 rural households in Tamil
Nadu. The analysis of primary data and additional analysis of secondary data reveal that these households
are active users of both formal and informal financial services, more so than the average. Further, we
oversample microcredit borrowers to ensure adequate representation of various products and practices
that dominate microlending in India today. Specifically on microcredit, sample respondents reported a
variety of contract features—including longer tenures, both weekly and monthly repayment schedules and
loans with variable equated monthly installments (EMIs) that allow customer to front-load prepayments.
Respondents also reported borrowing from multiple sources of institutional and informal credit, often at the
same time.

We find that 13 percent of sample households (both JLG borrowers and nonusers) were carrying unaffordable
levels of debt, where monthly repayment obligations were in excess of their income and to meet all these
repayments in full and on-time, borrowers would need to make costly adjustments including reductions in
consumption expenditure beyond a reasonable minimum living standard. Simulating a retrospective debt
affordability assessment to a subset of loans disbursed in the later months of the study’s observation, we find
that nearly 61 percent of those loans, though they were received at a time of need (and some proportion
of these loans would be used to repay other loans), left households worse off, strictly in a cash flow sense—as
per estimates at the point of sale, borrowers did not have the means to service the repayments on these
loans through their natural cash flows. We also present evidence of over-indebted households drawing
down their savings, selling assets (livestock, land) and taking on much more debt to ease cash flows and
finance repayments.

Further, we believe that by construction, this measure would underestimate over-indebtedness. Some formal
loans (such as the popular jewel loan) and many informal loans have flexible repayment schedules—loan
tenures or repayments frequencies are not specified, sometimes both. If our calculations were to assume
that households would service all outstanding loans as if through EMI-style monthly repayments, cases of
debt unaffordability would rise. Our current analysis also does not account for the seasonality of income
flows over the year nor the differences in income frequency within a month. Both of these are critical
elements of product suitability and the affordability of repayments, although effective savings products
could smoothen away some of the distress.

The research presented in this report raises several questions for further investigation, most saliently on the
impact of access to microcredit on borrowers’ resilience vis-à-vis the vulnerability of debt entrapment. Early
insights suggest that both these impacts would be heterogeneous and among many other factors, local
financial sector development (of credit, savings, and insurance) and practices will significantly influence
borrowers’ vulnerability to negative outcomes.

Though this research will continue to be updated over several months, there are several early takeaways for
practitioners and policymakers. First, we present unique evidence on the level and qualities of debt-induced
financial distress among microcredit borrowers, while also representing the local financial sector context in
which similar levels might be expected. Second, teams monitoring and regulating over-lending, we find that
publicly available data, when well triangulated, might be a helpful tool to focus further monitoring efforts.

                                                                                            	1
WORKING PAPER



Third, we explore the construction of a debt affordability assessment for low-income borrowers and in future
outputs from this research, will seek to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such an approach. We
call for researchers and practitioners in the larger financial inclusion community to consider replications
similar to debt affordability measurement in their own contexts—many of the fundamental implementation
challenges such as the need for high-quality credit information, the need to standardize well-developed
tools and adequately train loan officers, and the informality and volatility of incomes for low-income
households are similar across several countries, and there is a tremendous opportunity for insightful research
to inform international financial inclusion practice and customer protection policy.




2. 	 Policy Motivation
The motivation for this work stems from the current state of consumer lending in India which is rapidly expanding
and increasingly providing access to credit to rural households in India. Where there is an imperative for
strong customer protection norms to accompany such strong growth, it is unclear whether the existing
regime is adequate in protecting households, particularly in rural India, from adverse financial outcomes.
The following subsections elaborate on the inadequacies and present the rationale for developing suitability
guidelines for more responsible credit provision.


2.1. 	 Consumer lending in India
The penetration of formal credit penetration in India remains low and dominated by the joint-liability group
(JLG) loan product. This is mostly sold through the regulated channel of microfinance institutions (MFIs), but
also other nonbank financial companies (NBFCs).

With a gross loan portfolio of Rs.              Figure 1.	      MFI Lending in India
57 billion, Tamil Nadu (TN) ended
FY 2015 as the second largest
microcredit market in India, second
only to West Bengal at Rs. 60 billion.
Sector reports analysing the growth
pattern in top states have drawn
attention to the deepening of                       Average outstanding
                                                         loan per client
client relationships as the key driver
of growth in several top states,1 over
branch expansion or new client                        Clients pre branch
acquisitions. Consider for example
that the loan portfolio grew by 51                   Loan disbursed per
percent in TN and 67 percent in                 branch (in Rs. thousands)
Karnataka (two states adjacent to
                                                    Number of clients per
our study location), primarily driven                         employee
by equivalent or higher increases in
loan disbursement, followed by the                    Loan disbursed per
addition of new clients in existing                     employee (in Rs.
                                                              thousands)
service areas.                                                              10,000 20,000   30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000

2.2. 	 Existing customer protection norms for credit provision in India
Current norms to protect customers of microfinance products through the NBFC-MFI channel are governed
primarily by the regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI).


2.2.1. Regulatory guidelines
The latest RBI Master Circular on NBFC-MFIs3 defines the following guidelines on customer protection:

   •	 Caps on loan price
       ▫	 Loan price margin not to exceed 10 percent for large MFIs (loan portfolios exceeding Rs. 100
          crore) and 12 percent for others.
       ▫	 Interest rate to be lower of (a) the cost of funds plus margin (b) average base rate of the five
          largest commercial banks (advised by RBI every quarter) by assets multiplied by 2.75.

WORKING PAPER



    •	 Caps on loan size and tenure
        ▫	 Loans to be disbursed to rural households with income not exceeding Rs. 1 lakh, and urban and
           semi-urban households with income not exceeding Rs. 60,000.
        ▫	 Loan amount not to exceed Rs. 60,000 in first cycle and Rs. 1 lakh in subsequent cycles.
        ▫	 Total indebtedness not to exceed Rs. 1 lakh (loans toward meeting education and medical
           expenses shall be excluded in indebtedness calculation).
        ▫	 Tenure not to be less than 24 months for loan amounts in excess of Rs. 15 thousand with prepayment
           penalty.
    •	 Caps on loans per borrower
        ▫	 Borrower cannot be a member of more than one SHG/JLG.
        ▫	 Not more than two NBFC-MFIs should lend to the same borrower.
    •	 Repayment
        ▫	 Minimum period of moratorium between disbursement and due date for repayment of first
           installment should be less than then frequency of repayment.
        ▫	 Loan is repayable on weekly, fortnightly or monthly installments at the choice of borrower.
    •	 Loan use
         ▫	 Aggregate amount of loans given for income generation should not be less than 50 percent of
            disbursed.

2.2.2. Credit bureau reporting norms

In compliance, MFIs are mandated to report all new loan applicants to a credit bureau and confirm their
loan eligibility before approving or disbursing a loan.4 While specific weaknesses in the authentication and
updation of credit information continue to persist, almost all MFIs have implemented these norms.

Credit bureaus also track, aggregate and frequently report the incidence of non-compliant inquires, i.e.,
potential loan applications that were rejected on the basis that the applicant already held active loans in
excess of the lending limit or was in default of one or more loans.

As per data reported in 2015,5 Tamil Nadu ranked second in the incidence of noncompliant loan applications
when 8.57 percent of the inquiries submitted were rejected, alongside Maharashtra (8.97 percent) and
Karnataka (8.55 percent). Comparable market segments that had similar statistics were districts with 26–30
MFIs (8.84 percent), the top 50 districts as ranked by the number of borrowers (9.28 percent) and the next
50 districts (8.39 percent).

2.2.3. Self-regulatory norms

Two self-regulatory organisations, M-FIN and Sa-Dhan, as RBI-approved industry associations6 are also
responsible for ensuring customer protection measures through adherence to a Code of Conduct. The
latest Code of Conduct for the Microfinance Industry7 includes norms on “avoiding over-indebtedness”
including self-regulating commitments as MFIs to:

               TOWARD DEVELOPING UNSUITABILITY GUIDELINES FOR CREDIT PROVISION



  1.	 Conduct proper due diligence to assess the need and repayment capacity of client and make loans
      commensurate with the client’s ability to repay
  2.	 Not be the third lender to a client
  3.	 Not breach the debt limit prescribed by RBI (the regulator)
  4.	 Restrict the loan amount disbursed to Rs. 60,000 per borrower for loans on the basis of joint-liability, with
      the possibility of exceeding the limit as long as long is given out on an individual basis
  5.	 Carry out test checks of efficacy of processes relating to avoidance of over-indebtedness
  6.	 Reduce errors in identification through Aadhaar-based KYC


2.3. 	 Inadequacies of the current customer protection regime
In the current regime, there are several aspects that may not adequately safeguard customers of JLG
loans from adverse financial outcomes, which are highlighted as follows. There is increasing evidence from
the industry about these inadequacies manifesting in adverse client outcomes, sometimes to an extreme
degree.

Debt affordability

  •	 Assessment based on credit bureau checks: The assessment of debt affordability when carried out
     through querying the credit bureau profiles of customers provides an incomplete at best picture
     of household indebtedness. While there has been a recent significant regulatory development to
     mandate reporting of the SHG channel, bureau information remains far from a complete picture when
     informal credit constitutes a large part of household indebtedness in rural India.
  •	 Restrictions based on caps and limits: The regulatory and self-regulatory norms specify thresholds which
     seem fairly arbitrary and may not be applicable to the situations of different borrowers with a variety
     of income profiles and situated in different regional locations. The hard caps on loan amounts and
     number of active loans could exclude households with otherwise genuine needs and ability to repay.
     Conversely, such stark restrictions this could also lead providers to “lend to the limit” without assessing
     debt affordability in more meaningful ways. Ultimately, such lending restrictions based on caps and
     limits could create incentives for provider misreporting and borrower KYC manipulation, resulting in
     over-borrowing and issues like “ghost-borrowing” or “pipelining.”

Specifications of loan obligations

  Obligations of JLG loan products which when interacted with household portfolios can result in adverse
  financial outcomes.

  •	 Criteria for loan utilization: The regulatory mandate for at least 50 percent of a provider’s loan portfolio
     being toward income-generation is difficult to monitor after the point of sale. This mandate being
     relaxed over the years is in itself might be testament to loan use for consumption owing to the fungibility
     of loan amounts.
  •	 Repayment schedules: While structured repayment schedules could encourage customers to make
     disciplined repayments, loan use for consumption smoothing oftentimes supersedes the point of good
     money management into acute liquidity mismatches resulting in financial distress.

Transparency and client education

    While regulatory mandates are in place to increase product transparency and enhance client education,
    relying on such approaches still places too much responsibility on customers to decide their level of
    indebtedness and ultimately prevent bad outcomes.

Delinquency as a signal of financial distress

    The industry has relied on repayment frequency (or lack of delinquency) as a measure of overall success.
    However, delinquency might be, at best, a belated measure of customer financial distress.




3.	     Academic Motivation


      “We see a lot of heterogeneity. We see some people seem to be doing really well when they get
      access to microcredit, [say] 5% of the population, maybe. And for the rest it seems to have very little
      impact. So how do we target that 5%? This is a set of issues that seems to be about product design.
      What is it that we want microcredit to be?”
                                                                          —Prof. Abhijeet Banerjee, February 20158




This research is motivated by three broad themes well represented in the academic literature on financial
services for low-income households. The first theme draws on insights from rigorous evaluations of microcredit
access and use. Most studies have reported modest positive yet, not transformative effects on financial well-
being, while some have further explored population subgroups for whom microcredit was more successful
than on average. The second theme references a large and multidisciplinary body of work that evidences
negative outcomes of microcredit for certain population subgroups, also make note of systematic weakness
on both the demand and supply side that leave low-income borrowers vulnerable to a range of negative
outcomes. Following from this, the third theme explores in more detail various manifestations of debt-induced
stress, and the strategies that low-income households adopt to manage, if not mitigate, financial distress.


3.1. 	 Heterogeneous impacts of microcredit
Recent impact evaluations have questioned and successfully countered the claim that microcredit
interventions, through unleashing latent entrepreneurship, could eradicate want in low-income
communities. A common premise of the studies reviewed here is that latent entrepreneurial talent is both
unobservable and heterogeneous at the time of granting new credit access. When given access to credit,
microentrepreneurs may invest more in their businesses, or experiment with new techniques and over the
short-term, both actions generate valuable insights on entrepreneurial capability: both internally within
the firm and to a limited extent, externally to lenders. However, a primary outcome of incremental credit

access, subsequent investment and experimentation is the likelihood of failure and in fact, as Karlan, Knight,
and Udry (2012) show, the average microentrepreneur’s attempts to grow are more likely to fail that to
succeed. Through their own research and a review of three similar studies they report that only a small set
of microbusinesses receiving a randomized capital infusion outperformed the counterfactual group, while
many in the treatment group experienced negative returns.

Toward a better prediction of the positive returns (which could thereby allow more targeted microlending),
Banerjee et al. (2014) mark a fundamental distinction between two types of microentrepreneurs on the
basis of their entrepreneurial intent.9 Through the lens of this distinction, the authors demonstrate that almost
all the positive impacts of microcredit access (increased business profits, household consumption and
durable asset ownership) accrued only to those who were natural entrepreneurs and/or were likely to have
businesses even before gaining new access to credit. Together, these results suggest that entrepreneurial
ability and efficiency might be a key precondition for credit access in itself to translate into well-being.

Other factors besides entrepreneurship have also been shown to systematically influence the types and
magnitude of benefits that accrue to microcredit users, and these become especially salient in the context
of borrowers who use their loans to smooth consumption or make nonbusiness investments, including in
human capital. Angelucci et al. (2013) document both individual characteristics (such as having prior credit
experience with the formal sector, borrowers’ level of risk tolerance and patience) and as well, overall
community characteristics that mediate the impact of microcredit on borrowers.

In this research featured in this report we acknowledge heterogeneity in both (a) how low-income borrowers
use their loans and (b) how these loans might interact with borrower characteristics to mediate subsequent
outcomes. An in-depth understanding of both, we argue, can inform market standards for responsible
customer acquisition and underwriting.


3.2. 	 Debt-induced financial distress
While there is now strong evidence of heterogeneous positive impacts, there is also evidence of harmful or
negative outcomes, although this evidence is mixed when comparing evaluations conducted in dissimilar
settings. For example, respondents in treatment clusters in Hyderabad, India, reported on an average that
they were more worried and less happy (both measured through constructed indices in Banerjee [2014]),
although it is unclear whether higher levels of debt are a possible cause for the reported distress.

It is important at this stage to note the distinction drawn between financial and psychological distress—
credit would likely be linked to both and indeed, both find their place in evaluations of microcredit. The
original data collection and analysis presented in later sections of this report are limited to the antecedents
and consequences of financial stress only, for two reasons. First, studies on the incidence of mental health
problems revealed that financial stress is not only a leading cause for concern worldwide, but particularly so
in developing countries (Field et al. 2012). Second, most comparable international policy and regulation to
protect customers articulate the need for financial services providers to assess and mitigate financial distress
for their customers.

Scholars assert that to understand the role of microcredit in debt-induced financial distress, research focus
must shift from impacts created after the loan, to the repayments made during the loan (Dattasarma et
al. 2015; Field et al. 2012; Venkata et al. 2010). Venkata et al. (2010) document that microcredit borrowers



9.	 The first type is the much-celebrated segment of poor microfinance clients as natural entrepreneurs who could
    rapidly develop local, profitable microbusinesses—the authors call them “gung-ho” entrepreneurs. In contrast are
    reluctant entrepreneurs who might actually prefer to work elsewhere (in regular wage employment, for example)
    but are instead called on to start businesses or other pursuits to repay emergency or consumption loans.


                                                                                                                   7

attributed financial stress they experienced during the loan tenure to seasonality related income volatility,
life-cycle events and related expense volatility and the additional burden of repayment in the event of
delinquency by others in their joint-liability groups.

On loan repayments and credit contracts, two aspects find prominence in the literature. First, whether
the loan’s features are appropriate to borrowers’ circumstances in a manner that minimizes harm, if not
encourage success. Field et al. (2012) find that clients with a monthly repayment schedule scored 45 percent
lower on a Financial Stress Index than clients with repayments due every week. Further, they observed that
this differential was particularly large toward the end of the loan (correlated with a large differential in
the average incomes earned by the two subgroups), demonstrating how microcredit’s features hold the
potential to both induce and mitigate financial stress.

The second feature of credit services that are salient in the discussion of repayment burden is the question
of whether an additional loan, or loan access, poses a risk of over-indebtedness. The consequences of over-
indebtedness for borrowers can be severe, but will likely differ depending on, among other factors, the extent
of over-indebtedness and the strategies they adopt to manage this debt. Transitional over-indebtedness
may characterized by levels of debt that are high relative to income, but not overwhelmingly so; borrowers
might be able to use various strategies to stabilize and reduce total debt over the medium term (Guerin et
al. 2011), without significantly eroding their asset holdings. However, borrowers carrying persistently higher
levels of debt (such as when the repayments due are equal to income, or higher) were observed juggling
various sources of funds to maintain their creditworthiness, and were also likely to experience significant
asset erosion (Grammling 2009; Guerin et al. 2011), pauperization, or extreme dependence on support from
social networks.

Schicks and Rosenberg (2011) reviewed six field studies of microfinance over-indebtedness and reported that
anywhere between 12 percent and 85 percent of the study populations were classified as over-indebted.10
The definitions of over-indebtedness in each study, however, were quite varied: they could be measured by
the outcomes of debt (delinquency or default, although these are typically lagging indicators), by borrowers’
financial characteristics (number of loans, debt service ratio, and debt-asset leverage ratio, to name a few)
or by the nature of sacrifices made by borrowers to meet repayments. Schicks (2013) further explores the
merits of subjective measures of over-indebtedness such as when borrower’s self-identify costly adjustments,
unduly high sacrifices that were not anticipated at the time of taking on the loan and “regrettable” debt.

However, the use of subjective definitions to prevent over-indebtedness (say, at the time of loan appraisal)
has strong limitations, and we observe that in application, regulators have tended to prefer quantitative
measures. For example, regulations in Malaysia and Nicaragua prescribe a ceiling on the ratio of debt-to-
income, particularly for consumer lending (CGAP 2009). In South Africa, the National Credit Act requires
that all providers conduct a thorough affordability assessment of prospective borrowers through a check
on both their incomes and outstanding debts: a borrower would be considered over-indebted through the
new loan if the total of monthly debt payments was in excess of income net of minimum living expenses
(World Bank 2012).

The research featured in this report will consider both loan features and indebtedness levels in relation to
financial distress. We also explore some of the challenges in implementing debt affordability assessments in
low-income settings, and similar regulations aimed at mitigating debt stress.




10.	 The authors note that these estimates of over-indebtedness are not to be considered representative of markets
     everywhere. Several of the studies reviewed were conducted in areas known to have over-lending or lending
     crises.

3.3.	 Debt management and negative coping mechanisms
Low-income households are known to face high income volatility, extreme vulnerability to illness and injury
and unpredictable livelihood opportunities—and to cope, use a variety of financial strategies to manage
their cashflows. Coping strategies might include on smoothening income through income diversification
or balancing farm and non-farm employment. Alternatively (or sometimes, additionally) coping strategies
might instead focus on smoothening expenditure by supplementing income gaps through savings, insurance
and borrowing arrangements (Morduch 1995). These mechanisms help protect essential consumption not
only from income volatility, but also from shocks to livelihoods or to manage large expenses. There is a
growing body of evidence on the vibrant financial lives of low-income households and the variety of ways
in which they use formal and informal financial services to manage volatility and build-in additional flexibility
in times of need (Collins et al 2009; Zollman et al. 2015).

Specifically in the context of managing the stress of debt repayments, a few recent studies have expressed
concern over certain coping mechanisms that could potentially prove harmful if persistent over the
medium or long-term. Exploiting an unexpected temporary shut-down of microfinance in Karnataka, India,
Dattasarma et al. (2015) document dramatic changes to the household consumption expenditure patterns
when repayment obligations were relaxed. The relaxation of repayment obligations during a temporary
ban was observed to significantly bridge expense differentials across household on essential consumption—
notably, grains and vegetables while the significant gaps that remained were on discretionary spending
under the heads snacks, “given to husband,” fuel, meat and sweets. These findings support select borrower
testimonies (MIX 2015) where about 5 percent respondents self-reported that they struggled to make
repayments on-time and in order to do so, they would sometimes reduce or skip meals. Respondents in this
survey also reported that in times of stress, repayments would be made through borrowing from another
source, however, it is unclear under what circumstances each of these (or any other coping mechanisms)
were available to stressed borrowers and how they were chosen.

In this research, one of our hypotheses is that local socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, the history
of local financial development and the strength of community support networks will significantly mediate
how borrowers cope with financial distress.




4. 	 Research Design
The design of this study is premised on the foundation that financial products are deeply integrated with
lives of their users. There is a marked role for FSPs to be more responsible for the products and services
they provide to vulnerable customers and recent regulatory changes have required lenders to proactively
prevent adverse outcomes to the borrower that might arise from an unsuitable sale.11 The outputs of this
research are intended to inform and facilitate the development of suitability or unsuitability guidelines for
lending to low-income households.

In light of the imperative to meaningfully implement suitability guidelines for credit provision, this research
seeks to address the following questions:

   1.	 How does a credit product interact with the financial portfolios of low-income households?
   2.	 Is there evidence of adverse outcomes correlated with, or as a result of certain types of credit?
   3.	 Can this evidence inform responsible credit delivery?

WORKING PAPER



The primary data collection for this study was located in Krishnagiri district in Tamil Nadu, South India.
Households were recruited into the sample following a stratified random sampling protocol, though over-
sampling JLG borrowers and also taking care to include complete groups, i.e., all member households
of a borrowing group were included in the sample. Through detailed monthly interviews with 411 panel
households, we construct a longitudinal dataset presenting a comprehensive picture of economic
characteristics, financial access, financial behavior and cash flows. A description of the sampling protocol
is presented as an appendix and summary descriptive characteristics pertinent to sample households are
discussed in the next chapter.

In analysis we seek to test the following hypotheses. First, we seek to develop measures of debt-related
financial distress experienced by borrowers. We test whether traditional measures of default or delinquency
fairly estimate levels of underlying financial distress. Second, we seek to understand the role of unexpected
events that may occur during the loan tenure to exacerbate financial distress. Third, we seek to present
evidence on the variety of coping mechanisms that borrowers adopt to mitigate stress, including ones that
could prove harmful over the medium term or longer term.



5. 	 Economic Characteristics

5.1.	   Livelihoods and Income
The largest portion of sample households reported working in casual wage labor (23 percent), followed
by household enterprises (18 percent), and regular salaried professions (16 percent). These five categories
alone (see Figure 2) accounted for the occupations of 76 percent of individuals in the overall sample.

In addition to employment income, households also receive income through rent on land or property,
remittances from household members, pension, and other institutional or government welfare support. The
median monthly household income thus reported for all sample households ranged between Rs. 3,893 at
the lower end to Rs. 24,209 at the higher end, while the median was Rs. 9,614.

the average experience of low-income households. Even within a short observation period (approximately
seven months), his family’s monthly income fell 28 percent below their average in one month, while rose 66

5.3.	 Income Surplus
The median monthly household surplus (calculated as total household income net of total household
consumption) reported across all sample households in the study’s observation was Rs. 3,936. The surplus
ranged from (negative) Rs. 1,488 to Rs. 14,982. This includes income generated from primary and secondary
occupations, miscellaneous sources, and consumption of food, medicine and treatment, other regular
nonfood items, and events such as weddings, festivals, and funerals.

5.3.1. The scope to expand surplus

Many studies have documented a variety of ways in which low-income households stretch their incomes,
building in more elasticity in times of need (see Zollman et al. 2015 for a detailed discussion on budget
elasticity). Most of these strategies fall into a few broad categories—increase incomes, reduce expenses,
receive other nonincome resources through social networks, or use credit.

Specifically on reducing expenses, we explore how many households in the sample have the ability to
reduce expenses further, estimating the minimum living standard as the 10th percentile of the monthly per
capita expenditure reported for Tamilnadu (NSSO 2011). Eighteen percent of households’ current reported
consumption in the survey is below this minimum threshold; a further reduction of expenses as a coping
mechanism could have serious consequences over the longer term. Of the remaining households, many
are just above the threshold and also have little room to reduce consumption, though if they were all to
drop their consumption to the minimum level, on average, it would free up an additional 25 percent of their
incomes for other payments.

5.4. 	 Incidence of shocks and adverse events
The household surveys record the incidence of any celebrations, unplanned events, or adverse shocks
occuring in the household in the past seven months. The events recorded fall into five broad categories,
listed in Table 4.

                          In the case of agriculture or self-employment:
                             Delays in procurement of inputs or in payments receivable, unexpected price changes, loss or
              Shocks to      damage suffered to crops

                             Impossible to find work
   Climatic changes Extreme heat or cold, delayed/excessive rain, floods, and other natural calamities



For each event, the surveys also recorded the total expenses incurred and number of working days lost during
the event (for an estimate of financial and opportunity costs, respectively). Wherever income was foregone
or additional expenses were incurred, investigators probed to understand how households managed their
budgets during that period.

Coping strategies were marked in a precoded list and used a reference for the administration of the rest
of survey, such as the income, savings, and borrowing modules. Since coping strategies were self-reported,
they will also need to be triangulated with detailed data on observed incomes, expenses, and borrowing,
and are not reported here.

Between March and November 2015, the most frequent adverse event that respondents reported was
illness to household members while also reporting that they frequently hosted guests, celebrated festivals
and ceremonies, and undertook some travel.

For each of these events, we estimated both the median and upper bound of total expenses incurred in
each survey period that these events were reported. For example, we find that while repairs to property and
death of a household member are relatively infrequent events, the median expenses incurred in both cases
are much larger than most other events and these event-related expenses have the potential to escalate
quite rapidly (as high as Rs. 80,000 in the case of one panel household).



Figure 9. 	   Opportunity costs of major and/or unplanned events




Of the more frequently reported events, spending on festivals and ceremonies tended to be higher than the
rest, where the median expenses incurred during an illness or while hosting guests was Rs. 500, on festivals Rs.
1,000 and on ceremonies Rs. 700. As before, we observed that expenses on festivals and ceremonies had
the potential to escalate more rapidly and for more households than in the case of health-related events.

Illness and injuries would knock household members out of the workforce for anywhere between one day
and five days (at the median) to three weeks (at the 90th percentile in the case of injuries). Travel, either to
visit friends and relatives, in search of work tended to take anywhere between two days at the median to
eight days at the upper end.

In the case of households dependent on income from daily wage labor or daily income self-employment,
longer trips might mean a reduction in income during this period. However, the biggest shock in terms of
opportunity costs is the inability to find income-generating employment itself—though this was reported by
only two to three sample households in each round, the opportunity costs of this shock were higher than
most others, even at the median.

The All India Debt and Investment survey is a decadal survey that results in rich and detailed insights on
financial behavior of Indian households at district and subdistrict levels. From the data released in the latest
round (2013), we find evidence that Tamil Nadu outperforms all-India averages on both measures of access
to formal credit. Within Tamil Nadu, the median amount of outstanding institutional debt was 71 percent
higher in Krishnagiri than the state average, even though the incidence of indebtedness was almost the
same, indicating that rural households sampled from Krishnagiri are significantly more likely to have access
to, and actively use, institutional credit services.

There is mixed evidence of the effects of formal sector financial development on informal borrowing.
Incidence of borrowing from moneylenders is much lower in Krishnagiri than the state average, but for those
households that reported outstanding loans, the loans were 28 percent larger. Similarly for loans outstanding
to friends and relatives within social networks, the incidence of indebtedness is only marginally lower, but
outstanding amounts are higher. Overall, indebted households in this population carried much higher
outstanding debt than comparable state or national averages.

The CRISIL Inclusix report consolidates multiple measures of formal financial development including branch
presence, use of formal savings accounts, and credit penetration into a composite index at both state and
substate/district level. In 2013, Krishnagiri broke into the top 100 districts in India (many of these districts include
urban economic centers) while Tamil Nadu itself consistently ranked among the very best performing states.
In 2013 these calculations began to include credit disbursed through MFIs but even with MFIs excluded, a
consistent upward trend is observed in bank-led financial access in Krishnagiri.

Specifically on microfinance, very few sources release access and use statistics for substate units and most
that do (such as MIX Market’s Finclusion Lab initiative) rely on self-reported data from a subset of providers.
Even further, the government’s own Self-Help Group (SHG) bank-linked microcredit program may be at least
twice as large as commercial microfinance but remains unreported in credit bureaus and sector reports.
Measurement challenges notwithstanding, we review public data available on Krishnagiri and find that the
district is fairly well served through local institutions present in the district. Anecdotally and through primary
interviews, we understood that residents are also served by mobile agents from institutions in neighboring
districts—North Krishnagiri is less than an hour’s drive from Bangalore, while in the South several villages share
borders with Vellore. As Figure 12 and Figure 13 show, both neighbors have large financial markets that
would have naturally extended to Krishnagiri over time, easily serviceable without investing in additional
local physical infrastructure. For this reason, statistics aggregated on the basis of branches’ physical location
and not on the basis of the location of customers may underestimate the true penetration of microcredit
in districts such as Krishnagiri.

6.2.	 Credit access and use among sample households
The loan portfolios of sample households are reported for each subsample—JLG borrowers and non-JLG
households. The JLG group comprises those households that self-reported to be active users of a new JLG
loan (defined by having used a new JLG loan during the month of enlistment). The non-JLG group comprises
those households that self-reported to be nonusers of a JLG loan during the month of enlistment. Through
the study’s observation, only 6 percent households in the non-JLG sample went on to report receiving a new
loan from an MFI.

In concurrence with overall district-level access to credit statistics cited earlier in this chapter, sample
households, too, reported high incidence of institutional debt, in both samples. Loans from all domestic
banks were frequently reported in both subsamples, as were loans received through SHGs. In terms of
informal borrowing, loans from kin were relatively lower in incidence than loans from friends or other nonkin
social connections.

JLG and non-JLG subsamples seem evenly matched in terms of overall debt, though stark differences
emerged around certain types of unique institutions. We are yet unable to explain the reasons for some of
these differences; especially in the case of certain types of banks or other financial institutions, incidence of
indebtedness might be correlated with physical access or access through an MFI or a social connection.
However, this is a hypothesis we are unable to further explore.

Across the sample, households reported having taken the largest loans from banks (Rs. 50,000), followed by
SHGs (Rs. 30,000) and co-operatives (Rs. 28,000).

The survey also asked about any processing or transaction costs that households incurred to receive the loan,
typically including membership fees, transportation costs, cost of procuring documents, processing fees,
etc. For large portions of loans from banks and MFIs, 41 percent and 55 percent, respectively, respondent
households reported having incurred a cost of more than Rs. 50, and average cost for these sources tends
to be quite high.

For most loans, notably including those from kin and nonkin, households reported that interest was charged
and a majority of borrowers were also able to recall and clearly specify the type and level of interest
charged.

More than half of loans taken from formal institutions required some form of collateral, with the exception of
MFIs and SHGs. Of these collateralized loans, most loans were taken against gold, ornaments, and jewelry
or movable property (including livestock). The high prevalence of gold as collateral required might be a
telling indicator for the popularity of gold loan products, rendered desirable by their quick processing time
and low interest rates.

Across the sample, most formal loans are reported to specify fixed repayment periods in their contracts
and where this percentage is lower for some loans from banks and co- operatives, this is perhaps some sign
of the respondents’ low awareness of loan terms. On the other hand, less than half of loans from informal
sources are reported to specify fixed repayment periods.

In terms of loan tenure, informal loans are reported to have many more short tenure loans (1–6 months) than
formal loans.

Most loans from banks (63 percent), co-operatives (83 percent), and MFIs (75%) have loan tenures up to
12 months. It is noteworthy that a significant proportion of loans from MFIs (22 percent) were reported to
have tenures between 13 and 24 months, as one indicator of innovation from the classic joint-liability loan
product offered for only 52 weeks.

7.	       Evidence of Debt-Related Financial Distress
Study respondents reported loans with a variety of different repayment terms. Overall, loans taken from
friends in times of need tended to be flexible either in loan tenure or the frequency of payments to be
made—or usually both. Institutional loans often required fixed weekly or monthly repayments although we
learned of contract innovations that deviated from the typical EMI-type structure.


7.1. 	 Debt affordability measures: Debt-to-income and debt-to-surplus ratios
Following from the literature, we sought to estimate household debt burden as the repayment obligation for
all outstanding loans relative to the household’s incomes and expenses. For convenience, we aggregated
repayment obligations and cash flows by month, even where repayments are due or incomes are earned
at a higher frequency. Broadly, our review of loan features indicated three types of repayment structures:
(i) fixed tenure and regular repayment schedules, (ii) fixed tenure and “bullet” repayment schedules (where
both interest and principal are paid once at the end of the contract or a moderate rate of interest alone is
serviced through frequent payments but principal is paid down at the end of the contract), and (iii) flexible
repayment schedules where either tenure or payment frequency or both are left unspecified. Purely flexible
payment schedules are largely limited to informal lending whereas bullet repayments are increasingly
becoming more popular in formal banking, through the widespread success of the jewel loan product.12

For each of the three types of loans, we estimate and report simple debt-to-income ratios (DIR) as the
sum total of all estimated debt obligations for outstanding loans divided by average monthly household
income. In doing so we rely on two accounting assumptions:

      1.	 Where the loan tenure is fixed but repayment amounts or frequencies are not specified, such as in
          bullet repayment loans, we assumed that the burden of repayment to be evenly distributed over the
          tenure.
      2.	 Where loan tenure is not specified, such as in some types of informal loans, we assigned a reasonable
          tenure (based on loan amount)13 and thereby assumed that the burden or repayment to be evenly
          distributed over the tenure.

Both assumptions, while limiting, are a necessary prerequisite to standardize and compare relative debt
burdens. Figure 14 presents comparable distributions of debt-to-income ratios that first exclude flexible
loans, then consider them separately and, in the last column, aggregate flexible with fixed EMI-type loans.
Comparing the distributions, it is evident that considering repayments due toward fixed-schedule (and
mostly institutional) debts greatly underestimates the overall household debt burden for the whole sample.
Further, as presented in Figure 15, poorest households carry the highest estimated debt burden and yet
again, any analysis that excludes flexible loans would significantly underestimate debt burden and, thereby,
debt-related stress for the poorest and most vulnerable households.



12.	 A jewel loan is a loan against collateral and is typically marketed as providing short-term liquidity relief and widely
     offered at both rural and urban bank branches. Several features explain the popularity of the product—many low-
     income households own gold jewelery, interest rates are much lower other institutional loans, and the loan often
     requires only one lump-sum payment within a year to redeem the jewelery or, alternatively, a settlement of the
     interest to-date wherein the loan is “rolled over,” or simply renewed.
13.	 For loans up to Rs. 15,000 we assumed a tenure of 12 months and for larger loans, 24 months. This is consistent with
     the practices of MFIs, as directed by regulation.




                                                                                                                          23

However, it is here that our assumptions around how flexible loans might be repaid become salient—indeed,
they may neither be repaid in the tenure assumed nor as frequently as assumed. A common feature of
certain types of flexible, informal loans is also that they are often renegotiated with the lender.

Debt-to-surplus ratio

While DIRs are popular largely as personal finance rules of thumb, it is unclear whether they can be
appropriately applied to underwrite loans for low-income households. Poor people in developing
countries face significant income volatility and lack access to reliable formal safety nets. Debt affordability
assessments might therefore need to include a buffer to cover minimum living expenses, and prevent
borrower impoverishment through over-indebtedness, and this could take the form of a debt-to-surplus ratio
(DSR) where a healthy level of debt is characterized by a ratio less than 1.

As before, the numerator of an overall debt-to-surplus ratio remains the sum total of payments due on
outstanding loans in each month. In the denominator, we estimate average monthly incomes net of minimum
living expenses for all permanent household members.14 Figure 16 is a scatterplot of debt obligations on the
y-axis and surplus on the x-axis, where the quality of debt-to-surplus is plotted as the reference line. Households
in the lower triangle of the scatterplot are “in the clear”: their incomes are, on average, adequate to meet
both minimum household expenses and loan repayments due. As before, limiting the analysis to only the
payments due on fixed EMI-type loans could significantly underestimate overall indebtedness. Even so,
considering only fixed, regular payment obligations serves to identify households in the upper triangle of the
plot— some that were on the margin with only a small income deficit, while others reported a much wider
gap between disposable income available and estimated payments due.

WORKING PAPER



Overall, however, for about 78 percent of sample households, overall monthly repayment obligations on
fixed-tenure loans with regular repayment obligations was less than 80 percent of their income surplus (i.e.,
income net of minimum living expenses). These households, it seems ex-ante, should have been able to
comfortably manage to make their payments on these loans on time without facing extreme duress and
over and above these payments might have also been able to spend above the minimum standard and
perhaps, save toward paying down some of the other loans or any other goal. As noted in Table 10, even
households with comfortable DSR status carry moderate to high levels of flexible debt—to pay down those
loans, borrowers will need to save lump sums or mobilize funds from other sources when those payments
become due.

For yet another 7 percent of households, DSR is somewhere around 1, that is, their debt service obligations
on fixed and regular loans will more or less deplete their complete household surplus, leaving little excess
(or a small deficit) to manage any other expenses that may arise during the course of these loans. Should
these household face a health shock or an adverse event, or should any large payments fall due above
and beyond the very bare minimum living expenses (such as for travel, celebrations, or ceremonies) or even
if one of their creditors within their social networks ask to be repaid, these households might struggle to find
the resources to make those payments.

For all of the other households (15 percent of the sample), DSR seems to indicate that they might experience
significant financial distress in the course of the loan tenure, for as long as current loans remain outstanding
and income sources remain unchanged. All of these households also carry high levels of flexible debt,
likely incurred to supplement inadequate incomes in times of stress. Notice that this group has the highest
incidence15 of bullet repayment loans (the most common is the jewel loan) and an even higher incidence
of flexible borrowing, typically from friends and relatives.

               TOWARD DEVELOPING UNSUITABILITY GUIDELINES FOR CREDIT PROVISION



For a small number of households, we were unable to compute debt-to-surplus ratios; it appeared that
these households were in an overall income deficit position. They did have income sources but none of
these was regular and this created an extremely volatile surplus that was overall negative. Earlier we had
discussed income and surplus volatility as a monthly phenomenon. Here, we observe that for 2 percent of
indebted households in the sample, much of this volatility was persistent for a large part of the year, if not
longer. These households also reported frequently withdrawing from savings accounts, reported the highest
incidence of new borrowing during the study’s observation, and one of them even reported selling their
land (a follow-up qualitative interview will seek to understand if this was a distress sale).


7.2. 	 Delinquency on outstanding loans
Delinquency rates in microfinance are seldom reported or discussed in public, whereas low default rates
have been widely reported and celebrated within the sector. We therefore lack the means to benchmark
or compare the rates of the self-reported delinquency observed in our sample. Further, we report self-
reported delinquency that was captured during interviews at frequent intervals—it is possible that very
short-term delinquency (delayed payments but within seven days, for example) where not systematically
self-reported as delinquency in our survey.

During the observation window (roughly seven months), 7 percent of households reported at least once
that they were delinquent on a payment toward a fixed-tenure regular-repayment loan, i.e., the type of
loan on which they typically made monthly payments. In contrast, other indicators of repayment difficulties
returned much higher estimates.

Our hypothesis is that as debt levels increase relative to household surplus, the incidence of delinquency
would also increase, but even so, this would remain an underestimate of underlying financial distress.
Evidence reviewed earlier chapter in this report suggests that many borrowers, when under stress, raise
resources through other means to make their payments on time.

WORKING PAPER



In Table 11 shows results relevant to the first part of this hypothesis. The incidence of delinquency (at least
once during the study’s observation) is generally higher for households that have debt obligations in excess
of a basic surplus. Delinquency was fairly high even for households in the DSR 0.8–1.2 group, but this is not
unexpected. Surpluses were computed as net of income and a bare minimum living expense standard—
several sample households were (fortunately) at a slightly higher level even at the baseline and may not be
able to make further reductions to their consumption expenditure without significantly also reducing food
consumption and investments in health and human capital. Further, households computationally located
at the margin were vulnerable to a wide variety of shocks during the study’s observation—any or all of
which could have temporarily reduced labor supply or increased expenses, causing additional financial
distress through a temporary shrinking of resources.

In addressing the second part of the hypothesis, we investigate three coping mechanisms: (i) liquidating
assets for cash, (ii) borrowing to smoothen cash flows, and (iii) transacting with persons within the borrowers’
social or community networks.

7.3. 	 Liquidating assets
Three types of asset reductions were revealed in the data analysis and, while many others were investigated
(such as the sale of durable assets and farm machinery), perhaps the lack of functioning secondary markets
for certain assets implied that even households that were moderately asset-rich were unable to leverage
this position to smooth cash flows. The most liquid assets were savings accounts, livestock, and in what
we expect are rare cases, the sale of land. Households used savings accounts not only to make savings
deposits but also to receive wages and welfare benefits from the government. Many households also used
their formal savings accounts as collateral under the Self-Help Group Bank-Linkage scheme, where holding
a lump sum in the account acted as security against a group loan.

Figure 18 presents the results on the use of savings, Figure 19 on the sale of livestock, and Figure 20 on
the occasional land sale. While the incidence of savings withdrawals and livestock sale are high, both of
these may in some part be related to livelihood activity and in entirety cannot be interpreted as coping
mechanisms. For example, where weekly wages are received under the National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme or any other subsidies or benefits are received through the account, withdrawal of
these amounts must be interpreted with caution. Similarly, households engaging in certain kinds of livestock
farming will be more likely than others to sell their livestock for trade, and again, this must be interpreted
with caution. We propose to account for some of these livelihood factors in future iterations of this analysis.

7.4. 	 New borrowing
Incidence of new borrowing through the study observation period is correlated with DSR groups: groups
with higher DSR are also more likely to borrow and to borrow larger amounts. Where collateral is not a
constraint, this trend is borne out clearly (see Figure 22).

However, since computed DSR is an average of debt obligations during the same time-period for which
we report incidence, this correlation may not be interpreted as a causal effect of repayment stress on
borrowing. Rather, we cautiously infer that high monthly repayment pressure coupled with a correlated
repayment pressure on flexible loans and a systematic vulnerability to volatile cash flows and adverse shocks
leaves many households seeking to borrow additionally as a means of enhancing income and as a coping
mechanism. This is supported by the evidence in Table 12, where a majority of respondent households who
borrowed new loans from institutions during the study’s observation period reported that they were either
borrowing to make repayments or to smoothe consumption.

7.5. 	 Noninstitutional borrowing and social networks
As in the case of institutional borrowing, a similar trend is observed in noninstitutional borrowing, a large part
of which is borrowing from friends and relatives. The incidence of this type of borrowing is much higher than
either types of institutional borrowing but the amounts tend to be much lower. While resources available
through social networks are limited and even when they are interest-free, they are attached with social
costs. However, they may be significantly easier and quicker to access than institutional loans (earlier we
reported transactions costs for access).

Interestingly, households with higher DSR were also more likely to request and receive nonloan transfers from
their social networks, and both incidence and average monthly resources available through this channel
rank-order with the magnitude of debt-surplus ratio.

8.	    Debt Affordability Assessment at Point of Sale
With a view to understanding the role of debt affordability assessments at the point of sale (POS), we
retrospectively evaluated a subset of new loan disbursements reported—how many of these loans might
have failed a formal debt affordability assessment? A total of 170 new loans was reported in the fifth and
sixth survey rounds, of which 60 were from institution types governed by customer protection regulations of
some form. For each of the borrowers who reported these loans, we computed DSR at POS as the ratios
computed based on data observed up to the latest survey round at that time; results are reported in Table
13. Less than half of the loans disbursed cleared a retrospective DSR assessment as specified in the following:

  (Borrowers’ existing fixed and regular debt obligations + Additional debt obligations from the new
               loan) < (Average monthly income – Minimum living expenses for family)

We find this pattern consistent in both the survey rounds that supported retrospective checks.

WORKING PAPER



For the loans that did not clear the DSR threshold, two scenarios emerged. First, where the servicing of
already-existing fixed and regular repayments alone was consuming more than the borrower’s average
income surplus (suggesting that the borrower would either be delinquent on loan payments or meet
expenses through nonoccupational sources of funds, or both). Second, where servicing existing fixed and
regular payment loans did leave some room for additional debt, but perhaps not as much as was received
resulting in the addition of the new loan predicting an income deficit in the near future.

Several concerns arise here. First, this assessment counts only loans that specified fixed tenure and required
regular, frequent payments—most of these are institutional loans whereas a majority of loans from friends
and relatives, or even jewel loans would be excluded from such a debt affordability assessment. If we were
to add all outstanding loans to this assessment and apply the same assumptions as before (regarding how
flexible loans might be paid down), even fewer borrowers would have been deemed fit to receive the
loans that they did. Second, many borrowers seemed to report an income deficit or were predicted to
experience a deficit as a result of new debt obligations in the observation window. Specific challenges in
measuring and implementing debt affordability assessments in India are also discussed as follows.


8.1. 	 Implementing debt affordability assessments and its challenges
To enable better debt affordability assessments at POS, the quality and accuracy of credit information
available to providers need to be significantly enhanced. While efforts are underway to integrate formal
banking credit bureaus with the data from nonbanking financial institutions and a parallel effort to digitize
and integrate data on the performance of SHG loans, loans disbursed through co-operative banks remains
outside the purview of any centralized repository. There is a need to revisit and standardize credit reporting
requirements by function, rather than by institutional types.

However, relying only on institutional data on household debt could be inadequate. As our results show,
low-income households carry high amounts of debt outstanding to friends, relatives, employers, and
moneylenders and yet do not have any insights on whether these agreements are truly binding, whether
they can be renegotiated, and at what costs. These insights would also critically inform the development of
fair debt affordability assessments.

On FSPs’ readiness to implement debt affordability assessments, it seems that there is a huge disparity in how
providers conduct due diligence, what data they collect on customers, and how much of this information
feeds into meaningful loan underwriting criteria. Often, increments in loan size are automated by repayment
history (intended as a dynamic incentive) without much regard for borrowers’ own repayment capacity. We
believe that there is scope to harvest best practices from with the sector, both in India and internationally,
and to learn from previous experience how these assessments should be best designed and communicated
to loan officers.



9.	    Implications for Policy Design and Financial Services Provision
9.1. 	 Toward a suitability-based customer protection regime
Developing guidelines for unsuitability is in the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath, to ensure that financial services
“first, do no harm.” Upholding this principle is particularly salient in Indian low-access environments where
households are vulnerable to placing themselves in financial distress owing to vast asymmetries of information
and power with financial services providers.16



16.	 Sahasranaman et al. (2014) provides a much more detailed discussion.

                TOWARD DEVELOPING UNSUITABILITY GUIDELINES FOR CREDIT PROVISION



Rather than placing the responsibility on customers to prevent adverse outcomes of financial services, there
is a marked role for providers of financial services to be much more responsible for the products and services
that they recommend based on a systematic understanding of the customer’s financial situation. While
providers cannot be responsible for ultimate customer outcomes, adhering to preventive processes, such
as implementing a better debt affordability assessment at POS, will mark a significant step in enhancing
such provider responsibility.

The Indian national imperative to rapidly expand the reach of financial services to underserved populations
has recently been accompanied by a remarkable evolution of its customer protection regime from one
that was characterized by increasing product disclosure and client education (generally, according to
the principle of caveat emptor or “buyer beware”) to one that is increasingly placing legal and regulatory
responsibility on providers (generally, caveat venditor or “seller beware”) to steer customers away from
harmful financial outcomes.17 This shift is consistent with new regulatory approaches in several other
jurisdictions, most notably Australia, South Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to ensure that
financial services providers are acting in the best interest of their customers.

The draft Indian Financial Code 2015, which is currently awaiting Parliamentary approval, established a
legally binding right for retail financial consumers to receive suitable advice in relation to the purchase of
a financial product or service, and that the provider must collect all relevant information on the needs and
situation of the consumer in making its recommendation.18 The Reserve Bank of India in its latest Charter of
Customer Rights also includes a Right to Suitability such that the products offered should be appropriate
to the needs of the customer and based on an assessment of the customer’s financial circumstances and
understanding.19

Both these norms, legal and regulatory, rest on a mandate for every retail financial services provider,
regardless of its type or customer base, to institutionalize a Board-approved suitability policy that outlines
processes it can be held accountable to, rather than actual outcomes for customers. Such a policy will
ideally include clear guidelines on all end-to-end aspects of a financial services provider’s interaction with a
customer, including collection of information, product recommendation and sale, customer understanding
and informed consent, product post-sale servicing, incentives for customer-facing staff, grievance redressal,
and audit, monitoring, and compliance.20

Our model of debt affordability assessment to prevent unsuitable credit provision will seek to inform
normative practices of financial services providers on aspects of product recommendation and sale as well
as collection of information. Ultimately, our model as well as our evidence on borrower indebtedness will
seek to serve as a building block for developing regulatory guidelines on suitable credit provision as well as
developing similar guidelines for suitable provision of other product classes such as insurance, investments,
and pension.


9.2. 	 Toward better delinquency management and recourse
Our evidence shows that low-income households are vulnerable to several shocks on an ongoing basis
and are subject to significant income volatility, which could greatly affect their ability to make timely
repayments. Even beyond reasonable debt affordability assessments at POS, timely monitoring and

appropriate handling of incidents of delinquency will always remain a critical component of responsible
lending, and one that can significantly mitigate loan-related distress for borrowers. A systematic assessment
of delinquency management practices in microlending could be insightful in this regard.

The advent of a new bankruptcy framework in India (pending Parliamentary approval) will allow eligible
borrowers to file for personal bankruptcy and avail a “fresh start” that would entail discharging borrowers from
qualifying debts and allow for an opportunity to start financially afresh.21 This is an important development
in the light of our findings that new borrowing is a go-to coping mechanism in environments where there is
ready access to credit, and while this access is an important tool for consumption smoothing, there is a risk
that this could lead to entrapment in debt over the medium term.

In addition, financial services providers need to have in place better provisions for managing unforeseen
borrower delinquency. These could include practices such as providing top-up loans and contract
renegotiation to ease temporary financial distress. Timely debt counselling and frequent monitoring could
also help borrowers manage their debts over the loan tenure and may prevent further escalating distress.


9.3. 	 Implementing debt affordability assessments and its challenges
There has been an unequal trend in the expansion of financial services to low-income households in
India, with access to credit having risen rapidly, while access to reliable savings, investment, pension, and
adequate insurance instruments remain wanting. Our results suggest that low-income borrowers may be
substituting the roles of other financial instruments in mitigating risk and providing liquidity with credit, a
financial strategy that is oftentimes expensive and suboptimal. Commensurate and adequate access to
a more comprehensive suite of financial services will allow low-income households with limited resources
to better meet their financial goals of building lump sums and coping with adverse events by using more
optimal financial strategies.



10.	 Directions for Future Research
Data collection will continue into May 2016, extending this longitudinal dataset by five months and allowing
the observation of panel households for more than a year. Data updates for all the completed analysis
will serve not only to validate inferences, but also to remove any systematic seasonal effects on the data.
Upcoming analysis will also explore in more detail the role of borrowing as a coping mechanism for various
adverse events that low-income households face.

This study generates both data and research questions for further exploration. This study makes a unique
contribution by presenting early insights on the various trajectories that indebted households might take, as
they actively use new financial services. Through the lens of debt stress, we study the coping mechanisms that
low-income households adopt and learn that ready access to finance has the power to both mitigate and
exacerbate financial distress over the medium term for borrowers. Similar to the evidence on microcredit’s
impacts on financial well-being, we also see early trends of heterogeneous effects of finance on borrowers’
resilience. Further rigorous and insightful research on these effects would be both timely and relevant to
inform microfinance practice and customer protection regulation.

Annexure 1.	Data Collection
Primary data were collected through in-person interviews with 411 households (in the initial sample).
Households were typical revisited within 30–50 days and follow-up surveys on changes occurring in the
households since the last visit were administered.

Sampling

This research study is located in Krishnagiri district in Tamil Nadu, South India. The district of Krishnagiri was
formed as recently as 2004 (when it was carved out from the larger Dharmapuri administrative division) and
has the unique distinction of sharing borders with two other Indian states—Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.
Together with Tamil Nadu, these states are known to have a vibrant financial landscape and strong presence
of financial institutions, including microfinance.

To select the households in the sample, we followed a multistage random sampling protocol:

     1.	 First, we conducted listing surveys in 42 villages in Krishnagiri district, selected in a random order from
         the Census 2011 village list. The listing survey was administered to key informants in the entire village
         and gathered information on all currently active JLG borrowing groups. Of these, 28 villages had at
         least one JLG, and in 18 villages we found at least one JLG that received their disbursement within the
         last month. Since we were keen to study JLG borrowers through the tenure of their loans, we selected
         villages and groups such that borrowers would be at the beginning of a loan cycle.
     2.	 In each of the 18 villages, we sublisted only the JLGs that received a loan disbursement in the last
         month and randomly selected between one and five groups22 per village. All member households of
         each selected group were surveyed.
     3.	 In each village, an equivalent number of JLG nonparticipant households23 were also selected using a
         systematic random sampling technique, applied to the entire population of the village. For example,
         in a village where we sampled two JLGs of five members each, 10 JLG nonparticipant households
         were also sampled.
     4.	 In all, we sampled and successfully completed baseline household surveys for 200 households that
         were members of JLG groups in a new loan cycle and 211 JLG nonparticipant households.

Survey design

In total, four survey instruments were designed and administered. First, a quick listing survey was administered
between January and February 2015 through which we understood the geography of each village, any
changes in population since the 2011 census, and the presence of financial institutions including microfinance
providers and joint-liability groups.

Following the sampling protocols, the first interview with sample households followed the Baseline Household
Questionnaire. Subsequent to the baseline round, it was planned that sample households would be revisited


22.	 The number of groups selected into the sample in each village was normalized by both village population and JLG
     loan access, allowing us to over-sample from larger villages and from villages where multiple JLG providers were
     present.
23.	 A JLG nonparticipant household was identified as one that had either never borrowed through a JLG before and/
     or one that did not have a JLG loan (or application for a loan) outstanding at the time of listing. Nonparticipant
     households that subsequently borrowed through JLGs during the study period were retained in the sample with no
     consequent changes to the survey or observation. Up to the first seven monthly survey rounds, only 6 oercebt of in
     the non-JLG sample received a new JLG loan.

every month24 and a more streamlined Follow-up Questionnaire would be administered. The streamlined
questionnaire was edited to remove redundancies in the data collected on household characteristics,
while focusing instead on recent events, dynamic cash flows (incomes and expenses), and any changes in
households’ socioeconomic situation since the previous visit.

Finally, a rich community inventory of basic facilities in the village, livelihood opportunities, and activities
of formal and informal financiers will be administered to key informants (e.g., Panchayat leaders, Village
Administrative Office bearers, school headmasters, SHG leaders, village elders, etc.). The village survey will
also collect rich data on village-level characteristics, village associations, social groups, and recent adverse
events. The first part of this survey was administered along with the listing survey in 2015, while the remaining
modules will be administered in March 2016.




24.	 In practice, revisit interviews were typically conducted within 30–50 days of the previous visit. Field investigators
     regularly followed a fixed route and village order for survey administration but occasional changes were made
     to accommodate respondents’ availability or unavoidable delays between survey rounds. If a respondent was
     unavailable for the interview (often due to temporary migration for work, social events outside their village or
     the incidence of adverse events in their family), the investigators coordinated with respondents to complete the
     interview later at their convenience.

*     The survey did not formally define the role of head of household, but investigators were trained to probe for the person
      in charge of household management and decision-making. As a result, we also observed women self-identifying as the
      key decision-maker of the household instead of their husbands, which we perhaps may not have observed had we used
      other standard definitions.
