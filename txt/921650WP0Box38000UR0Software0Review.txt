Over 80 open access software packages—excluding
commercial software packages—were considered
in the evaluation. A preliminary analysis was used
to determine whether the models were currently
supported and if they were open access. Based on
the results, a subset of 31 models was selected for
more detailed analysis; these included 8 earthquake
models, 4 cyclone models, 11 flood models, and 8
storm surge/tsunami models. The detailed analysis
evaluated the models on the basis of over 100
criteria and provided a synopsis of available open

                                       Goal and Summary of the Software
                                    The software calculates deterministic and event set probabilistic risk for buildings using continuous fragility functions. CRISIS2007 is the hazard
                                    module that can create an event set using 3D source geometries of a particular annual frequency. Different ground motion (GM) parameters can
                                    be used, but spectral acceleration (Sa) is the most common. Once there is output, the vulnerability module (ERN-Vulnerabilidad) allows
                                    computation of fragility functions that are essentially user driven. Uncertainty is user driven with a simple variance. CAPRA-GIS is used for the
                                    quantification of the loss based on the input hazard set, for a particular exposure.

                                    Description of Software Risk Outputs

                                    Human losses can be calculated directly from a vulnerability function.
                                    In addition, economic losses are output in a *.res format file.
                                    For the list of earthquakes, the exposure value as well as EP (expected
                                    loss), VarP (variance of the loss), and the beta distribution (a, b) are
                                    output.
                                    Annual average loss (AAL) over a set of buildings or one building,
                                    probable maximum loss (PML), and exceedance curves for loss are
                                    output.
3.1 – 	Earthquake Loss Estimation




                                    Losses are displayed per building in the CAPRA-GIS window, providing
                                    an easy view of loss.
                                    Liquefaction analysis can also be undertaken and a map produced (for
                                    landslide and tsunami also).

                                    *CAPRA does not have a formal manual currently and instead uses support and tutorials.


                                       Advantages and Disadvantages

                                    ✓ Hazard is not hardwired, and can be input from any other program as long as the file is in the right format.
                                    ✓ The log files are very good, and the individual file production means the rerun capabilities are very good.
                                    ✓ The process of going through the hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, and then building the functions, helps the basic user to understand the
                                      problem. Variability and uncertainty are handled well.
                                    ✓ Inbuilt GIS related directly to the loss calculations is very useful; GIS is modular and extendable.
                                    ✕ The fatality functions and economic functions lack a lot of diversity, with only a direct relationship available.
                                    ✕ The damage distribution is not calculated directly and only an MDR (mean damage ratio) is available.
                                    ✕ CRISIS2007 has a strange way of assigning fault regimes to faults: assignment can be done only through the GMPE, not directly.
                                    ✕ No formal manual is provided, and with its mix of Spanish and English, the entire GUI is quite difficult to maneuver.



                                       Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                    The software would benefit from the input of fragility/casualty/economic functions from other projects. It could benefit from synergy with EQRM
                                    or MAEviz to add more functionality.

   Goal and Summary o the So tware
Earthquake Risk Model (EQRM) is a model or regional earthquake risk assessment that has been developed by Geoscience Australia (GA) or
application to Australian cities. The model is utilized in the orm o a Python or Matlab-based program ounded on the Hazus model. It has been
adapted to Australian conditions with the building/bridge types and other changes, especially the geological conditions within the hazard
section. It also includes a regional seismicity model, attenuation model, regolith site response model, elements at risk (social demographics,
building inventory), vulnerability o those elements at risk (building vulnerability model [capacity]), casualty model, injury model, and economic
loss model.

Description o So tware Risk Outputs

Structural, nonstructural, and contents damage based on lognormal
 ragility curves with standard deviation calculated in terms o spectral
displacement (per the Hazus methodology) via per ormance point are
used to create damage state probability.
Total economic loss split into components (structural, contents, etc.) is
calculated by usage, damage state, loor area, and cost per m2.
Fatalities and injuries are also calculated.
Both Australian values and those or Hazus are inbuilt.
Outputs include aggregated annualized loss, annual loss, risk
exceedance curves (PML), exceedance curves, and disaggregated
losses by a number o options, such as distance, magnitude,
                                                                            Screenshot o the disaggregated loss or Newcastle (Robinson, Ful ord,

available.



   Advantages and Disadvantages

   The so tware o ers a large number o visualization options or hazard (uni orm hazard spectra, hazard exceedance, and probabilistic seismic
hazard analysis [PSHA]) and or risk (AAL, PML, disaggregation), including or a large number o building typologies.
  This so tware was the irst to calculate event-based PSHA with this level o detail and analysis; it still leads or physical risk output options in
terms o annualized losses and risks.
  It is completely open source and extendable, which allows or easy modi ication o parts o the code.
  Integration with GIS is lacking; this could be changed in uture editions.
  There is no GUI, which makes it di icult or basic users. The so tware simply needs to be combined with MAEviz!




   Recommended Improvements or Greater Utility
Socioeconomic indicators should be added, and there should be greater depth in GUI and GIS (as in MAEviz).
EQRM would also combine well with CAPRA, given its event-based nature, despite the di erence in vulnerability.
EQRM needs a GUI or non-experienced users in order to become mainstream and could combine well with other so tware rom GA (TCRM,
TsuDAT) as well as lood so tware rom Deltares, although rewriting would be necessary.

                                    hazard is based on an input of a set of earthquakes, or a scenario quake using NGA (next generation attenuation) relations. The vulnerability
                                    method is based on the capacity spectrum method—finding the performance point between demand and capacity. This allows for the calculation
                                    of losses to buildings, infrastructure, and lifelines, as well as social loss.

                                    Description of Software Risk Outputs

                                    Losses are based on buildings, essential facilities, transportation, and
                                    utilities. Damage states are calculated based on a lognormal pdf versus
                                    hazard metric.
                                    The output is in the form of an ArcGIS display of hazard and the relative
                                    losses to buildings and population.
                                    Shelter, deaths, injuries, and other social loss functions are calculated
                                    through calibration with historical losses and building damage. In

                                    ✓ The software includes a detailed technical and user manual with full disclosure as to all data and assumptions related to fragility, hazard, and
                                    loss functions. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) calculators and mitigation aspects are also part of the decision module.
                                    ✓ The software includes many groupings of buildings and loss estimates based on U.S. building typologies and expert judgment.
                                    ✓ GUI and system of analysis for earthquakes work well and even allow ShakeMap input.
                                    ✕ The package is heavily calibrated to U.S. conditions. Many loss functions have never been fully calibrated, given the lack of large loss events in
                                    the U.S. since 1994 (Northridge).
                                    ✕ Although free, the package cannot operate without commercial software (ArcGIS). A problem arose because .NET had not been installed,
                                    creating a conflict with the SQL server.



                                       Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                    Hazus has already been adapted and has influenced EQRM, SELENA, MAEviz, etc. In terms of its functionality, it could become more global
                                    (adapting fragility functions to locations outside the United States) and open source
                                    (allowing changes in code, and changing GIS). As it develops, it should be monitored and its functions included in other software packages. The
                                    fire-following-earthquake, liquefaction, and input-output models can be applied to most other software packages.

   Goal and Summary of the Software

This software is a link between the science community and those in the planning and policy community seeking to understand an earthquake
scenario. Created as a project of the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR), World Bank, and GFDRR, it is a plugin that takes
exposure inputs (population, buildings) and hazard inputs (MMI, intensity raster over the scenario area) from any model, then uses simple
vulnerability functions to calculate an output through a simple-to-use GUI in a QGIS plugin form.

         *.shp                     n.a.                   *.shpf             program and is then switched inside the program to create the impact
                                                                             functions.


Description of Software Risk Outputs

InaSAFE is currently in production; it currently outputs building loss (as
a function of MMI) and damage state, and can also calculate economic
losses based on floor area and contents/building value.
It calculates fatalities using a PAGER function or an ITB (Bandung
Institute of Technology) function. Displaced people are also calculated
via population density.
It has a great tool for measuring shelter needs, even calculating the
amount of rice, drinking water, family kits, and toilets needed.
The losses, shown in the form of a GIS file within QGIS, are easy to view.
The sidebar also provides an easy-to-view loss summary.


                                                                                 Screenshot of the Padang 2009 earthquake (inasafe.org 2013).




   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ This is a wonderful tool that allows the “plug and play” addition of hazard and exposure layers into the system.
✓ It explains concepts clearly so that novice users are able to understand them.
✓ It is supported by a very good developer community and a very good manual system.
✓ It is easy to adjust functions and to read the code.
✕ It uses an ITB fatality function based on four earthquakes in which the MMI was only simulated and did not match the actual event (though
the beauty of InaSAFE is that it can be changed and is extendable).
✕ It is still in the test phase, and still needs additional functionality.




   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
This software would fit well both with ShakeMap utilities for rapid loss and with detailed scenario hazard estimates. It would benefit from the
following: synergy with MAEviz to explore possible end modules to be coded; synergy with an additional hazard module (possibly MAEviz or
EQRM); and some form of additional socioeconomic analysis with respect to indicators.

                                    Another Hazus-based application, MAEviz (Mid-America Earthquakes Visualization) was developed to perform seismic risk assessment in the
                                    middle U.S. states. At first glance, it seems specialized; however, its huge potential can be seen in the flowchart of analysis procedures (48 and
                                    counting) and its complete Hazus system, including detailed algorithms. The visually driven system uses a combination of Sakai (an open source
                                    web portal), NEESgrid (a framework of tools to allow researchers to collaborate), and SAM (Scientific Annotation Middleware) in order to allow
                                    users to add their own hazard data. It is easily extendable; the European Union (EU) project SYNER-G, for example, has added a large fragility

                                       Advantages and Disadvantages


                                    ✓ The software is completely open source and features inbuilt GIS; it is well formatted with the GIS user interfaces.
                                    ✓ It is easily the best software for scenario risk assessment and decision support (mitigation, benefit-cost).
                                    ✓ It has an outstanding array of modules that provide end analysis such as shelter needs or business interruption.
                                    ✓ There is a developer community, and the function codes are easy to read and improve.
                                    ✓ Basic users find it easy to use; it offers a large array of infrastructure types for analysis.
                                    ✓ Combining detailed hazard, detailed vulnerability, and management and risk modelling, the software is easily extendable.
                                    ✕ It is currently tuned only for deterministic analysis.



                                       Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                    mHARP will give this fantastic software an additional use. It should be integrated with Deltares or other risk software, given the common
                                    structure. It has already been integrated in HAZturk and SYNER-G.
                                    A combination with EQRM for probabilistic modelling would be useful.
                                    An InaSAFE-style command system could simplify the software even further for the most basic users, but it is currently fairly user-friendly.

   Goal and Summary of the Software

Currently in the production phase, the software is being designed to calculate earthquake risk transparently for any location on the globe at
various levels (country, regional, local). The release date was moved from 2013 to 2014. In the demonstration of the software, hazard can be
calculated using multiple PSHA methods (classical and event based) as well as deterministic scenarios analyzed via the NRML XML files (Natural
Markup Language). Vulnerability is then input in the form of fragility functions via xml to create a variety of risk outputs.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

Risk outputs will include losses for nonstructural, structural, contents,
and occupancy for residential buildings.
The software creates loss curves, aggregated loss curves, loss maps
(currently output in xml), fractional loss ratios, benefit-cost ratios,
damage distribution and various aggregated loss ratios, and event loss
tables for a particular taxonomy, or scenario losses and damage.
Handling of fatalities and social losses is still being developed but will
likely use PAGER-type loss functions associated with structural loss, or
the empirical functions.

*v1 was originally due for release in April 2013; however, it was not available at the time of publication. The software should be
 retested once a full version is released.

   Advantages and Disadvantages
✓ Software includes a wide range of hazard and risk analysis tools, with a very good hazard section allowing for all types of sources, as well as
  fault and strain rate analysis.
✓ The source code and test case are promising for Messina 1908.
✓ It currently offers the most in-depth probabilistic analysis of any of the reviewed software packages for earthquake, accounting for classical
  PSHA as well as event-based PSHA.
✓ It provides a consensus from some earthquake experts globally through a stakeholder process for some parts of the software.
✕ It looks only at residential buildings.
✕ It is not known whether all data are freely available and open, or whether the all components of the software are open source.
✕ No GUI is currently available; the installation procedure through OATS had many difficulties, and the software will likely be difficult for non-
 engineers to use.


   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
For the software to be useful externally, a stand-alone GUI with data is required.
The installation procedure needs to be improved (note that software is still in the test, preproduction phase).
Before the software’s release, it is hard to propose possible synergies, but given that the Python-coded EQRM joins well with the Global
Earthquake Model (GEM), there is a natural synergy between OpenQuake and these two software packages.

                                    The software creates deterministic and (in the future) probabilistic direct and indirect socioeconomic loss estimates for earthquakes for all types
                                    of assets, networks, and population, and includes all secondary hazards. It uses a wide array of builders, combining assets (input of buildings,
                                    infrastructure, etc.), aggregation (method to combine assets), hazard (defining the hazard model to be used), fragility (to create fragility curves),
                                    and mitigation (to perform analysis of changes in infrastructure quality).

                                    Description of Software Risk Outputs

                                    An empirical method is used to create loss using MDRs for different
                                    infrastructure types from the intensity with a continuous function to 1.0.
                                    Casualties are calculated in much the same way from a mean collapse

                                       Advantages and Disadvantages


                                    ✓ Graphical user interface and tool builders are very easy to understand and a pleasure to use.
                                    ✓ Output of the analysis can be done in many forms (pdf, xls, in software, kml, shp).
                                    ✓ Historical earthquakes and the various builders are very easy to use. This is one of the most user-friendly packages!
                                    ✕ There is not a transparent explanation of how the different functions are calculated.
                                    ✕ The software is not itself open source, and the code is unavailable.
                                    ✕ The software itself is quite simplistic in terms of the features to calculate—e.g., simple curves.




                                       Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                    The integration of an EQRM-style analysis would be useful. Essentially, the RiskScape model is dominated by the hazard layer, which is limited to
                                    MMI in New Zealand. The probabilistic model will provide an additional boost to the software. Other software packages should understand the
                                    benefits of working with RiskScape, given the large effort that has gone into making the software user-friendly. The software should be open

   Goal and Summary o the So tware
SELENA (Seismic Loss EstimatioN using a logic tree Approach) has been produced by NORSAR with support rom the International Centre or
Geohazards, Norway, and essentially uses the Hazus damage probability methodology in a stand-alone Octave ormat, which has been
calibrated to Oslo conditions. SELENA uses a logic tree approach based on the weighting o the input parameters in order to consider epistemic
uncertainty. Hazard analysis is probabilistic, real-time, or deterministic; the capacity spectrum method is used to ind the per ormance point
and damage.

Description o So tware Risk Outputs

The so tware produces text iles o ive damage states in terms o built
area, number o buildings, and probability per building type. The cost o
repair is simply calculated by repair/replacement per m2, giving a total
direct economic loss value on a geounit basis. Uninhabitable units and
debris computation are also included on a geounit level.
Social losses are calculated in terms o deaths and injuries (three
levels), based on occupancy ratio, the structural damage, and a user
input casualty rate.
Occupancy patterns are taken into account using the Hazus
methodology (night, day, to/ rom work), and the text iles give the
results or these three times.
Plotting can occur in RiSe (a Google Earth display acility as part o
SELENA) as an aggregated or disaggregated ile with 16 percent, 84                      RISE output rom SELENA and the GUI inter ace.
percent, and logic tree options.



   Advantages and Disadvantages


 The so tware has an easy-to-use GUI, and the Hazus methodology is easy to use once the text iles are prepared.
 It allows all types o disaggregation and logic trees in order to calculate loss.
 It uses Octave, an easy programming language, and also has a nice viewer (RiSE).
 Outputs are quite di icult to manipulate compared to other so tware packages.
 The number o text iles that need to be input makes it complicated to run without errors; headers need to be in the right spot, and the use o
many geounits and building types and occupancy contributes to the di iculty.




   Recommended Improvements or Greater Utility
The original text ile system should be re ormatted, and the GUI inter ace should be integrated with this system. Currently, there is no intensity
measurement, though one would be a use ul addition or low-moderate seismicity countries with a lack o ground motion records. The logic tree
component lends itsel to being adapted into other so tware packages.

                                                 Goal and Summary of the Software
                                              The software calculates deterministic and event set probabilistic risk for buildings using continuous fragility functions. CAPRA-Hurricane is the
                                              hazard module that can create a set of events for hurricane paths. CAPRA NHRain and CAPRA-Flood are combined for creating water column
                                              depth. Once there is output, the vulnerability module (CAPRA-Vulnerabilidad) allows computation of fragility functions that are essentially user
                                              driven and based on flood height and wind speed. Uncertainty is user driven with a simple variance. CAPRA-GIS is used for the quantification of
                                              the loss.

                                              Description of Software Risk Outputs

                                              Human losses can be calculated directly from a vulnerability function.
                                              In addition, economic losses are output in a *.res format file.

                                              curves for loss are output.
                                              Losses are displayed per building in the CAPRA-GIS window, providing
                                              an easy view of loss.
                                              Landslides can also be calculated in relation to losses, as rainfall often
                                              causes problems.

                                                 Advantages and Disadvantages

                                              ✓ Hazard is not hardwired, and could be input from any other program as long as the file is in the right format.
                                              ✓ The log files are very good, and the individual file production means the rerun capabilities are very good.
                                              ✓ The CAPRA-Hurricane package works well, CAPRA-Vuln and CAPRA-GIS combine well to allow users to understand the loss.
                                              ✓ Inbuilt GIS related directly to the loss calculations is very useful. GIS is modular and extendable.
                                              ✕ The fatality functions and economic functions lack diversity, with only a direct relationship available, the damage distribution is not calculated
                                               directly, and only an MDR is available.
                                              ✕ No formal manual is provided, and with its mix of Spanish and English, the entire GUI is quite difficult to maneuver – with novice users, it will

                                              The wind speed measurement should be calculated using pressure and other parameters available. Software could learn from TCRM about the
                                              hazard module. Some Hazus functions should be applied, and hazard file converters should be more functional. The methodology would work
                                              well in a MAEviz environment..

   Goal and Summary of the Software
The software calculates hurricane damage to infrastructure and populations over a U.S. census tract, county, or state. The exposure module has
around 5,000 unique building types, based on roof types, etc. There are many functions for each building type. The hazard module is based on
user-defined or historical hurricanes, which can be converted for probabilistic analyses or analyzed individually. The vulnerability method is
based on the peak gust speed versus a damage probability using empirical curves. This approach allows for the calculation of losses to buildings
and essential facilities (other types not supported as yet).

Description of Software Risk Outputs

Losses are based on buildings and essential facilities (loss of use and
damage state). Software calculates the damage states based on a
lognormal pdf versus the hazard metric. Debris is calculated along with
tree blowdown.
The output is in the form of an ArcGIS display of hazard and the relative
losses to buildings and population. Tables and reports are also created.
Shelter, temporary housing, and displaced households are calculated
through calibration with historical losses and building damage. In
addition, direct (structural, nonstructural, contents, inventory) and
indirect economic losses are taken into account with downtime and
business interruption functions. These are calibrated for U.S. conditions.

   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ There is a detailed technical and user manual with full disclosure concerning data and assumptions for fragility, hazard, and loss functions.
 BCR calculators and mitigation aspects are also part of the decision module.
✓ The package worked well combined with earthquake and flood.
✓ It includes many groupings of buildings and loss estimates that are based on U.S. building typologies and expert judgment.
✓ The GUI and system of analysis for hurricanes works well, allowing inclusion of new storm tracks.
✕ The software is heavily calibrated to U.S. conditions and difficult to apply to other locations.
✕ Although free, the package cannot operate without commercial software (ArcGIS).
✕ No fatality modelling is currently undertaken.



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

Hazus is not currently open source, and there are no hurricane loss analyses apart from the CAPRA and RiskScape software packages. The
addition of transportation and power outages would be useful. Hazus could be integrated into the MAEviz methodology.

                                              The software creates deterministic and (in the future) probabilistic direct and indirect socioeconomic loss estimates for wind gusts for all types
                                              of assets, networks, and population, and includes all secondary hazards. It uses a wide array of builders, combining assets (input of buildings,
                                              infrastructure, etc.), aggregation (method to combine assets), hazard (defining the hazard model to be used), fragility (to create fragility curves),
                                              and mitigation (to perform analysis of changes in infrastructure quality). For wind, a few test cases have been undertaken using the BLASIUS,
                                              RAMS, and GERRIS modelling of wind fields for locations in New Zealand.

                                                 Advantages and Disadvantages

                                              ✓ The GUI and tool builders are very easy to understand.
                                              ✓ Output of the analysis can be done in many forms (pdf, xls, in software, kml, shp).
                                              ✓ The various builders are very easy to use.
                                              ✕ There is not a transparent explanation of how wind speed is calculated (individual model equations are available for the three methods so far
                                               used in manuals, but not for the application in RiskScape).
                                              ✕ The software is not open source as such, and the code is unavailable online.
                                              ✕ The software itself is quite simplistic in terms of the features to calculate—e.g., simple curves.




                                                 Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                              The integration of a TCRM-style analysis would be useful. Essentially, the model is dominated by the hazard layer, and the vulnerability functions
                                              are not transparent. Much more study related to wind storm modelling is needed. Currently, RiskScape cannot really be integrated with other
                                              software packages.

   Goal and Summary of the Software
TCRM (Tropical Cyclone Risk Model) is a stochastic event simulator for tropical cyclone hazard. It uses wind field modelling distributions, which
can be mathematically and statistically derived from a variety of methods, to simulate a user-input number of years of activity and create either
a probabilistic view of wind speeds or just a single scenario. Having so many distributions available allows the user to see the sensitivities
associated with stochastic modelling. Although created in Australia, this software could potentially be used anywhere. Lists of historical events
can be input from the IBTrACS data set using tropical cyclone serial numbers and locations, and then defining radius of maximum wind, mean
sea level pressure, and distribution to fit the wind field profile and boundary layer method. Different return periods are then input for the wind
hazard calculation

   Advantages and Disadvantages


✓ The software package is easy to use—and widely used—for creating tropical cyclone tracks with many different wind field profiles and
  distributions.
✓ The data set supplied has all the data needed to run the model and is provided freely.
✓ The GUI is fantastic—the format is easy to use and help files are included.
✕ The advconfigeditor.exe should be renamed in order to prevent confusion.
✕ As with EQRM, installing MinGW, SciPy, and NumPy can be problematic depending on the version of Windows being used. There are fewer
  problems with Linux.



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

This software would work well with nearly every model, given the diversity and ease of coding. It currently addresses only hazard, so it cannot
be compared with risk models.

                               Zurich to determine the impact of river corrections. The whole program is developed for hydraulic purposes to analyze river flow and flood
                               potentials. It offers many modelling possibilities including sediment transport, erosion and both steady and unsteady modes. It also includes
                               many algorithms and calculation methods (optimisation techniques). Basechain is a 1D numerical tool for river reach simulation. BASEplane is a
                               2D numerical tool for river reach simulation. Both of them are primarily hazard based.

                               Description of Software Risk Outputs

                               There are essentially no risk outputs, as there are no modules for
                               vulnerability or exposure analysis included. The hazard model is the
                               output of the software and produces a detailed inundation map.
                               1D Saint-Venant, 2D shallow water, and 3D Navier-Stokes equations are
                               solved in all domains, as well as the output of depth and velocity. The
                               software also explores geography of channels.
                               Some nice visualizations are possible through the BASEviz module.

                                  Advantages and Disadvantages


                               ✓ The manual explains the process well and also explains the parallel performance available in the code.
                               ✓ There are good topographic input and grid components, as well as a large range of numerical models.
                               ✓ The hazard model is sound and provides nice solutions to channel transport and flow.
                               ✕ The software needs a lot of time to run (slow calculation speed).
                               ✕ It is not easy to use and takes longer to learn than other flood software.
                               ✕ There is no vulnerability or risk module.




                                  Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                               This software would benefit from an associated risk module. It is not currently open source, meaning that changing many of the functions is not
                               possible. The software itself provides a good format, being coded with links to Python; thus it could be used in some existing pursuits such as
                               InaSAFE.

   Goal and Summary of the Software
CAPRA-Flood is a simple tool for determining flood hazard. It uses rainfall data produced by the module, CAPRA-Lluvia, and hydraulic
calculations, which are performed by a link to HEC-RAS. It takes multiple factors into account, such as mean velocity, depth, and rainfall, and
also includes uncertainties. Its use of the HEC-RAS calculation engine makes it a fast and rather simple tool for evaluating risk and return
periods based on precipitation data. For basin analysis, it calculates rainfall data based on geographical data (provided by simple shp files) and
PADF (precipitation, area, duration and frequency) curves, which should be provided as txt files. A short manual is also included, which explains
the theoretical background and the functionality of the program. Once there is output, the vulnerability module (CAPRA-Vulnerabilidad) allows
computation of modifiable inundation depth fragility functions. CAPRA-GIS is used for the quantification of the loss based on the input hazard
set for a particular exposure. The software is in both Spanish and English.

*.ame(main), *.txt, *.grn      *.fvu, *.dat                 *.shp           rainfall. For floods, rainfall runoff is calculated to give a flood depth.
                                                                            Unit velocity can also be calculated, and various hydrograph methods
                                                                            can be used.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

Human losses can be calculated directly from a vulnerability function.
In addition, economic losses are output in a *.res format file.
For flood events, the exposure value, as well as EP (expected loss),
VarP (variance of the loss) and the beta distribution (a, b), are outputs
from the input list.
AAL over a set of buildings or one building, PML, and exceedance
curves for loss are output.
Losses are displayed per building in the CAPRA-GIS window, providing
an easy view of loss.

   Advantages and Disadvantages
✓ Hazard is not hardwired, and could be input from any other program as long as the file is in the right format.
✓ The log files are very good, and the individual file production means the rerun capabilities are very good.
✓ The process of going through the hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, and then building the functions, helps the basic user to understand the
 problem. Variability and uncertainty are handled well.
✓ Inbuilt GIS related directly to the loss calculations is very useful; GIS is modular and extendable.
✕ The fatality functions and economic functions lack diversity, with only a direct relationship available.
✕ The damage distribution is not calculated directly and is based only on inundation depth, not flow.
✕ No formal manual is provided, and with its mix of Spanish and English, the entire GUI is quite difficult to maneuver.



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

Capra-Flood could be combined with Kalypso or Deltares for flood hazard; specifically, some end functions from these software could be added
to CAPRA-Flood.

                               Delft-3D-Flow calculates solutions for unsteady flow using meteorological and tidal forcing upon a curvilinear (or rectangular) grid. The software
                               can therefore model all tidal flow regimes, tsunamis, and river flow simulations. The software is compatible with all other modules in Delft3D. It
                               allows for 3D flow modeling within and around engineering structures, making it a useful tool for locations or projects that may consider flood
                               control structures.

                               Description of Software Risk Outputs

                               The inundation depth, flow, and other hydrodynamic characteristics, as
                               well as turbulence quantities, are output to a file after processing. All
                               forms of 2D/3D equations are solved from Navier-Stokes
                               incompressible free surface flow. Boundary conditions and other details
                               such as wind, control structures, and cross sections are also output to
                               files. This approach makes rerun very easy.
                               Coupled with HIS-SSM, there are certain opportunities and possibilities
                               to change the calculated hazard values into risk values. These changes
                               have not been implemented in open source as yet. The software could
                               potentially use the flood layers calculated as part of a 3D-FLOW
                               scenario.

✓ The software is well suited to modelling 3D flow; it takes all boundary phenomena and details into account.
                               ✓ It offers many application possibilities (rivers, storm, tide, tsunami) and is coupled with all other Deltares software.
                               ✓ Large-scale analysis is possible (limited only by computing power).
                               ✓ The user can choose from many inbuilt functions for each part of the calculation—e.g., fitting coefficients.
                               ✕ For risk assessment, the computation is quite difficult to use, with many inputs needed (3D modelling).
                               ✕ To review results, the software needs external tools such as Delft3D-WAVE.

                               This software package is state-of-the-art. Further development of risk products on the end of the software is potentially a collaboration point.
                               Combining with MAEviz, TCRM, or CAPRA would also be a natural progression to improve the software’s risk output capability.

   Goal and Summary of the Software

The software calculates flood damage to infrastructure and populations over a U.S. census tract, county, or state. The hazard is based on an
input of a set of floods, or a scenario flood using depth-discharge frequency. A combination of hydraulic and hydrologic modelling is added to a
digital elevation model (DEM). Hydrologic modelling is done via stream gauge data and a regression equation for discharge frequency for each
reach. Hydraulic modelling is done in 2D, using cross sections, Manning’s n, and all flow regimes. The estimates are confined to within the
floodplain. The relationship to inundation depth is generally used within the flood vulnerability module.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

Losses are based on buildings, essential facilities, transportation, and
utilities. The software calculates the damage based on occupancy and
count. A lognormal pdf versus inundation depth is used.
The output is in the form of an ArcGIS display of hazard and the relative
losses to infrastructure and population.
Social losses are calculated via a simple function, whereas shelter
needs are analyzed in depth. In addition, direct (cost of repair, income
loss, and agricultural damage) and indirect economic losses are taken
into account with downtime and business interruption functions. These
are calibrated for U.S. conditions.

   Advantages and Disadvantages
✓ The software includes a detailed technical and user manual with full disclosure as to all data and assumptions used with respect to fragility,
 hazard, and loss functions. BCR calculators and mitigation aspects are also part of the decision module.
✓ The software includes many groupings of buildings and loss estimates based on U.S. building typologies and expert judgment.
✓ The GUI and system of analysis for floods are good. The analysis is very sound, using 1D/2D and hydraulic and hydrological modelling.
✕ The software is heavily calibrated to U.S. conditions; the depth-damage functions are from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and are
  applicable to U.S. building types.
✕ Although free, the package cannot operate without commercial software (ArcGIS).



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
Hazus is not itself open source, but it can be considered a learning tool for other open source software packages. It provides a useful estimate
of flood risk for anywhere in the United States. It allows for transference (or testing of the transference) of flood loss curves which could be used
for other software packages like CAPRA or in other locations (as long as the US damage functions and assumptions hold).

                               The HEC Suite allows the modelling o lood risk in its entirety— rom hazard through to loss and then decision support in an easy-to-use
                               Windows environment. It was designed by the U.S. Army Corps o Engineers or U.S. lood modelling. HEC-RAS undertakes 1D low
                               measurements to model hydraulic low o rivers. It is probably the best known lood hazard so tware in the world. It can also model lood
                               structures and sediment transport. HEC-HMS is the rain all-runo model; it includes urban and rural overland modelling, watershed runo , and
                               other water supply processes. These are combined with other tools or lood requency statistics calculation (HEC-SSP) and geospatial
                               modelling (HEC-GeoRas). The risk components are then modelled in HEC-FDA and HEC-FIA.

                               Description o So tware Risk Outputs

                               HEC-FIA uses hydraulic inputs in the orm o depth grids and duration
                               grids or hydrograph data to calculate risks or single events using an
                               entire hydrograph. Economic losses are then calculated using location
                               data input rom Hazus, parcel data, or existing point data.
                               Li e loss calculations can be undertaken in a module called Li eSim,
                               which is the most advanced atality system among so tware packages
                               that use indicator systems to model potential atalities. Agricultural
                               losses can be calculated using crop and harvest details.
                               HEC-FDA is a probabilistic or deterministic methodology using the peak
                               o the hydrographs. It looks at contents loss analysis, too. Annualized
                               loss, annual damage, annual exceedance probabilities, and other
                               conditional data are calculated, and uncertainty analysis is carried out
                               as well. Risk analysis and visualization are also created.
                                                                                                                    Floodway determination: Perspective plot in HEC-RAS.

                                  Advantages and Disadvantages

                                 HEC Suite provides an impressive array o so tware, given the ull lood risk approach. There are around 15 tools that make up the suite, all o
                                 them reeware, and they have been developed over many years.
                                 Li e loss and economic losses are calculated easily rom the outputs o FDA and FIA.
                                 Tutorials with reely available data are o ered, and there are very good manuals and data sets.
                                 The GUIs are very easy to use, and or irst-time users make a lot o sense.
                                 The major drawback is the absence o source code, meaning that the so tware is not open source



                                  Recommended Improvements or Greater Utility

                               I the source code could be obtained, then this so tware would be the best or lood. HEC-RAS will also change to 2D modelling soon. For now,
                               the best that can be done is to look at and learn rom the methodology, and then apply it to a so tware such as Kalypso or Deltares Sobek.

   Goal and Summary of the Software


This software links the science community to those in the planning and policy community seeking to understand a flood impact scenario.
Created as a project of the AIFDR, World Bank, and GFDRR, it is a plugin that takes exposure inputs (population, buildings from OpenStreetMap,
or other shapefiles) and hazard inputs (inundation depth raster over the scenario area, from any open software), and then uses simple
vulnerability functions to calculate an output through a simple-to-use GUI in a QGIS plugin form.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

InaSAFE is currently in production; however, it currently outputs
building loss (as a function of inundation depth) in terms of a 1 or 0
function. This could be adapted by the user.
Displaced people are also calculated using population density and the
buildings impacted by the flood raster. The software looks not only at
the number of displaced, but also at the resources needed to support
them.
InaSAFE has a great tool for measuring various shelter needs, even
calculating the amount of rice, drinking water, family kits, and toilets
needed.
The losses are shown in the form of a GIS file within QGIS that is easy
to view.

                                                                                               Screenshot of a Jakarta flood example.



   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ This is a wonderful tool that allows the “plug and play” addition of hazard and exposure layers to the system.
✓ It explains concepts clearly so that novice users are able to understand them.
✓ The developer community makes it possible for researchers to adapt functions and easily contribute.
✓ OpenStreetMap and QGIS connectivity are very easy to use.
✕ The software is still in the test phase, and needs additional functionality.
✕ There is no numerical model for flood or water depth inside the software, though this is not necessarily a negative.



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
This software would fit well with many decision support modules of Kalypso and SOBEK for rapid loss, as well as any detailed scenario hazard
estimates. It would benefit from some synergy with MAEviz to explore possible end modules to be coded. The software would also benefit from
synergy with an additional hazard module, possibly a simple form such as NoFDP IDSS. Some form of additional socioeconomic analysis with
respect to indicators would also improve it.

                                  Goal and Summary of the Software

                               Kalypso is a multi-module program for calculations about hydrology (rainfall-runoff), water-level analysis, 1D/2D analysis, flood calculation, and
                               risk determination. All these modules are linked together. The main focus is on deterministic hydrological calculations of river basins and floods.
                               The user can start with hydrological analysis, which takes into account elements such as precipitation, rainfall, etc., and then continue to the risk
                               calculation. It was originally built for German river locations. The risk calculation uses land-use data based on user input. The resolution of the
                               calculations is quite nice, while the complexity of the modules decreases moving from the hazard to risk, meaning that the hydrological part is
                               quite complex, while the modules for flood and risk are rather simple.

                               Description of Software Risk Outputs

                               The risk outputs include entire hazard inundation maps for various
                               return periods (between 2 and 100 years). Land use and other
                               parameters can be input in order to give the risk. In Kalypso Risk, the
                               parameters are combined as a damage function in an open format,
                               using a function versus inundation depth or duration/frequency. This
                               can have the form “x-” or a straight value, and it is then multiplied by
                               the economic value to give loss.
                               This design allows the software to be easily manipulated, and fatalities
                               could technically be calculated by manipulating the software.

                               ✓ The wiki-style system and manual for each component make the software easy to use. The results also have multiple export options.
                               ✓ The GUI and GIS (through QGIS) are state-of-the-art and are easy to use, well-developed, and up-to-date.
                               ✓ There are multiple options for optimization in terms of short-time and long-time modelling.
                               ✕ As with most flood analyses, the risk and flood modules are too simple. The vulnerability analysis is essentially constructed with the hazard
                               parameter overlaid on exposure.
                               ✕ The software focuses mostly on German conditions, and the manuals are mostly in German.



                                  Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                               TThis software should be combined with MAEviz, given the modular structure. It would benefit from the many modules on the end of it, as well
                               as common language types in the structure. The shelter and evacuation modules are well suited for combining. The addition of fragility
                               functions would help Kalypso. InaSAFE could learn from the simplicity of Kalypso’s modules.

   Goal and Summary of the Software


Produced as part of the INTERREG III project, NoFDP IDSS is an easy-to-use 1D program for developing, optimizing, and analyzing solutions for
risk reduction. It contains the Deltares hydrological calculation tool SOBEK. IDSS is completely open source, as is SOBEK, so the two can now be
combined. IDSS covers multiple modules for the import of geo-data and includes a simple GIS engine to edit the data. It also contains a link to
ISAR, a calculation concept based on vegetation factors and renaturation. It is the precursor to Kalypso and has many links back to SOBEK.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

The program calculates the flooded areas due to different flood
scenarios (return periods of 50 years, 100 years, etc.) and uses land-use
information by CORINE to calculate economic damage (much as the
Kalypso Risk module does). Multiple building and single building
analysis are not covered within the calculation, but this information can
be obtained by more detailed land-use data. A variety of flood
structures can also be modelled.
The focus is on determining and calculating risk reduction variants and
comparing them to each other by economic social parameter. This
decision-support aspect is the most interesting part of NoFDP IDSS. The
program also contains a number of collaboration tools, such as
automatic report generator (based on Open Office), a screenshot
database, and a link to Google Earth.
                                                                                              NoFDP IDSS scenario screen.



   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ The decision module is very easy to use for basic users, and allows for multivariate analysis.
✓ There is a risk reduction focus as well as collaboration tools.
✓ The open source outputs are useful, and the Google Earth screens are easy to understand and use.
✕ 1D analysis undertaken with SOBEK has not been updated since the end of INTERREG III in 2006.
✕ There is little information about the steps within the risk analysis.




   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

Not all options that are in NoFDP IDSS have yet been added to Kalypso, though they will probably be added in the future. The software would be
improved with a powerful model such as SOBEK 1D/2D.

                                  Advantages and Disadvantages
                                 The GUI and tool builders are very easy to understand and a pleasure to use.
                                 Output o the analysis can be done in many orms (pd , xls, in so tware, kml, shp.)
                                 Historical loods examined within the so tware and the various builders are very easy to use. This allows or a ast view o the possible
                                 analysis that can be undertaken.
                                 There is not a transparent explanation o how the di erent unctions are calculated.
                                 The so tware is not itsel open source, and the code is unavailable.
                                 The so tware itsel is quite simplistic in terms o the eatures to calculate—e.g., simple curves.



                                  Recommended Improvements or Greater Utility

                               The way RiskScape portrays the loss in ormation with outputs and shows the need or detailed DEMs is impressive and could be combined with
                               a probabilistic engine or a Deltares-type so tware.

   Goal and Summary o the So tware
SOBEK undertakes all types o 1D/2D hydrodynamic modelling by solving low equations on both 1D network systems and 2D horizontal grids.
This approach can be used or river lood orecasting and modelling, overland looding, drainage system modelling, and engineering structure
testing (dam breaks, breaches, rural and urban looding). It is computationally e icient and allows or all low regimes. SOBEK 1D can be run
through two modules—pipes and examining overland low. It can also be coupled with D-Rain all Runo Open Water, which creates event sets or
separate events. SOBEK 2D gives three options or downloading, including rural, urban, and river modelling, which consists o an overland low
module in 2D and a rain all-runo model.

Description o So tware Risk Outputs

The main output is the inundation depth at di erent time periods on
the spatial scale de ined, along with the low velocities. In both 1D and
2D, the hydrograph methods are changeable, and the complete set o
Saint-Venant equations is solved. The rain all-runo model can be
either distributed or lumped; it allows analysis o many catchments and
input o historical rain all or production o rain all patterns. Note,
however, that there are essentially only hazard outputs. They can be
viewed in a GIS plat orm along with all 1D network and 2D grid
structures.
HIS-SSM could be connected to Sobek in order to calculate casualties
and damage associated with representative scenarios o the outputs
 rom the SOBEK suite.

*HIS-SSM is currently not combined in the so tware, but can be included ree o charge upon request.

   Advantages and Disadvantages

  The so tware provides all solutions or 1D and 2D lood modelling, with pipes, overland, rural, urban, and river modules.
  It is simple to install and very easy to use. The end products are easily viewable.
  It is compatible with OpenMI (along with other Del t products), which allows or user adaption.
  The programming is designed to be very ast, with e icient computation structures.
  Unless the so tware is combined with HIS-SSM, only hazard outputs are produced.
  Not currently ully open source at time o review.*



   Recommended Improvements or Greater Utility

This so tware o ers a antastic basis or lood hazard modelling, and the so tware structure works very well. SOBEK (and all the Deltares
products) would combine well with CAPRA, TSUDAT, InaSAFE, or MAEviz.

                               The software is a set of mathematical solvers for various equations related to free surface flow. Many of these can be used for floods and
                               waves. It has been very well tested, with over 200 applications worldwide to date. A finite element method (FEM) grid is set up and discretized
                               into triangles, with the numerical modelling then being undertaken to solve 1D/2D/3D equations. The various module parts are ARTEMIS (wave
                               modelling in harbors), MASCARET (1D surface), TELEMAC-2D (2D Saint-Venant), TELEMAC-3D (3D Navier-Stokes), SISYPHE (2D sediment
                               transport), and SEDI-3D (3D sediment transport). STBTEL is used to build the grid interface. The GUI is provided through BlueKenue or a software
                               called FUDAA, which allows the grid to be generated. POSTEL-3D also allows creation of 2D sections from 3D simulations. It consists of a series

                               Description of Software Risk Outputs

                               Some risk outputs of TELEMAC include the inundation modelling based
                               on dam breaks, embankment failures, and other structural breaks. Risk
                               as such is not calculated; however, a few applications have used
                               TELEMAC-MASCARET for risk production.
                               Though often overlooked, TELEMAC is a very powerful solver suite; in
                               the 1D it can solve all flow regimes (subcritical, supercritical), as well as
                               steady and unsteady flows. TELEMAC-2D has been well set up for
                               supercomputing and is currently part of the PRACE (Partnership for
                               Advanced Computing in Europe) project that models flooding of the
                               Rhine.
                               There is the potential to include an open source risk output package on

                                  Advantages and Disadvantages
                               ✓ Validation is a key parameter checking the output; the software has been ratified by the International Association for Hydro-Environment
                                 Engineering and Research (IAHR), and there is documentation of these validation cases.
                               ✓ The software provides all the tools necessary for wave and inundation modelling via solving equations.
                               ✓ The code is in Fortran and easily downloadable for use in any application.
                               ✓ There is quite a large user community for these tools.
                               ✕ The software is not for basic users, and using it for applications requires considerable manipulation.
                               ✕ There is no risk calculation within the software.



                                  Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

                               This software should be examined in greater depth; however, it definitely offers a very useful set of libraries and tools to integrate into flood and
                               wave modelling. It has natural synergies with any of the risk modules, including HEC-FIA, Kalypso, Sobek HIS-SSM, CAPRA, or NoFDP IDSS.

   Goal and Summary of the Software

The software calculates deterministic and event set probabilistic risk for tsunamis, using continuous fragility functions. CRISIS2007 is the hazard
module that can create an event set using source geometries of a particular annual frequency for tsunami generation. Inundation depths are
then produced from topography and bathymetry. Once output, the vulnerability module, CAPRA-Vulnerabilidad, allows computation of fragility
functions, which are essentially user driven. Uncertainty is user driven with a simple variance. CAPRA-GIS is used for quantifying the loss based
on the input hazard set for a particular exposure, and then Map Viewer CAPRA-WWJ, a visualization tool using the NASA WorldWind Java SDK
engine, is used. Storm surge is handled as part of CAPRA-Hurricane.

  *.ame(main), *.tsu,
                               *.fvu, *.dat         *.shp, *.grn, *.dat    from hurricane tracks or tsunami (wave height). Both need the

                                                                           bathymetry and topography data.


Description of Software Risk Outputs

Human losses can be calculated directly from a vulnerability function.
In addition, economic losses are output in a *.res format file.
For the list of tsunamis and/or storm surge events, the exposure value
as well as EP (expected loss), VarP (variance of the loss), and the beta
distribution (a, b) are output.
AAL over a set of buildings or one building, PML, and exceedance
curves for loss are output.
Losses are displayed per building in the CAPRA-GIS window, providing
an easy view of loss.

   Advantages and Disadvantages
✓ Hazard is not hardwired, and could be input from any other program as long as the file is in the right format.
✓ The software provides both tsunami and storm surge options.
✓ The log files are very good, and the individual file production means the rerun capabilities are very good.
✓ The tutorials help a basic user to understand the problem.
✓ Inbuilt GIS related directly to the loss calculations is very useful; GIS is modular and extendable.
✕ The fatality functions and economic functions lack diversity, with only a direct relationship available.
✕ The damage distribution is not calculated directly and is based only on inundation depth, not velocity; the model is a simple one. It is unclear
  where roughness is used in terms of assumptions.
✕ No formal manual is provided, and with its mix of Spanish and English, the GUI is quite difficult to maneuver.

   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
CAPRA would benefit from a more formal tsunami methodology, such as that of TsuDAT. An inbuilt historical tsunami database would also help
users to create the event set. There should be additional calibration of loss functions, though there are fewer functions available in other
software tools.

                                                 Delft-3D-Wave is a GUI-based application using the SWAN model and the HISWA model, both of which are strong calculation engines for
                                                 hydraulic flow and waves. The software can look at wind-generated waves in coastal waters, examining all depths of water, and can model
                                                 wave generation, propagation, and breaking problems of short-crested random waves. It needs a lot of advanced-user input, but is one of the
                                                 most powerful numerical tools for calculating large-scale wave propagation and storm surges. It is usable for estuaries, tidal inlets, lakes, barrier
                                                 islands, channels, and coastal regions. It is coupled to Delft3D-FLOW.

                                                 ✓ It is very fast, using as it does the set of Fortran90 codes based on the third generation SWAN model—though it also allows use of the second
                                                   generation model.
                                                 ✓ There are many application possibilities (storm, tide, tsunami).
                                                 ✓ Large-scale analysis is possible (limited only by computing power).
                                                 ✕ For risk assessment, the computation is quite difficult to carry out, with many inputs needed (3D modelling).
                                                 ✕ It needs external tools to review results.

This software is a link between the science community and those in the planning and policy community seeking to understand a tsunami impact
scenario. Created as a project of the AIFDR, the World Bank, and GFDRR, it is a plugin that takes exposure inputs (population, buildings) and
hazard inputs (tsunami inundation depth) from any Openstreetmap data or software, then uses simple vulnerability functions to calculate an

Description of Software Risk Outputs

InaSAFE is currently in production; however, it currently outputs
buildings that are inundated as a result of a tsunami wave as well as
damage state, and it can also calculate economic losses based on floor
area and contents/building value.
Displaced people are also calculated via the population density.
It has a great tool for measuring various shelter needs, as in the other
InaSAFE modules.
The losses are shown in the form of a GIS file within QGIS and are easy
to view.




                                                                                          Startup screen including the exposure data.



   Advantages and Disadvantages


✓ This is a wonderful tool that allows the “plug and play” addition of hazard and exposure layers to the system.
✓ It explains concepts clearly so that novice users are able to understand them.
✓ Its functions and coding are easy for inexperienced users to understand.
✓ There is a good developer community that promotes interaction.
✕ The software is still in the test phase, and needs additional functionality.




   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
This software would fit well with many functions for rapid loss and any detailed scenario hazard estimates. It would benefit from some synergy
with MAEviz to explore possible end modules to be coded, and could use run-up heights from TsuDAT or CAPRA.
The software would also benefit from synergy with an additional vulnerability function builder for various tsunami impacts globally. Some form
of additional socioeconomic analysis with respect to indicators would make the software more useful for decision makers.

                                                 respective countries. Exposed stock is simply intersected with the hazard layer to create statistics.

   Goal and Summary of the Software

The software creates deterministic and (in the future) probabilistic direct and indirect socioeconomic loss estimates for tsunamis for all types of
assets, networks, and population, and includes all secondary hazards. It uses a wide array of builders, combining assets (input of buildings,
infrastructure, etc.), aggregation (method to combine assets), hazard (defining the hazard model to be used), fragility (to create fragility curve),
and mitigation (to perform analysis of changes in infrastructure quality). The RiCOM model, which solves a Reynolds-averaged 3D wave
equation, has been used so far in test cases. High-resolution topography and bathymetry are also used within the analysis.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

An empirical method is used to create loss, using MDRs for different
infrastructure types from the intensity with a continuous function to 1.0
using an empirical fragility function. RiskScape-Tsunami currently
allows everything except human susceptibility to be calculated.
Damage states, monetary losses via replacement, contents,
nonstructural costs, a number of socioeconomic interruption
parameters, fatalities, injuries, homeless, and uninhabitable buildings
are all calculated over the *.shp aggregation selected. This is not
available for all options in RiskScape.
*.kml outputs are in Google Earth in 3D.
*.shp outputs can be viewed in any GIS program.
*.pdf summary shows the key aspects and maps desired from the
starting panel.
*.xls, *.csv give an Excel readout of the various losses.                     Screenshot of the RiskScape loss output for Hawke’s Bay tsunami.


   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ GUI and tool builders are very easy to understand and a pleasure to use.
✓ Output of the analysis can be done in many forms (pdf, xls, in software, kml, shp).
✓ Mitigation factors, tide levels, and predefined tsunamis can be calculated easily to see the process of tsunami risk assessment.
✕ There is not a transparent explanation of how the different functions are calculated.
✕ The software is not open source, and the code is unavailable.
✕ The software itself is quite simplistic in terms of the features to calculate—e.g., simple curves.




   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
There is a natural link between the Delft3D models, TELEMAC3D models, and the high-resolution modelling attempted by RiskScape. These
models within RiskScape attempt to calculate very in-depth hazard parameters, but there is no one model for hazard in RiskScape. TsuDAT and
RiskScape also should collaborate, given the proximity of the development teams and given that Riskscape currently lacks probabilistic hazard
calculations.

                                                 coastal areas. It does, however, have two use ul eatures that are
                                                 essentially risk indicators: a MEOW and a MOM (maximum o the
                                                 maximums), which is the maximum o all the singular MEOWs or a
                                                 particular basin. Many basins have been modelled, and SLOSH includes
                                                  ive MOMs (Cat 1 MOM, Cat 2 MOM, etc.). These risk indicators are very

                                                   The so tware has a great historical database that is integrated into the so tware.
                                                   It is very well suited or basic users: easy to install, easy to use, and very ast.
                                                   It has only a ew output/export options into .rex, .pcx, and .txt and these are not very use ul.
                                                   The so tware is technologically outdated, and it will be no longer developed.

   Goal and Summary of the Software
The software is part of the set of mathematical solvers for various equations related to free surface flow, a few of which can be used for floods
and waves. In this case, the same FEM grid is set up and discretized into triangles, with the numerical modelling then being undertaken to solve
1D/2D/3D equations. The various module parts are TELEMAC-2D (2D Saint-Venant), for tsunamis with wavelengths in the shallow water domain
(wavelength > 20 times the depth); TELEMAC-3D (3D Navier-Stokes), for shorter wavelengths; and TOMAWAC, for modelling wave propagation in
coastal areas. TOMAWAC uses a solution of spectroangular density of wave action (F = E/pg). STBTEL is also used to build the grid interface.
POSTEL-3D also allows creation of 2D sections from 3D simulations. It consists of a series of Fortran subroutines and functions that is easily
adapted and can be viewed in various programs such as BlueKenue.

Description of Software Risk Outputs

This set of solvers unfortunately does not follow through to risk;
however, the hazard calculation could be integrated directly into risk
assessments. The currents, as well as frequency and duration outputs,
are useful.




                                                                                                 Tomawac output of waves.


   Advantages and Disadvantages

✓ Validation is a key parameter checking the output. The software model has been ratified by IAHR, and there is documentation of these
  validation cases. It provides another useful solver.
✓ The software provides all the tools necessary for wave modelling via solving equations.
✓ The code is in Fortran and easily downloadable for use in any application.
✓ There is quite a large user community.
✕ This is not for basic users, and much manipulation is required in order to use the software for applications.
✕ There is no risk calculation within the software.



   Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility

The tool needs to be examined in greater depth; however, it definitely offers a very useful set of libraries and tools to integrate into wave
modelling. It has natural synergies with any of the risk modules for tsunami, such as Hazus and CAPRA.

                                                 TsuDAT is a calculation software for tsunami inundation, based on the Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment by Geoscience Australia, which
                                                 allows many individual scenarios to be created from 76,000 different modelled synthetic tsunamis. The hazard is calculated at a point of 100m
                                                 depth offshore around Australia. The hazard can then be disaggregated for an event with a defined height and return period, giving a table of
                                                 results. The scenario is then run using the hydrodynamic model, ANUGA, in order to solve the shallow water wave equations over the DEM
                                                 topography and bathymetry data. Offshore time series and ANUGA scripts can be edited, meaning that any inundation code can be used.
                                                 TsuDAT has a variable mesh resolution and friction that can be drawn as polygons by the user.

                                                 The software presents an inundation map of the location that the user
                                                 uploads as a DEM.
                                                 For an engineer or a decision-maker, it is a very good tool for creating a
                                                 map.
                                                 TsuDAT Client also allows the user to analyze the given scenario
                                                 through the NCI (a cloud computing system in Canberra) and then
                                                 receive the results back.
                                                 Currently, no risk model is attached, though a couple of test cases have
                                                 been undertaken internally; on the other hand, the software is
                                                 extendable and the inundation map could be uploaded to InaSAFE or
                                                 analyzed within another environment of flood inundation modelling,

                                                 It should be noted that testing TsuDAT fully was not possible, as it was being updated during this study.

                                                    Advantages and Disadvantages

                                                 ✓ The software’s tsunami hazard methodology is the best of all wave software packages reviewed.
                                                 ✓ The methodology for disaggregating a suitable scenario is better than that of any other package.
                                                 ✓ The ability to “plug and play” the code with any hydrodynamic model is useful.
                                                 ✓ The use of GeoNode and fully open source systems is useful.
                                                 ✕ The code can be looked at locally, but running TsuDAT requires a connection to the server at the NCI. Thus if Internet connections are not
                                                 working, analysis cannot take place.




                                                    Recommended Improvements for Greater Utility
                                                 TsuDAT should be promoted as much as possible and seems the best candidate to be combined with other software. The system for scenario
                                                 selection and disaggregation lends itself to a MAEviz system. It should be implemented in InaSAFE to allow risk outputs as well as in other
                                                 modules for tsunami globally.

                      Additional Software Packages and Links
                      Table B-1 lists—and includes links to—software packages that were not reviewed in their entirety but will be in the
                      future. Some were discovered too late in the review process to be included; some solve only a very simple set of
                      equations and may not be extensive in their application to risk assessment; others were known to be only hazard
                      engines, and were not reviewed if enough risk software packages existed in their group (e.g., earthquake). The
                      applicable packages will be reviewed over the coming months and years, and a dynamic list for the worldwide user
                      community will be provided in order to keep the list of potential open source risk assessment software up-to-date.

Software Criterion Used in Evaluation
Table C-1 provides a verbal description of the criteria for the modules used in the analysis of the 31 software
packages. The criteria are not exhaustive and can be changed, added to, removed, and adjusted, to reflect the
opinions of future users and software updates. The process and most of the criteria are derived from the OPAL
procedure described in Daniell (2009), with additional criteria suggested during meetings with World Bank and
GFDRR experts.

Summary of Software Packages in Initial Assessment
A list of all software packages used in the assessment and the results of the initial review are provided in table
D-1. The table categorizes the packages by the four peril categories, indicates whether the software package was
selected for more detailed analysis, and provides a quick synopsis of the package’s features. The name of each
software package is hyperlinked to the software’s URL. (There are a number of other packages for flood and wave
that were not included in this table; links for these are listed in appendix A.)

The software packages selected by the initial review are listed in table D-2. Further analysis of the packages
used subjective criteria that accounted for the packages’ outputs, the hazard and risk they addressed, and their                                                          Table D—1
