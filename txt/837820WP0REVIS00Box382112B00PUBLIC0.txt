Building Morocco’s Resilience: Inputs for an Integrated Risk Management Strategy




           World Bank’s Five Pillars of Action on Disaster Risk Management (DRM)
    BOX 1: 
    Though the World Bank has been assisting countries on building resilience to disasters since the 1980s, its strategic
    role evolved with the creation of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)—a multi-donor
    partnership and financing mechanism to mainstream disaster and climate risk management into development
    strategies and planning. Housed within the World Bank, GFDRR also acts as the Bank’s focal point for oversight,
    partnership building, and business development in DRM. The growing strategic commitment of the World Bank to
    DRM is reflected in the number of Country Assistance and Partnership Strategies that now build disaster risk into
    their approach.
    The DRM practice operates across five strategic pillars of action:
    1.	Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) and Emergency Reconstruction & Recovery: large-scale emergency
       recovery programs such as those after the Aceh tsunami in Indonesia, the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan and the
       Wenchuan earthquake in China in 2008. There have been 26 PDNAs to date, supported by rapid mapping and
       damage validation through remote sensing and Earth observation, such as the one conducted in Haiti in 2010.
    2.	Disaster risk mitigation and related climate adaptation investment programs and multisector mainstreaming of
       DRM: risk mitigation programs, including those focusing on climaterelated hazards, such as the India National
       Cyclone Mitigation Project.
    3.	Innovation and application of new technologies: innovative risk financing instruments such as the Caribbean
       Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the Pan-African Drought Insurance Pool; remote sensing and
       geospatial analysis for mapping risks; analyzing intervention options and assessing post-disaster impacts; and
       leveraging public-private partnerships.
    4.	Global knowledge solutions and building access to data: actively informing the global DRM and climate change
       adaptation agenda with cutting-edge knowledge products, such as the Housing Reconstruction Handbook, and
       the seminal study on the economics of prevention Natural Hazards, UnNatural Disasters, etc.
    5.	Partnership development and donor coordination: through the GFDRR, building strategic and operational alliances
       with technical and political leaders in the DRM field.

                                                     SECTION I: A New Approach for Governments’ Risk Management




          The World Development Report (WDR) 2014: Managing Risk for Development
   BOX 2: 
   The World Development Report (WDR) 2014 will concentrate on the role of risk management in development and
   poverty reduction. It will argue that responsible and efficient risk management is crucial not only to reduce the
   negative impacts of shocks and hazards, but also to enable individuals, households, and enterprises to pursue new
   opportunities for growth and prosperity. Responsible and efficient risk management requires a systematic approach
   that combines preparing for (ex ante) and coping with (ex post) risk.

   Whether risks are imposed or assumed voluntarily, growth and development can be achieved only by confronting
   risks responsibly and efficiently. Risk management should, therefore, be a central concern at all levels of society. From
   both private and public perspectives, the goal of risk management is to mitigate the losses and improve the benefits
   that people may experience while conducting their lives and pursuing development opportunities.

   Whether risks are idiosyncratic or systemic, risk management is a shared responsibility, requiring actions that
   individuals and social systems must undertake, often in coordination. It is virtually impossible for individuals to handle
   successfully all of the risks they face on their own. Effective risk management requires the participation of well-
   functioning social and economic systems—the household, the local community, the enterprise sector, the financial
   system, the state, and the international community—with each providing support to people’s risk management in
   different yet complementary ways.

   Looking at risks in an integrated manner helps define priorities, and avoids overspending on managing one risk while
   neglecting others. Synergies and tradeoffs exist in managing individual risks, while synergies offer opportunities
   to achieve more easily attainable initial targets and low-cost actions. A multi-stakeholder approach to national risk
   management enables these tradeoffs and synergies across risks to be identified and managed. It also makes the
   process of risk management less prone to political capture, and introduces critical accountability mechanisms.

           World Economic Forum Risk Response Network
    BOX 3: 
    The World Economic Forum’s Risk Response Network (RRN) serves as a neutral, impartial and trusted platform that
    connects all of the Forum’s risk related activities by: (a) convening relevant experts from all disciplines both physically and
    virtually to respond to global risks; (b) curating knowledge, experiences and practices from around the world that offer
    new solutions; and (c) catalysing partnerships, initiatives and research that shape global, regional and industry agendas.
    The RRN concentrates currently on four core activities at the global, regional and industry levels.
    Providing a Strategic Assessment of Global Risks: Each year over 1,000 experts worldwide evaluate 50 global risks
    in terms of their perceived likelihood and impact over a 10-year horizon and, most importantly, their interconnections
    across five categories of risks: economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological. The findings also
    serve as the basis of the Forum’s flagship publication on Global Risks published in January in advance of its Annual
    Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
    Improving National Resilience to Global Risks: Countries are increasingly vulnerable to exogenous shocks over
    which they have no control. Often such shocks emanate from risks that are difficult to predict and where there is
    little experience or knowledge on how to handle their impact. The RRN’s primary effort in this context is to develop
    innovative ways to improve a country’s resilience (i.e. its ability to absorb and recover from external shocks while
    preserving core functions of critical systems) via new diagnostic methods. It also aims to promote the establishment
    of a Country Risk Officer function in national governments similar to a Chief Risk Officer in multinational corporations,
    which is very much aligned with the IRM strategy discussed in this report.
    Advancing Risk-Related Industry Initiatives: Forum industry communities have initiated major initiatives that focus
    on specific global risks. RRN objectives include fostering cross-industry collaboration and promoting knowledge
    and data sharing among public, private and academic institutions. Cyber-Resilience, Global Supply Chain Risks,
    Corruption in High-Growth Markets, Catastrophic Risks and Global Food Safety are among the industry workflows
    in this context.
    Identifying and Evaluating Leading Practices: Via the Forum’s virtual interaction and knowledge management platform
    (Toplink), the RRN connects experts and curates their experiences in the form of an interactive, online exchange which
    evaluates successful practices in improving resilience to major risks at the global, national or industry levels.

          Enterprise Risk Management
   BOX 4: 
   The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) published an Enterprise Risk
   Management (ERM) standard in 2004, which is now widely recognized by risk management practitioners. It provides
   a framework for undertaking ERM and has gained considerable influence because it is linked to the Sarbanes-Oxley
   federal law requirement for companies operating in the United States. On a global level, the International Organization
   of Standardization (ISO) released its dedicated ISO 31000 risk management guide in November 2009, which is viewed
   as an internationally agreed-upon standard to provide firms with a unifying risk management framework. ISO 31000 is
   intended to be applied within existing management systems to formalize and improve risk management processes.
   When implementing ISO 31000, attention is to be given to integrating existing risk management processes in the
   new paradigm addressed in the standard. ISO 31000 ‘Harmonization’ programs have centered on: (i) transferring
   accountability gaps in enterprise risk management; (ii) aligning objectives of the governance frameworks with
   ISO 31000; (iii) embedding management system reporting mechanisms; and (iv) creating uniform risk criteria and
   evaluation metrics.
   While ERM strategies differ from by firm, industry and country, the strategy consulting firm McKinsey identified five
   building blocks in many successful ERM strategies.
   •	 A risk dialogue forum for top management where the executive team reviews the risk profile of the company and
      discusses the risks associated with major decisions.
   •	 A risk charter for the Board, with a clear definition of allocation of responsibilities of risk oversight processes.
   •	 A user-friendly synthesized risk dashboard, which can be used by the top management and Board of the firm
      (typically an extension of that report and metrics already used by decision makers). This approach ensures that all
      the information is in one place.
   •	 A risk appetite statement, which defines how the company decides to create value, and determines whether risks
      are acceptable or not.
   •	 Risk management is to be embedded in all business decisions. ERM is most successful when it becomes a tool
      that helps business leaders balance risks and rewards and integrate risk more systematically in the evaluation of
      business opportunities.

   BOX 5: The UK Cabinet Office
   The UK Cabinet Office (essentially the Prime Minister’s office) established its strategy unit in 2002. The Strategy Unit
   was an elite group of 45 to 90 people which operated under Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown until its
   functions were transferred to other units in the Cabinet Office at the end of 2010. The Strategy Unit’s role was to
   provide the head of government with in-depth strategy advice and policy analysis on key priorities. This included
   monitoring key national risks, reports to the Cabinet on progress achieved and responsibility for guidance on the
   risk management framework previously adopted. Its role was to increase policy-making at a strategic level within and
   between Ministries. It also provided the Prime Minister and all Ministers with longer-term thinking and dedicated
   studies to help decision-making.a
   The British government also monitors the most significant emergencies that the UK and its citizens could face over the
   next five years through the National Risk Assessment (NRA). This annual confidential assessment draws on expertise
   from a wide range of departments and government agencies. The National Risk Register (NRR), the public version of
   the assessment, publishes a number of scenarios, to better inform citizens and businesses of the hazards and threats
   facing the country. The purpose of making these scenarios available is to inform the public, and provide guidance on
   what the public can do to prepare for the consequences of the most likely risks, should they wish to do so.

    BOX 6: Singapore
    In Singapore, the Whole-of-Government Integrated Risk Management (WOG-IRM) framework aims to improve the
    risk awareness of all government agencies. Though most agencies are already aware of most of the risks that fall
    within their remit, some agencies have not deliberately and systematically identified the full range of risks. Agencies
    may also lack an awareness of how such risks are affected by the action or inaction of other agencies, and vice versa.
    In a growing interdependent world, being able to consider this interconnectedness of risks is especially critical. The
    tendency of an approach favoring risk avoidance in government agencies failures to consider how much is lost by
    foregoing opportunities or by not creating them. Singapore’s WOG-IRM framework stands out as a good practice
    because it not only helps address gaps in risk management, but also identifies cross-agency risks that may have
    fallen through gaps in the system. It helps agencies to address their own vulnerabilities and to identify those that
    are contingent upon the vulnerabilities of others, while reinforcing the government‘s broader effort to evaluate
    and prioritize key risks in a holistic manner (OECD, 2009). The implementation of the WOGIRM strategy is tracked
    throughout the year and aligned with the annual budget cycle. This ensures that priority budget allocations are
    awarded to initiatives that address the key risks identified in the strategy. A Strategy Committee provides oversight
    and guidance by serving as the main platform to steer and review the overall implementation and progress. The
    Committee meets quarterly and comprises Permanent Secretaries from the various ministries across the government
    of Singapore.a

    BOX 7: The Netherlands
    In 2007, the Netherlands was one of the first countries to adopt a Cabinet’s Strategy on National Safety. This Strategy
    seeks to examine all risks that can seriously affect the country on a common basis. For instance, in 2007 and 2008
    a Cabinet’s Taskforce Flooding was installed to develop worst credible flood scenarios and formulate a nationwide
    preparation. It cumulated in a week long exercise involving about 15,000 people from NGOs, different governmental
    organizations and different operational organizations. In 2009, following special attention to floods, the country
    organized the largest European Union exercise to test the assistance from Member States of the EU. That same
    year the National Risk Assessment paid special attention to pandemics (pre-empting the global outbreak of H5N1).
    In 2010–11, special attention was given to cyber risks, and associated issues. The National Steering Committee
    for National Safety (“Stuurgroep Nationale Veiligheid”, SNV) was formed in 2011 to strengthen the holistic risk
    management approach. The SNV realizes coherence in national risk assessment and management at several levels
    of government policy, both regional and national, as well as international policy. The SNV advises the Dutch Cabinet
    and Parliament on risk reduction and regularly reports on National Risk Assessment and activities to strengthen
    capabilities and national risk management coherence.
    As such, the national IRM strategy is also based on a whole-of-government approach instead of departmental tasking
    and on a systematic national risk assessment, which guarantees more flexibility and agility in the risk management
    and risk financing strategy process.

   BOX 8: Benefits of Integrated Risk Management
   Integrated risk management (IRM) has a number of clear benefits over traditional risk management. This is because
   IRM considers major risks in a consistent manner using common criteria and, at times, combines risk reduction
   vehicles and methods, whereas traditional risk management typically operates in silos, does not collate comparable
   risk data and separately pursues differing risk reduction options based on inconsistent criteria. Overall, IRM is a major
   step towards managing the complexity inherent in the many risks facing a nation. It does this through a transparent,
   continuous, multi-stakeholder processes that coordinates risk assessment and risk reduction efforts. It increases the
   systematic integration of the risk factors into a large number of day-to-day and strategic decisions—and helps to
   more efficiently allocate scarce risk reduction resources as well as monitor progress on multiple fronts.
   The specific benefits of IRM include, among others: a,b,c,d
   •	 Identifying Risks and Preparedness: IRM results in a more consistent identification and prioritization of key risks
      facing a country, which leads to a clearer understanding of the capabilities and capacities for reducing these risks.
   •	 Improving understanding of risk interdependencies: Risks are too often treated in silos but they are becoming
      more and more interdependent. For instance, a massive flood will impact different ministries differently–Public
      works to ensure constructions are built outside of a flood zone; Agriculture if the flood affects farmers; Interior for
      security/emergency services; Health for the treatment of the victims in hospitals; and Finance for compensation of
      impacted individuals and communities and the financing of reconstruction.
   •	 Making Informed and Cost-Effective Decisions: IRM is transparent, rational, and if implemented well can lead
      cost-effective decision making—its key value for decision makers is the ability to comprehensively consider options
      within the larger context and across multiple risks. Opportunities for synergy and leveraging, particularly in the
      financial arena, are more easily identified and implemented (highest ‘bang for the buck’).
   •	 Enhancing communication and coordination: IRM promotes a common vocabulary and technology across
      ministries, breaks down “silos”, enhances vertical and horizontal integration within the government and involves
      other key stakeholders (such as scientific organizations, community leaders, businesses, NGOs etc) to improve
      effective risk management.
   •	 Providing top decision makers with a complete dashboard of exposure and possible solutions: By approaching
      risk management holistically, one can provide the right information top decision makers need rather than relying
      on piecemeal results from independent studies looking only at one aspect of a problem at a certain time. In doing
      so, the integration also typically elevates risk management to a more strategic level than smaller risk management
      initiatives could achieve.
   Ultimately, an integrated risk management strategy will help governments make more informed decisions on how
   risks compare to each other, how limited budget can be allocated across different risk reduction initiatives, and how
   such policy can benefit from economies of scale across the country. Implementing an IRM approach would also
   position Morocco as one of the more active countries around the world on risk management, which in turn can serve
   as a strong signal for foreign investors.

          An Integrated Approach to Fiscal Risk Assessment and Management in Colombia
   BOX 9: 
   The Government of Colombia (GoC) was one of the first movers in a growing number of countries concerned about
   taking an integrated, strategic approach to identification, quantification, disclosure, and management of fiscal risks.
   The GoC’s interest in the topic was driven by a substantial series of calls on demand guarantees related to public-
   private partnerships (PPPs) in power, telecom, and toll roads in the 1990s (eventually resulting in cumulative payments
   by the government of 2% of GDP) that led to the passing of Law 448 of 1998, which dictates that the national
   government, territorial entities, and other decentralized entities should include in their public management the
   necessary appropriations to cover possible losses arising from contingent liabilities. It also mandates that (i) the
   national government develop and enforce methodology for estimation of contingent liabilities; (ii) the Ministry
   of Finance’s General Directorate of Public Credit and the National Treasury have oversight over estimation and
   management of contingent liabilities; and (iii) that the national government establish a contingency fund for
   government entities and determine what type of risks were to be covered by the fund.

   Since the passing of Law 448, the GoC has been improving and expanding its approach to fiscal risk assessment,
   disclosure, and management. In 1998, it established the Risk Management Subdirection in the Ministry of Finance
   to lead this effort. The Risk Management Subdirection began the process of quantifying and publicly disclosing
   fiscal risks in 2003 with the government’s contingent liability to public credit operations. It has since expanded its
   methodology to assess and manage four other contingent liabilities, including natural disasters. In 2010, the first time
   that the government comprehensively assessed all of its contingent liabilities, the GoC identified natural disasters as
   its second largest contingent liability behind legal actions against the state.

   Other middle-income countries have also established dedicated units in the Ministry of Finance responsible for
   overall management of most fiscal risks—for example, in Indonesia and Peru. Other countries have been expanding
   the scope of their debt management departments to monitor and manage risks from contingent liabilities.

           MnhPRA – Morocco natural hazards Probabilistic Risk Analysis
   BOX 10: 
   A guiding principle of modern management is “what gets measured gets managed.” A key element of the
   Government of Morocco’s disaster risk management program has been the development of MnhPRA, a Geographic
   Information System (GIS) based software package that inventories the country’s assets at risk and the hazards that
   threaten these assets, and allows analysis to estimate the impacts of these hazards on the assets. MnhPRA thus
   permits measurement of disaster risk, a key step towards managing that risk.




   MnhPRA is open-source software developed during 2010–12 under a project coordinated by an inter-ministerial
   committee and managed by Ministère des Affaires Générales et de la Gouvernance (MAGG), with technical support
   provided by the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and scientific review by
   a panel of Moroccan university professors. MnhPRA contains GIS databases of Morocco’s assets at risk—that is,
   Morocco’s population, the entire built environment of Morocco—all buildings, roads, bridges, railways, ports and
   airports, electric generation and transmission and other infrastructure, and selected agricultural crops. MnhPRA
   combines these asset databases with databases of hazards (currently, earthquake, flood, tsunami and drought)
   that threaten these assets, and links these two with vulnerability functions, to estimate fatalities, injuries and direct
   economic costs due to all possible disaster occurrences. An advanced model of the Moroccan economy, developed
   in conjunction with Le Haut Commissariat au Plan (HCP) then provides estimates of the overall impacts on the national
   economy. Results are provided in detailed tables at the commune level, summary tables at the province, region and
   national levels, and maps.
   MnhPRA is an advanced powerful tool that allows both local and centrally coordinated management of natural
   hazards, using the same data so that decisions are made on a common basis. Towards this end, technical staff from
   a number of ministries attended training sessions for MnhRPA. Because it is open source and GIS-based however,
   MnhPRA is intuitive, easy to use and can be extended to other hazards, becoming Morocco’s fundamental tool for
   integrated risk management, thereby saving lives and reducing damage at a lower cost than if MnhPRA were not
   available.

   BOX 11: “What-ifs” Scenarios
   “What-ifs” are scenario analyses of the benefits and costs of a particular risk reduction, or mitigation, action.
   For example “what if schools in a high seismicity region are strengthened for an earthquake?” The “what if…?”
   question asks “what are the benefits if… [some action is taken].”

   In the context of risk reduction, the benefits are typically avoided future losses, which are calculated based on
   probabilistic risk analysis techniques. While greater and greater benefits can be realized with increasing mitigation
   actions, since these actions come at some (increasing) cost, there is typically an ‘optimum’ level of mitigation,
   which is the point at which the decreasing loss equals the increasing cost of mitigation. Probably the most common
   method of determining the optimum level of mitigation is benefit-cost analysis, which seeks to determine the
   Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of a particular mitigation action—the higher the BCR, the more bang (benefits, that is,
   avoided loss) for the buck (cost of mitigation).

   Based on MnhPRA, what-ifs were developed for a total of 51 scenarios, ranging from strengthening of buildings,
   flood warning systems, structural measure of flood mitigation and evacuation mapping to elevating buildings
   to protect against floods. The scenarios considered high-risk areas such as Al-Hociema and Nador province for
   earthquake, Kenitra province for floods and coastal areas of the country for tsunami, as well as other key provinces
   such as Fes and Agadir.

   The BCR for the 51 scenarios varied from 54.3 to 1.1. The total cost of mitigation for all 51 what-if scenarios was
   MAD 9.3 billion. The top ten scenarios in terms of BCR were:

   (i)	    Flood warning system for Ouregha sub basin (BCR = 54.3)

   (ii)	   Culverts on railway lines in Gharb plains (BCR = 34.6)

   (iii)	 Evacuation mapping for tsunami in coastal areas (BCR = 8.3)

   (iv)	 Mitigation of residential buildings for floods in new township near Kenitra (BCR = 8.2)

   (v)	    Mitigation of government buildings for floods in new township near Kenitra (BCR = 7.2)

   (vi)	 Strengthening of hospital buildings in Nador province (BCR = 5.8)

   (vii)	 Risk assessment for floods in new township near Kenitra (BCR = 5.7)

   (viii)	 Risk assessment for proposed schools in the country (BCR = 4.4)

   (ix)	 Mitigation of school buildings for floods in new township near Kenitra (BCR = 4.2)

   (x)	    Strengthening of schools in Nador province (BCR = 3.6)

BOX 12: Measuring and Enhancing Economic Resilience through IO and CGE Modelsa
Measuring indirect economic effects of disasters (how the economy will adjust to a shock and how the population
will be affected by households’ income and consumption) requires specific macro-economic models that capture the
interdependencies between all the sectors of the economy and macro-economic actions adopted by the government
before the disaster, and to responses following a disaster. Those policies can reduce the economic and social impacts
of disasters and support fast recovery.

Input-Output (IO) models, developed and used by the Haut Commissariat au Plan (HCP), allow the government to
rapidly estimate the short-term total economic losses from a disaster by sector and for the whole economy

Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are more sophisticated and capture the long-term dynamics. For
example, a manufacturing plant affected by an earthquake, could switch production to other plants not operating at
full capacity in parts of the country not affected, thus limiting total production loss.

Key results of the analysis

The higher-order effects and total impacts of disasters are significant and complex:

1. The IO method calculates the total production losses (direct and indirect) that would be higher than the sole
direct losses estimated by the probabilistic risk assessment, ranging from MAD 13.5 billion for a flood of 1,000 year
return period, to MAD 52 billion, for an earthquake of 10,000 year return period; approximately 6% and 23% of the
government budget, respectively. These total losses would be MAD 26.4 billion in the case of a 1,000 year return
tsunami (or 11.6% of government budget).The evaluation by the CGE model shows that when markets and the
adjustment mechanisms work more flexibly, the negative effects of direct loss of production, although relatively high,
tend to be attenuated compared to the IO method.

2. The decline in economic activity would impact negatively household incomes, resulting in a reduction of consumption
and standards of living. The financial capacity of the state can also be adversely affected and in a massive earthquake
could experience a reduction of MAD 11 billion. It is therefore important to appropriately evaluate and account for
the interconnectedness between industry sectors and economic agents (consumers, businesses).

Analysis of the sectoral distribution of total impacts reveals that the manufacturing and services sectors suffer from
those interdependency effects more than other sectors, such as agriculture and mining, because they rely more on inter-
industry relationships domestically and/or internationally and are located in the middle and at the end of production
chains. Damages and losses on the other sectors propagate to these two sectors, resulting in larger economic disruption.
However, the intensity of inter-industry relationships, or interdependencies, varies significantly, as do the impact effects.

3. The total losses calculated by the IO model are often typically higher by 25 to 30%, compared to the direct losses
based on the estimation of physical losses found by RMSI, demonstrating that disaster losses can be more significant
via ripple effects through interdependencies within an economy when the disaster affects critical assets. With the
CGE, those losses are slightly lower than 25%, since it takes into account longer-term adjustment. The CGE model
results are consistent with many international assessments, which show that the effects of disasters are lessened
when the economy is developed and markets and adjustment mechanisms work properly.

Taking the right macro-economic actions when a disaster happens is critical

Resilience-supporting public policy can significantly alleviate the negative impact of natural hazards on the economy and
accelerate its rate of recovery. The two key economic policies—investment and productivity enhancement—simulated
to counter the shock of a large earthquake would reduce GDP loss up to 40%. Household income could increase if the
government implements such policies. This in turn will impact positively households’ consumption, yielding an overall
increase in the aggregate demand that will give an economic boost. Also, the worsening of the government deficit
after the disaster would be significantly less if those economic resilience policies were implemented.

The development of the IO and CGE models provide the GoM with state-of-the-art analytic tools to improve macro-
economic decision-making and can be used for disaster scenario and/or public policy mix. Based on international
experience, these tools position Morocco as one of the most advanced non-OECD countries for disaster macro-
economic policy evaluation capability.

   BOX 13: Risk Perception Survey of Communities in Morocco
   Efforts to reduce disaster risks and implement risk reduction programs should build upon a community’s knowledge
   and experience about hazards, vulnerabilities and disaster risk reduction while recognizing the importance of local
   customs, culture and materials. To capture this facet of community perception of risks, the World Bank together
   with the GoM (TFESSD financed) conducted a study in four urban and rural communes in the provinces of Guelmim,
   Hoceima, Taounate and Chefchaouen. The objective was to capture existing good practices in CBDRM, conduct a
   social qualitative assessment (survey questionnaire and focus groups) of risk perceptions based on experience of a
   previous disaster, and an institutional assessment of DRM structures.
   The results were quite interesting: community interest to DRM seemed to vary based on (i) available financial
   resources (only 12% of respondents had a financial reserve of any kind); (ii) residential status (84% of respondents
   owned their own home and wished to reduce the potential damage to their property); (iii) the recurrence of hazards
   (89% of the respondents considered floods as the main risk, even in areas prone to earthquakes); and (iv) the type of
   hazard (for example, a sense of helplessness and acquiescence in the case of slow onset hazards like droughts). The
   role of the state seemed to vary depending on the geographic region (proximity), type of hazard (fast vs. slow onset)
   and the phase in the disaster cycle (high intervention during response and reconstruction but low during the ex ante
   phase). Although all respondents recognized their role in the management of natural hazards and the importance of
   community action, 81% thought that investing in risk management is a government responsibility (national and local).
   All these findings are important indicators and inputs when designing mitigation and adaptation actions as the
   ultimate beneficiaries, responders and users of most of the risk reduction actions (infrastructure, insurance, etc.) are
   the communities.

Building Morocco’s Resilience: Inputs for an Integrated Risk Management Strategy




     BOX 14: Building Resilient Communities in Vietnam
     Since 2000, the Government of Vietnam has refined its approach to DRM by empowering provincial organizations
     and communities to plan for and respond to disasters. The national government has combined institutional capacity
     building efforts with risk reduction structural investments at the community and provincial levels. The main non-
     structural measures that have been adopted in Vietnamese communities are the establishment of early warning and
     evacuation systems and the organization of training programs for citizens, including evacuation drills. Similarly, the
     introduction of new technologies has led to increased public participation and transparency, with tools such as a
     cell-phone based monitoring system and a farmers’ management information system. The structural measures for
     risk reduction at the community level include the construction of reservoirs, dams, drainage canals, rural roads and
     irrigation infrastructure built with new standards, as well as multi-purpose evacuation centers.

     A key to the overall success of the program has been the inclusion of these measures in the community development
     plans, and the creation of Safer Community Plans. Similarly, the participation of all stakeholders, including villagers,
     relevant government agencies at all levels and international partners, ensures the durability and feasibility of the
     program. Finally, the linkage of physical investments with CBDRM activities through geographic clustering provides
     for greater synergies and a more comprehensive approach. What began as a pilot project in 2000 is now a model that
     is being reproduced by the government in nearly 6,000 communities.

             Mexico’s Oil Hedging Strategy: Institutional Capacity for Risk Management
     BOX 15: 
     Mexico’s state-owned oil company, PEMEX, the world’s third largest oil production company, pays taxes and levies
     totaling about 60% of sales. This represents more than one-third of overall government revenues, meaning that the
     federal budget is vulnerable to oil price declines. In response, Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC)
     has implemented an oil price hedging program—part of a three-pronged, public finance strategy to guarantee
     sustainability, including adequate liquidity and financial risk management.
     Each year, Mexico’s Congress establishes a projected oil price for budgetary calculations, based on a pre-established
     formula using historical and futures prices. The MFPC designs and executes the oil hedging strategy based on
     the projected price, with funding from the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund (FEIP), created in 2001. Any revenues
     obtained from the hedging transactions are used to offset lost revenues from price declines that have adversely
     affected oil marketing and sales. Currently, the government implements the hedging program using the purchase
     of put options, giving it the right, but not the obligation, to sell oil in the future at a pre-determined strike price
     equivalent to the projected price set in the budget for the next year. This strategy creates a floor in the price for oil
     exports giving the country an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements should they occur. Typically,
     the government transacts 12-month, put-option contracts, with a strike price equivalent to the projected oil price
     used to develop the national budget. Institutionally, the MFPC develops the hedging strategy and purchases put
     options for the following year; it pays the premium from the FEIP via its financial agent, the Central Bank, which runs
     a competitive process for each transaction to determine market counterparties. In the early program years, Mexico
     hedged 20–30% of its net oil exports.
     Mexico’s oil hedging program has been operating for nearly a decade. A strong set of institutional arrangements has
     provided a solid foundation for the government’s risk management strategy. Its systematic approach has resulted in
     increased sophistication and capacity. The government has a clear and consistent message, which it takes care to
     communicate to the public. The objective of the hedging strategy is not to profit directly from a fall in the price of oil,
     but to hedge the existing financial risk that Mexico faces, owing to its heavy dependence on oil revenues.

     BOX 16: Proposed Modifications to Law 34-08
     Following a reexamination of the proposed Law 34-08a and consultation with the insurance sector, the government
     is considering a number of modifications to the provisioned law that will clarify the scope of the law and the risk
     financing responsibilities of the stakeholders in the law. The proposed modifications can be summarized as follows:
     Insurance policies and design: The catastrophe insurance would cover a list of named perils, as opposed to the
     broader coverage for unnamed perils previously anticipated. Deductibles and limits for each type of exposure (e.g.,
     vehicle, residential, commercial, industrial) would be set by regulation and these may be adjusted over time based
     on the scheme’s maturity and risk financing capacity.
     Risk financing responsibilities and limits: Moroccan insurers would retain a tranche, totaling between MAD 500
     million and MAD 1 billion, of the catastrophe risk transferred through the program. The government would act as
     reinsurer for a top risk layer, the size of which will be determined annually or over a multi-year period depending
     on the amount required to secure an adequate level of solvency for the scheme and to overcome the volatility of
     the international reinsurance market. This intervention would either be direct or via the Fonds de solidarité contre
     les événements catastrophiques. Finally, a global limit on the amount payable under the compulsory catastrophe
     insurance program would be set via regulation. If damages incurred under the program exceed this overall limit, the
     amount paid out under the program will be adjusted so that it does not exceed the overall limit.
     The catastrophe insurance program’s revised risk financing strategy is as follows:


                              Residual risk layer above State-guarantee (above global comprensation limit set by Program)

                                     State          A final layer is guaranteed by the State, either directly or indirectly

           Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF)
   The Southeastern Europe and the Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF) project is facilitating
   the development of national catastrophe and weather risk markets in SEEC through the design and introduction of
   innovative, low-cost insurance products, insurance business production technologies, regulatory reform, consumer
   education, and provision of reinsurance services. The project is supported by the World Bank, UNISDR, the European
   Commission, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and the Global Environment Facility.

   SEEC CRIF is being implemented through the creation of a specialty government-owned catastrophe risk reinsurer,
   Europa Reinsurance Facility Ltd. (Europa Re), with the view to improving access to weather risk and catastrophe risk
   insurance for millions of households, small businesses, and governments in the Facility’s member states. Established
   in 2009 in Switzerland, Europa Re employs an independent Board of Directors and is managed by a professional
   management team. SEEC member governments are Europa Re’s shareholders; currently, Albania, the former
   Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia have joined the Facility, with others in discussions to join.

   Europa Re is currently completing probabilistic high resolution regional earthquake and flood risk models for the
   SEEC member countries. The models will be used for the purposes of underwriting and pricing flood and earthquake
   risk in these countries. It is also developing a web-based underwriting and risk-pricing platform that will provide
   insurers with automated real-time underwriting, pricing, and reinsurance decisions for all risks assumed through
   the sales of approved catastrophe insurance products in member countries. This platform will allow participating
   insurers to keep track of all policies issued through the portal and will enable them to report, and Europa Re to
   settle, insurance claims. Finally, Europa Re will utilize the platform to track its risk accumulations by location and
   type of risk.

           Improving India’s National Agricultural Insurance Scheme Through Risk Data
   BOX 18: 
           Infrastructure Relying on Innovative Technology
   Developed in 1999, the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) offers insurance for food and commercial
   crops through the state-owned insurer, Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AICI). The Government of India
   supports the NAIS through a substantial subsidy (over US$2.5 billion since its inception) and has faced key challenges
   in its operation, including budgeting for its claims liability ex post events and a lack of risk-based pricing in the
   system.

   Since 2005, the Government of India has been working to address these challenges by transitioning NAIS from the
   ex post regime to an ex ante financed, market-based insurance program. This involved extensive work and technical
   support from the World Bank; AICI’s technical capacity was built to transition NAIS to a market based approach.
   Analytical tools and prototype actuarial software were developed to statistically analyze weather index insurance
   products and develop actuarially sound rating methodologies, which in turn led to more targeted distribution of
   government subsidies. The quality and timeliness of the data was improved, using innovative mobile technology
   in crop-cutting experiments and developing an auditing function and improved database. An area-yield based
   insurance product was piloted and is now beginning to scale up, providing farmers with more reliable insurance
   coverage.

     BOX 19: Overhauling Insurance of Public Assets in Colombia
     The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) in Colombia has developed and is implementing a national disaster
     risk financing strategy, which includes improving its approach to the insurance of public assets, with prioritization of
     central government buildings and PPPs in the first phase. In 2011–12, the MHCP reviewed the state of insurance
     coverage of public assets. Using the results of the review, the Government of Colombia (GoC) is now moving to
     a centralized approach to the insurance of central government buildings that will pool risk into one diversified,
     well-structured portfolio to pass to insurers through a group insurance policy. This approach will lower operating
     costs and increase the GoC’s bargaining power. More recently, in light of US$22.5 billion worth of new infrastructure
     concessions over 2013–14, the GoC is enhancing insurance requirements for PPPs based on international (re)
     insurance market standards.
