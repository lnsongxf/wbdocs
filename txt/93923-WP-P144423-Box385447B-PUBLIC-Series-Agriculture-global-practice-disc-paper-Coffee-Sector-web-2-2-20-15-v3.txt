This study is the outcome of a collaborative approach between the International Coﬀee
Organization (ICO) and the World Bank’s Agricultural Risk Management Team. The
concept of this report emerged during the September 2012 meeting of the Core Group
of the ICO’s Consultative Forum on Coﬀee Sector Finance. Its objective is to raise
awareness of risks and their impacts on diﬀerent actors at diﬀerent stages of the value
chain; illustrate potential means for managing risks through the implementation of a
variety of programs and mechanisms; and demonstrate a series of innovations where
attempts have been made to improve access to ﬁnance. The direct correlation between
improved risk management and improved access to ﬁnance is challenging to show con-
clusively; however, anecdotal evidence suggests that improvements in the management
in risk can often lead to improvement in ﬁnance and vice versa. To meet these goals, this
report brings together interesting and relevant case studies from coﬀee-producing coun-
tries showcasing risk, risk management, and improved access to ﬁnance. The authors of
this report would like to thank all of the ICO members and coﬀee sector participants
who contributed information, data, and, especially, case studies to this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Millions of coﬀee farmers and coﬀee trading enterprises lack suﬃcient credit. This is
partly due to myriad challenges and considerable costs that formal lending institutions
face serving rural, often isolated markets. It is also often perceived to be the case that
the inability of coﬀee farmers and enterprises to manage risk contributes to keeping
risk-averse lenders at bay. A better understanding of coﬀee sector risks is needed to
respond with strategies, training, and tools that can help farmers, and enterprises,
mitigate their exposure to risk and strengthen their resilience against inevitable shocks.
Such eﬀorts might also assist in increasing the upstream ﬂow of credit, catalyzing new
productivity-enhancing investments, and contributing to more proﬁtable and more
sustainable livelihoods for coﬀee farmers.

This report explores the role that producer associations, governments, non-proﬁt
organizations, the private sector, and other intermediaries can play in making risk
management and ﬁnancing tools more accessible and more workable for smallholder
coﬀee growers. It examines the global coﬀee sector and outlines: 1) major risks and
constraints facing the sector; 2) potential opportunities for improving the management
of certain risks; and 3) programs launched in various regions aimed at improving
access to ﬁnance.

Through the use of detailed case studies taken from a number of coﬀee-producing
countries, this report seeks to demonstrate: how risks can arise that adversely impact
on the coﬀee sector and those working within the sector; how risks can be better man-
aged so that the sector is able to improve its resilience; how ﬁnancing constraints can
be overcome through a variety of innovative approaches; and how there are potential
opportunities to both improve risk and access to ﬁnance in a coordinated manner. The
rationale for utilizing case studies is to enable best practices to be shared more widely.
Even today, there are gaps in research and understanding of these subjects, and these
case studies can provide a means of considering interventions and informing thinking.
Many of the cases detailed in this report have not been widely shared across other
coﬀee-producing countries, despite these countries sharing similar risks and facing simi-
lar ﬁnancing constraints. As such, it is the aim of this report to both raise awareness

as to the potential means for improving the management of risks, and to demonstrate
innovative approaches to expanding the provision of ﬁnance to the sector.

This report highlights the need for collaboration among all stakeholders within the
coﬀee sector, both nationally and globally. Speciﬁcally, a number of the cases show
that while individual actions may succeed in improving the management of one risk
or reducing one of the constraints that limit ﬁnancing, a more fundamental improve-
ment in risk, as well as an expansion of ﬁnancing, is not possible without a more
holistic approach. However, where stakeholders work together to proactively tackle
multiple risks and overcome multiple constraints, the impact can be dramatic. The
ﬁnal two cases demonstrate a virtuous circle of improved risk management that gener-
ates improved access to ﬁnance, which itself facilitates further improvements in risk
management.

To this end, this report considers the global coﬀee supply chain and the actors operat-
ing within it, and demonstrates, through the use of selected case studies, how collabo-
rative eﬀorts by actors and stakeholders can improve risk management and access to
ﬁnance. It shows how risks can be mitigated and/or transferred between supply chain
actors, and how coping can be facilitated through cooperative arrangements for when
risks arise.

CHAPTER ONE
TAMING RISK AND UNLOCKING FINANCE
FOR A VIBRANT COFFEE SECTOR
As with other agricultural industries, the global coﬀee sector daily confronts risks that
could hamper production, curtail potential markets, decimate margins, and even ruin
entire networks of growers, roasters, marketers, traders, and exporters. The preva-
lence of these risks plays a part in reducing the incentives and willingness of ﬁnanciers
to lend to the sector, and also curbs the interest of coﬀee sector actors in borrowing to
invest in their enterprises. Accordingly, better risk management could well be a step
toward easier access to ﬁnance.

Compounding these issues is the reality that actors within the supply chain often have
an inadequate appreciation of the risks they face, hampering their eﬀorts to mitigate
them and preventing adequate assessment and pricing by lenders.

The objective of this report is to demonstrate how improved risk management is pos-
sible and show innovative examples of actors implementing improved risk manage-
ment; and demonstrate how the use of innovative lending products and processes can
facilitate the expansion of lending to the coﬀee sector. This report also details two case
studies which demonstrate opportunities for improving both risk management and
access to ﬁnance in the coﬀee sector.

However, it must be noted that not all coﬀee supply chain actors are equal, and not all
coﬀee supply chains are identical. As the report will show, a range of actors within the
coﬀee supply chain face diﬀerent exposure to risks, have varied levels of ability to man-
age such risks, and similarly will face various degrees of diﬃculty in accessing ﬁnance.
Similarly, no two coﬀee supply chains are identical, and while all supply chains have
similarities, the major diﬀerences between supply chains in countries and regions, in
terms of the participants and in terms of the structure of the industry, demand that
there cannot be a “one size ﬁts all” solution to improving risk and/or improving access
to ﬁnance. Any existing mechanisms to improve risk and expand ﬁnance in one loca-
tion will need to be tailored to the local context.

CHAPTER TWO
RISK IN THE COFFEE SECTOR
The apparent increase in frequency of commodity price spikes and crop failures added
to concerns over climate change have increased global interest in risk management for
commodities. In addition, millions of farmers are dependent on “non-food” com-
modities, including coﬀee, for their household income. They face both a highly risky
production system and an arguably more complicated market, one that is more depen-
dent on macroeconomic drivers in developed countries. For both sets of producers, the
supply chains that link them to markets and their governments mean that the realiza-
tion of agricultural risks can have a catastrophic impact. In addition to producers, a
large number of other stakeholders are also involved in the coﬀee supply chains and
they carry out a diverse range of activities throughout the continuum, from farm to
cup. These stakeholders include input suppliers, traders, processors, banks, and ﬁnan-
cial service providers, transporters, retailers, and government agencies. In one form or
another, all of them are exposed to agricultural risk.

Not all risks are of equal importance and, as such, it is important when considering
coﬀee sector risks to understand how each risk aﬀects each set of supply chain actors.
This process enables a ﬁnancier to understand which risks should demand the bor-
rower’s closest attention. It can be helpful to classify risks into one of three principal
types of risks and prioritize them based on their probability of occurrence and severity
of losses. It is important to note that there are often interconnections between risks,
and additionally that managing one risk may lead to the creation of another, new risk.

The three risk categories are deﬁned as:

Production risks: Weather events (droughts, ﬂoods, hurricane, cyclone, sudden
drop or increase of temperature, frost, and so on), pest and disease outbreaks, and so
on, are major risks that lead to production volatility. Case Study 6 considers the out-
break of coﬀee rust disease across Central America and details the adverse impact on
coﬀee farmers.

Enabling environment risks: Changes in government or business regulations,
macro-economic environment, political risks, conﬂict, trade restrictions, and so on are

CHAPTER THREE
FINANCE AND THE COFFEE SUPPLY CHAIN
The scale of the ﬁnancing needed to facilitate the global coﬀee trade emerges when
considering that in 2013 exports totaled 6.66 million tons of green coﬀee, valued at
US$17.91 billion, while a further 2.68 million tons were sold domestically.4 It is help-
ful to consider ﬁnancing of the coﬀee supply chain by considering the ﬁnancing needs
and the availability of ﬁnancing for actors at each stage of the chain. As noted in
Chapter One, lenders perceive that risk is greatest at the origin end of the coﬀee sup-
ply chain, which at least partly explains why access to credit is easier for those at the
retail end of the chain than for producers.

Table 3.1 shows the needs, duration, and providers of ﬁnance at each stage of the
value chain, both in producing and consuming countries. It also illustrates that actors
at diﬀerent stages of the value chain have a diﬀerent range of ﬁnancing sources avail-
able and require diﬀerent types and durations of ﬁnance.

There exists a wide range of lenders involved in providing ﬁnancing to the sector, both
formal (regulated ﬁnancial institutions) and informal lenders (unregulated individuals
and organizations who provide ﬁnance). Formal lending institutions include banks,
microﬁnance institutions, credit unions, and other types of ﬁnanciers, while informal
lenders include moneylenders as well as other value chain actors who provide ﬁnanc-
ing to secure supplies of coﬀee. It is notable that inter-value chain lending is a critical
element of the ﬁnancing arrangements of some actors. For example, a great many
traders and collectors provide ﬁnancing to farmers at the start of the season to secure
access to their coﬀee, and many of these traders in turn receive ﬁnancing from the
exporters who similarly wish to secure their own supplies. Depending on the local
market conditions, some exporters may at times receive ﬁnancing from their import-
ers. What is common to the inter-value chain lending ﬂows is that all lending is based
upon the needs of the actors to lock in supplies of coﬀee.5

CHAPTER FOUR
THE DYNAMICS OF RISK AND FINANCE
The case studies strongly suggest there are numerous opportunities to improve risk
management and better facilitate access to ﬁnance for actors across the coﬀee sector.
Indeed, the case studies contained in this compendium illustrate that actors across the
coﬀee supply chain have been and continue to be focused on addressing individual
risks and constraints, including a paucity of ﬁnance, that are considered to hamper
the full potential of the industry. Some eﬀorts have focused purely on production
risks, such as disease outbreaks or climate impacts, while others have sought to reduce
the potential for similarly catastrophic price falls in coﬀee markets or state-instigated
changes to regulations and laws.

However, this report also considers the inter-relationship between risk, ﬁnance, and
other constraints. Speciﬁcally, it addresses the opportunities that improved risk man-
agement can have for expanding access to ﬁnance, and how improved access to ﬁnance
can enable investment in risk management for the sector. In essence, this becomes a
virtuous cycle with improvements in risk management leading to reduced exposure to
losses from risks when they arise, that result in improved access to ﬁnance, which itself
enables investment in improved risk management.

In the case of Root Capital (Case Study 13), the lender undertook responsibility for
encouraging and guiding cooperatives in their choice and use of credit products and
graduating the borrowers to more complex and longer-duration loans in line with
their success and their growing needs. Similarly, Sustainable Harvest (Case Study 5)
provides an example of an importer that set out to encourage cooperatives in Latin
America to become more adept at managing their price risk exposures by facilitating
their use of call options. The example of Twin Trading (Case Study 18) emphasizes
the opportunities that arise when a buyer invests the time and eﬀort in facilitating
introductions and relationship building between suppliers and lenders.

Building on such instances of symbiotic relationships within the coﬀee supply chain,
the report concludes with two case studies (19 and 20) that highlight the positive
relationship between improvements in risk management and improvements in ﬁnance.
