    Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
Executive Summary

    Executive Summary

    Over the period 2011–2013, Indonesia had universal maternal health coverage for its population
    and utilization of key maternal health services was relatively high, except for in the case of facility-
    based deliveries — only about 63 percent of all deliveries occurred at a health facility, even though 83
    percent of births were attended by a skilled attendant. This policy paper presents findings from an analysis
    of the supply-side service readiness of Indonesia’s public health facilities to provide key maternal health
    (MH) services, such as antenatal care, obstetric care, and neonatal care, and assesses the extent to which
    Indonesia’s universal maternal health coverage was “real”, in order to inform policy reforms aimed at
    attaining universal health coverage (UHC) in Indonesia by 2019, which includes the merger of existing
    schemes into a single-payer umbrella — Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN).

    Key findings include the heterogeneity of maternal health service utilization and service readiness in
    the country, with ‘eastern’ provinces1 associated with lower utilization and public sector dominance, while
    ‘western’ provinces2 were associated with higher utilization and private sector dominance. Hence, as the
    first of eight key policy recommendations, a Special Focus on Eastern Provinces is recommended in order to
    improve MH outcomes in these areas, especially since the service readiness of public facilities is weak and
    will likely directly impact the ability to meaningfully provide quality MH services. In ‘western’ provinces,
    there is a need to Improve Stewardship and Accountability of private facilities through an independent
    accreditation process, as well as to clarify the accountability structures of different levels of government,
    given the decentralized context of government health services.

    Although service readiness differs per region, the overall national picture indicates that there is
    much room for improvement in levels of maternal health service readiness in Indonesia. For example,
    PONED (Pelayanan Obstetri dan Neonatal Esensial Dasar) puskesmas, which are health centers with special
    responsibility for providing basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care across the country, generally do
    not have the inputs required to manage and treat obstetric emergencies such as postpartum hemorrhage
    and neonatal care. Hence, further Investments in Service Readiness for Maternal Health are needed across the
    board. Additional granularity emerges with the finding that deficiencies in diagnostic capacity, medicines
    and commodities, and specialized equipment, are more pronounced than deficiencies in basic equipment.
    Important urine tests, injectable antibiotics, and specialized equipment are lacking. Efforts are needed to
    Understand Why Supply-Side Deficiencies and Misallocations Exist as these could be related to how health
    facilities are financed and/or to a lack of accountability.

                                                                                                                   3


Furthermore, there are specific and worrying gaps in the availability of the key commodities required
to manage the two obstetric conditions that together account for 55 percent of maternal deaths -
hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and hemorrhage. For example, there are significant deficiencies
in the availability of urine tests required to diagnose these conditions. There is also a peculiar deficiency in
the availability of the recommended treatment of choice — magnesium sulphate — for managing these
conditions, while an alternative, inferior drug is more available (although also with limitations). Similarly,
key drugs required to manage hemorrhage are also limited in their availability, especially in ‘eastern’
provinces. These deficiencies, which may reflect more than just a logistics or financing issue and could
instead reflect limitations in provider knowledge and demand for these treatments, need to be explored
further to Address Specific Bottlenecks Preventing the Deployment of Specific Life-Saving Maternal Health
Interventions. Similarly, PONED puskesmas are only a little better than non-PONED puskesmas, and
substantially more underequipped than public hospitals, at providing primary care interventions like
basic obstetric care (which are intended to be provided at puskesmas-level facilities). This limits the
effectiveness of the referral network system built around PONED puskesmas. Hence it is recommended
that efforts to Strengthen the PONED and Referral Systems, which are already part of national policy, be
accelerated in an efficient and optimal manner.

As Indonesia moves forward with the implementation of JKN, priority should be placed on Ensuring
Non-Interruption of Universal Maternal Health Coverage Benefits by delaying and effectively coordinating
the termination of the Jampersal program, and on Clarifying the Supply-Side Implications of the Benefit
Package, with particular focus on ensuring clarity in the supply-side specification of the JKN benefit
package. These efforts are key to ensure that the focus is not just on increasing the breadth and height of
universal maternal health coverage, but also on ensuring that ‘effective depth’ of coverage exists in order to
realize improved maternal health outcomes.

    Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
Introduction
6


    1. Introduction

    Over the period 2011-2013, Indonesia had universal maternal health coverage for its population.
    Although there were some differences in the specific benefit entitlements, many in the country had maternal
    health coverage through Askes (the formal public sector social insurance program), Jamsostek (the formal
    private sector social insurance program), Jamkesmas (the non-contributory social insurance program for
    the poor and near-poor), or through Jamkesda (the local government-financed social insurance programs
    that complement Jamkesmas in several districts and provinces). In addition, anyone not covered by existing
    insurance programs had coverage via Jampersal, a special program financed by the central government that
    provided a comprehensive maternal health benefit package. Since 2014, most social insurance schemes
    (including Askes, Jamsostek, and Jamkesmas) have been merged under a single-payer umbrella – Jaminan
    Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) – and Jampersal has been dismantled.

    Utilization of most key maternal health services is relatively high in Indonesia. Latest data from the
    2012 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) indicate that 96 percent of mothers received
    antenatal care (ANC) from skilled providers, with 88 percent of all pregnant women receiving the WHO-
    recommended four or more ANC visits during their last pregnancy.3 In addition, 83 percent of all births
    occurred with the assistance of a skilled attendant, and 80 percent of mothers received postnatal care
    (PNC) within two days following delivery. Facility-based deliveries, however, remain relatively low: only
    about 63 percent of all deliveries occurred at a health facility in Indonesia.

    Recent progress notwithstanding, and despite the relatively high utilization rates for most key
    maternal health services, the level of maternal mortality remains high in Indonesia, especially in
    provinces such as West Papua, North Maluku, Papua, Gorontalo, West Sulawesi, Maluku, and South
    Kalimantan. In general, for a variety of reasons, high utilization of maternal health services need not
    translate into improvements in maternal health outcomes.4 High fertility rates, poor health and nutrition
    at the time of conception, and high levels of adolescent pregnancies can increase the risk of complications
    during pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, poor levels of service delivery—in terms of inputs, ability,
    and effort of health care providers—can lead to high maternal mortality outcomes despite high levels of
    utilization of maternal health services.5 In Indonesia, previous assessments indicate that continued use of
    traditional birth attendants, poor access to emergency obstetric services, and poor quality of health care
    have contributed to high levels of maternal mortality.6

    This policy paper assesses the supply-side readiness of Indonesia’s public health facilities in providing
    key maternal health services such as ANC as well as basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric
    care. Given universal maternal health coverage over the period 2011-2013, and using analyses of facility-

level data, the focus in the paper is on assessing to what extent Indonesia’s universal maternal health
coverage is “real”. What were the benefits provided for maternal health under the different social health
insurance programs? Were there clear facility-level guidelines for provision of maternal health services and
how did these compare with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Service Availability and Readiness
Assessment (SARA) guidelines?7 Did facilities have the minimum inputs to be able to adequately provide
ANC and basic and emergency obstetric services as stipulated in the benefit packages of the various
social insurance programs? If not, where are the biggest deficiencies and what might be potential ways of
overcoming them? Assessing supply-side readiness for key maternal health services is a key input to help
inform policy reforms aimed at attaining universal health coverage (UHC) in Indonesia by 2019. Ensuring
the supply-side readiness of Indonesia’s health system, incorporating lessons from the past experiences of
implementing universal maternal health coverage under the different social health insurance programs, will
be one key factor in ensuring that implementation of UHC results in improvements in health outcomes,
including for maternal health.8

The remainder of the policy paper is structured as follows: The section Maternal Health in Indonesia
provides some background on maternal health in Indonesia and on intended reforms to attain UHC by
2019. Assessing Universal Maternal Health Coverage in Indonesia provides information on maternal health
benefits under existing social health insurance programs. Public Facility Supply-Side Service Readiness
for Maternal Health outlines the supply-side implications of maternal health coverage using national
guidelines as well as the WHO’s SARA framework, focusing specifically on ANC as well as basic and
emergency obstetric care services and presents an assessment of service readiness using facility-level data.
The report then concludes with policy implications in the final section, Policy Implications and Conclusions.

of service delivery in a health system such as the availability of key human resources and infrastructure resources as well as basic
equipment, basic amenities, essential medicines, diagnostic tools, and the readiness of facilities to provide health-care interven-
tions for tracer conditions; for more details see: WHO. 2012. Measuring Service Availability and Readiness: A Health Facility

     2. Maternal Health in Indonesia

     The Republic of Indonesia is an archipelago of almost 18,000 islands encompassing 33 provinces and
     special administrative regions with over 238 million people. There are hundreds of distinct ethno-
     linguistic groups which reside in areas as diverse as densely populated Java to sparsely populated regions
     in Kalimantan and Papua.

     2.1 Maternal Mortality

     By most estimates, Indonesia has made steady and significant progress in attaining reductions
     in maternal mortality in the past few decades. Recently released joint United Nations-World Bank
     (UN-WB) data indicates that Indonesia’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) declined by an average of 3.5
     percent per year over the period 1990–2013 (Figure 1). Estimates from an Institute of Health Metrics and
     Evaluation (IHME) model indicate an annual decline of 1.9 percent per year 1990 to 2011. Data from
     the 2012 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) indicates a decline of 3.0 percent per year
     over 1990–2007 (albeit followed by an increase over the period 2007–2012) (Figure 1). By comparison,
     in order for Indonesia to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goal 5 (MDG5) target
     of reducing maternal mortality by 75 percent over 25 years, a 5.4 percent reduction in the maternal
     mortality rate per year is implied and needed. The decline in maternal mortality in the past few decades
     is likely a result of improvements in general socioeconomic conditions, as well as government initiatives
     specifically targeting maternal health. In addition to improving financial access via the expansion of social
     health insurance coverage, Indonesia has implemented several programs that include improving access
     to family planning services, overhauling the national midwifery program, the introduction of special
     “waiting rooms” for supervised deliveries in remote villages, and additional financing for puskesmas in
     regions with the poorest maternal health indicators.9

Recent progress notwithstanding, the level of maternal mortality in Indonesia remains high,
considering Indonesia’s economic status and regional comparators, especially in some of the poorer and
more remote regions of the country. There is some uncertainty about the exact level of Indonesia’s MMR.
Joint UN-WB model-based estimates report an MMR of 190 per 100,000 live births in 2013. The IHME
model estimated an MMR of 189 in 2011. 2012 IDHS estimates based on sibling-survival data indicate
an MMR of 359, although it is important to note that this latter estimate is derived from a sample
occurrence of only 92 maternal deaths over a five-year period (Figure 1).




Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia

     Despite the uncertainty in the estimates of the exact level of MMR in Indonesia, it remains clear
     that it is high and especially so for a country in which the population ostensibly has had access to
     universal maternal health coverage. Indonesia is also a relative underperformer, considering the economic
     status of the country and its health expenditure per capita. For example, Sri Lanka has a similar GDP per
     capita and health expenditure per capita as Indonesia, but has a substantially lower MMR. Indonesia has
     a higher GDP per capita and health expenditure per capita than India, but has a similar MMR (Figure 2).
     This suggests that the high MMR in Indonesia cannot solely be attributed to the economic status of the
     country nor its health expenditure.

     There are significant differences in the number of maternal deaths and in the MMR across provinces
     in Indonesia. Whereas the absolute number of maternal deaths is highest in populous provinces such as
     Central and West Java, the MMR is highest in West Papua, North Maluku, Papua, Gorontalo, and West
     Sulawesi. DKI Jakarta, Bali, and DI Yogyakarta have the lowest MMRs in the country (Figure 3).

Many factors contribute to the relatively high levels of maternal mortality in Indonesia. Hypertensive
disorders during pregnancy, including eclampsia and preeclampsia, and postpartum and antepartum
hemorrhage, were the two biggest causes of maternal death in the country. Although rates of skilled
attendance at births have risen significantly in recent years, there are concerns about the training of
midwives and their adherence to protocols. Access to emergency obstetric care in the case of complications
remains a challenge in some parts of the country. In general, the number of obstetricians is low and
availability is skewed, with most practicing on the island of Java. Referral systems do not always function
smoothly across different levels of care. Continued use of traditional birth attendants in some areas is
another contributory factor.10

     Adolescent pregnancies are a further concern as mothers under the age of 18 are more likely to
     experience complications during pregnancy. According to the 2012 IDHS, 10 percent of adolescent
     women (ages 15–19 years) had begun childbearing: 7 percent had a live birth and 3 percent were pregnant
     with their first child.12 Unsurprisingly, adolescent women from rural areas with only primary education
     (or less) and those from lower wealth quintiles were associated with early childbearing. Worryingly, this
     proportion is an increasing trend compared with the 2007 IDHS.

     2.2 Utilization of Maternal Health Services

     Indonesia has mixed public-private provision of health care services. The public sector generally
     takes a dominant role in rural areas and for secondary levels of care but, as discussed below, this is not
     necessarily the case for maternal health services. Private provision has been increasing rapidly in recent
     years, including for primary care. Of the 163,000 hospital beds in the country, about 52,000 are managed
     by the private sector. According to the Indonesia Midwives Association, there are 37,289 midwives in
     private practice. For primary care, Indonesia has more than 9,500 public puskesmas (PONED and non-
     PONED puskesmas), each serving catchment areas of 25,000–30,000 individuals (approximately a third
     of puskesmas also provide inpatient services).13 The public system also includes village-level public health
     facilities: village delivery posts (polindes, often the home of a village midwife) and village health posts
     (poskesdes). Under the Jampersal program, poskesdes count as health facilities and are supposed to be

          Approximately 500 new puskesmas have been constructed since the Rifaskes census in 2011.

equipped to handle normal deliveries. Maternal health providers and facilities are summarized in Table
2 below, including details on the role of PONED puskesmas: a subset type of puskesmas that form a
backbone of the obstetric referral system in the country. There are specific guidelines for the availability
(density) of PONED puskesmas and service standards (including staffing, training, and equipment). In
addition, the implementation plans for PONED include making detailed plans for how referrals are to be
arranged and for the socialization of the availability of these facilities to the general population. Although
these guidelines and plans exist, the socialization of the PONED system is unclear and women may not
know the difference between PONED puskesmas and ordinary puskesmas.

Within Indonesia, there is a wide variation in the density and type of health facilities14 across
provinces (Figure 4). Generally, densely populated provinces have fewer health facilities per population
and this could be related to the dominance of private health providers and efficiency gains in having fewer
but larger health facilities in densely populated areas. Only West Papua, a sparsely populated province, has
close to the WHO recommended target15 of two health facilities per 10,000 people. PONED guidelines
require at least one PONED puskesmas per 100,000 people. On a provincially aggregate basis, this
requirement is met in most provinces except densely populated provinces and Papua. Papua is also notable
in that the density of puskesmas is high, but few of these are PONED puskesmas.

With regard to human resources for health, the density of health workers in Indonesia is just below
the WHO’s critical threshold of 23 health workers (doctors, nurses, and midwives) per 10,000 people,
which is the minimum required to achieve an 80 percent coverage rate for deliveries by skilled birth
attendants.16 The density of health workers is typical for the region (Figure 5), but the performance of
countries with a similar density of health workers varies widely—from Thailand with a much lower MMR
to Lao PDR with a much higher MMR— suggesting that other factors are also crucial in influencing
maternal health.

     quintile). ANC utilization (of all providers, both public and private) was in excess of 90 percent both
     among those living in urban areas and rural areas. One outlier was the province of Papua, with an ANC
     utilization rate of only 58 percent; all other provinces in Indonesia had ANC utilization rates greater than
     85 percent (Figure 6).

     Almost half of all ANC visits occurred at private clinics in Indonesia: 29 percent occurred at
     village-level public health facilities; 18 percent occurred at puskesmas; and only 3 percent at public
     hospitals. There were wide variations in the extent to which ANC utilization occurred at puskesmas
     or at public hospitals across provinces. More than half of all ANC visits occurred at either puskesmas
     or public hospitals in the provinces of Papua, East Nusa Tenggara, West Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Maluku,
     South Sulawesi, West Papua, Central Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, and North Maluku (as compared to 21
     percent nationally) (Figure 6). One third of all ANC visits among the poorest economic quintile occurred
     in puskesmas (compared to 8 percent among the richest). Only 2 percent of the poor utilized ANC
     care at public hospitals compared with 8 percent of the rich. Greater utilization of public hospitals than
     puskesmas may be a general indication of perceived deficiencies in the provision of care at puskesmas. This

is particularly notable in Papua, West Papua, North Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara, North Sulawesi, and
East Kalimantan, where this prominence of ANC utilization at public hospitals in could be an indication
of perceived or real deficiencies in the the provision of care at puskesmas.

The rate of skilled attendance at births in Indonesia was 83 percent, with 62 percent of births attended
by a nurse, midwife, or village midwife, 20 percent attended by an obstetrician, and 1 percent by a medical
doctor. Nationally, about 14 percent of births were attended by traditional birth attendants, but this
proportion rose to almost a third among the poorest economic quintile. Variations in rates of skilled birth
attendance were notable between urban and rural dwellers (92 percent versus 75 percent, respectively),
between the rich and the poor (98 percent versus 57 percent, respectively), and across provinces. Less
than 50 percent of births were attended by a skilled health worker in Papua, Maluku, and West Sulawesi,
compared to almost 100 percent in Bali and DKI Jakarta.

The institutional delivery rate is one of the few key maternal health utilization indicators that was
relatively low in Indonesia. Only about 63 percent of all deliveries occurred in a health facility in 2012.18
The institutional delivery rate at health facilities was almost double in urban areas versus rural areas (80
percent versus 47 percent, respectively). Home delivery rates among mothers in the lowest economic
quintile were almost six times higher than among mothers in the highest economic quintile (69 percent
versus 12 percent, respectively). About 17 percent of all deliveries occurred at puskesmas (5 percent) or

     public hospitals (11 percent).19 By contrast, almost 47 percent of deliveries nationally were at private
     hospitals.20 This paper focuses on institutional deliveries rather than skilled birth attendance, not because
     the importance and contribution of skilled birth attendance is not recognized, but due to the nature of the
     facility-based supply-side assessment and framework described in the next section.

     In general, higher institutional delivery rates were strongly associated with higher use of private
     facilities. Use of private facilities for deliveries was highest in Java-Bali provinces. West Nusa Tenggara,
     East Nusa Tenggara, North Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, and Gorontalo had some of the highest proportions
     of all deliveries occurring at puskesmas and public hospitals (Figure 8). East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa
     Tenggara were also the two provinces with the highest proportion of all births occurring at puskesmas
     (21 percent and 18 percent, respectively). Institutional delivery rates were inversely related with maternal
     mortality ratios across provinces (Figure 9).

Utilization of postnatal care (PNC) services was also relatively high: 80 percent of mothers received
postnatal care within two days following delivery. PNC was provided mainly by nurses, midwives, or
village midwives (60 percent) and obstetricians (17 percent), while doctors (1 percent) and traditional
birth attendants (2 percent) played a smaller role in PNC. Almost all women who delivered at a health
facility (96 percent) had a PNC checkup. The lack of any PNC checkups was associated with greater
parity21, rural residence, lower educational status, and lower wealth quintiles.

2.3 Universal Health Coverage Reforms in Indonesia

Since 2011, Indonesia has had universal maternal health coverage for its population, in the sense that
everyone who potentially needs maternal health care has coverage under at least one of the various health
coverage schemes. Although there are some differences in the specific benefit entitlements, many in the
country have maternal health coverage through Askes (covering 9 percent of the population), Jamsostek
(covering 8 percent of the population), Jamkesmas (the non-contributory social insurance program for
the poor and near-poor), or via Jamkesda (the local government-financed social insurance programs that
complement Jamkesmas in several districts and provinces). Jamkesmas and Jamkesda together cover
about 21 percent of the population.22 In addition, since 2011, anyone not covered by existing insurance
programs has coverage via Jampersal, a special program financed by the central government that provides
a comprehensive maternal health benefit package (described in more detail below), hence the breadth of
coverage for maternal health in Indonesia is universal, theoretically.

  These are estimates from SUSENAS 2011; the magnitude of the extent of insurance coverage is similar to that found in
IDHS 2012.

        Box 1: Jampersal1


        Jampersal is a program for maternity care supported by the central government and speciﬁcally
        targeted at pregnant women who are not covered by any other health insurance schemes, and was
        implemented from 2011 to 2013 in line with the Ministry of Health Strategic Plan 2010—2014 and
        the government’s Roadmap to Accelerate the Achievement of MDGs in Indonesia. The Jampersal
        beneﬁts package includes antenatal care, delivery care, and post-partum care for the mother and
        newborn, and family planning, at both public health facilities and enlisted private facilities. Funds are
        channeled from the central Ministry of Health to hospitals (directly) and to primary care facilities (via
        the District Health Oﬃce). Reimbursement tariﬀs to providers were increased and beneﬁts for users
        expanded between 2011 and 2012. With the introduction of the National Health Insurance Program
        (JKN) on January 1, 2014, the implementation of Jampersal has been terminated and merged into JKN.


        A small study on Jampersal in two areas in West Java—Garut District and Depok Municipality—found
        that utilization of institutional deliveries increased by 14 percent between 2011, just before Jampersal
        was implemented, and 2013, and that the increase in utilization was highest among women who
        were least educated, poor, and who resided in rural areas.

     Indonesia is in the midst of implementing a series of health system reforms aimed at attaining
     UHC for all health services by 2019. The universal right to health care was included as an amendment
     to Indonesia’s constitution in 1999. However, the impetus for UHC came a few years later, in a 2004
     landmark legislation—the Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional or the SJSN Law—which formed the legal
     basis for attaining several social protection objectives in the country. In 2011, the government passed a
     ground-breaking follow-up law that defined the administrative and implementation arrangements—the
     Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial or BPJS Law—which stipulated that several existing contributory
     and non-contributory social health insurance schemes would be merged to provide streamlined uniform
     benefits under a single-payer umbrella beginning in 2014. Following institutionalization of the single-
     payer insurance administrator (BPJS Kesehatan) in 2014, the government plans to incrementally extend
     coverage to the entire population by 2019. BPJS Kesehatan is expected to contract with both public and
     private providers for delivery of the benefit package beginning in 2014. Jampersal will be phased out
     beginning in 2014.

                                                                                                           23


Assessing supply-side readiness for key maternal health services is a key input to help inform
policy reforms aimed at attaining UHC in Indonesia by 2019. Ensuring the supply-side readiness of
Indonesia’s health system, incorporating lessons from the experiences of implementing universal maternal
health coverage under existing social health insurance programs, will be one key factor in ensuring that
implementation of UHC results in improvements in health outcomes, including for maternal health.

     UHC—ensuring that everyone has access to quality health services when needed, without experiencing
     financial hardship as a result—can be conceptualized as having three key dimensions: “breadth”,
     “height”, and “depth” (Figure 10).23 Breadth refers to the proportion of the population that is covered;
     height refers to the proportion of health costs that are paid by pooled funds as opposed to via direct OOP
     payments; and depth refers to the benefit package of services that are covered by pooled financing (and the
     definition of services can be broadened to include provision of public health interventions).24

                           Population: who is covered?



     One of the key challenges to implementing UHC from a service delivery perspective is to
     ensure depth (benefit package) of coverage—not just on paper, but also in effect (available at an
     accessible, empanelled provider)—especially in rural, remote regions of the country and in light
     of the continuing challenges related to improving maternal health outcomes in Indonesia. Table
     3 summarizes benefit package entitlements and provider payment methods for maternal health services
     under some of the existing social insurance programs such as Jamkesmas, Jampersal, and Askes. The
     proposed JKN benefit package for maternal health services is comprehensive and will be similar to that of
     Jamkesmas and Jampersal.

Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia

     Demand-side payments from social health insurance schemes are not the primary source of revenue
     for public health facilities. For example, health facilities receive supply-side investments and operational
     financing in the form of equipment and drugs from and determined by the local government. The central
     government also contributes towards specific vertical programs such as immunizations, contraception,
     and communicable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria—in some instances through a special
     central fund.25 Operational budgets (including salaries) are also provided by local governments (except
     in the case of central hospitals). Hence, accountability for supply-side readiness (especially for non-
     commodities; for example, equipment and staffing) falls, to a large extent, under the responsibility of local
     governments.

     Both Jampersal and Askes make important distinctions between primary care and secondary care
     for the purposes of reimbursement. At the primary care level, outpatient maternal health care—such as
     ANC and PNC visits—are reimbursed on a case-by-case basis at a rate of Rp 20,000 per visit. Secondary
     maternal health care is reimbursed by Jampersal and Jamkesmas using a form of diagnosis-related groups
     (DRGs) called Indonesia Case-based Groups (INA-CBGs). Askes, the insurance scheme for civil servants,
     provides lower benefit payments than Jampersal and Jamkesmas: Rp 300,000 instead of Rp 500,000 for
     a normal delivery.

     Private facilities in the network are reimbursed the same amount as public facilities under Jamkesmas
     and Jampersal, but do not receive the same central and local government supply-side financing. Askes
     reimbursements to private facilities are based on negotiated rates, but presumably, this will be phased out
     with the introduction of JKN. Considering that both public and empanelled private providers will receive
     the same demand-side payments from JKN, private providers are possibly at a disadvantage as they do
     not receive supply-side financing (equipment, salaries, etc.) from the government but would presumably
     cover these costs from the demand-side payments. Considering that utilization of maternal health (MH)
     services is low, the capacity and dynamism of both public and private sector providers would be helpful
     during this initial period—perhaps with private providers filling in geographic or service gaps with the
     focus of expanding coverage, although careful attention has to be paid through the accreditation process
     to ensure adequate service readiness in both sectors. As it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore this
     in further detail, additional research is anticipated through a forthcoming Public Expenditure Tracking
     Survey to explore the dynamics arising from interactions between public and private providers, in the
     context of the newly merged JKN health insurance scheme.

     3.1 Framework for Analysis

     The framework used in this paper to assess supply-side readiness for UHC is summarized in Figure
     11 below. As depicted in the figure, the supply-side assessment begins with an examination of the current
     maternal benefit package for key social health insurance programs in the country. Detailed supply-side
     implications for the provision of the benefit package were derived from program-specific facility guidelines
     that detail equipment, diagnostic tests, and medicines that are stipulated to be available at facilities. The


     25
        This Special Allocation Fund, or Dana Alokasi Khusus (DAK), is a central funded allocation to the local government (prov-
     ince/district) to finance special local government needs, especially needs related to national priorities (Law No. 33 year 2004 :
     Equalization fund between central and local government; and Government Regulation (PP) No. 55 year 2005 : Equalization fund).


                                                                                        Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
                                                                                                                         29


paper also compares the supply-side implications from program-specific facility guidelines with those
recommended by the World Health Organization’s SARA framework. SARA is a comprehensive framework
for monitoring and assessing key aspects of service delivery in a health system.26 The framework has
two dimensions: (i) service availability: this is with regard to number and distribution of health facilities
and staff; and (ii) service readiness: this includes two elements—general service readiness (which relates
to general infrastructure required to provide any type of health service, for example water supply and
electricity) and specific service readiness (which relates to the specific inputs required for specific diseases,
conditions, and services such as diabetes mellitus and antenatal care). This paper and analysis focuses on
the service readiness dimension of SARA, providing a framework to collect and analyze facility-level data,
and enabling an assessment of whether or not facilities have the minimum staffing, equipment, diagnostic
capacity, medicines, and commodities for a given disease or condition. This SARA framework can also
provide an inference of the extent to which a health system is able to minimally provide the benefits that
are included under the service benefit package dimension of UHC schemes, and hence by extension, this
framework can help assess the “effective depth” of MH coverage.

In assessing the depth of UHC, it is also important to link the provision of covered benefits to
broader issues related to service delivery. Service delivery can be conceptualized as consisting of three
key dimensions: (i) inputs; (ii) provider ability; and (iii) provider effort.27 The abovementioned framework

     in Indonesia focus on the issue of service delivery inputs.28 Needless to say, even if service delivery inputs
     are available, the ability and efforts of providers—as well as the actions and behaviors of households and
     key interventions in other sectors—remain areas of consideration in ensuring that any intended reforms
     lead to improvements in MH and other health outcomes.

     3.2 Data Sources

     The assessment of the depth of coverage reported in this policy note using the framework outlined
     above is based primarily on analysis of the 2011 Rifaskes facility census data, validated, where possible,
     with information from the 2011 Health Facility Costing Study (HFCS) and evidence reported in recent
     literature where applicable.29 The Rifaskes facility data was collected by the Ministry of Health’s National
     Institute Health Research and Development Ministry in 2011. The data covers all public facilities owned
     by central, provincial, and district governments—a total of 707 hospitals and 9,005 puskesmas. From
     these, 685 hospitals and 8,981 puskesmas, that is, those that were operational prior to January 2010, were
     included in the final analysis. The data includes information on human resources, medical equipment,
     organization and management, health services, and outputs of most essential health services. Data was
     collected through interviews, observations, and also from secondary sources. Independent validation of
     the Rifaskes data was conducted by three public health faculties in Indonesia: University of Indonesia,
     Airlangga University, and Hasanuddin University.

     Although the design of the Rifaskes census of puskesmas and hospitals throughout Indonesia was
     not based on the WHO SARA framework, it includes many questions in common with the WHO
     SARA questionnaire and these have been used to estimate, albeit incomplete, of the corresponding SARA
     service readiness indicators presented in this report. There are certain occasions where the SARA indicator
     is more precise and specific (e.g., urine dipstick test for protein) than the Rifaskes (e.g., urine test), and
     this is noted as footnotes in the analysis.

     Private providers were not included in Rifaskes, except for a small unrepresentative sample, and this
     unfortunately limits the analysis to public providers. This is an important caveat to bear in mind, as the
     utilization of private facilities for MH services is significant and indeed larger than that of public providers.
     This is especially so in densely populated provinces, which due to their sheer population size contribute
     more towards absolute counts of maternal deaths than remote and sparsely populated provinces (which
     tend to have higher mortality rates). Considering that private providers are even more dominant in these
     densely populated provinces, the lack of data on private providers would constrain the value of an analysis
     focused on those provinces. Although it could be argued that by focusing this analysis on exploring the

     29
          A further possible data source—the PODES Village Infrastructure Census (2011)—was considered for inclusion in this
     analysis, but unfortunately the census was not found to contain relevant information for contextualizing or validating the analy-
     sis from the other data sources.


                                                                                       Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
                                                                                                               31


effective depth of coverage of MH, providers within the health insurance schemes (all public providers
are automatically ‘empanelled’) are key. However, private providers too can be empanelled, albeit after
an accreditation process, and this accreditation process would presumably imply that a set of minimum
criteria for service readiness had already been met by empanelled private providers. It is understood,
however, that the government is currently in the process of conducting a follow-up assessment of facilities,
building on Rifaskes, but with inclusion of private providers.

The Rifaskes data, and to some extent the WHO SARA framework, do not specifically explore
provider ability or provider effort directly. Formal training received and job role are the primary means
of defining minimum human resources for health (HRH) service readiness. Actual provider knowledge
and skills, and actual provider presence at the health facility are not part of this framework.

Analysis of Rifaskes data was complemented with results from HFCS data, the latter collected as part
of a nationwide costing study commissioned by the Ministry of Health in 2011, financed by the German
organization for international cooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ))
and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) with technical support from Oxford
Policy Management, GIZ, and Universitas Gadjah Mada. The facility survey sampled 234 puskesmas,
120 government general hospitals, and 80 private general hospitals across 15 provinces in 30 districts/
cities. The sample was selected using a stratified random sampling method so as to ensure national
representativeness of the facility data, but the sampling method and sampling frame are different from
those of Rifaskes, and hence direct comparisons would not be valid. The primary objective of the GIZ
health facility study was to calculate the cost of service provision. For this purpose, the study collected
highly detailed information about assets, drugs, equipment, and supplies from the fourth quarter of 2010
until the third quarter of 2011. Some modules were collected monthly; others were collected quarterly
or annually. To ensure data quality, an independent verification team was established consisting of staff
from four universities: University of Indonesia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, University of Airlangga, and
University of Hasannudin. The richness of the database and the time period of data collection make it
useful for triangulation with Rifaskes data.

Annex A summarizes key information regarding both the Rifaskes and GIZ facility datasets used in the
analysis reported in this policy note.

        Readiness for Maternal Health

     As mentioned above, the SARA framework includes two domains of focus for service readiness:
     general service readiness and specific service readiness. General service readiness refers to the basics
     required to provide any medical service, such as availability of water and sanitation facilities, electricity,
     and a private room for consultations. Specific service readiness, in the context of maternal health, refers to
     specific components and stages of maternal health such as antenatal care (ANC) and basic obstetric care.

     4.1 General Service Readiness

     Analysis of puskesmas data from Rifaskes indicates that many puskesmas lacked basic water and
     sanitation facilities, but access to referral communications and transportation systems was generally
     reasonable. Although almost all puskesmas had electricity and a private room for consultations, adequate
     water and sanitation facilities, important for ensuring clean and hygienic conditions for childbirth, were
     only available in 72 percent of all puskesmas. If obstetric complications were to occur, which necessitate
     an emergency referral to hospital, 82 percent of puskesmas had access to referral transportation and 84
     percent had access to basic communications such as telephones (Figure 12).

There was a nearly twofold difference between provinces with the lowest and highest general service
readiness. In Papua, the mean basic amenities index was 46 percent compared with 89 percent for DI
Yogyakarta (Figure 13).30 As almost all puskesmas had electricity and a private room, the provincial
differences appear to be driven by the availability of water, sanitation facilities, basic communications,
and referral transportation, which are all vital for the provision of obstetric services. For example, only 40
percent of puskesmas in Papua had water and sanitation facilities compared with 80 percent or more in
the provinces in Java. Almost half of puskesmas in West Sulawesi lacked the means to transport a pregnant
woman needing emergency referral to hospital; and although the 66 percent of puskesmas in East Nusa
Tenggara had this means, only 40 percent would have been able to communicate the referral or seek advice
by telephone. This contrasted with the readiness of puskesmas in the provinces in Java to provide transport
and basic communications, which was above 90 percent.

    The index is the mean availability of relevant service readiness indicators for basic amenities. For example, if the basic ameni-
ties index in a given province was 50%, this meant that on average, health centers in that province only met half of the relevant
service readiness indicators for basic amenities.


Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia

     In general, urban puskesmas had better service readiness indicators when compared with rural
     puskesmas. This was also true to a lesser extent when PONED puskesmas were compared with non-
     PONED puskesmas (Table 4). For public hospitals, by way of contrast, the availability of general services
     indicators was almost 100 percent (Table 4). Compared with international comparators for which data
     was available, puskesmas in Indonesia are better supplied with electricity but somewhat less so for water
     and toilets (Table 4).

     4.2 Antenatal Care

     The benefit package for existing social health insurance programs such as Jamkesmas and Jampersal
     includes coverage for up to four ANC visits: one during the first trimester, one during the second
     trimester, and two during the third trimester. The content of ANC services, according to Antenatal Care
     Guidelines, should include: height measurement, weight measurement, blood pressure measurement,
     fundal height measurement, blood tests, urine tests, iron tablets, tetanus toxoid vaccinations, and advice
     on complications during pregnancy and delivery.31 The associated service readiness indicators for ANC are
     summarized in Table 5. Apart from the Doppler ultrasound and the weighing scale, which are stipulated
     under national guidelines, the national supply-side requirements for ANC are the same as those in WHO
     SARA (Table 5). In the rightmost column, Table 5 shows which of the indicators were available for
     analysis in the Indonesia facility data sets.

Equipment required to conduct basic ANC services, such as blood pressure apparatus, was widely
available across all puskesmas in Indonesia. Furthermore, more than 75 percent of all puskesmas
reported having staff trained in ANC. Stethoscopes, iron and folic acid tablets, and tetanus toxoid vaccines
were also generally reported as being available. Hemoglobin blood tests, used for diagnosing anemia, were
available in 81 percent of puskesmas nationally.

The two indicators for which ANC service readiness was weak at puskesmas were with regard to
availability of ANC guidelines at the facility and the ability to conduct urine tests. Although the
average availability of ANC indicators was over 80 percent, only 20 percent of puskesmas had all the
measured ANC service readiness indicators available, suggesting that there is still substantial scope to
improve the service readiness of puskesmas. ANC service readiness at public hospitals was generally higher
than at puskesmas for all available ANC indicators, although Rifaskes did not collect data on ANC-
specific commodities at hospitals (Figure 14).

     Three provinces—namely, Maluku, Papua, and West Papua—had generally poor ANC supply-side
     readiness indicators. These were also the same provinces in which more than half of all ANC utilization
     visits occurred at puskesmas (Figure 6) and that had the highest maternal mortality rates (MMRs) in the
     country (Figure 3). Whereas in the provinces in Java, hemoglobin testing was available at more than 90
     percent of all puskesmas, in some provinces such as North Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua less than 60
     percent of puskesmas had this blood test available. The availability of urine tests was even more limited:
     only 43 percent of non-PONED puskesmas and 66 percent of PONED puskesmas had this capacity.32
     Although finding protein in the urine is vital in diagnosing pre-eclampsia and finding glucose in urine
     is vital in screening for gestational diabetes, urine tests were almost completely unavailable in certain
     provinces such as Gorontolo (3 percent), North Sulawesi (5 percent), and Maluku (8 percent), which
     contrasts with the universal availability of urine tests in puskesmas in DI Yogyakarta (100 percent).

        The Rifaskes questionnaire does not differentiate between the different types of urine tests (e.g., for protein, ketones, or
     glucose).

Deficiencies in the availability of basic ANC-related medicines at puskesmas were also prominent in
some provinces. In particular, availability of iron and folic acid tablets was limited in Papua (77 percent),
West Papua (83 percent), and Maluku (86 percent) (Table 6). Tetanus toxoid vaccines—which unlike iron
and folic acid tablets require a cold chain—were stocked by 95 percent of puskesmas nationally; however,
deficiencies were notable in some provinces such as Papua (58 percent), West Sulawesi (88 percent), and
North Maluku (89 percent) with implications for neonatal tetanus, especially if there is an associated lack
of infection control and sterilization of equipment at the same facilities.

a. The ANC index is the unweighted mean availability of selected ANC indicators. There is mild skewing of this data which does not aﬀect the provincial rank order.
   Use of mean is consistent with usage in similar SARA analysis and reports, e.g., http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/datacatalog/index.php/catalog/25

     and reusable equipment such as the measurement of blood pressure and body weight are unsurprisingly
     reported by 97 percent of pregnant women as having been received (see Figure 15). With regard to
     diagnostic tests, far fewer pregnant women reported having received these basic diagnostic tests—for
     example, only 52 percent of pregnant women reported having had a blood test and only 49 percent
     reported having been provided with a urine test during antenatal care at puskesmas. The former is
     particularly intriguing as the service availability of blood tests is decent.

However, there are exceptions to this comparability—especially for iron and folic acid tablets, and
blood tests—providing further insight into additional limitations and constraints (i.e., those not
due to service readiness alone) that prevent women from receiving the full ANC package. For example,
it is surprising that only 79 percent of pregnant women received iron and folic acid tables even though
97 percent of puskesmas stocked this (Figure 16 and Table 7). This may be related to training and low
provider compliance to guidelines. Similarly, even though blood tests were available in 81 percent of
puskesmas, only 52 percent of pregnant women reported a blood test during ANC.

     Despite some cases of disconnect between supply readiness and service provision, provinces with
     better ANC supply readiness also are generally better at providing the different ANC components
     at puskesmas level. Almost every component for ANC was better provided in the high ANC index
     provinces of Bangka Belitung, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, East Java, and DI Yogyakarta compared
     to provinces with some of the lowest ANC supply-side readiness such as Papua, Maluku, West Papua,
     North Sulawesi, and North Maluku.

     4.3 Basic Obstetric Care

     There is substantial overlap between the WHO SARA guidelines for basic obstetric care and
     Indonesia’s National Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (PONED) guidelines, allowing
     for greater detail in the analysis. Supply-side readiness indicators for basic obstetric care according
     to SARA and PONED guidelines are summarized in Table 8. The analysis of supply-side readiness for
     basic obstetric care focuses on: (i) supply-side readiness in PONED puskesmas; (ii) provinces where the
     proportion of deliveries occurring at puskesmas were the highest; and (iii) provinces with the highest rates
     of maternal mortality. Most (not all) supply-side readiness indicators for basic obstetric care were available

Nationally, only 62 percent of PONED puskesmas had at least one staff member trained in PONED
in the previous two years34, only slightly more than in non-PONED puskesmas (50 percent). About
three-fourths (77 percent) of PONED puskesmas and 68 percent of non-PONED puskesmas reported
having guidelines for basic obstetric care available at the facilities. Geographical disparities appear modest,
even for human resources for health (HRH)—with rural puskesmas appearing to be better staffed than
urban puskesmas (Table 9). The availability of PONED guidelines and HRH training in PONEDs was
generally the same or higher in public hospitals in the country (Table 9).

    The arbitrary cut-off of training within the last two years, is in concordance with SARA guidelines. However, this is not
intended to be an adequate marker for provider ability—training within the last two years does not necessarily mean that the
provider has the ability to perform.

There was substantial variation in the availability of equipment required to provide basic obstetric
care. On the positive side, basic equipment such as delivery packs and blood pressure apparatus are almost
universally available (in 92 percent and 96 percent of all puskesmas throughout the country, respectively)
(Table 10). Even in rural areas, the availability of either exceeded 91 percent. However, among the five
provinces with some of the highest rates of maternal mortality, for instance, Papua and West Papua, the
availability of delivery packs was only 78 percent and 83 percent, respectively; and for blood pressure
apparatus, 83 percent and 85 percent, respectively. However, the availability of emergency transport
was generally deficient except for in some of the larger urban centers such as DKI Jakarta (98 percent)
and Yogyakarta (94 percent). Among the five provinces with the highest rates of maternal mortality, the
availability of emergency transport was extremely poor: only 52 percent in West Sulawesi and 55 percent
on North Maluku (Table 10).

     Public hospitals are clearly better equipped, with 95 percent possessing a manual vacuum extractor
     (for assisting with complicated deliveries) and 95 percent possessing a Doppler ultrasound (for the easy
     detection and measurement of the fetal heart rate) (Table 10).

     Medicines and commodities required for basic obstetric care are generally poorly available, with
     the exception of lidocaine. The availability of drugs and commodities such as intravenous solution and
     oxytocin was notably deficient, especially when compared with the availability of basic equipment (Figure
     18).

     The most common causes of maternal mortality can be classified into two categories: postpartum
     hemorrhage (PPH), and preeclampsia and eclampsia.35,36 Being cognizant that the determinants of
     maternal mortality are far more complex than the service readiness of puskesmas, especially considering that
     most deliveries (and most maternal deaths37) do not occur at puskesmas, in the following paragraphs these


     35
         PPH refers to abnormally large amounts of bleeding following childbirth. The main risk factors for PPH are a prolonged
     third stage of labor, parity (e.g., multiple previous pregnancies, multiple pregnancies (e.g., twins), and unskilled birth delivery
     assistance (e.g., episiotomy) resulting in trauma of the birth canal. With this in mind, the person attending the birth would
     need the training to manage the birth process skillfully (including in the use of uterotonic drugs such as oxytocin to actively
     manage the third stage of labor, as per basic obstetric training) in order to reduce the risk of PPH, to be able to detect (through
     training and experience) that the women is bleeding an unusually large amount, identify the source of where the bleeding is
     coming from, and to treat that cause by stopping/slowing the bleeding.

         Abnormally high blood pressure related to pregnancy (preeclampsia), leading to seizures (eclampsia).
     37
         Locations of maternal deaths: Urban maternal deaths: 49% at public hospitals, 25% at private hospitals, 18% at home, 5%
     at other locations; Rural maternal deaths: 38% at public hospitals, 36% at home, 10% at private hospitals, 0.5% at puskesmas,
     10% at other locations.


                                                                                         Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
                                                                                                                                 47


two causes of maternal death are contextualized against the availability of specific equipment, medicines,
and commodities used to identify or treat these conditions. This is not intended to be a comprehensive
analysis of the determinants of maternal mortality in Indonesia, but merely a logical way of categorizing
the mix of service readiness indicators for basic obstetric care.

In the case of PPH, to identify the source of the bleeding, the attendant needs an examination light and
a speculum (to help visualize the birth canal). These were present in only 86 percent and 72 percent of
PONED puskesmas, respectively. In some urban centers, it is understandable that only some puskesmas
have a Sims speculum, as they are unlikely to have to manage obstetric emergencies since deliveries would
mainly occur at hospitals. However, in certain provinces with high rates of maternal mortality such as
Papua and West Papua, it is of grave concern that only 11 percent and 13 percent of puskesmas had this
speculum, respectively, as these facilities would be inadequately equipped to manage PPH even if the
delivery occurred there.

Uterotonic drugs (oxytocin and ergometrine injection) for prevention and treatment of PPH were
only available in 36 percent of puskesmas (Table 11).38 Even among PONED puskesmas, which have
special responsibility for managing obstetric cases, the availability of these drugs was limited: 67 percent
for oxytocin and 69 percent for ergometrine.39 The geographical inequalities are an even greater concern.
In all five provinces with the highest rates of maternal mortality, the availability of these lifesaving drugs
was below 50 percent and as low as 17 percent in the case of oxytocin in Papua. Even in provinces
where the utilization of puskesmas for deliveries were the highest in the country—for example, West and
East Nusa Tenggara, and North and South Sulawesi—the availability of oxytocin and ergometrine was
modest (ranging from 45 to 61 percent) except for in North Sulawesi, where the availability was low:
only 20 percent for oxytocin and 24 percent for ergometrine. Intravenous solution, essential for PPH
management, was only available in 12 to 21 percent of puskesmas in the five provinces with the highest
rates of maternal mortality, and was only 51 percent of PONED puskesmas.




38
    Uterine atony (loss of tone of uterine muscles) is the main cause of PPH. This can be managed and treated by uterine
massage and administration of uterotonic drugs which cause the uterus to contract down tightly so that bleeding from the inner
lining of the uterus stops or slows.
39
    HFCS data indicate higher availability of oxytocin and ergometrine among PONED puskesmas: 86% and 86%, respective-
ly.

                                                                                                                                    49


Blood pressure equipment for detecting abnormally high blood pressure that can lead to preeclampsia
and eclampsia was widely available (at 98 percent of PONED puskesmas). On the other hand, urine
tests were only available in 42 percent of PONED puskesmas and in only 3 percent of puskesmas in
Gorontalo (Table 12).40

For the prevention and treatment of seizures related to abnormal high blood pressure, only 7 percent
of PONED puskesmas have injectable magnesium sulphate in stock. This is ironically less than the
availability in puskesmas nationally (44 percent). Injectable diazepam, an alternative drug that is also
used to treat seizures, is more widely available, in 69 percent of PONED puskesmas compared with 55
percent of all puskesmas nationally.41 Both injectable magnesium sulphate and injectable diazepam are
specified in the essential medicines list for puskesmas.42 However, national PONED and Comprehensive
Emergency obstetric and neonatal care (Pelayanan obstetric dan neonatal emergensi komprehensif (PONEK/
CEONC) guidelines, as well as international guidelines, recommend the use of injectable magnesium
sulphate instead of injectable diazepam due to its superior clinical results compared with diazepam.43
Considering that PONED puskesmas typically stock injectable diazepam instead of injectable magnesium
sulphate, these findings provide tantalizing evidence that although clinical guidelines (from 2005 and
2007) and essential medicines lists (from 2011, that is, before the Rifaskes census) have been updated, the
likely actual practice inferred by this data is that preeclampsia and eclampsia are generally managed with
injectable diazepam instead of injectable magnesium sulphate. Regional variation is a further concern with
only 42 percent and 50 percent of puskesmas in Papua and West Papua, where maternal mortality rates
are among the highest in the country, stocking diazepam (and far fewer stocking injectable magnesium
sulphate). Even just including the top four provinces where the utilization of puskesmas for deliveries is
highest, there is considerable variation in the availability of injectable magnesium sulphate (ranging from
23 percent to 64 percent) and injectable diazepam (ranging from 30 percent to 77 percent) suggesting that
utilization alone may not drive the service readiness of these basic obstetric medicines.

    Rifaskes does not provide additional details on the nature of the urine test—for example, whether it is a test for glucose or
protein.
41
    HFCS data indicates that the availability of injectable magnesium sulphate and injectable diazepam at PONED puskes-
mas is higher—36% and 75% respectively—however the noted trend that diazepam is more widely available than magnesium
sulphate is similar.

Basic obstetric care includes management of newborns, especially if the newborn is premature, is
asphyxiated during birth, or is at risk of infection. Essential equipment for management of newborns
includes suction apparatus. This equipment was available in 80 percent of PONED puskesmas (but only
in 31 percent of non-PONED puskesmas), with pronounced regional disparities. Although puskesmas in
Papua and West Papua rarely had this equipment (19 percent and 17 percent, respectively), 80 percent of
puskesmas in Gorontalo had it. PONED Puskesmas in general have a neonatal bag and mask44 (70 percent),
but non-PONED puskesmas rarely do (7 percent). Among the five provinces with the highest rates of
maternal mortality, the availability of this equipment ranged from 6 percent (Papua) to 80 percent (West
Sulawesi). The reasons behind the variation in availability of this equipment, even amongst disadvantaged
provinces, should be explored further. Regarding medicines and commodities for newborns, one trace
drug is antibiotic eye ointment, used routinely to prevent eye infections among newborns. Although only
58 percent of PONED puskesmas stocked this drug, there is less variation in its availability. For example,
57 percent of rural puskesmas stocked this drug compared with 52 percent of urban puskesmas.

Infection following childbirth (and abortions) is another main cause of maternal mortality. Basic
infection control measures such as gloves were, however, only available in 67 percent of PONED
puskesmas and only 38 percent of puskesmas in Gorontalo. Injectable antibiotics for infection treatment
were available only in 45 percent of PONED puskesmas. Geographic disparities were even more stark:
only 15 percent of puskesmas in Gorontalo stocked this drug, although it is notable that there were
deficiencies even in provinces such as Bali (18 percent) and West Java (26 percent) where the maternal
mortality rate was lower than the national rates.

4.4 Comprehensive Obstetric Care

Comprehensive obstetric care, which within the WHO SARA framework refers to hospitals and
facilities offering caesarean section, describes key interventions and obstetric complications that
comprehensive obstetric care would need to cover.45 These are all complex procedures that require the
availability of perhaps hundreds of different types of medicines, commodities, and equipment, not to
mention a variety of staffing skills and expertise. Furthermore, compared with basic obstetric care, there
is greater variation in practice, with different providers and facilities choosing a different combination of
inputs (like medicines and equipment) in order to provide equivalent services. Hence, for the purposes of
this analysis and due to data limitations, four aspects are specifically explored: (i) the physical accessibility
of (public) PONEK (CEONC) facilities; (ii) HRH; (iii) the availability of a small subset of key advanced
(generally high-cost) obstetric and neonatal commodities and equipment; and in particular, (iv) blood
transfusion services, which are important services required to support the provision for caesarean sections.
Public hospitals, the location for 11 percent of births nationally (more than double that of puskesmas), are
the focus of data analysis for this section.46

Globally, the lack of timely access to PONEK facilities in the event of pregnancy-related complications
is a key determinant of high levels of maternal mortality. Three types of delays are commonly described:
(i) a delay in the decision to seek care, (ii) a delay in reaching care, and (iii) a delay in receiving adequate
health care.47 The first type of delay, in the decision to seek care, in the context of this supply-side analysis,


45
    These are: Parenteral administration of antibiotics; Parenteral administration of oxytocic drug; Parenteral administration of
anticonvulsants; Assisted vaginal delivery; Manual removal of placenta; Manual removal of retained products; Neonatal resuscitation;
Caesarean section; Blood transfusion; and Comprehensive emergency obstetric care.

Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia
54


     pertains mainly to the quality of ANC and in particular, the training of health workers in explaining the
     warning signs to pregnant women, signs which indicate that medical care should be sought immediately.
     Other determinants of the delay in the decision to seek care (e.g., cultural factors and educational status)
     are also important, but beyond the scope of this paper.

     Regarding the second type of delay, that of reaching care, government policy indicates that the standard
     for the regionalized system of obstetric and neonatal care is that these facilities should be accessible by
     the catchment population within one hour, using the usual transportation method for that area, although
     there is a lack of clarity regarding whether the health facilities referred to are PONED puskesmas or
     public hospitals.48,49 Analysis of the PODES dataset indicates that the median distance from a village
     to a maternity or general hospital is about 20km in Indonesia. Unsurprisingly, distances to hospitals
     in the relatively densely-populated provinces in Java and Bali are much lower than in other provinces:
     in Central and West Kalimantan the median distance to a maternity or general hospital is almost three
     times higher than the national average (Figure 20). As discussed in the early section on Basic Obstetric
     Care Service Readiness, the readiness of puskesmas to provide emergency transportation (Table 10) add a
     further dimension to delays in reaching care, particularly for these disadvantaged provinces.

The third type of delay, that of receiving adequate health care in time, is a function of both service
readiness and provider ability and effort. Key advanced obstetric and neonatal service readiness
indicators are summarized in Table 14 below. Provider ability and effort is not specifically measured in
the Rifaskes census but availability of key staff, training, and the availability of guidelines is measured and
included in Table 14.

Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia
56


     Nationally, half of public hospitals reported having PONEK guidelines available, but only one of
     ten public hospitals in West Papua reported the same. Availability of PONEK guidelines, although
     generally low across all provinces in the country, was especially low in the provinces of North Maluku,
     Riau Island, West Papua, Maluku, and Southeast Sulawesi. There ought to be a relatively easy fix for this:
     a key policy recommendation would be for the Ministry of Health (MOH), Provincial Health Offices
     (PHOs), and District Health Offices (DHOs) to ensure that, at the very least, hospitals have PONEK
     guidelines that can be easily accessed and socialized among hospital staff.

     About 78 percent of all public hospitals in Indonesia had essential HRH for CEONC. In most cases,
     the deficiencies were related to hospitals not having the minimum number of midwives (3) and nurses (2)
     required by the national CEONC guidelines.

About half of all public hospitals in Indonesia reported having access to 24-hour blood transfusion
services, but there are large geographical variations. In almost half of all provinces in Indonesia, less
than two thirds of public hospitals reported having 24-hour blood transfusion services. These were also
the provinces with the lowest proportion of public hospitals reporting a blood transfusion response time of
less than one hour (to deliver crossmatched blood after receiving a sample of the patient’s blood). Overall,
less than a quarter of all public hospitals in Indonesia reported a blood transfusion response time of less
than one hour. (Table 17).

POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND
CONCLUSIONS

     5. Policy Implications and Conclusions

     Despite progress in recent years, Indonesia’s maternal mortality ratio remains high relative to its
     income level and for a country that has universal maternal health coverage. From a health systems
     perspective, some of the challenges in improving maternal health remain with regard to the availability
     and training of HRH, quality of services, and access to emergency care when needed. Universal maternal
     health coverage has, in principle, reduced financial access barriers. Nevertheless, supply-side readiness
     remains a challenge in terms of actualizing benefits of universal maternal health coverage especially in
     provinces with some of the poorest maternal health care utilization indicators and some of the highest
     maternal mortality ratios. Although, on paper, Indonesia has universal maternal health coverage, this
     is far from the reality if one assesses the ability of public health facilities to provide some of the basic
     services related to ANC, basic obstetric care, and comprehensive obstetric care. Using analysis of facility-
     level data—combined with information from the maternal health benefit package of key social insurance
     programs, from national maternal health service guidelines, and the WHO’s SARA framework—this
     paper presents a snapshot of supply-side service readiness for maternal health services in Indonesia.

     One notable result from this analysis is the degree of heterogeneity of MH service utilization and readiness
     inherent within Indonesia. The ‘eastern’ (loosely speaking) part of Indonesia (as typified by provinces
     such as Papua, West Papua, Gorontalo, Maluku, North Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara, and North
     Sulawesi) utilization of MH services is generally much lower and where utilization does occur, the
     public sector is dominant but weak in service readiness. Although these regions, by virtue of low
     population densities, do not contribute the most towards the total counts of maternal deaths in Indonesia,
     the rates of maternal mortality are generally higher than the Indonesian average. In some of these provinces,
     the readiness to provide services is so poor that basic infrastructure like a water supply was only present in
     40 percent of puskesmas in Papua, referral transportation was only available in half of puskesmas in West
     Sulawesi, and referral communications only available in 40 percent of puskesmas in East Nusa Tenggara.
     These deficiencies are likely to result in less effective service provision of MH services and contribute
     towards low utilization levels as patients may not have confidence in using these puskesmas. The higher
     utilization of public hospitals rather than public puskesmas even for primary care services like ANC lends
     further weight to this possibility. The policy implications of this are:




                                                                           Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
                                                                                                                                    61


     Special Focus on Eastern Provinces. In order to improve maternal health outcomes, Indonesia will need
     to focus attention on some of the eastern provinces (such as West Papua, North Maluku, Papua,
     Gorontalo, and West Sulawesi) where utilization of maternal health services in public facilities is
     the highest (though is not necessarily highest in total utilization, inclusive of private providers). The
     MH supply-side readiness of public health facilities, which may be the only providers that some
     communities in these provinces have access to, is weaker than in the rest of the country. As public
     health facilities are automatically into JKN, the existing service readiness of these facilities will have a
     direct impact on the ability to meaningfully provide quality MH services. Although the sparseness of
     the population means that developing health services may be more costly than in other provinces,
     greater improvements in maternal health outcomes are expected since current outcomes are poor.
     The focus on the eastern provinces should also emphasize aspects that would encourage utilization—
     including enhanced cultural and ethno-linguistic sensitivity in attempting to change the utilization
     behaviors of pregnant women, and improvement of facility readiness.



In ‘western’ provinces of Indonesia (as typified by provinces in Java and Bali), utilization of MH
services is already high and the private sector is strongly dominant. Although maternal mortality
rates are generally lower than the Indonesian average, these provinces contribute the majority of maternal
deaths in Indonesia, by virtue of the sheer population numbers living in these areas. Due to limitations
in the data sources used in this analysis, the service readiness of private facilities could not be explored
in detail.50 However, the accreditation process of JKN in theory should encourage private providers to
upgrade their service readiness in order to meet the criteria and prevent private providers that do not have
adequate service readiness from providing services under JKN. Hence,


     Improve Stewardship and Accountability. The MOH should play a stewardship role in facilitating the
     independent accreditation of facilities, rather than focusing purely on service provision, although it is
     accepted that the role of the public sector in providing MH services in areas that may not be attractive
     to private sector providers and in ensuring an adequate network of referral centers remains critical.
     The measuring and monitoring of service availability and readiness should be further integrated as
     a core function of the MOH.


     In addition to accreditation, there are further challenges in accountability considering Indonesia’s
     decentralized context. There remains some confusion about the roles and responsibilities for
     diﬀerent levels of government, especially given the diﬀerent ﬁnancing modalities in the health
     system. If district and provincial governments are to be held accountable for provision of health
     services, a better system of independent monitoring and evaluation needs to be put in place, as well
     as appropriate and eﬀective incentive and provider payment mechanisms to ensure that coverage
     is realized.




50
    It is understood by the authors that the Ministry of Health is currently in the midst of conducting a follow-up assessment to
the Rifaskes, which will include a greater sample of private providers.


Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia
62


     Notwithstanding the variations among regions and provinces, there is a need for improvement
     of overall maternal health service readiness in Indonesia. For example, only 21 percent of PONED
     puskesmas nationally had all the inputs (included in Rifaskes) required to manage and treat postpartum
     hemorrhage, and only 11 percent of PONED puskesmas had all the inputs required to provide neonatal
     care. The ‘effective depth’ of coverage of these services through public puskesmas is hence in doubt. Hence,

        Invest in Service Readiness for Maternal Health. In order for investments in expanding the breadth and
        height of maternal health care to be fully realized, the depth of coverage needs to be addressed: to
        maximize eﬃciency gains from the prevention and prudent management of relevant conditions, and to
        minimize costly and harmful complications. This is vital, not only to ensure the long-term sustainability
        of JKN, but also to improve the health and productivity of Indonesia’s women and children.



     As outlined in this paper, deficiencies in diagnostic capacity, medicines and commodities, and
     specialized equipment are more pronounced than for basic equipment. While the availability of basic
     equipment like stethoscopes and blood pressure apparatus, which are used even for non-MH services, is
     nearly ubiquitous even in rural areas, even basic diagnostics like urine tests are only available in 42 percent
     of PONED puskesmas and injectable antibiotics are only available in 45 percent of PONED puskesmas.
     It is not only consumables that are limited. Specialized equipment (in the sense that they have a specific
     purpose for maternal and newborn health, but not in the sense that they are complex or particularly
     expensive) that is reusable is also in short supply. For example, neonatal bag and masks used to support
     the first few breaths of a newborn child are only available in 70 percent of PONED puskesmas, and a
     Doppler ultrasound, a small hand-held device to accurately listen to the fetal heart rate, is only available
     in 63 percent of PONED puskesmas. Hence,


        Understand Why Supply-Side Deﬁciencies and Misallocations Exist. The analysis of Rifaskes and other
        facility data demonstrate where deﬁciencies in supply-side readiness exist. One key next step is to
        gain a better and more systematic understanding of why these deﬁciencies exist and what can be
        done to overcome them.


        Several explanations are possible including weaknesses in data collection and reporting of service
        readiness; lack of provider ability and provider demand for equipment/commodities; lack of ﬁnancing,
        or ineﬃcient ﬁnancing that is unresponsive to the needs of the facility; lack of provider autonomy,
        or lack of signals as to what inputs are required for providing services; weak procurement/logistics
        systems; or lack of accountability.


        In order to assist with further understanding why supply-side deﬁciencies exist, a proposed Public
        Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) is planned for health facilities in Indonesia, including provincial
        consultations and analytical work related to assessment of public ﬁnancial ﬂows at diﬀerent levels
        of government (central, provincial, district). It is hoped that this analysis will provide further evidence
        for the development of policies related to the eﬃcient allocation of resources—HRH, equipment,
        medicines, etc.—across levels and across provinces.




                                                                             Universal Maternal Health Coverage?
                                                                                                                                 63


There are also specific and worrying gaps in key commodities required to manage the two obstetric
conditions that together account for 55 percent of maternal deaths— hypertensive disorders during
pregnancy, including eclampsia and preeclampsia, and postpartum and antepartum hemorrhage. While
the determinants of these maternal deaths are far more complex than facility service readiness, several
supply-side concerns are highlighted.

Firstly, with regard to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, although blood pressure apparatus
is readily available, urine tests required to detect protein are lacking, even in PONED puskesmas,
which have a special responsibility to identify and manage or refer patients on for these conditions.
Only 42 percent of PONED puskesmas have urine tests available (or 9 percent, according to HFCS
data, which specifically asks for urine protein tests), which are used to diagnose this condition. Even
if this life-threatening hypertensive condition is identified accurately and in time, the treatment of
choice according to national (and international) guidelines—magnesium sulphate (MgSO4)—is only
available in 7 percent of PONED puskesmas (36 percent according to HFCS data, which is still low).
This particular deficiency highlights an additional and interesting concern, which may provide clues to
some of the possible underlying causes. There is an alternative treatment, injectable diazepam, which
used to be the standard treatment for eclampsia (seizures due to a hypertensive condition) until later
clinical evidence demonstrated the superiority of MgSO4. Injectable diazepam, in contrast to MgSO4, is
more widely available, at 69 percent of PONED puskesmas (75 percent according to HFCS data). The
relatively high availability of the comparatively less effective injectable diazepam suggests that there may
be a disconnect in the transmission of information on the latest clinical guidelines to both staff (are they
trained to use the newer drug?) and to procurement systems. With regard to staff knowledge, considering
that only 62 percent of PONED puskesmas are staffed by PONED-trained staff trained within the last
two years, it is unsurprising if the content of the latest clinical guidelines (available in only 77 percent
of PONED puskesmas) has not been internalized. In addition, the fact that there is no large gap in
PONED training between PONED puskesmas (62 percent have staff trained in the last two years) and
non-PONED puskesmas (50 percent have staff trained in the last two years) could reflect the magnitude
of staff rotation, in that PONED-trained staff are allowed to rotate out to non-PONED puskesmas,
instead of concentrating Human Resources for Health (HRH) resources in alignment with the PONED
referral network system.

Secondly, with regard to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the lack of key uterotonic drugs used to
prevent and treat PPH, such as oxytocin and ergometrine, is a worrying concern. These drugs work
by causing the uterus to clamp down tightly so as to reduce bleeding from the lining of the uterus, but
are only available in 67 percent (oxytocin) and 69 percent (ergometrine) of PONED puskesmas and there
are large geographical variations. 51 In provinces where utilization of puskesmas for deliveries is high—for
example, West and East Nusa Tenggara, and North and South Sulawesi—the availability of oxytocin and
ergometrine is modest (ranging from 45 to 61 percent) except for in North Sulawesi, where the availability
is low: only 20 percent for oxytocin and 24 percent for ergometrine. The routine administration of oxytocin
in the active management of the third stage of labor (immediately after the birth of the neonate, before the


51
   HFCS survey data indicate higher availability of oxytocin and ergometrine among PONED puskesmas in aggregate - 86%
and 86% respectively – but sample size is too small for greater geographic granularity. A follow-up assessment is currently in
progress.

     placenta is delivered) is recommended52 in order to stimulate contractions and prevent PPH. The lack of
     this drug indicates that national guidelines cannot even be adhered to on a routine basis. Hence,


          Address Speciﬁc Bottlenecks Preventing the Deployment of Speciﬁc Life-Saving Maternal Health Interventions.
          In order for a shift in facility deliveries to impact maternal mortality rates, the facilities need to be
          able to diagnose, manage, and treat the key causes of maternal deaths. Although service readiness
          indicators provide some inference of where certain problems are, focusing on the minimum basic
          inputs to provide maternal health services is clearly not enough. The mere availability of inputs
          required to manage these conditions does not necessarily mean that providers are able and willing
          to use them in such a way as to improve outcomes. Other dimensions of service delivery, including
          provider ability (knowledge and skills) and eﬀort (working presence at the facility)—which capture
          higher dimensions of provision of care, but are not included in Rifaskes—should also be assessed
          and improved systematically and regularly, especially in light of the major health system reforms
          being implemented in the country. Additional context and recommendations for HRH, which is not
          the speciﬁc focus of this paper, can be found in New Insights into the Provision of Health Services in
          Indonesia: A Health Workforce Study (World Bank, 2010), and this would be an area ripe for further
          exploration and research.



     As mentioned, public hospitals are clearly better equipped than PONED puskesmas, which are little
     better than non-PONED puskesmas. Although it is unsurprising that public hospitals are better equipped
     than public puskesmas, the gap even in Basic Obstetric Care service readiness between public hospitals and
     PONED puskesmas is far greater than the gap in Basic Obstetric Care service readiness between PONED
     puskesmas and non-PONED puskesmas. (Basic Obstetric Care is actually a primary care intervention
     intended for PONED puskesmas, rather than for hospitals, which would provide Comprehensive Obstetric
     Care). For example, with regard to having all the inputs (included in Rifaskes) required to manage and treat
     postpartum hemorrhage, only 1 percent of non-PONED puskesmas fulfilled the criteria, compared with
     21 percent of PONED puskesmas, but 95 percent of public hospitals. Ironically, with regard to having all
     the inputs required to manage and treat preeclampsia and eclampsia, more non-PONED puskesmas (13
     percent) than PONED puskesmas (3 percent) fulfilled the criteria, while 88 percent of public hospitals
     fulfilled the criteria. This suggests that many PONED puskesmas are still not ready to play the role of a
     referral center by receiving referrals from the community and providing basic emergency obstetric and
     neonatal care.

                                                                                                              65


Hence,


   Strengthen the PONED and Referral Systems. The rationale for establishing a network of public primary
   care facilities close to the community (within an hour of travel) that can provide basic emergency
   obstetric and neonatal care and refer onwards more complex cases, remains strong. However,
   further investments in the supply-side and HRH will be required in order for this vision to materialize.
   As resources are limited, careful allocation and distribution of these resources are required in order
   to serve the communities in an eﬃcient and optimal manner. There may be eﬃciency gains made
   by oﬄoading the primary care workload of public hospitals back to primary care facilities, especially
   in the context of a national insurance scheme like JKN, where gatekeeping may be an appropriate
   cost-containment and sustainability strategy. There needs to be more clarity with regard to the role
   of diﬀerent levels of facilities in providing maternal health care services so that resources can be
   allocated accordingly and community expectations managed. Greater socialization of the PONED
   health facility network and referral system will also be helpful.



Finally, in moving forward with the implementation of JKN, two major priorities should be
emphasized:


   Ensure Non-Interruption of Universal Maternal Health Coverage Beneﬁts. Indonesia has had universal
   maternal health coverage since 2011, when the Jampersal program was introduced to provide
   coverage for maternal health care to all those that did not have coverage via other programs. In light
   of the 2014 single-payer reforms, Indonesia will dismantle Jampersal. This will leave a period between
   2014 and 2019 during which those who are not covered under JKN will no longer have access to
   universal maternal health coverage as they did over the period 2011–2013. As JKN will be one of the
   largest health coverage schemes in the world, implemented within an ambitious timescale, it would
   be surprising if there are no implementation problems during the transition period. The central
   government should consider keeping Jampersal active at least until 2019, by which time everyone is
   expected to have coverage under JKN. Other stakeholders, both national and local — such as Program
   Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) Generasi and Program Keluarga Harapan — should also
   be informed of the implementation plans, not least so that they may be able to provide grassroots
   support to guide communities and individuals in the allocation of PNPM Generasi resources.




Assessing the Readiness of Public Health Facilities to Provide Maternal Health Care in Indonesia
66


     And finally,


        Clarify Supply-Side Implications of the Beneﬁt Package. As the analysis reported in this policy
        note indicates: it is not enough to specify a beneﬁt package on paper. In moving forward to
        implementing UHC, Indonesia needs to ensure that there are clear supply-side standards that are
        derived from the speciﬁcation of the uniﬁed JKN beneﬁt package, in terms of what equipment,
        training, diagnostic capabilities, and medicines are to be provided at diﬀerent levels of care
        and to clearly specify the accountability structure for this provision. In this regard, BPJS may
        want to reconsider its plans for automatic accreditation of public facilities and to consider an
        independent accreditation process for public facilities in the future as the program develops.
        In addition, JKN should specify whether or not lower-level public facilities (such as polindes and
        poskesdes1 ) are eligible for reimbursement under the program, and to clearly specify the supply-side
        implications for them. In addition, MOH policy with regard to PONED and non-PONED puskesmas
        needs to be clariﬁed.

     In conclusion, the analysis reported in this policy paper underscores that in order to realize universal
     maternal health coverage and improve maternal health outcomes, there needs to be a focus not just
     on increasing the breadth and height but also on ensuring that effective depth of coverage exists,
     especially in the eastern parts of the country and at the primary care level (PONED puskesmas). It is not
     enough to specify a comprehensive maternal health benefit package on paper if facilities do not have the
     basic supply-side readiness conditions to be able to provide key maternal health services such as ANC,
     basic obstetric care, and comprehensive obstetric care. In addition to identifying where and along what
     dimensions the key maternal health supply-side deficiencies exist, it is also important to better understand
     why this is the case.
