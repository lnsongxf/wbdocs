Background
In August of 2015, The International Youth Foundation (IYF) engaged in work sponsored by the
World Bank to build the life skills training capacity of key stakeholders from Lebanon’s civil
society and government sectors under the World Bank supported National Volunteer Service
Program (NVSP). The NVSP is a four-year project that seeks to increase youth civic engagement
and improve social cohesion across communities and regions by: (i) expanding youth
volunteerism among 15-24 year olds, particularly in communities other than their own; and (ii)
improving the employability of youth through enhanced soft skills.

Within this context, IYF designed and implemented a series of life skills training of trainers
(TOT) sessions for MOSA staff (which includes those social workers in charge of administering
the volunteering summer camps), the NVSP Program Independent Unit (PIU) and selected staff
and trainers from participating NGOs utilizing its proven Passport to Success® life skills
program.

Prior to the implementation of the TOTs, IYF staff worked closely with work with the WB, NVSP
PIU, and selected MOSA staff to establish a protocol for the successful and effective integration
of the PTS program into the WB supported NVSP program.

Subsequently, and at this, stage IYF is providing coaching and mentorship to newly trained
trainers as they deliver the life skills training to 1000 youth participating in the program’s
community engagement and service learning projects. This training is intended to target an
additional 1000 students per year for the next three years.

The following report summarizes the activities of the four TOT sessions that took place in
August 2014 and includes training objectives, activities, discussions, statistics, evaluation results
and other relevant information. Detailed reports of the results of individual TOTs as well as the
assessment of each individual were provided (In Arabic) to the WB and NVSP staff.
Training of Trainers (TOT)s
Within the context of this program the IYF / PTS team implemented 4 TOTs in Beirut with as
follows:

      Two concurrent TOTs, 17-20 August, 2015 for 42 participants from 22 NGOs. (See list of
       NGOs in Annex I)
      Two concurrent TOTs, 24-27 August, 2015 for 6 NVSP team participants and 26
       participants from MOSA staff.

TOT Objectives and Agenda
The Objectives of each TOT were to:

      Equip the new trainers to deliver PTS lessons to youth utilizing the PTS experiential
       training methodology.
      Create a safe and enjoyable workshop environment where learning can take place.
      Allow trainers to learn/relearn skills, strategies and techniques needed for the effective
       delivery of a life skills and employability development program.
      Allow trainers to examine and experience the program’s components and materials.
      Provide trainers with opportunity to explore the steps for successful implementation of
       the Passport to Success program

Two IYF Master Trainers (MTs) facilitated each of the TOT workshops. During the workshop,
training participants learned about the PTS program, its goals, program units and lesson topics,
how to use the lessons, the trainer’s role, teaching skills, and strategies for implementing the
program in a variety of settings and for participants with different educational backgrounds and
skill levels. Training participants also had the opportunity to see life skills lessons modeled by
IYF MTs, and subsequently planned and delivered a sample lesson with a small group of peers
in a practicum setting and received feedback on the delivery of their training approach. The
training workshops were extremely “hands-on” and allowed the participants to experience and
practice the training techniques and teaching methodologies employed by this program.

The agenda of the TOT can be found in Annex II.
Summary of TOTs
After each TOT, IYF MTs developed a detailed report and individual trainer assessments (in
Arabic) that were shared with the WB and NVSP that detailed the main success stories,
challenges, and recommendations from the perspective of the MTs. It also included an
attendance sheet with detailed trainer assessments providing a starting point towards the
certification process that was detailed to the participants in the training. The following is a
consolidation of the 4 TOT reports.

Summary of Results
IYF utilized two methodologies to evaluate the TOTs:

   a) Trainer Evaluation: an evaluation from the perspective of IYF MTs through a general
       summary report as well as individual assessment of the performance of each
       participant. These were shared with the NVSP and WB.
   b) Participant Evaluation: an evaluation from the perspective of the participants/trainees
       through engaging them in two surveys:
           o A post-TOT assessment that measured their perception of the different TOT
               components which was filled by 76 participants.
           o A pre/post self-assessment survey that measured their perception of the change
               in their training skills as a result of the TOTs which was filled by 67 participants.

Trainer Evaluation
IYF MTs positively evaluated with the training capabilities and attitude of the participating
trainees. The MTs observed that:

      The participants were very motivated and highly engaged especially when they got
       introduced to the experiential aspects of the workshops activities such as the practicum
       lessons.
      Several trainers were identified as highly skilled and capable of employing the program
       effectively. This bodes well to the future of the implementation. Only 6 out of the 42
       participants were recommended not to continue to train youth due to low assessments
       in their evaluations.
      There was a high level of commitment from the participants to commit to the extensive
       training agenda despite the fact that some of them traveled long distances to attend the
       training.

Moreover, we were encouraged that certain trainer groups initiated ad-hoc support groups
using social media. For example, a WhatsApp group was initiated by one of the trainers to
facilitate communication among the trainees and IYF MTs. This innovation contributed
positively to sharing of PTS experiences and allowed better coordination and planning of the
subsequent youth trainings.

Trainer/Participant Evaluation
Additionally, the positive findings of our MTs were supported by the comprehensive evaluation
conducted at the end of the fourth day in which the participants evaluated their experience of
TOT and which indicates very strong overall satisfaction with the program. The table below
summarizes the opinions of the 76 attendees.

           with Today’s Youth



Further supporting the above, and in terms of the perceptions of the training skills acquired,
the analysis of the pre/post self-assessment indicates that trainees/participants overall
perceived that their training skills have improved by an average of 20% (aggregate score). In
particular, trainers exhibited:

      23.6 % improvement in their assessment of their ability to prepare lessons/lesson plans.
      16.1% improvement in their assessment of their ability to prepare a youth friendly
       training space.
      23.6% improvement in their assessment of their ability to utilize interactive training
       methodologies.
      20.9% improvement in their assessment of their ability to customize content based on
       the youth audience.
       19.1% improvement in their assessment of their ability to involve all participants in the
        training.

From IYF’s perspective, this is very positive signal when coupled with the overall evaluation of
our MTs that the majority of the trainers were already experienced and strong.

Summary of Challenges
In any extensive engagement when four TOTs were implemented in a short timeframe, it is
expected that a series of challenges could arise. Based on the observation of IYF MTs, the
following were the main challenges encountered in the TOTs:

   There were no selection criteria for the participants / trainers from the NGOs. This was due
    to the short timeframe from planning to implementation. Few trainers were young and
    some had no training experience. This factor affected the flow of some of the program
    components because extra attention was needed to be given to those trainees.
   Most of the trainees arrived daily from outside of Beirut. That caused some delays in the
    agenda of the training. Moreover, some of them had to also leave earlier. This also resulted
    in some of the trainees missing on some components of the program.
   As in any training, some of the participants were more difficult to manage and
    unintentionally engaged in activities and discussions outside the scope of the trainings. This
    also hindered the flow of the already extensive agenda.

Despite the above, and consistent with the positive results, IYF MTs felt that these challenges
were limited and did not severely diminish the quality of training. In the next section we will
propose some of actions that can be taken to mitigate such challenges.

Summary of Recommendations
Based on the above, IYF recommends the following in order to improve the quality and delivery
of any future TOTs as well as the training of youth following:

       Allow ample time for a more deliberate selection process for the trainers / participants.
        This will reflect positively on the TOT and the subsequent training of youth.
      Ensure all requirements in terms of objective of the program, time commitment, and
       logistics at the TOTs as well as later time commitments in terms of training the youth
       are communicated to the participants before the training. This will ensure the flow of
       the training process.
      Follow-up with trainees who will go on to implement the training with youth to ensure
       they receive proper coaching and supervision.


Conclusion
Overall, and despite the condensed timeframe allotted for their preparations, the TOTs were
implemented without any major issues. We thank the WB staff and the NVSP staff for their
continuous follow-up and cooperation as we engaged to implement this ambitious project.
Following the TOTs, IYF has been engaged with the staff from NVSP to arrange coaching visits
and follow-up trainings to ensure the training of youth is being run effectively.
