Mozambique is poised to meet the MDG goal of 100 percent primary education enrollment.
The achievement will have limited impact if the quality of the education that pupils have access
to is lacking. Education quality will critically determine whether the promise of the newfound mineral
wealth is shared among all Mozambicans and whether the economic growth will be concentrated in
the extractive industries, while innovation, education and training remain underdeveloped.

Annex. Definition of the Education Service Delivery Indicators
School absence rate
Share of a maximum of ten randomly selected teachers absent from school during an unannounced visit.

Classroom absence rate
Share of teachers who are present in the classroom during scheduled teaching hours as observed during an unannounced visit. Teachers may be found
teaching outside, and these are marked as present for the purposes of the indicator.

Time spent teaching per day (also known as Time on Task)
Amount of time a teacher spends teaching during a school day. This indicator combines data from the Staff Roster Module (used to measure absence
rate), the Classroom Observation Module, and reported teaching hours. While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and non-
teaching activities. Teaching is defined very broadly, including actively interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil’s work, asking questions,
testing, using the blackboard or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling or memorization.

Minimum knowledge among teachers
This indicator measures teacher’s knowledge and is based on mathematics and language tests covering the primary curriculum administered to all
mathematics or language teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or grade four in the year the survey was conducted. It is calculated as
the percentage of teachers who score more than 80 percent on the language and mathematics portion of the test. Test score: This indicator measures
teacher’s knowledge and it is calculated as the overall score of a mathematics, language, and pedagogy tests covering the primary curriculum
administered at the school level to all mathematics and language teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or grade four in the year the
survey was conducted.

Infrastructure availability
Unweighted average of the proportion of schools with the following available: functioning electricity and sanitation.
Specifically: (i) functioning toilets operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii) sufficient light to read the blackboard from the back of
the classroom.

Teaching Equipment availability
Unweighted average of the proportion of schools with the following available: functioning blackboard with chalk, pencils, and notebooks. Specifically:
(i) functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils with pens is equal to or above 90 percent, and (iii) the share of pupils with notebooks in that
classroom is equal to or above 90 percent.

Share of pupils with textbooks
Number of mathematics and language books used in a randomly selected grade four classroom divided by the number of pupils present in the classroom.

Pupil- teacher ratio
Average number of grade four pupils per grade four teacher.
The indicator of teachers’ availability is measured as the number of pupils per teacher in one randomly selected grade four class at the school based on
the classroom observation module.

     About the SDI surveys
     The SDI survey was conducted between March and June, 2014. The fieldwork involved collecting information
     from 200 primary schools, 1006 teachers, and 1,731 grade four pupils. The results provide a representative
     snapshot of the quality of service delivery and the physical environment within which services are delivered in
     public primary schools. The survey provides information on three dimensions of service delivery: measures of (i)
     teacher effort; (ii) teacher knowledge and ability; and (iii) the availability of key inputs, such as textbooks, basic
     teaching equipment and infrastructure (such as availability of sanitation, quality of lighting in classrooms, etc.).
     Mozambique is the seventh country where SDI surveys have been implemented, the other being: Tanzania,
     Senegal, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Togo. This allows for comparison across countries and benchmarking
     country performance.

     The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Program
     The SDI initiative is a partnership of the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),
     and the African Development Bank to develop and institutionalize the collection of a set of indicators that
     would gauge the quality of service delivery within and across countries and over time. The ultimate goal is
     to sharply increase accountability for service delivery across Africa, by offering important advocacy tools for
     citizens, governments, and donors alike; to work toward the end goal of achieving rapid improvements in the
     responsiveness and effectiveness of service delivery.

     found at: www.SDIndicators.org and www.worldbank.org/SDI, or by contacting SDI@worldbank.org.
