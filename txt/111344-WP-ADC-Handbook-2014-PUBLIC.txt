     Introduction
     The ambition to reach full global financial inclusion requires that we address
     the challenge of delivering appropriate and affordable financial services
     to an estimated 2.5 billion unbanked individuals globally. One response to
     this challenge has involved the design of products such as microloans, low
     balance savings accounts, micro-insurance, and mobile money transfer that
     are specifically tailored to meet the needs of the often excluded low-income
     mass market. Delivering these products and services on a large scale, however,
     cannot be achieved without accessible channels that lower the cost of service
     and increase reach.
     Alternative delivery channels, defined as those    result in poorly planned and implemented
     channels that expand the reach of services         ADC projects. The net result is a patchy

     CHAPTER 1
     Basic concepts and terminology
     ADC implementations by FSPs employ many delivery approaches and
     use different terminologies, such as ‘e-banking’ and ‘branchless banking’.
     These variations in approaches and terminology are in part contributing to
     some of the confusion in the financial services sector about channels and
     technology. Hence, this chapter aims to ensure that all readers have a common
     understanding of the terms used in this handbook, and to introduce some of
     the basic concepts that will be referenced as we progress through the details
     of strategy, technology, selection, and implementation.

      	 Given that FSPs are the target audience of this handbook, we will focus primarily on channels which are
        used to connect customers to bank accounts held at a FSP, as opposed to other financial products such
        as e-wallets and money transfer offered by non-bank financial services providers. An overlap clearly exists
        wherein FSPs may opt to use these non-bank services as one of their channels, such as when banks are
        linked to e-wallets services for cash in/out and payment purposes.

        Services involves equipping FSP staff with technology solutions.

     Building a channel strategy
     Our journey to implementing an ADC solution starts with the formulation of a
     plan or channel strategy. This channel strategy is a critical component of the
     overall organizational strategy, and as such must be guided by the business’
     vision, mission, and strategy, as well as market conditions.

                                           The decision to pursue a specific channel or channels must take into consideration many
                                           internal and external factors. These factors are summarized in Figure 6, which shows
                                           how the channel strategy is influenced by both the internal and external environments
                                           within which a FSP operates. The channel strategy therefore involves an assessment of
                                           each of these factors separately and collectively, as outlined in this graphic.

03_MAPPING STRATEGY TO A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM




FROM A TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE
For those readers interested in the more technical details, this section discusses the
applications and different devices which could be components of an ADC platform.




Applications
Apart from ATM and Internet banking channels, which have standard software, all
other ADCs operate on a variety of customisable software applications. Each of these
applications has certain advantages and disadvantages, as outlined in Table 3. Smart
and non-smart native apps have been combined as the major difference between the
two is in the choice of device and not the application functionality. While SMS has
mostly been talked about as a communication option, we include it in the analysis of
potential applications to show how it can still provide some limited functionality as
an application.

Integration
Given that most ADC solutions require integration of different systems and that this integration can
often pose problems during implementation, we wanted to focus on the topic in more detail. We
introduced the types of integration in Chapter 3 as either batch or real time, but now want to dive
into more detail of the real time integration options, explaining at a high level the protocols that
exist, how each of them works and their pros and cons. Table 9 provides an overview of how systems
integration can be achieved either via bespoke protocols specifically designed to exchange certain
types of data, such as ISO8583, or through more generic formats which we roughly class as APIs.

Conclusions and lessons
learned
This final chapter provides some of the observations or lessons learned with
regards to ADC projects so that FSPs benefit from the experiences of others
who have travelled ahead of them in this area. These are compiled from the
authors’ experiences across multiple projects, several continents, and from a
range of different types of FSPs. The intention is only to share some insights
based on institutional knowledge gained from past ADC projects rather
than dictate ADC strategies or projects, and these lessons must be applied
carefully to the context of the FSP embarking on ADC projects.

TERM                     DEFINITION
3rd Generation Mobile    Third generation of mobile telephony (cellular) technology. 3G telecommunication networks support services that
Network (3G)             provide an information transfer rate of at least 200 kbit/s and a maximum of 3.1Mbps.

4th Generation Mobile    Fourth generation of mobile telephony technology, succeeding 3G and preceding 5G. As opposed to earlier
Network (4G)             generations, a 4G system does not support traditional circuit-switched telephony service, but all-Internet Protocol-
                         based communication such as IP telephony, and provides higher download speeds relative to 3G.

Agent                    A person or business contracted to process transactions for users. The most important of these are cash in and cash
                         out (that is, loading value into the mobile money system, and then converting it back out again); in many instances,
                         agents register new customers too. Agents usually earn commissions for performing these services. They also often
                         provide front-line customer service, such as teaching new users how to complete transactions on their phone.
                         Typically, agents will conduct other kinds of business in addition to mobile money. Agents will sometimes be limited
                         by regulation, but small-scale traders, microfinance institutions, chain stores, and bank branches serve as agents in
                         some markets. Some industry participants prefer the terms ‘merchant’ or ‘retailer’ to avoid certain legal connotations
                         of the term ‘agent’ as it is used in other industries. (GSMA, 2014).

Agent banking            Banking services, often limited, carried out by an agent.

Aggregator               Servicer provider with existing integrations to a number of MNOs and/or PSPs to facilitate billing, technical, and
                         operational relationships and interfacing across operators via one link to the aggregator, as opposed to separate
                         integrations with each provider.

Alternative Delivery     Channels that expand the reach of financial services beyond the traditional branch. These include ATMs, Internet
Channels (ADCs)          banking, mobile banking, e-wallets and extension services.

Android                  A Linux-based mobile operating system originally developed by Android and currently developed by Google. With
                         a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such
                         as smartphones and tablet computers.

 Automated Teller              An electronic telecommunications device that enables the customers of a financial institution to perform financial
 Machine (ATM)                 transactions without the need for a human cashier, clerk, or bank teller. ATMs identify customers via either a magnetic
                               or chip-based card, with authentication occurring after the customer inputs a PIN number. Most ATMs are connected
                               to interbank networks to enable customers to access machines that do not directly belong to their bank, although
                               some closed-loop systems also exist. ATMs are connected to a host or ATM controller using a modem, leased line or
                               ADSL.

 Basic phone                   The most basic type of mobile handset available on the market. This phone has no data or GPRS capabilities and for
                               MFS is only compatible with USSD and STK applications.

 Branchless banking            The delivery of financial services outside of conventional bank branches through the use of retail agents and ICT. For
                               the purpose of this handbook we have considered this term to be equal to ADC and e-banking.

 Call center                   A centralized office used for the purpose of receiving or transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. In
                               this context, as well as handling customer complaints and queries, it is also used as an alternative delivery channel to
                               improve outreach and attract new customers via various promotional campaigns.

 Card Management               The system used by businesses to manage the full administration and support associated with payment cards. A CMS
 System (CMS)                  will typically provide functionality to manage card product definition, application processes, production, and issuing,
                               blocking, and managing transactions along with the card balances, if required. A CMS will be required for any FSP
                               that wants to use either POS or ATMs with cards as the means of customer authentication.

 Channel                       The customer’s access point to a FSP, namely who or what the customer interacts with to access a financial service
                               or product.

 Core Banking System           The core system used by a FSP to manage all of its key business processes, including front- and back-office
 (CBS)                         components. Most CBSs provide CRM functionality, loan portfolio tracking, accounting, and reporting. For the
                               purpose of this handbook we have used the term synonymously with Management Information System.

 Core Implementation           A group of staff from the FSP charged with making the day-to-day decisions regarding the ADC project
 Group (CIG)                   implementation. This group will be involved in training, requirements analysis, and testing of the systems and typically
                               form a group of ‘super users’ or champions of the system.

 Electronic banking            The provision of banking products and services through electronic delivery channels.
 (e-banking)
 Enabling technology           For the purpose of this handbook we refer to the enabling technology as the underlying technology platform used
                               to drive an ADC. It includes the hardware devices, software systems, and the technological processes that enable the
                               provision of financial products and services over ADCs.

 Europay, MasterCard,          EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, a global standard for the inter-operation of integrated circuit cards
 and Visa (EMV)                (IC cards or ‘chip cards’) and IC card-capable POS terminals and ATMs, for authenticating credit and debit card
                               transactions (Wikipedia, 2014).

 E-wallets/e-money             Short for ‘electronic money’, it is stored value held in virtual wallets or cards. Typically, the total value of e-money is
                               mirrored in bank account(s), so that even if the provider of the e-wallet service were to fail, users could recover 100
                               percent of the value stored in their accounts. Bank deposits can earn interest, while e-money cannot.

Extensible Markup       A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable
Language (XML)          and machine-readable. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet.
                        It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of
                        XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in Web
                        services.

Extension services      Field-based banking services often performed by FSP staff. This includes remote data capture, mini branches and
                        branch on wheels.

Feature phone           A mobile handset that is more advanced than a basic handset by the fact that it contains embedded data transfer/
                        GPS capabilities. A feature phone can be used to connect to the Internet or to run mobile applications dependent
                        on data connectivity. Unlike smartphones, feature phones have no in built security and limited peripherals and
                        applications.

96 ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY CHANNELS AND TECHNOLOGY
Offline                   Offline means not connected to the Internet or network connection. Some programs or applications are configured
                          to operate offline or have the option to work offline when the connection is lost so that data entry is not interrupted,
                          meaning the software continues to function on the device and stores data locally. However, no data can be
                          transmitted to or from the device on which it is operating until a connection is established. Offline data can be
                          synchronized with an online or central database when connectivity is re-established or the device is tethered to
                          transfer data.

One Time Passwords        A security protocol that works on the basis of one factor of authentication being generated only when needed,

                          facilitate the transaction. The hardware used may vary.

Premium Rate Service      An intermediary provider, licensed by the MNOs and usually the government, to offer bulk SMS, USSD, and short
Provider (PRSP)           code services. The regulation governing these businesses will vary from country to country, with some places
                          allowing for only a direct relationship with the MNOs for these services. Where regulations for PRSP exist, a FSP will
                          need to contract with these parties in order to access bulk SMS and/or USSD channels, although these services will
                          still require a tripartite agreement between the FSP, MNO, and PRSP. For this handbook we have considered a PRSP
                          as the same as an Aggregator.

Request for Proposal      A solicitation made by a company to initiate a bidding process to procure a commodity, service, or valuable asset

                          the communications authority, MNO or, where applicable, the PRSP.

Short Message Peer-to-    An open telecommunications industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communication interface
Peer (SMPP)               for the transfer of short message data. It is used to process bulk SMS messaging.

 Supplementary Service          channel is supported by all GSM handsets, enabling an interactive session consisting of a two-way exchange of
 Data (USSD)                    messages based on a defined application menu.

 User Acceptance Testing        The testing process that occurs at the end of a software development process whereby the actual software users test
 (UAT)                          the software to make sure it can handle the required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications. In this
                                context, the ADC system would be tested to confirm it meets the agreed specifications and requirements of the FSP.

 Virtual Private Network        A private data network that makes use of the public telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy through
 (VPN)                          the use of a tunnelling protocol and security procedures. It enables a computer to send and receive data across
                                shared or public networks as if it is directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality,
                                security, and management policies of the private network.

 Web API                        A set of HTTP request messages that have defined structured response messages. These messages can be written in

                                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and runs in a Web browser relying on the browser to render the application. Web apps
                                function very much as a standard Internet website using a URL, but the size and features are designed to display and
                                interact better on a mobile device than on a traditional website.

 Wi-Fi                          Local area wireless technology that allows an electronic device to exchange data or connect to the Internet using
                                radio waves.
