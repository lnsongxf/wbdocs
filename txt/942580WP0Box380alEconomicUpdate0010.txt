Foreword
T    his report is the first in a new series aimed at monitoring economic developments in Senegal and analyzing key policy options.
     It presents a broad overview of macroeconomic and structural developments in the country over the course of 2013 and 2014.
The second part provides a historical analysis of economic growth since 1990 in order to draw lessons for the future. The third
part focuses on the emerging challenge of climate change. The authors are Matthias Cinyabuguma, Senior Economist, and Philip
English, Lead Economist. The authors received valuable support from Djibril Ndoye, Poverty Economist, and Isabelle Kane, Disaster
Risk Management Specialist.

              We hope this report will stimulate debate within Senegal on the appropriate mix of policies needed to improve living
              standards and reduce poverty. Comments on the content of this report are welcome.

Summary
• GDP growth was a disappointing 3.5 percent in 2013. It remained largely unchanged compared to 2012, reflecting a decline in cereal
  production and stagnation in the industrial sector. Services continue to drive the economy.

• The total value of exports stagnated in 2013, as four of the five major export products suffered declines—phosphoric acid, gold,
  cement and fish. Tourism, which remains the largest foreign exchange earner, also struggled.

• Budget execution remained in line with the fiscal framework, with a decline of the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of GDP. However,
  poor revenue performance necessitated cuts in public spending.

• The economic outlook for 2014 was more positive, but poor rainfall and the Ebola outbreak have forced downward revisions in GDP
  growth projections, now expected to reach 4.5 percent.

• Fiscal consolidation continued in 2014 with a reduction in the budget deficit from 5.5 percent in 2013 to 5.2 percent in 2014. However,
  the wage bill, particularly benefits, became increasingly important, and the 2014 and 2015 Budgets did not always appear to fully
  reflect the priorities announced by the government.

• A longer-term analysis of the economy underlines the loss of dynamism since 2005, partly due to external shocks but also inefficient
  investment and a lack of reforms.

• The Plan Senegal Emergent aims to break with this trend, with a welcome focus on higher economic growth. However, its ambitions
  may exceed available resources and will likely depend on accelerated reforms and a strong private sector response.

• Climate change poses new challenges for the economy. Coastal erosion is already affecting the tourism industry, and rising sea levels
  pose a significant medium-term threat, particularly for Saint-Louis.

Introduction
    T   his first Economic Update begins with an overview of the macroeconomic situation in Senegal, starting with a review
        of 2013 before examining the initial results of 2014. After a brief look at the challenges posed by unemployment
    and poverty, the report turns to an assessment of the growth strategy. Since the growth targets of this strategy are
    very ambitious when compared with Senegal’s economic track record, we then turn to an analysis of past performance
    since 1990 in order to understand better what needs to be done differently. We conclude this first section with a few
    recommendations.

    The second part of this report focuses on the new challenges posed by climate change. It begins with some observa-
    tions drawn from the 2011 poverty survey to underline the vulnerability of the poor to environmental shocks. We then
    turn to an innovative study recently supported by the World Bank on the impact of rising sea levels and coastal erosion
    in Senegal, and the policy choices to be made. Particular emphasis is placed on the implications for the tourism sector,
    correctly identified in the government’s growth strategy as a key driver of economic growth and job creation. Finally, a
    few recommendations are made for adaptive strategies and additional studies.

Current situation and
recent trends in Senegal
    A     new government is formed to implement a new strategy. President Macky Sall launched a new growth strategy,
          the Plan Sénégal Emergent (PSE), at a Consultative Group meeting in Paris in February 2014, first to the traditional
    donors and then to private investors. The response was very positive, with donor financing pledges and private sector
    participation both greatly exceeding targets. However, it also further raised the expectations of the population. With
    implementation of his program remaining too slow for the President, a new government was formed on July 7 with
    clear instructions to accelerate the pace.



    Economic developments
    Economic growth remained disappointing in 2013. Real GDP growth for 2013 was 3.5 percent, not much different
    from 2012 (3.4 percent), and lower than the projected level of 4.0 percent. The services sector led the economy increas-
    ing by 6.4 percent. The slow rate of growth was attributable to decreases in both the secondary sector (–1.5 percent)
    and in crop production (–8.3 percent).1

revenues, after these corrections it is clearly above 40 per-

Time for a new growth strategy
    S    enegal has stabilized in a low growth pattern and is struggling to move to higher, more sustainable and
         inclusive growth. GDP growth has averaged 3.3 percent per annum over the years 2006–2013, which is not much
    above the rate of population growth of 2.6 percent. It is therefore not surprising that, between 2006 and 2011, the
    poverty rate fell by only 1.6 percentage points, from 48.3 percent to 46.7 percent, which is not a statistically significant
    decline. This contrasts with the ten-year post devaluation period of 1995–2005 when the economy benefited from the
    one-off improvement in competitiveness due to the exchange rate adjustment, followed by a brief period of reform.
    GDP growth during that period averaged 4.5 percent per annum and poverty dropped significantly from 68 percent
    to 48.3 percent. While the international context has become more difficult since 2008, many other African countries
    have prospered. Whereas Senegal was growing faster than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa during 1995–2005, it has
    fallen below the average in the more recent period (Figure 18). It is now the poorest performer in the WAEMU group of
    countries, with the exceptions of politically-troubled Guinea Bissau and Mali.

Climate change adaptation in Senegal
    C    limate is a factor affecting the daily lives of all Senegalese people. The country’s location—adjacent to the
         Atlantic Ocean and the semi-arid land of the Sahel subject to sea-level-rise and increasing land degradation due
    to a combination of anthropogenic and climate factors—is subject to climate change induced effects. Droughts result
    in reduced harvests, lower revenues for the rural poor and higher food prices for urban consumers, as well as diverting
    foreign exchange toward food imports. Damage imposed on the country’s beaches by rising sea levels and associated
    coastal erosion hurts the tourist industry. Beach erosion and particularly changing ocean temperatures could have a
    dramatic effect on the fishing sector. Thus policy makers need to understand better and assess in more detail the
    economic impacts of climate change for the different sectors and geographical zones in Senegal to adopt appropriate
    mitigating measures.

    We begin with a general examination of the relationship between the environment and poverty. Two conclusions
    emerge. First, the majority of the population is aware of the negative impact of environmental shocks on their lives,
    suggesting that there may be an existing reservoir of public support for various climate change adaptation measures.
    Second, the negative impacts fall most heavily on the poorest, suggesting that adaptation measures must be a priority
    in a country where nearly half of the population lives in poverty.

    We then turn to a recent World Bank-financed study: “Economic and Spatial Study of the Vulnerability and
    Adaptation to Climate Change of Coastal Areas in Senegal.” Led by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
    Development with support from the World Bank, this study was undertaken from 2011–2012. A first of its kind in Sen-
    egal, the study assessed three pilot sites under a number of scenarios up to 2080, predicted the costs of damage if no
    action will be taken and developed a cost-benefit analysis model for soft (policy) and hard (infrastructure) adaptation
    options. The study examined a number of climate-induced risks related to rising sea levels (mainly coastal erosion,
    coastal flooding, submersion, water shortages and groundwater salinization) and the interaction of those risks with
    other natural risks, for example, river flooding and run-off floods for the entire coast and for three pilot sites (Rufisque/
    Bargny, Saly and Saint-Louis). The damages expected from climate change induced hazards were compared with the
    costs of adaptation measures. Extrapolation from the economic analysis carried out for the three sites yielded esti-
    mates for the economic costs for the entire coast.

    The implications for the tourism sector are then explored in more detail. This is one of the key sectors generating
    jobs outside of Dakar and one which has substantial growth potential if managed properly. Unfortunately, it is suffering
    from significant coastal erosion in the main tourism site of Saly-Portudal.

protection measures which remove the threat in one area but
aggravate the erosion further down the coast. 25 percent of the
coast of Senegal is today at high risk for coastal erosion which
is estimated to increase to 75 percent by 2080 if sea levels con-

Data about climate change impact on the tourism sector is
scarce. Although the loss of beach area is clearly visible to long-
time residents and returning tourists, only rudimentary and local-
ized data concerning the rate of loss of beach areas is available.
Tourism-related data is often kept confidential and not shared
easily for evaluation purposes. There seems to be no regular
publicly available surveys on visitors regarding their satisfaction
and reaction to the situation. While the relative importance of
beach erosion in the decline in tourism cannot be determined,
actors in the industry are clear that it is a contributing factor.
