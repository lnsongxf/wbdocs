CENTRAL ASIA EARTHQUAKE RISK REDUCTION
FORUM OVERVIEW

Central Asia is a region vulnerable to many natural
hazards, of which earthquakes are one of the most
catastrophic ones. Historically, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
have been devastated by a number of earthquakes that
caused huge economic and human losses. In 1948,
Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and the nearby areas were
shattered by a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. The city saw
extreme ground shaking, which caused most of it to be
destroyed, leaving around 110,000 people dead. About
a year later, the 1949 Khait earthquake occurred in Ta-
jikistan, triggering massive landslides throughout the
area and causing an estimated 12,000 deaths. A magni-
tude 6.4 earthquake occurred in Andijan, Uzbekistan,
in 1902, destroying over 40,000 houses and claim-
ing more than 4,500 lives. In Kazakhstan, the city of
Almaty experienced many earthquakes, including the
earthquake of 1911, which killed over 450 people. In
the past 25 years, Kyrgyz Republic has seen numerous
earthquakes with magnitudes above 6.0, one of which
happened in 1992 and destroyed over 8,200 dwellings
and killed an estimated 54 people.

Online Poll
An online poll of all the participants was conducted to see what would be the one
thing that they would like to see as an outcome of the Forum. Some of the re-
sponses and desired outcomes included a regional collaborative project on disas-

the Forum, a regional platform that would show the past and ongoing DRR pro-

I appreciate very much the opportunity you gave me to
address you at today’s important forum organized by
the World Bank.
Learning from years of experience confronting nat-
ural disasters, Government of Japan has been closely
collaborating with the World Bank in mainstreaming
“disaster risk management”, DRM, in development
policies and practices. The collaboration was further
strengthened, particularly after the Great East Japan
Earthquake happened in 2011.
In 2014, Japan and the World Bank jointly announced
a program called “Japan – World Bank Program on
Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in Devel-
oping Countries”. DRM Hub Tokyo was established in
the World Bank Tokyo office, as operational arm of the
program.                                                   with Kazakhstan by the medium of JICA in the field of

Conclusions
(1) In the wake of the recent Nepal earthquake, all emergency management agencies agree that
drills and preparedness are critical when it comes to disasters. In addition, channels for internation-
al support and humanitarian assistance should be prepared and ready in case of a large event.
(2) Risk information is currently used to create risk profiles for the areas in order to prepare the ad-
equate measures for population protection; however, up-to-date risk information is needed to reflect
the current risk and be prepared for more representative disaster scenarios.
(3) Regional earthquake management activities should be strengthened in order to make better
use of the newly created Regional Center for Disaster Response and Risk Reduction to achieve
more efficient response and preparedness.
(4) Central Asian countries have improved their capacities for preparedness and response in the
recent years. However, the risk of a large earthquake event in the region is high, and therefore con-
tinued improvement in the capacity of the countries is imperative.

Conclusions
(1) Before conducting any seismic risk assessment, we need to understand what its purpose is.
What will be the difference between our assessment and the previous ones? How do we effectively
use the results of the risk assessment? Risk assessments are the most valuable when we use them
in decision making.

(2) Earthquake risk assessment must encompass all three aspects: hazard, exposure, and vulnera-
bility.

(3) Risk assessments should consider existing local and regional knowledge and experience in the
field. The importance of collaboration with local agencies should be noted, as they will be the user
of the final product.

Conclusions
(1) It is important for us to convene and develop a plan of actions for unifying seismic zones, be-
cause these risks have no boundaries between countries. Today each country has their own hazard
assessment and zoning methodology which poses a challenge when working at a trans-boundary
level.
(2) The hazard maps need to be updated every 10 years. During this period the countries need to
update their knowledge and skills. Each country has its own specifics and if any country decides
to choose a different approach, then it would make the task more difficult. This is a challenge that
needs to be addressed by the countries. Discussions were held with the directors and seismic spe-
cialists in hope to initiate a project that will produce a common map for the region.
(3) The current risk information used in Central Asia is primarily based on hazard assessment only.
Therefore, capacity building in exposure and vulnerability information has been identified as a key
area for development in order to ensure complete understanding of risk.
(4) It was identified that the base information at the foundation of many of the assessment was cre-
ated during the Soviet period and should be updated.

Conclusions
(1) The successful risk reduction programs in Bangladesh, Japan and Turkey demonstrated that in
order to have an effective risk reduction program, a clear understanding of risk is needed. The risk
information allows prioritization of risk reduction activities in light of constrained financing and it
helps to convince high level decision-makers of investments.
(2) A well designed program based on clear prioritization criteria has shown that international finan-
cial institutions are more willing to invest in the risk reduction program. Such programs provide a
clear direction for steps to be taken in the implementation of the measures.
(3) The governments of Bangladesh, Japan and Turkey learned the significance of investing in large
risk reduction programs only after a disaster already happened in their countries. Central Asian
countries have a chance to be proactive and not wait until catastrophe happens to start investing
in earthquake risk reduction. These investments should be included in the countries’ development
programs.

Conclusions
(1) Central Asian countries have started some programs to reduce earthquake risk in schools,
hospitals and public buildings. However, there has not been a systematic approach to investing in
comprehensive programs covering all sectors at risk.

(2) Building codes are mostly based on old hazard maps and require integration of new hazard in-
formation and update to reflect modern seismic resistant design and construction techniques.

(3) There is a need for improved methods and control mechanisms in construction quality as well
as building code enforcement.

ness should be strengthened.

DUSHANBE, REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
In Dushanbe a lot of repairing and construction works
are ongoing, where 70-80% are done through external
investments. The main challenges the city faces are the
lack of coordination and overlapping of the projects.
At times, when international projects propose and
use their own methodology, local experts do not have
the capacity to use and accept those methodologies.
Therefore, in the future closer collaboration should
be established that will build on the existing work and
take advantage of the local expertise.




Conclusions
(1) The main challenges that urban centers in Central Asia face are outdated norms and regulations
for construction, lack of hazard information and assessment of the condition of public infrastruc-
ture, private residences being built without compliance with seismic code and lack of coordination
in some DRM works.
(2) These challenges can be overcome by conducting hazard and risk assessments for municipal-
ities, while working closely with the stakeholders and addressing their needs. Conducting public
awareness campaigns can help raise awareness among individuals about the importance of seis-
mic resistant construction.
(3) Knowledge and experience sharing should be done on a regional level and with countries who
have previously conducted urban resilience projects, such as Turkey.

REDUCING FISCAL VULNERABILITY
SESSION OBJECTIVES: to give an overview of ways to finance contingent liabilities due to natu-
ral disasters and see what Central Asian countries are doing to financially prepare their countries
for natural disaster

Presented and Moderated by
  Mr. Hector Ibarra Pando, Lead Financial Officer, World Bank
Round-table Participants:

FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST DISASTERS
Disasters can have substantial and varied finan-
cial impacts on countries. For example, the recent
2015 Nepal Earthquake had an estimated total
economic impact of US$7 billion, which is rough-
ly a third of the county’s economy. In order to help
reduce their fiscal vulnerability to natural haz-
ards and improve the financial response capacity,
countries should engage in ex-ante financial plan-
ning. This will help ensure reduced cost of capital,
rapid mobilization of funds and greater discipline
in post-disaster spending and clarification of
ownership of risk. There are different financial
tools that are available for different purposes, with
some of them shown in the figure.
It is also important that the funds are mobilized according to the time of needs and can be accessed efficient-
ly when a disaster strikes. Some examples of financial protection measures around the world include Mexico’s
national fund for disasters that promotes financial discipline and minimized budget disruption, Turkish catastro-
phe insurance pool that increases insurance uptake, and the Marshall Islands’ disaster assistance emergency fund
and sovereign insurance which allows access to external financial capacity. It should also be noted that financial
protection is one of the essential components of disaster risk management.

Conclusions
(1) The majority of the Central Asian countries have been responding to large disasters through re-
serve funds, budget reallocations and international financial support.
(2) Currently the Central Asian countries rely on post disaster financial mechanisms to finance the
negative consequences of catastrophes. Therefore, a need to develop a better understanding of the
contingency liabilities was identified in order to explore ex-ante financial mechanisms and create a
more efficient risk financing strategy.
 (3) Some countries in Central Asia have started to develop catastrophe insurance mechanisms,
such as the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Nevertheless, these insurance markets
are at the beginning stage and countries have identified the need for capacity building in this area.

EARTHQUAKE HAZARD OVERVIEW OF CENTRAL
ASIAN COUNTRIES

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
The Republic of Kazakhstan is the world’s largest land-locked country that is made up of 15 regions, or
oblasts, and two independent cities, Almaty and Astana. As of 2015, the population of the Republic of Ka-
zakhstan is 17.4 million with an increasing annual trend of 1.4% over the past 6 years. The majority of the
population are urban dwellers, with 57% of the population living in cities1. The southeastern part of Kazakh-
stan lies in a seismically active zone at the foothills of Zailysky-Alatau mountains, a sub-range of Tien-Shan.
The earth’s crust movement in this area is thought to be due to the collision of India and Eurasia plates2.
Almaty is Kazakhstan’s most populous city with 1.6 million people, which account for 9% of the county’s pop-
ulation. Almaty was the former capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan, until it was moved to the city of Astana
in 1997. Today, it is an urban center of Kazakhstan, with a large financial center housing one of the biggest
bank in Central Asia and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.
Over the last century, the most significant historical earthquakes in the Republic of Kazakhstan occurred
in the vicinity of the city of Almaty. In 1887 and 1889, two earthquakes known as Verny (M7.3) and Chilik
(M8.3) struck the city of Almaty. Shaking of IX-X and VII-VIII were felt, respectively3. In 1911, a magnitude
M7.8 earthquake, known as the Kebin or Chon-Kemin earthquake, occurred on the territory of Kazakhstan.
The earthquake killed more than 450 people and destroyed over 770 brick buildings in Almaty4. In May 2003,
a M5.4 earthquake occurred in Zhambyl Region, which affected 43,300 people and caused great devastation
to housing and social infrastructure5. Furthermore, on 1 December 2003, a Mw 6.0 earthquake occurred on
the Kazakhstan-Xinjiang Border. Most of the damage and fatalities occurred in China, however, strong shak-
ing was also felt in the southeastern part of Kazakhstan6.

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
Kyrgyz Republic, is a land locked country located in a mountainous region of Tien-Shan mountains, an active
seismic zone. Due to the mountainous landscape and a combination of soil and water-level conditions, many
sites throughout Kyrgyzstan are also prone to landslides. Kyrgyz Republic is comprised of 7 regions, or oblasts,
and 2 administratively independent cities, Osh and the capital city of Bishkek. Regions are further subdivides
into districts with local governments. The population of Kyrgyzstan is 5.8 million (2014) with an increasing
trend, where 36% of people are living in urban areas1.
Kyrgyz Republic is classified as one of the most seismically dangerous territory in Eurasia with over 300 earth-
quakes registered annually2. According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, about 3.3 million people or 66%
of the population live in houses highly vulnerable to strong earthquakes. Over the period of 1988-2007 the larg-
est number of deaths caused by natural disasters was from landslides (238) and earthquakes (58). Earthquakes,
however, are the hazard that caused highest economic losses (US $163 million) and affected the largest number
of people on the territory of Kyrgyzstan3. On a long-term scale, earthquakes are the greatest hazard to the popu-
lation of Kyrgyz Republic. The area that can experience ground shaking of intensity IX (MSK-scale) comprises of
about 20% of the territory of Kyrgyzstan, and around 79% can be subject to VIII point intensity4.
In the last 25 years, Kyrgyz Republic experienced a number of damaging earthquakes. A M6.6 earthquake
occurred on 15 May 1992, causing 4 fatalities and an estimated economic loss of US$31 million5. Three months
later, on 19 August 1992, a M7.3 earthquake hit near the village of Toluk. It killed an estimated 54 people, 14
of which were killed by a triggered landslide, and destroyed more than 8,200 dwellings6,7. In January 1997, the
Naryn region was shaken by a M7 earthquake, around 200km south of Bishkek8. The region saw damage to more
than 400 houses and an estimated US $2 million worth of damage9. More recently, on 5 October 2008, a M6.7
earthquake happened in south Kyrgyzstan, near the intersection of the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and
China. The earthquake severely damaged village of Nura and killed 75 people10. In July 2011, a M6.1 earthquake
occurred near the intersection of the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Although most of the
casualties occurred in Uzbekistan, the earthquake was felt in Bishkek and Jalal-Abad and caused power outages
in Batken11

REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN

The Republic of Tajikistan is comprised of 4 regions and one independent city: Sughd and Khatlon regions,
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomout Republic (GBAO), Region of Republican Subordination, and the city of
Dushanbe. Each of the regions is further subdivided into districts (58 total), which are in turn divided into
jamoats (570). In total there are 17 cities in the republic, with capital city of Dushanbe. The total population
of Tajikistan is 8.2 million (2014) with only 26.6% of the population living in urban areas. Around 9.5% of the
population resides in Dushanbe1.
Tajikistan is subject to many natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, mudflows, avalanches, floods,
drought, heavy snowfalls and others. High seismicity in the country is caused by the northward-moving In-
dian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate. According to the Global Seismic Hazard Map, Tajikistan is locat-
ed in a high-hazard area, where most of the country exhibits intensities of VIII–IX for a hazard level of 5%
exceedance in 50 years2. As seen from seismic events in the 20th century, the damage and fatalities are often
caused by secondary effects such as landslides, rockslides, mudflows and avalanches.
In the 20th century there was a number of damaging earthquakes that occurred on the territory of Tajikistan3:
  • 1907 Karatag earthquake, M7.3, intensity at epicenter IX (MSK scale)
  • 1911 Sarez earthquake,Ms7.4, triggered a massive landslide which destroyed the Usoy village with all its
  residents and blocked the Murghab River, thereby creating the Sarez Lake 4
  • 1943 Faizabad earthquake, M6.0, intensity at epicenter VIII-IX (MSK scale)
  • 1949 Khait earthquake, M7.5, intensity at epicenter IX-X (MSK scale), triggered a series of landslides
  which buried the town of Khait with an estimated death toll of 12,000 people5
Since the 2000’s, there were several damaging earthquake events in Tajikistan. Some of these earthquakes
occurred in Khatlon region (2006) Vanj district (2010), and Rasht Valley (2012) . The latest significant Mw7.2
earthquake occurred on December 7, 2015, in the Murghob district of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous
Oblast (GBAO). Losses consisted of 2 fatalities caused by landslides, 10 injuries, complete or partial destruc-
tion of 660 houses and 15 schools and kindergartens, damages to several health centers and a small hydroelec-
tric power station, and loss of livestock 6. Estimates suggest that 4,000 people have been displaced and over
124,000 were affected by the earthquake.

TURKMENISTAN

Turkmenistan is comprised of 5 provinces and one capital city district. The majority of the country is covered
by the Karakum Desert. On the west side, the country is bordered by the Caspian Sea, and in the southwest
the Kopet-Dag mountain range stretches along the Iranian border. The capital city, Ashgabat, is located in the
foothills of the Kopet-Dag. As of 2014, the population of Turkmenistan was 5.3 million, with 50% of people
living in urban areas1.
Due to its geographical features, the country is prone to mudflows, cyclones, tornadoes, sand storms, flood-
ing, and earthquakes. Since most of the country is located in a seismically active zone, earthquakes are the
dominant natural hazard of Turkmenistan, followed by flood2. Earthquakes amount to an average annual loss
of $72 million, where as floods have a loss of $7 million3.
The most significant earthquake in Turkmenistan happened on October 6th, 1948. During this event, Ashga-
bat and the nearby area were devastated by a magnitude M7.3 earthquake, which occurred 25 km south-east
of the capital. The city saw intensities up to X (MSK scale), which caused most of the city to be destroyed4.
Almost all brick buildings in the city collapsed and concrete structures saw a high level of damage5. The death
toll was classified during the USSR; it was later revealed to be around 110,0006. Other large earthquakes that
affected Turkmenistan in the 20th century include 1929 Kopet Dag earthquake, 1946 Kazandzhik earthquake,
and 1983 Kum-Dag earthquake. In December 2000, a magnitude M7.0 earthquake occurred in Balkan region
near Balkanabad, which caused several deaths and multiple injuries 7,8

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

The Republic of Uzbekistan is located in a basin between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers and is surrounded
by Gissar-Alay and Tien-Shan mountain ranges in the east. The country is comprised of 12 provinces and auton-
omous Republic of Karakalpakstan. Uzbekistan is a country with a long history of seismic activity, particularly
in the northeast Tashkent Region and the Bukhara Region in the southwest of the country. Certain areas of the
republic are expected to see earthquakes of intensity IX or greater (MSK scale)1.
As of 2014, the population of Uzbekistan was 30.5 million, with the population trend steadily increasing by an
average of 1.5% per year over the last 15 years2. Uzbekistan’s urban dwellers account for 36% of the population,
with the majority of people living in rural areas.
Particular attention should be paid to Uzbek capital Tashkent, since it is the most populous city in the country
and is situated in a seismically active zone. The city is located in the west part of the Tien- Shan mountain range,
where ground shaking intensities can reach up to VII-IX (MSK scale) causing widespread damage and fatalities3.
In 2014, Tashkent population was 2.4 million, which accounts for 8% of the county’s population4. The capital city
is also home to Uzbekistan’s key educational, industrial, political and cultural facilities.
Due to Uzbekistan’s mountainous landscape and an abundance of rivers, the population living in the mountain-
ous areas are also exposed to a high risk of landslides and mudflows. Although landslides and mudflows can
be triggered by various factors, they are often seen as a consequence of earthquakes and must be considered in
seismic risk management.
Soil conditions play a large role in ground motion amplification, where soft soils have an amplification effect
and saturated soils can become prone to liquefaction. Uzbek seismic code identifies 10 soil types for its territory,
which are classified into 3 categories that have different seismic characteristics. In particular, Tashkent is known
to have areas of unfavorable soils that increase the seismic hazard of the area.
In the last century, five notable events occurred in the region, causing widespread damage and casualties. An
earthquake of magnitude 6.4 (Ms) occurred in Andijan in 1902, destroying over 40,000 houses and claiming
more than 4,500 lives5. In 1966, Tashkent was hit by a magnitude 5.0 earthquake. Various numbers are disputed
with regards to the death toll and damage incurred during this earthquake; however, the USGS reports that the
earthquake killed 10 people and destroyed 27,000 of the city’s buildings, leaving more than 10% of the popula-
tion homeless6. In the southwest part of the country two large earthquake occurred in 1976 and 1984 next to the
desert town of Gazli, which caused sizable economic losses.
