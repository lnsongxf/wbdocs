 Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture         The index is based on five factors that are considered indicative of women’s overall empowerment in the
 Index (WEAI) (IFPRI, USAID)                agricultural sector: decisions over agricultural production; power over productive resources such as land
                                            and livestock; decisions over income; leadership in the community; and time use. Women are considered
                                            empowered if they score adequately in at least four of the five components. Data on individual men and
                                            women in the same household are used to calculate a women’s empowerment index and a gender parity
                                            index. (See IFPRI 2012; http://www.ifpri.org/book-9075/ourwork/program/weai-resource-center.)

Intervention Area                    Possible Policy Options
1.	 Clarify land rights and          •• Reform land-use planning and land tenure policies to increase community ownership over resources and
    responsibilities, especially        create greater security of access to and use of natural resources.

                                        and legal standing of common interest groups that include and empower both men and women.
3.	 Overcome institutional           •• Conduct a thorough review of current landscape and restoration programs and policies to identify social/

     Table 18.4 Objectives and Information Needs for Three Types of Analyses Pertinent to Designing Gender-Responsive
                 CSA Projects
     Type of Analysis           Goals, Elements, Guidance
     1.	 Gender-responsive      a.	 Identify and assess the gender-mainstreaming capacity of the key organizations that may be involved in the project,
         stakeholder analysis       which could represent the interests of men and women from different socioeconomic groups. Consider partnering
                                    with a women’s organization to ensure that women’s knowledge of climate and agriculture is incorporated into the
                                    project, and also to secure women’s participation in decision making about CSA practices. Identify men’s and
                                    women’s specific needs for adopting CSA practices.
                                b.	 Describe how information is shared between organizations and determine whether these channels will be sufficient
                                    for facilitating the work of the project. Identify who has access to the information available to the target
                                    community.
                                c.	 Pay attention to who participates (include young people and households headed by women as well as men) and
                                    who has a say in decision making, because it will affect who benefits from project activities. Highlight
                                    men’s and women’s potential roles in the project, because this will help to clarify how women’s participation will be
                                    guaranteed.
     2.	 Gender-responsive      a.	 Identify the specific risks associated with the impacts of climate change in the context of the project, identifying which
         problem analysis           risks are considered most serious by men and women, respectively. Discuss possibilities for reducing GHGs and any
                                    negative impacts on women. On the basis of the roles and responsibilities of men and women in different groups,
                                    identify who bears the risks of both climate-related impacts as well as climate change related activities. Identify the
                                    opportunities for reducing risks and whose livelihood activities are involved.
                                    Document men’s and women’s roles in relation to food security, including roles in producing and processing food
                                b.	 
                                    and in managing agricultural activities. Document the strategies used by men, women, and youths to cope with food
                                    insecurity, especially in relation to the climate risks identified in the analysis.
                                c.	 Describe which resources are present for coping with climate risks and which resources are needed. Investigate
                                    whether there are differences in access to or control over these resources and practices for men and women
                                    and how those differences may affect proposed solutions.
     3.	 General gender         a.	 Document what men and women do—their income-generating activities as well as their caregiving and household
         analysis                   management work. An understanding of men’s and women’s division of labor and time use will be crucial for
                                    evaluating how CSA practices may change what people do and how they spend their time, which is crucial for ensuring
                                    that no single group of participants is overburdened.
                                b.	 Describe what men and women know—which can include information on men’s and women’s relative literacy
                                    levels and the specific knowledge they call upon in times of climatic or food stress (such as opting to produce different
                                    varieties or species of crops and animals, or changing their food preservation and storage practices).
                                c.	 Verify men’s and women’s capacity gaps that will need to be filled for successful CSA.

Table 18.5 Checklist for Setting Up a Monitoring and Evaluation System at the Formulation Phase
Define clear, gender-responsive objectives in relation to CSA for the overall project and for each component. Defining objectives for
gender in CSA supports the design of a set of indicators to track results that will be included in the M&E guidelines/manual.
Develop a results chain for the project that includes gender-responsive indicators for CSA along the results chain (see “Examples of
Gender-Responsive Indicators,” later in this note).a
Collect baseline data for outcome indicators related to gender in CSA, and set performance targets for gender-responsive indicators.
Identify specific evaluations and other M&E tools to assess progress on gender in CSA and the quality of implementation for gender-
responsive activities.
Ensure that a distinct budget is allocated for gender-responsive activities (for example, funds for gender expertise, gender analysis, gender
training of staff).
Mainstream gender in the M&E guidelines, implementation manual, and other relevant documents used to implement the CSA project.
The mainstreaming of gender in the M&E guidelines includes the following:
•• Developing a results chain for the project, which includes gender-responsive indicators for CSA.
•• Identifying the specific evaluations or the component(s) of larger evaluations or studies to be conducted in the course of the project that can
   inform on progress in gender in CSA.
•• Identifying the information flow/feedback and responsibilities for reporting on progress.
•• Identifying project staff and staff from implementing agencies that will report, analyze, assess, and use sex-disaggregated data in CSA for decision
   making.
•• Developing reporting formats for project staff and implementing agencies that specifically require information on gender in CSA.
Ensure that the project staffing and project capacity development plan reflects M&E, gender, and CSA needs.b Effective M&E for
gender in CSA relies on a strong collaboration between project gender specialists, M&E officers, and other project staff and implementing agencies.
Ensure that the terms of reference for the project staffing and project capacity development plan include gender and CSA issues.
Budget for the overall M&E system, including any capacity development needed to capture gender-related data in CSA.

Table 18.6  Checklist for Monitoring and Evaluation at the Implementation Phase
Ensure that men, women, boys, and girls affected by the project receive information on planned activities and can express
themselves (have voice and agency) during implementation. Be aware of power relations between men and women within the household
and how they may affect participation or the acceptance of changes in the agricultural activities people perform.
Ensure gender-responsive CSA activities are included in quarterly and annual plans, monitored, and reported. In this way, gender
in CSA activities will be identified in the project’s plans; otherwise little progress will materialize in CSA outputs and outcome for men and women
farmers. When planning, ensure that the target for the number of beneficiaries of a CSA activity is disaggregated by sex.
Monitor progress of gender in CSA through quarterly and annual plans and reports. Quarterly and annual reports will also include
outputs and outcome results based on an agreed format that is informed by the understanding and mainstreaming of gender in CSA.
Conduct data auditing and supportive supervision to ensure the quality of the data reported at all levels of the project and build
the capacity of staff involved in M&E. These actions will improve the quality, reliability, and regularity of data collection.
Ensure that implementing agencies are committed to reporting on gender in CSA by supporting continuous sensitizing (including
training and refresher training) on gender and M&E in the context of CSA. Develop mechanisms to hold M&E implementing agencies
accountable.
Integrate gender in the supervision of CSA projects. If needed, provide further technical assistance on gender, CSA, and M&E. Include gender
in reviews of progress, issues, and recommendations. Provide technical assistance in gender and/or M&E based on the issues identified through
supervision.

     Table 18.8 Indicator Index Card: Example of a Tailored Indicator for Gender in CSA for a Research Component
                 of an Agricultural Productivity Project
     Indicator:             Number of Gender-Responsive CSA Technologies Developed by Research
     Definition             Technologies developed are defined as technologies that have successfully been validated and tested by research and are ready
                            to be promoted via extension services. The technologies developed include both new and improved technologies. Only
                            technologies financed/supported by the project funds are accounted for.
                            CSA technologies are defined (in this specific project context) as technologies that contribute to an increase in agricultural
                            productivity and technologies that contribute to the efficient and sustainable use of land and water resources.
                            Gender-responsive technologies are defined as: (i) technologies based on needs and interest of female farmers; (ii) technologies
                            that reduce time and labor for women farmers; (iii) and technologies that are accessible and affordable by women farmers.
                            Technologies reducing women’s farm labor and the time that female farmers need to perform household duties could enable
                            them to devote more time to productive farm activities (Definition from the World Bank Project “Ethiopia: Agricultural Growth
                            Project II Gender Working Group”).
                            Technologies will be disaggregated by major type: (i) agricultural productivity; (ii) land management; and (iii) water management.
     Justification          This indicator allows for the tracking of the number of CSA technologies developed that are gender responsive. If a CSA
                            technology that is developed is gender responsive, it is assumed that it will contribute to an increase in the adoption of CSA
                            technologies by women farmers. Depending on the project context/results chain, this indicator can be used in the results
