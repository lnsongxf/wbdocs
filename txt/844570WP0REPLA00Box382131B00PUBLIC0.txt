          SAFETY NETS IN AFRICA
                              Experiences from 22 Countries

The World Bank Africa Social Protection Strategy for 2012–22 highlights the need for a
strong evidence base to inform the design and implementation of social protection programs
in Africa (World Bank 2012a). Hence, since 2009, the World Bank has conducted compre-
hensive social safety net assessments in 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings of
these assessments and other studies of safety net programs were recently synthesized into a
regional review. This review provides an assessment of the current status of safety net pro-
grams in Africa and presents lessons on how they can be strengthened to better tackle poverty
and vulnerability.

      BOX 1: Definition of Terms
      Safety nets refer to noncontributory transfer programs targeted in some way to the poor or vulnerable (Grosh et al. 2008).
      Safety nets aim to increase households’ consumption—either directly or through substitution effects—of basic commod-
      ities and essential services. Safety nets are targeted to the poor and vulnerable—that is, individuals living in poverty
      and unable to meet their own basic needs or in danger of falling into poverty, because of either an external shock or
      socioeconomic circumstances, such as age, illness, or disability. Social safety nets form a subset of broader social protec-
      tion programs along with social insurance and social legislation. Hence, social protection includes both contributory and
      noncontributory programs, whereas safety nets are noncontributory.

  BOX 2: Can Cash Transfers Boost Household Productivity in Africa?
  Most safety net programs focus on reducing current levels of poverty. However, they may also have the potential to in-
  crease productivity and reduce poverty in the long term. Public works are considered productive even in the short term
  because, besides transferring income to disadvantaged households, they help create small community investments. Cash
  transfer programs (often conditional) can help poor families invest in the human capital of their children, for instance,
  through more regular school attendance. However, some groups of the very poor and destitute may not be able to par-
  ticipate productively in society and may use income support to purchase food and other necessities (the protective role
  of safety nets). Improving consumption could, however, be considered productive in itself; for instance, better nutritional
  intake helps children develop and improve their future prospects. Old-age support to grandparents in Kenya and South
  Africa is used to support the schooling of their grandchildren.
  Helping households become more productive is an increasingly important aspect of safety nets in Africa. This potential
  remains to be fully exploited, but some findings from impact evaluations and other research in a number of African coun-
  tries show promising results. Initial findings of this work show that even a small amount of regular income support—even
  without any conditions—can help households diversify livelihoods and increase their consumption of “goods” (such as
  investment in assets, human capital, and small enterprise development) and move away from “bads,” or negative coping
  strategies (such as reducing exploitive or risky employment and asset sales in times of distress). As such, safety nets can
  allow households to invest in higher-productivity, higher-return activities. Also, cash transfers were shown to boost the
  local economy through multiplier effects because beneficiaries spend transfers in the local market.

           The Safety Net Experience in 22 African Countries
           Safety nets have evolved differently across Africa      and efficient safety net systems. Safety nets are also
           in response to the specific political economy and       being placed higher on government agendas. The

BOX 3: Examples of African Safety Net Programs
Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) was launched in 2005 to transform the historic food aid-based system
into a more predictable safety net that produces productive assets in poor communities. The PSNP provides cash and food
transfers to food-insecure households through labor-intensive public works for households with able-bodied members
(80 percent) and direct transfers to households that are unable to fulfill a work requirement (20 percent). Estimated annual
transfers per household are equivalent to about 40 percent of their annual food needs. The PSNP reaches more than 7
million people, or about 10 percent of the population, and implements about 34,000 small works projects per year. The
PSNP’s public works have rehabilitated over 167,000 hectares of land and 275,000 kilometers of stone and soil bund em-
bankments and have planted almost 900 million seedlings, all of which will help to mitigate the effects of future droughts.
Rigorous evaluations of this program have confirmed that it has made significant transfers to the poor in times of need.

Ghana’s Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) Program is a social cash transfer program that provides
cash and health insurance to extremely poor households across Ghana to alleviate short-term poverty and encourage
long-term human capital development. Eligibility is based on poverty and having a household member in at least one
of three demographic categories: a single parent with an orphan or vulnerable child, an elderly poor person, or a person
with an extreme disability who is unable to work. LEAP started in a trial phase in March 2008 and, as of June 2013, 71,000
households are enrolled. Beneficiaries receive bimonthly cash transfers of between US$4 and $8 per month. An impact
evaluation is currently ongoing. The objective is to scale up LEAP to 1 million households over the next three years.

Kenya’s Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC) was initiated in response to concerns about the
wellbeing of orphans and vulnerable children, particularly AIDS orphans. The objectives of the program are to encourage
the fostering and family retention of children and to promote their human capital development. Eligible households,
which are those who are poor and contain an OVC, receive a flat monthly transfer of US$21. The program reached 150,000
households, including 495,000 OVC across the country as of June 2012, about 24 percent of the estimated number of
households with OVCs. Impact evaluations have found significantly higher expenditures on food and health services
among beneficiary households. The impact of the program on schooling is concentrated on the secondary level, where
enrollment was increased by 9 percentage points and children from beneficiary households were less likely be behind a
grade and more likely to progress to the next grade.

Rwanda’s Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) combines public works (50 percent), cash transfers (20 percent), and
microfinance loans (30 percent) to targeted poor households in the poorest sub-districts. Managed by the Ministry of
Local Government, the public works encompass land productivity and irrigation, mainly terracing, ditches, small dams
and forestry, as well as construction of roads, school classrooms, and health centers. Wages are set at the district level and
vary by project type but with a guideline that they should be less than or equal to the market rate for similar work. As of
2009, wages averaged about US$1.50 per day. As of FY2010/2011, the government spent about 0.7 percent of the national
budget on VUP public works and employed 522,856 people, half of whom were women. This is equivalent to about 5
percent of the national population. VUP public works were found to have reduced extreme poverty in the areas covered
by the program.

South Africa’s Social Grants is the largest cash transfer program in Sub-Saharan Africa. It includes several types of means-
tested grants targeted to the older people, poor families with children, foster families, people with disabilities, and war
veterans. Roughly 15 million people receive a social grant, or about 30 percent of the national population. The child sup-
port grant (CSG) reaches about 10 million people, while the old age grant, which applies to poor people over 60 years of
age, reaches about 2 million people. According to household survey data, social grants make up over 60 percent of the
income of the poorest 20 percent of recipient households, with child grants being the largest contributor. Children who
were enrolled in the CSG at birth completed significantly more grades of schooling and achieved higher scores on a math
test than children who were enrolled at the age of six. These effects were particularly significant for girls. Enrollment in
the CSG reduced the likelihood of illness among children by 9 percentage points. The main effects on adolescents were
reduced sexual activity and teen pregnancies and less drug and alcohol use.

  Safety nets should be built on the basis of strong
operational tools to ensure effective program im-
plementation and monitoring and establishment of
institutional and coordinating bodies in charge of
organization and planning. Basic operational tools,
such as beneficiary registries, targeting methods,
payment systems, and monitoring and evaluation
systems, provide a platform that enables programs
to deliver support effectively to targeted groups.
More work is needed to understand how exist-
ing food-based programs and their infrastructure
should play a part in new and improved safety net
systems in Africa.
  These systems need to be built during stable
times so that they are ready and can respond
quickly to crisis. Establishing such systems takes

  More accurate targeting of African safety net
