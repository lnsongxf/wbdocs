1          Introduction

1.1        About this document
This document contains data collection instruments to support data collection, for which the
resulting data will inform diagnostic and decision-making tools for Fecal Sludge Management
(FSM) services. The diagnostic and decision-making tools shown are those developed in a
World Bank global FSM study (2016) that are further described in (i) a Summary Report of the
FSM study (ii) Tools and Guidelines for improving fecal sludge management (FSM) services.

This document accompanies the above documents the World Bank global FSM study. It can
essentially be used as a stand-alone guide for the purpose of data collection in other studies,
but adaptations will be required to account for local circumstances.

To distinguish between the diagnostic tools and the data collection instruments:

   the tools are a quantitative and qualitative means of displaying data to support problem
    diagnosis and decision-making;
   the data collection instruments consist of the data collection formats (such as the
    household survey questionnaire) and their associated protocols (which are an instruction
    manual and methodology), which provide an input to the tools.
This document sets out the instruments mainly as they were used in the five cities of this study.
Both can and should be adapted to the objectives of whoever is using them, and the specificities
of the city concerned.

2.1                  Overview
A variety of data collection instruments can be used to inform the diagnostic tools developed
under the World Bank global FSM study. The various data collection instruments used for the
purposes of the global study and the research methods associated with them are summarized
in the table below. In addition, the table shows the cities where these instruments were used
under the global study, and the diagnostic tool or analysis which each instrument eventually
informs.

There are six main instruments, four quantitative and two qualitative. However, the reality of
using them is more complicated, as many are interrelated. For example, it makes sense to
strongly link data collection on observations and fecal sludge characteristics (2 and 4 in the
table), since they will both require working alongside FSM service providers.

However, they will also involve entering households, and therefore touch on the domain of the
household survey. The household sampling should be random, whereas sampling for

                                                                                                       2

observations/characteristics will necessarily be purposive and driven by the service providers’
availability schedules. This is discussed in more detail below, but serves to demonstrate the
level of planning that needs to go into finalising any fieldwork model. The likely outcome is that
households where service providers are observed may not end up being part of the main
household survey sample.

A related point to that made above is that service providers are identified as key informants to
be interviewed, but the cooperation of service providers is also required to carry out
observations of the sanitation chain and testing of characteristics. In practice, service
providers employ many individuals. For example, in the case of a company operating
desludging trucks, there would be a key informant interview with the manager, but discussions
with his/her colleagues (i.e. the truck operatives) for the observation.

In terms of sampling, the research design should be adapted to each city context, but the
broad overview is shown in Table 3 below as a guide. Sampling was designed so as to allow
conclusions to be drawn about the city-wide situation, as well as the specific context of slums /
informal settlements / low-income areas.

Together, this information comprises a data collection protocol. Such protocols are provided
per instrument in the next Section. Some cross-cutting considerations on ethics and data
management are briefly discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.


2.2        Ethical considerations
The main ethical considerations related to all data collection protocols are:

Informed voluntary participation: Informed written or oral consent must be obtained from
participants before data collection is conducted. Team members and participants are to be
informed about the purpose, methods, risks, benefits and intended possible uses of the results
of the study.

Right to refuse or withdraw: The participants must be informed that they are free to withdraw
from the study at any point, or may refuse to answer any questions. They will also have the right
to ask questions at any point before, during or after the study is completed.

Confidentiality and privacy: No personal identifiers should be used in any form of reporting or
dissemination. Personal identifications will be linked with a unique identifier (e.g. id code) and
kept securely. No information should be published that could identify the respondents. Paper
copies of collected data will be stored for three years in a secure location; only the study team
should be able to access them. While confidentiality cannot always be guaranteed (especially
where data is collected in a group, or public setting), participants are requested not to disclose
details of what was discussed.

Risks and benefits: The risk of participation is considered minimal as there will be no collecting
of sensitive information or biological samples. The respondents will not be directly benefited by
participating, however the information that they will provide inform policy makers to improve the
overall water, sanitation and hygiene condition of their country and they may eventually have
an indirect benefit from that.

Payment: There should be no compensation payment to the participants and nor will they have
to pay to participate in the study. Interview and focus groups should be held close to the homes
of the participants to avoid any transport costs.


2.3        Data management considerations
Tight data collection and quality control must be followed up by sound data management. The
process in any given city will depend on the firms or consultants contracted and their usual
practice, but there are certain practices which should be followed when paper data collection
formats are used. If digital data collection is used, separate guidance will be necessary.

Starting with qualitative data, the consultants will have clear Terms of Reference specifying how
they should record their findings and write them up into transcripts and reports as appropriate.
This will vary by city – the essential thing is that all stakeholders are clear on what is to be
provided in what format before work begins, and that it is in the TOR.

Next considering quantitative data, any data collection firm must have an identified Data
Manager, to supervise Data Entry Operators and Data Editors (assuming paper data collection
is used). Their roles and responsibilities are as follows:



                                                                                                4

for the project. Each data entry operator will be able to enter about 30-40 household
questionnaires per day. Once the data is double-entered, both versions of the datasets will be
checked for consistencies. The data editors will manually check the hardcopy questionnaires
for any inconsistencies between them. In addition, whoever is doing the data analysis should
check internal inconsistencies, outliers, missing data and other data quality issues.

3           Data collection protocol: components for each
            instrument

objective, (ii) methodology, (iii) sampling, (iv) fieldwork. The associated formats themselves
are in the Annexes.

3.1         Household survey

       3.1.1       Introduction and objective

A quantitative household survey enables researchers to ask questions of many households
consistently and with the same answering format. Questions can invite answers which are
categories, binary yes/no, and continuous numerical variables, amongst other things. The
household survey proposed here aims to provide information about household perspectives
on the FSM market, emptying practices, etc.

The objective of the household survey is to collect information from people using on-site
sanitation (particularly those living in slums, informal settlements or low-income areas)
regarding their use of FSM services and preferences for future FSM services. The household
survey informs multiple tools and analyses as set out in Section 1. In order to keep the
number of questions manageable, prioritisation is necessary. The questionnaire should be
adapted to fit the objectives of the survey and fit the local context.

A cluster survey is proposed and the necessary sample size may differ across each city.
Sample size calculations are based on the population size, estimated prevalence or the main
indicator of interest, the required confidence level, acceptable margin of error and the design
effect (related to inter-cluster correlation). Informally, it would also be influenced by the budget
available. The proposed indicator of interest is ownership of a latrine not connected to a
sewer, since the tools are primarily focused on FSM services for those with non-networked
sanitation.

       3.1.2       Methodology

The World Bank global FSM study was interested in two separate but overlapping groups, (i)
people living in slums, informal or low-income settlements (a geographical area), (ii) people
using on-site sanitation (ownership of a specific asset), some of whom live in slums, informal
or low-income settlements but others elsewhere in middle class or wealthier areas. The aim
was to draw conclusions about these groups by interviewing a sample of them.

Interviewing households at random from across a whole city is not a very reliable way of
drawing such conclusions, and it is also difficult to administer. One of the best ways of


                                                                                                   6
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



combining statistical rigour with a workable fieldwork model is a cluster survey. This involves
sampling a defined number of groups of households in areas of a consistent size.

Most cluster surveys are based on primary sampling units (PSUs) made up of 100-250
households depending on the country, from which a cluster of 5-20 households is sampled. In
towns and cities, PSUs are often referred to as ‘urban blocks’ – the list is usually available
from the national statistics office in the country based on the most recent census. They
typically contain between 100 – 500 households depending on the country.

The World Bank global FSM study used a cluster survey approach, and in most cities 720
households across two sub-samples in each city were interviewed. The sampling approach is
detailed in the next Section. The Household Survey questionnaire is in Annex A of this
document.

         3.1.3     Sampling

First, the sampling frame needs to be defined, i.e. the geographical or other scope, of all the
households that could be sampled. A dual sub-sample approach can be taken:

         A sub-sample of households using on-site sanitation living across the whole city (some
          of whom may live in slums / informal settlements)

         A sub-sample of households living in slums / informal settlements with boundaries
          defined by the study team.

The decision of which approach to use is about representativeness. The key decision is to
define the population which the sample will represent (and the associated level of confidence).
If it is only slums, informal or low-income settlements, then it is appropriate to sample only
these geographically-defined areas. If the scope is beyond such areas, then it will probably be
necessary to sample the whole city.

The sample sizes are influenced by the population size, the prevalence rate for indicators of
interest, the required confidence level, and the design effect (related to inter-cluster
correlation). The generally-accepted minimum number for cluster surveys is 30 clusters.

The approach, as used in the World Bank global FSM study, is generally as follows:

         Sub-sample A: 30 primary sampling units (PSUs) from across the city, based on
          administrative divisions. For example, if there are 90 wards in a city, the approach
          would be to first randomly select 30 wards, and then randomly select 1 PSU per ward.
          This sub-sample is designed to be representative of the city as a whole. However,
          households within each PSU would be selected using a random walk method.

         Sub-sample B: 30 PSUs from geographically-defined slums / informal settlements. For
          example, if 15 such areas were defined, 2 PSUs would be randomly selected from the
          total number of PSUs in each of those areas. Households would be selected using a
          random walk method.

The next decision is the size of the clusters, which needs a power calculation. The best and
easiest to use is the statistical software EpiInfo, developed by US Centres for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).



                                                                                                  7
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



For the city-wide sample, the indicator of interest is the proportion of households using non-
networked sanitation. For most developing country cities, this is between 60-100% (see
summary report for explanation), so 80% was used.

As shown in the graphic below, the statistical assumptions are population size: infinite,
expected frequency: 80%, margin of error = 5%, design effect = 2, cluster size = 12 and
number of clusters = 30.

Figure 1       Example sample size calculation




This provides a power (confidence level) of 90%. Surveys placing a premium on
representativeness would aim for 95% confidence, but 90% may be sufficient for many
studies.

Selecting 12 households per PSU gives an overall sample size of 720, with 360 households in
each of sub-sample A and B. At this sample size, sub-sample A would not be representative
of the city with very high confidence, but would give an idea of a broader geographical area
than just slums. Sub-sample B would give relatively high confidence about the defined
geographical area (though the areas selected would be purposive and not give statistical
representativeness’).

This approach balances the need for a focus on slums / informal settlements (however
defined) but also the need for users of non-networked sanitation in lower-middle and middle
class areas to be part of a city wide FSM service. If areas known to be wealthy and connected
to sewers are randomly selected in sub-sample A, these can be replaced by another draw,
with little risk to the integrity of the methodology. However, a sampling expert should be
consulted. Within each PSU, the sampling of households (secondary sampling units) could be
done in the field, i.e. by random walk or a similar method to be determined. This is the lowest
cost method when representativeness is not the highest priority.




                                                                                                 8
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



       3.1.4       Fieldwork

The fieldwork model (e.g. size of enumerator team, which drives cost) is determined by the
number of households sampled per PSU. Assuming the questionnaire is 45 minutes long,
then a maximum of 6 households can be completed by one enumerator per day, though this
could be ambitious. If it is practical, then 12 households per day (i.e. one cluster) could be
achieved with 2 enumerators in the team plus a supervisor.

With 60 clusters and only 1 team, that would mean 60 working days of fieldwork, which would
be too long. A better model could be 4 teams, which would then take 15 days to complete.
Alternatively, there could be 3 teams, which would mean 20 days to complete.


3.2        Observation of service provider practices

       3.2.1       Introduction and objective

Observation is a useful tool for triangulation to confirm the reliability and consistency of
information collected from other studies, including from questionnaires and interviews. It is
applicable to both quantitative and qualitative data collection.

For this instrument, observation requires making visual inspections about fecal sludge
management from containment in a pit or tank, to final disposal. It requires identification of
hazards, hazardous events, and an assessment of possible risks at each stage (containment,
emptying, transport, treatment and end-use or disposal) of the fecal sludge management
chain.

Three types of observation can be carried out:

      1.   Structured observation of service providers, to identify risks to the environment
           associated with procedures, state of equipment and actions taken (by households
           and workers) in relation to containment, emptying, transport/conveyance, treatment,
           disposal or end-use of fecal sludge
      2.   Characteristics of fecal sludge removed from sanitary facilities, using tests to identify
           the solid/liquid state of the sludge and other aspects – see separate section on fecal
           sludge (FS) Characteristics
      3.   Environmental conditions in the neighbourhood, using Transect Walks
The fill list of issues to observe is shown in Table 4.




                                                                                                       9

                               environment)


       3.2.2       Methodology

Using a set of developed check-lists (see Annex B) helps to identify and capture the key risks
associated with practices carried out during stages of the FSM service chain.

Completing the structured observation

While observations are ideally made unannounced, to observe full containment facilities, as
well as emptying and transport practices, visits need to be planned, agreed and carried out as
and when containment systems are being emptied. Specific skill sets will be needed for


                                                                                                             10

observation, with at least one observer being a sanitation expert, trained to be aware of
relevant details.

A prepared checklist helps the observers identify the main risks associated with all stages of
the FSM service chain (from containment to disposal/ end-use). Training in use of the
checklist will be needed, as well as an opportunity for enumerators to pilot them, to ensure
good understanding in how to use them effectively and any adjustments required before
conducting final observations.

Having gained approval to conduct the structured observations (e.g. from householders,
emptiers, operators/managers of treatment facilities, etc.), the enumerators should observe
the household sanitation facility (containment), the practices of the service provider handling
the fecal sludge (emptying, transportation and disposal), and the facilities handling the fecal
sludge (treatment and/or end-use).

As each observation is conducted, the enumerator must complete the appropriate checklists
to the fullest extent possible. To do this, the enumerator places a clear and consistent mark
(such as X or ) against the appropriate response to each question. If no answer can be
identified, the mark can be made against the answer “DK” (representing don’t know). If the
enumerator needs to provide a different response to any of those suggested, it must be clearly
stated. There is also space on the checklists for additional comments to be made.

The questions are not to be asked out loud, but rather the enumerators ask each question to
themselves (or perhaps quietly to each other, as a prompt) as they complete the check list.

General household information must also be completed, as indicated on page 1 of the form.

Recording results of the structured observation

Observation will generate both quantitative and qualitative data. All information collected
should be recorded in note form and eventually transferred into an excel file. Each location at
which observations are made should have a unique identification code. It is important that the
report form provides detailed information for identification (city, PSU, GPS coordinates and
date of observation, as a minimum).

One set of survey sheets are to be completed for any one observation: i.e. a containment and
emptying observation, plus – to the extent possible – observing transportation, disposal and
treatment/ end-use facilities for the emptied fecal sludge. If only containment and emptying
practices can be observed in one event, then separate observations of transportation,
disposal, treatment and/or end-use may need to be arranged.

The results taken on paper, for each set of observations, must be accurately transferred into
an excel spreadsheet format. One page of the spreadsheet is used to record results for
observations at each stage of the FSM service chain.

In the excel file, the results noted in the field (paper copy) must be accurately transferred into
the corresponding cell for each question addressed. Each excel file must have a uniquely
coded file name, to identify the specific location and time in which the structured observations
were conducted.

         3.2.3     Sampling

Fully recorded observations are to be made at a minimum of 5 different locations, through all
stages (if possible) of the sanitation chain. The chosen observations should reflect existing
fecal sludge management practices as much as possible, considering both manual and
mechanical emptying methods.

To achieve a purposive sample (covering a range of types of sanitary facilities, income groups
and procedures), the following need to be taken into account:

          To obtain as representative a range of observations as possible, discuss emptying
           schedules with emptiers (both mechanical and manual operators) and identify a
           range of customers, income groups and types of facilities emptied. This may require
           discussions with a number of service providers, to achieve a suitable range.

          Observations need to coincide with a household having their facility (pit latrine, septic
           tank, etc.) emptied. Information will need to be sought from emptiers, or households,
           to know when emptying will take place and time visits accordingly. Note that
           observations of manual emptying procedures may need to be done at night.

          Timing and locations of visits will need to be finally agreed in advance, in consultation
           with the emptiers. Permission to observe must be sought from the emptiers before
           the visit and from households prior to, or at the time of, visits.

          Where possible, the structured observations should observe the full procedure of a
           “shift” by the emptiers – following them through the stages of emptying, transporting
           and disposing of the fecal sludge – to the extent that is possible.

          The visits will require careful thought and preparation, to avoid significant down-time
           of observers. It may benefit to identify, in consultation with emptiers, the times of day/
           days of the week that they are busiest, and then match this against the stage of work
           to be observed.

It is estimated that a minimum of 30 minutes will be required per recording, depending on the
extent of the service providers’ “shift” that can be observed and the length of any shift to
follow-through the procedures. Where long, or congested, transportation routes are involved,
that stage of the observation may require significantly more time.

         3.2.4     Fieldwork

Each observation should be carried out by two members of the survey team to make
observations and record details, with at least one person being a sanitation expert. Both will
have been trained in use of the checklists.

The structured observations can be completed at the same time, and by the same team, as
carries out observations of fecal sludge (FS) Characteristics (see below). If and when
possible, they could be conducted while household visits are happening in the same area, but
given the need to follow the activities of the emptying service providers, this may not always
be possible.




                                                                                                   12

Quality control and risk management

The Quality Control officer is unlikely to carry out quality checks either during or following the
structured observations – and they are not able to re-observe practices. They should therefore
interview the enumerators to discuss a sub-set of recorded information, ask what happened at
the time of the recording and check that the recorded observations are appropriate.

Those conducting the observations should use protective clothing (gloves, safety glasses,
face masks, etc.) if there are identified risks. This is particularly the case as and when they
take samples of fecal sludge to identify its characteristics at the time of emptying (see
separate Protocol).


3.3        Transect walk

       3.3.1       Introduction and objective

A transect walk enables participants to make a subjective and qualitative assessment of
conditions within a community. During the walk, participants make systematic observations,
discuss their observations, and record their findings. The information collected complements
information collected from household questionnaires, observations, and sample collection and
analysis.

For the purposes of this instrument, a transect walk provides information about the broad
environmental risks to public health, in particular with respect to the presence of fecal material
and solid waste, and the proximity of these wastes to drainage channels and water sources.

       3.3.2       Methodology

A transect walk is not an intrusive activity, but ideally local authorities should be informed
about survey work within a community, and permission obtained in advance. If possible, two
male and two female adult volunteers living in the community should be asked to participate in
a transect walk, so that the information collected can benefit from both local knowledge and
outside knowledge. Local participants should be briefed at the start, so that they know what a
transect walk is, and what information it provides.

The route for a transect walk should not be imposed upon the participants, but an agreed
route should be identified and agreed. The route followed should include areas that are
generally representative of the PSU.

The route taken for each transect walk should be planned and recorded using a map and/or
GPS data. The route should cross the PSU, following a winding route to include a variety of
areas. Those planning the route should try to include residential areas from across the
income range, and examples of areas that may pose risks to public health, such as river or
streams, drainage channels, back streets, open wasteland, food markets and local waste
dump-sites.

Qualitative information from observations made during the transect walk should be
summarised, using a report form such as included in Annex C. When using the report form,
different examples of risk may be observed during a single transect walk. Classification
should be based on what is observed in the majority of places, and representing the general
local conditions.

                                                                                                  13
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



Photographs may be taken of any relevant and significant details, but the locations of areas
photographed should be identified, together with brief comments about what each photograph
shows.

The final set of questions should be answered at the end of the walk, and asked of the four
community members who have participated in the walk (see below). They are slightly different
from the rest of the instrument in that they will provide quantitative data on certain aspects.
This consists of some questions asking about the general conditions within the community
relating to open defecation, fecal sludge contamination and awareness of associated risk,
from the community perspective. The questions are asked to the group as a whole, who can
discuss their opinions before offering a single response.

       3.3.3       Sampling

Up to 40 transect walks will provide a good data set of conditions within a range of areas and
information about the environmental public health risks to the communities. This can comprise
a transect walk in all of the 30 PSUs from Sub-Sample A, and 10 randomly selected from Sub-
Sample B. This allows the study to draw conclusions about health risks in the city as a whole,
by carrying out a transect walk in all 30 sub-sample A PSUs.

       3.3.4       Fieldwork

Each transect walk team should include two members of the survey team, including a
sanitation specialist, to make observations and record details. In addition it should include two
male and two female community members to create a mixed team to provide information and
insights from different perspectives that contribute to creating a complete picture of the
environmental health risks in the area.

Each transect walk should be arranged during the household survey period, complementing
information collected from household surveys. A standard report form should be used, so that
information collected for the same categories on the form can be compared directly for
different PSUs.

A draft report form should be completed during each transect walk, with a final version
updated as soon as possible afterwards, before information becomes vague or is forgotten.
The two members of the survey team, and one member of the community who has
participated in the walk, should sign the form after completion to confirm that they agree with
the information reported. A copy of the report, with a brief explanation of what has been
observed should be given to the member of the community who signs the completed form. It
is important that the report form provides detailed information for identification (city, PSU and
GPS coordinates).


3.4        Testing fecal sludge (FS) characteristics

       3.4.1       Introduction and objective

The characteristics of fecal sludge will vary, depending on factors such as the length of time
for which it has been stored, the season, and the storage conditions (e.g. whether the sludge
was in a lined or unlined pit). Assessment of the characteristics is required at three stages,
and for the following reasons:


                                                                                                14
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



       1.      During removal, as this will influence the removal methods that could be used; and
       2.      After removal, as this will influence how the faecal sludge can be transported and
               treated, and possible resource recovery options.
       3.      After treatment, as this will determine the resource value of the end product
               derived from the faecal sludge.

Data collection to assess and measure the characteristics of fecal sludge will use the
components of both (a) observation and (b) sampling and analysis. This will require
observation of the sludge during removal from a pit or tank, and collection of sludge samples
from three points along the sludge flow pathway.

The three points from which sludge samples should be collected are:

       (i) at pits or tanks during emptying,
       (ii) from trucks, vehicles or vessels during discharge to treatment, and
       (iii) at the outlet or following the final stage of any treatment



       3.4.2       Methodology

Observation

The physical appearance and characteristics of fecal sludge will vary, depending on the length
of time for which it has been stored, the storage conditions (e.g. whether the sludge was in a
lined or unlined pit), and whether solid wastes have been added to the faecal matter.
Observation of the fecal sludge during removal from pits or tanks is necessary to determine
whether the fecal sludge will behave as a fluid or a solid, and which removal methods may be
appropriate. The top layer of the sludge may be unrepresentative, so a more representative
sample should be collected in a bucket part-way through the emptying operation. Observation
will also reveal what solid wastes may be present in addition to faecal matter.

Tables Table 5 and Table 6 should be used to describe the sample collected during emptying.
Table 5 shows five categories, from dry solid to liquid, for fecal sludge based on observations;
and Table 6 shows five categories for fecal sludge based on the solid waste content. Where
possible, a photograph should be taken of the fecal sludge sample collected during removal
from a pit or tank, and a record kept to identify the location and date for the photograph.

Collection and testing of samples

Physical and chemical characteristics of fecal sludge will vary, depending on factors such as
the length of time for which it has been stored, the season, the storage conditions (e.g.
whether the sludge was in a lined or unlined pit) and removal practices (e.g. whether water is
added to the sludge to make it behave as a fluid).

 Very high solid waste content              Contains more solid wastes than faecal material.
 High solid waste content                   Contains significant amounts of miscellaneous solid wastes.
 Medium solid waste content                 Contains small amounts of miscellaneous solid wastes.
 Low solid waste content                    Contains some paper materials used for anal cleansing.
 No solid waste content                     Contains no solid wastes.

Sample collection for analysis to assess fecal sludge characteristics is required at four stages,
as shown in Table 7, which also includes the requirement for observation:

1.        Before removal from individual pits or tanks, to ascertain whether the fecal sludge will
          behave as a fluid and the extent of solid (non-fecal) waste content. These both have
          implications for the removal techniques and equipment required.

2.        During removal from individual pits or tanks, to obtain a variety of fecal sludge
          characteristics and indicate the nutrient content and calorific values, and whether the
          FS is of high or low strength.

3.        During discharge from the truck, vehicle or vessel (at the tipping point or treatment
          plant), as this will provide a composite sample from more than one pit or tank. These
          characteristics will also indicate the nutrient content and calorific values, and whether
          the FS is of high or low strength. The characteristics may influence how the fecal
          sludge can be transported and treated, and help to identify possible resource recovery
          options;

4.        After treatment, as this will determine the safety and resource value of the end product
          derived from the fecal sludge. Important characteristics at this stage include the
          nutrient content and calorific values.

                                            A subjective assessment of the sludge before removal will
                                            indicate whether the sludge will behave as a fluid or as a solid.

* For fecal sludge, weights may be used instead of volumes, depending on whether the fecal
sludge behaves as a solid or liquid.

        3.4.3       Sampling

Within each city the following numbers of fecal sludge samples and sampling positions are
recommended;


                                                                                                           19
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



         Observation of the fecal sludge from each of five separate pits or tanks shortly during
          removal from pits or tanks to determine the physical appearance and characteristics of
          the fecal sludge, and whether it will behave as a fluid or a solid. The pits or tanks
          should be selected following discussions with a range of pit emptiers, with the aim of
          collecting samples from a variety of pits or tanks from different income groups. They
          would only be from slums and informal settlement areas in sub-sample B, but would
          not necessarily overlap with our PSUs, with the priority being cooperation of the
          service providers.

         One 1 litre sample from each of the same five separate pits or tanks being emptied.
          (Each sample to be divided to provide duplicate results.)

         A good mixed composite sample, consisting of three 1 litre samples, preferably from
          five different trucks, vehicles or vessels, at the inlet structure of the fecal sludge
          treatment facility, during discharge of fecal sludge. The first 1 litre sample should be
          taken at the start of discharge, the second approximately mid-way through discharge,
          and the third towards the end of discharge. (Each sample to be divided to provide
          duplicate results.)

         Five 1 litre samples, collected at different times during one day, from the outlet or
          following the final stage of each treatment facility. (Each sample to be divided to
          provide duplicate results.)

It is recommended that, when collecting samples during discharge of fecal sludge from
vehicles, some fecal sludge is collected in a bucket, and a 1 litre sample taken from the
bucket.

         3.4.4     Fieldwork

Each sample collection team should consist of two people from the survey team, and including
a sanitation specialist, to make observations, take samples, and record details. Samples
should be collected during the household survey period, when information can be collected to
identify households for which the pit or tank is about to be emptied. The exact timing for
sample collection will be determined by the survey teams in discussion with pit emptiers.

Prior to collecting samples, the city teams need to identify suitable certified laboratories
capable of conducting the various tests required. Arrangements need to be made with the
laboratory or laboratories about:

         identification of samples;
         costs for sample analysis;
         delivery of samples;
         storage of the fecal sludge in appropriate conditions prior to analysis;
         confirmation of the sample size required;
         the choice of sample bottles to be used; and
         how and when results will be provided.

In addition, each city team needs to purchase suitable sterilized bottles for transport and
storage of fecal sludge samples, labels for identification of sample bottles, and protective
clothing (gloves, eye-protectors, masks, overalls and boots) for each member of the sample
collection teams. Sample collection teams need to receive some basic training, and gain
practical experience, in how to collect representative samples safely at each stage.



                                                                                                  20
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



Quality control and risk management

To minimise risks to the members of the sample collection team, each team member should
wear the protective clothing provided (gloves, eye protection, mask, overalls and boots).
Samples should be placed in sterile and secure sample bottles, correctly labelled for
identification. After collection, samples should be stored at below 4°C and analysed within 4-6
hours. If the time between collection and analysis exceeds 6 hours, the report of the analysis
should include information on the condition and duration of sample transport.

Each sample should be divided to provide duplicate results. Analyses of duplicate samples
are used to validate the precision, variation and repeatability of the analytical methods within a
laboratory. Results from the duplicate samples can be compared, and explanations sought for
any significant inconsistencies in the results obtained. Preparation of duplicate samples also
provides reassurance that a back-up sample is available in the event that one of the
duplicates is accidentally spilled, contaminated, or mistakes are made during analysis.

Data Management and analysis

Results from analysis of samples should be compiled using Excel spreadsheets. A separate
spreadsheet page should be used for data at each stage within a city. All observation results
would be on one spreadsheet page; all results for FS samples taken during emptying of a pit
would be on another spreadsheet page, etc.

All sampling points should be readily identifiable, with unique identification labels and
recorded GPS coordinates. If the laboratory has not been used before, it may be worth
sending initial samples for analysis to check that the laboratory staff and facilities are familiar
and able to handle all of the required procedures.




3.5        Key Informant Interviews

         3.5.1     Introduction and objective

Key informant interviews (KIIs) are the way in which primary information will be sought to
address key questions about how both the ‘enabling environment’ and the operating
environment affects FSM services (past, current and future). KIIs with stakeholders having
responsibility or interest in FSM services at city-level and beyond will allow the enabling and
operating environments to be better understood in relation to the influence within the city, or to
wider spheres of influence – such as State or National legislation.

KIIs are also means to engage stakeholders in other aspects of the research process,
including to:

          clarify the purpose, objectives and interests of each stakeholder, in relation to current
           FSM services and the likely outcomes of changes to those services;

          facilitate further data collection, including: providing specific documents/ ‘grey
           literature’, granting access to localities, approving the sampling arrangements,
           making contacts with other organizations/ individuals.



                                                                                                  21
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



       3.5.2       Methodology

KIIs will be held with a range of stakeholders who have a role or interest in FSM services
within the city. In summary, they are likely to include:

   City council/ Municipality/ Utility
   Government Ministries/ Departments with responsibility for: urban sanitation/ sewerage
    (liquid waste), urban solid waste collection, urban water supply, urban planning,
    environmental health/ protection, finance, economic development and agriculture.
   Service providers (private and/or public) covering: manual and mechanised emptying and
    transportation services, public sector operation of FS treatment and disposal sites, private
    sector operation of FS end-use sites (including re-use for agriculture and industry)
   NGOs and other ‘external’ agencies providing support to FS services. In this context,
    ‘external’ refers to individuals and agencies that are not service providers but have
    interests related to FSM management and service delivery. In addition, key informants
    could include those who are not key stakeholders (i.e. those with a direct interest or ‘stake’
    in FSM services) but perhaps more ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’ observers of the sector,
    including academics or researchers with expertise and relevant knowledge in FSM or, in
    some cases, even the media.

Key Government staff: It is likely that key staff within a range of units/ offices with the
Municipality and different Directorates within government Ministries/ Departments will need to
be consulted, to ensure those met are in a position to respond to questions relating to the
different components of the research (and possibly to specific issues within them). Careful
identification and selection of individuals will need to be undertaken, to ensure reliable
information can be sought wherever possible, as well as diverse perspectives if relevant.

Service providers: Service providers will be interviewed as a means to identify both
qualitative and quantitative data relating to the provision of FSM services through the FS
service chain: from containment to end-use/ disposal.

    While it would be ideal to interview all service providers operating within the city, up to a
    maximum of 10 emptiers and a maximum of 5 providers of services for each of the other
    stages (i.e. operators driving/ managing transport services, treatment/ disposal sites and
    end-use facilities) may be more realistic. It is likely that manual emptiers – particularly
    those that operate under informal conditions – will be identified through information gained
    during household surveys and possibly from secondary reports already conducted in those,
    or similar, neighbourhoods. Interviews with a range of both formal and information emptiers
    will be sought.

A combination of open-ended and closed questions can be asked during the interview, to gain
better understanding of:

   qualitative aspects of the enabling environment, including: quality of services, engagement
    with other stakeholders (regulation, reporting procedures), availability of technical options,
    cost-recovering mechanisms and supporting facilities.
   quantitative aspects of service provision, including: demand, pricing, disposal locations,
    obstacles, transport to disposal, volumes, equipment, staffing, investment plans, etc.

Further guidance on stakeholder mapping as a way to inform which questions to ask to which
stakeholders is included in Annex EE.

Box 1        Discussions or interviews with emptiers and transporters of fecal sludge
Emptiers and drivers of vehicles are not necessarily the same people as the "owners" of those
vehicles (who are more likely to be engaged in the interviews). They have different interests,
opinions and knowledge, which is often missed during standard research processes.
Interviews (formal or less formal) are to be arranged and held with those directly involved in
the emptying and transportation of fecal sludge serving the informal settlements/ slum
communities sampled during the data collection. Manual emptiers, as well as those who
operate mechanised emptying equipment should be interviewed. Such discussions can help
to ensure that all stakeholders are consulted on questions of direct relevance and purpose to
the services they provide.
The topics that could specifically be discussed during these interviews are shown in the tables
in the Annex.


NGOs and other ‘external’ agencies: A range of ‘external’ agencies may be engaged in
FSM services within the city, such as academic institutions, donors, private investors or
consultants. In this context, ‘external’ refers to agencies that are not service providers, but
have interests related to FSM management and service delivery. They may be well placed to
contribute views on a range of issues affecting FSM services.

More ‘neutral’ key informants – i.e. those without a direct ‘stake’ or interest in FSM – are also
likely to be in a good position to help with an initial stakeholder mapping exercise. This can
both help identify key stakeholders to talk to in subsequent interviews as well as form the
basis to identify which specific components, sub-components and questions can be asked to
which public or private sector stakeholder, on issues where they have particular interest
and/or influence in relation to current and future FSM services.

       3.5.3       Sampling

Key informants and stakeholders with different positions and perspectives bring their own sets
of interpretive biases and analysis. For some of the research questions, and particularly in
relation to the political economy analysis, there may be no single absolute truth and difference
of opinion (rather than standardisation) can be useful to understand. Trustworthiness in
interpretation can nonetheless be strengthened by cross-checking – or triangulating – the
views and analysis of different key informants (and focus groups). It is important to remember
that these may include people who might not normally be talked to, in order to ensure multiple
and different perspectives are gathered. It is critical that women are also interviewed and that
gender is recorded on all interview reports.

The total number of interviews required, as well as the range and extent of questioning, will
also be influenced by the availability of current and reliable data from other sources, as well as
constraints on time and resources.

The likely maximum number of interviews required, to gain all information sought, is
considered to be 40 interviews. The actual range of stakeholders and interviewees should be
determined following an initial stakeholder mapping activity and information gained during the
household survey.

The final list of stakeholders and proposed interviews should ensure appropriate
representation from a range of government ministries and service providers, as well as
external agencies. Representation of service providers through the FSM service chain should
reflect the percentage of roles and responsibilities that each plays in FSM for the study city

(e.g. in a city where manual emptiers are the dominant providers of emptying services, they
must account for the majority of those observed and interviewed during emptying and
transportation procedures; likewise, where private companies carry out mechanised emptying
and transportation services for most areas of the city, they should account for the majority of
providers observed and interviewed during emptying and transportation procedures).

The list of stakeholders may include the types of stakeholder outlined in Table 10, with an
indication of the sampling process.

 services: e.g. academic institutions,           In this context, ‘external’ refers to individuals and
 donors, private investors, consultants          agencies that are not service providers but have
                                                 interests related to FSM management and service

       3.5.4       Fieldwork

It is anticipated that one individual consultant, with experience in conducting interviews with a
broad range of stakeholders, will carry out the work. However, it is possible that on occasion it
may be deemed appropriate to have two people involved – one to facilitate the questions and
the other (or both) to take notes.

The length of interviews will vary, but on average may take approximately 1 hour.



                                                                                                         24

It may help to phase the timing of interviews, to build-up the level of understanding about the
context and extent of FSM services in the City. This will depend to some extent on the existing
experience of the consultant and the existing relationships developed with the stakeholders
involved.

A proposed phasing of interviews, assuming no or little pre-existing knowledge and
relationship with the range of stakeholders, is outlined in the table.

                        health,

 4th set          Emptying / transportation service providers (following household interviews)
                  Treatment plant / end-use / disposal site service providers

At the end of the interviews, if time and resources allow, it would be useful to cross check and
validate initial findings and analysis based on all the interviews to the 1st set of interviewees.

As outlined above, the identification, prioritisation and sampling of respondents (from
government, FSM service providers, etc.), will be based on an initial analysis of institutional
responsibilities and stakeholders using information from more ‘neutral’ FSM sector observers
– e.g. potentially academics, the media, researchers, etc. This will help identify key city (and
other) level stakeholders and the potential perspectives they may have, together with issues in
the FSM service chain that might be relevant to particular stakeholders. Use this analysis to
focus questions for particular respondents appropriately.

Quality control

KIIs should follow commonly adopted good practice, including:

              pre-arrange interviews, to ensure the most appropriate interviewee is available;
              select questions to ask, and ask them in such a way, that the interviewee is in a
               position to answer ;
              interviews may be voice-recorded, but only with prior knowledge and permission of
               the interviewee;
              follow-up the interview, to obtain further detail/ clarity if appropriate;
              provide a write-up of the interview, if requested.

If the interviewee invites other participants to join the interview, be aware of their
appropriateness to the subject matter and any possible disruption this may cause to the
exchange of information. If they have valid contributions to make to the interview, incorporate
these into the notes and clearly identify in the write-up who else participated in a broader
discussion, or observed the interview.

Comprehensive notes should be captured electronically – either during the interview itself
(typed directly into word document or similar), or within 24 hours of interview.

Key points relating to the main topic areas of the interview should be identified and
summarised, as soon as possible following the interview.




                                                                                                                    26
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



Ethical considerations

The following points should be addressed, to ensure the collection of data meets with ethical
standards:
     State the purpose of the interview and use of findings, before starting.
     Offer anonymity – and ensure it is followed if requested.
     Only use a voice-recorder with prior knowledge and permission of the interviewee.
     Gain verbal permission to start the interview and note this on the interview write-up.
     Allow the interviewee to “pass” on specific questions.
     Provide a write-up of the interview, if requested.
     Indicate next steps, or possible follow up, if appropriate.

Data Management

A separate word document should be developed for each interview write-up. The document
file name and any original interview forms (hand-written) should have a unique code that
identifies the document. It could use for example, a coding for the City, type of Stakeholder
(e.g. Government/ Private Sector/ NGO/ Donor), if appropriate the Organization interviewed
(name of the institution, not the individual), date of the interview and, if necessary required a
unique number to distinguish the document from others.

Data Analysis

This will vary greatly depending on the objectives of the study. If developing a prognosis for
change, research questions will need to be developed before commencement of data
collection. Analysis would then aim to use the collected data to answer those questions. For
example, there may need to be an initial institutional mapping of responsibilities or a
stakeholder mapping of interests and influence in relation to FSM, undertaken early in the
process..

After the completion of all the interviews, the mappings can be revisited to ensure any
presentation or summary they present is an accurate reflection of the information from all
respondents (i.e. not just the initial information from external actors / agencies, or from a
particular set of other stakeholders).

A further institutional responsibility mapping should be completed to show the responsibilities
as they are actually undertaken – i.e. not the theoretical formal responsibilities but the
stakeholders who actually takes responsibility for FSM at the local level. This should also
include any stakeholders who do not have formal responsibilities but in practice undertake
particular activities of tasks.

Further stakeholder analysis should also be completed in more detail based on the
information from the whole range of key informants. It might be necessary to note and include
different perspectives in this in order to ensure readers are aware of any multiple perspectives
and the rational for each.

Process mapping can also be used to outline both how processes are meant to be undertaken
or implemented in theory, and how they actually occur in practice, together with reasons why
this is the case.

3.6         Focus Group Discussions

       3.6.1       Introduction and objective

The objective of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with residents of informal settlements/ slum
communities is to gather qualitative data that will compliment, validate, or perhaps challenge
responses made during the household survey. Questions will focus on obtaining information
relating to household practices (particularly identifying the practices of “others” as individuals
are reluctant to talk honesty about their own, or their family, practices), service levels, past
interventions, risks and other issues associated with FSM services that affect their community.
Topics to be covered during the FGDs and a proposed set of questions to be asked are
included in Annex FF.

Gender-disaggregated groups and information is required – which must be accounted for
during planning, running and collecting results from the FGDs.

       3.6.2       Methodology

A draft FGD guide (including proposed questions to be asked) is included inAnnex F. The
questions should be adapted and reworded into appropriate vocabulary, as well as being
translated into the appropriate language to suit the local context and aid understanding.

Once translated, the questions should be pre-tested. This allows for the suitability and
acceptability of questions to be checked – as well as ensuring those running the FGDs clearly
understand the nature of each question. Appropriate modifications to the FGD questions can
then be made.

Team members must have appropriate experience and skills to both facilitate and write-up the
discussion during the FGDs (anticipated to be done separately by a team of 2 – see next
section). In most countries, women interviewers are required to interview women-only
FGDs, to enable women to talk more freely, about for example the issue of disposal of
menstrual hygiene products, who makes decisions on sanitation within the household, etc.

Appropriate approvals to conduct the FGDs should be sought, prior to running them. This will
be with individuals invited to participate as a minimum, but may also require approval from
officials representing affected communities and households (if deemed necessary).

       3.6.3       Sampling

It is proposed that up to 10 FGDs are held with households from 10 randomly selected PSUs.
These may all be from ‘sub-sample B’ PSUs (from the total of 30 PSUs) which have been
purposively sampled from informal settlements / slum areas in the city, or from PSUs in both
sub-samples A and B.

 communities only, or from PSUs                   may be conducted with users of non-networked sanitation
 in sub-samples A and B                           in higher and middle-income areas)


                                                                                                            28
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



A range of perceptions, priorities, practices and challenges will face different residents,
depending on various factors. FGDs are a means by which participants can be selected for a
specific reason, as a way to help draw-out from the group issues particularly affecting different
‘types’ of residents in informal settlements.

As a minimum, at least half of the FGDs should be gender-segregated, to allow responses to
be disaggregated by gender. Other groups may be focused around different socio-economic
factors, to suit the characteristics of the population within the PSUs. For example:

          -   Vulnerability: all participants are elderly, disabled, or less able-bodied
          -   Household characteristics: all participants are tenants, or all are owner-occupiers,
              or all are landlords
          -   Presence of a household latrine: all participants own a private household latrine, or
              all manage a latrine that is shared by a number of families
          -   Use of shared, community, community or public toilets on a daily basis.
          -   Use of service providers for emptying: all participants have their latrines emptied by
              manual operators, or all rely on mechanised services
          -   Type of latrine: all participants have simple pits, or all have septic tanks

         3.6.4     Fieldwork model

FGDs can be run by teams of two people. One person will facilitate the discussion, while the
other person takes notes and observes non-verbal communication. Both team members
should have previous experience and suitable skills in running and/or documenting FGDs, as
well as technical knowledge in urban sanitation.

FGDs should only take place once household surveys and observational instruments have
been conducted, so that relevant individuals or groups can be identified and invited to
participate. Any ‘group selection’ would need careful discussion and agreement in advance, to
ensure it is appropriate and will be effective to the needs of the study.

FGDs should take place in a convenient, quiet and comfortable location for participants. The
availability and accessibility of women and other vulnerable groups must be considered when
planning all locations and times at which to hold the FGDs. FGDs typically last an hour or
more but the duration of each discussion may vary depending on the dynamic of the group
and number of participants. Participants should be notified of the expected duration and the
facilitator should ensure not to run over this time.

Focus groups are typically 5-10 participants however researchers need to anticipate likely ‘no-
shows’ and recruit accordingly, aiming for no more than 10 participants.

Quality control and risk management

The management of FGDs should follow commonly adopted good practice, including:

     -    pre-plan: select and invite the right participants;

     -    set an appropriate venue, time and duration;

     -    (re-) explain the purpose of the FGD at the start and gain approval from participants to
          continue;

                                                                                                  29
FSM global study - Data collection instruments



     -    seek agreement of ground rules with participants (one person speaks at a time,
          everyone’s views are important, there are no right or wrong answers, etc.);

     -    only voice-record the FGD with prior knowledge and granted permission of ALL
          participants;

     -    allow participants to opt-out or leave at any time;

     -    allow everyone the opportunity to participate and no-one to dominate;

     -    summarise key messages received with participants before ending;

     -    re-state what will happen to the data they have supplied.

As well as direct questioning, a range of participatory tools activities could be considered, to
facilitate good discussion during FGDs. These include: pocket-chart voting, mapping, buzz-
groups, using pictures/ diagrams, story-telling, matrix-ranking, process mapping, etc. Be
aware however that these activities take more time, need to be planned in advance and
careful facilitation to make them effective. A wide range of guidelines and notes are available
to help select appropriate activities.

Comprehensive notes should be captured electronically – either during the FGD itself (typed
directly into word document or similar), or within 24 hours of FGD. Where different languages
are used for the group discussion, note-taking and final write-up, the team needs to have
adequate language skills to ensure the quality and meaning of information being said,
captured and reported is maintained through the process.

Ethical considerations

The important ethics issues related to this study are described below.

Informed voluntary participation: Informed oral consent must be obtained from participants
before FGDs are run. Team members and FGD participants are to be informed about the
purpose, methods, risks, benefits and intended possible uses of the FGD results.

Right to refuse or withdraw: The participants will be informed that they are free to leave the
FGD at any point, or may refuse to answer any questions. They will also have the right to ask
questions at any point before, during or after the FGD is completed.

Confidentiality and privacy: No personal identifiers will be used in any form of reporting or
dissemination. Personal identifications will be linked with a unique identifier (e.g. id code) and
kept securely. No information will be published that could identify the respondents. Paper
copies of FGDs will be stored for three years in a secure location; only the study team should
be able to access them. Confidentiality cannot be guaranteed as it is a group setting but
participants are requested not to disclose details of what was discussed.

Risks and benefits: The risk of participation in the FGD is considered minimal as there will be
no collecting of any sensitive information or biological samples. The respondents will not be
directly benefited by participating, however the information that they will provide us may give
some important information to the policy makers to improve the overall water, sanitation and
hygiene condition of their country and they may eventually have an indirect benefit from that.

Payment: There will no compensation payment to the participants and nor will they have to
pay us to participate in the study. FGDs should be held in the target PSU to avoid any
participant transport costs.

Data management and analysis

All details relating to the FGD, together with the discussion during each FGD, will be
adequately recorded by the note-taker. This may be done in hard copy or soft copy format.

A word document is to be prepared using a reporting template, to consistently capture the
significant issues raised during the FGDs against the main topic areas. This write-up should
include, where relevant, quotations, indication of strength of feeling around certain topics
(identify by, for example, a show-of-hands, or secret ballot), any ranking of significance of
issues conducted during the FGD.

All word documents are to be allocated a unique identification name/label that will clearly
identify the location of the FGD and nature of the group. Copies of original FGD write-ups (in
soft and/or hard copy) must be kept securely throughout the duration of the study.

A.2       Consent
Hello. My name is ________________________________ and I am from [[[[[survey firm]]]]]. I am here today
to conduct a survey on sanitation. Your household has been randomly selected for this survey. If you are
interested to participate in this survey we would ask you some questions on your households, its members
and characteristics and on sanitation aspects of your household. The interview would take approximately 60
minutes. The information you will be providing us will be confidential and only the researchers who are
involved in this will have access to it. Your participation is absolutely voluntary and you can withdraw from
the survey any time you want. You may also choose not to answer any questions. You will not have to pay
to participate in this survey; nor will we pay you. You will not directly benefit from this survey, however the
information that you will provide us may give some important information to the policy makers to improve the
overall water, sanitation and hygiene condition of this country and you may have an indirect benefit from
that.

 B.1      Do you want to participate in our survey?

E - Household Characteristics
[Many of these variables in this section are used in the construction of a wealth index (i.e. wealth

          o Tanker-truck
          o Surface Water (river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, irrigation channels)
          o Others (specify)

[F1 should ideally follow the latest guidance of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring
Programme, adapted to the country if necessary but still allowing combination or separation of
categories so as to be reconciled to the JMP categories. This is crucial for ease of comparison
to other data (e.g. DHS, MICS, census)]

     2. On average, how long does it take to travel to this water point?
        [Record time to travel (one way) to WP in minutes]
        [skipped if on premises]

     3. On average, how long do you / the household member have to wait in the queue to get
        water?
        [Record waiting time in minutes]
        [skipped if on premises]

     4. What kind of toilet facility do members of your household usually use?

          o Hanging toilet/hanging latrine
          o Others (specify)
          o No facilities or bush or field, --> skip to xx

[See note on question F1. In addition, skipping patterns are to be devised by the survey
designer in each city]

     5. Where do the contents of this toilet discharge to?
          o Piped sewer system
          o Fully-lined septic tank with soakaway
          o Fully-lined septic tank with overflow to drain / open ground / other
          o Partially-lined septic tank (bottom and/or sides unlined)

                                                                                             40

               o    Others (specify)
               o    DK

[F5 is the most crucial question in the survey. It aims to establish two things: (i) whether
the technology is “emptiable” (e.g. toilets which discharge directly to drains do not contain
excreta and are not emptiable), and (ii) whether the technology safely contains excreta or
allows it to leach into the environment via unlined bottom/sides or an overflow. It is highly
context-specific as to which categories are seen as acceptable/unacceptable in a given city,
depending on many variables (e.g. population density, groundwater levels, whether anyone is
drinking groundwater etc.)The categories used will be highly context-specific, depending on
the prevalent septic tank or pit technologies in the city. It will be important not to have too
many categories, however, to avoid confusing the enumerators, who are unlikely to be
sanitation experts. Extensive debate within the study team should take place about how
different categories are to be interpreted, with use of pictures, before the enumerators are
trained.]

     6. At home, where do you dispose of waste water from kitchen, bathing and/or laundry?
            a. Piped sewer system
            b. Fully-lined septic tank with soakaway

            f. Pit with unlined bottom or sides
            g. Directly to open drain / ditch

            i. Directly to open ground
            j. Others (specify)
            k. DK

[this should be the same categories as the previous question]

     7. How are the stools of children < 3 years usually disposed of?

          o Put/rinsed into toilet or latrine
          o Put/rinsed into drain or ditch
          o Thrown into garbage

In Table 1, the final “score” for each of the categories will be the average of the general conditions found in the community .
As you walk around, place ticks against the descriptions that best describe examples of what you see. At the end of the transect walk, decide what the
average of all the ticks should be for each of the categories and mark this clearly with a score of 1 to 5.

When a particularly high risk situation (conditions 4 or 5) is seen, make a note of this in Table 1 (column on the right) for relevant categories (1, 4, 5a, 5b
and 8). In each case, ask local people how frequently this situation occurs.
Make a note of the frequency in Table 1 (far right column) and complete details in Table 2 for the most significant locations and risks.

When you have finished the transect walk, ask some community members the questions in Table 3.

Annex E                Key informant interviews

E.1       KII indicators and questions
Before developing the set of interview questions, a preliminary “mapping exercise” may need
to be carried out. This mapping can help identify which stakeholders/institutions and specific
interviewees can address which topic-areas (and/or specific questions) from the full set of
possible questions.

This mapping can also identify the extent to which relevant, adequate and reliable
information is already available from other sources. For example, recent past studies or
official reports addressing FSM services may be available, meaning certain questions do not
need to be asked during interviews. However, it is important to consider whether gaining
additional information on a given point will help to verify the existing information, or ensure
different perspectives on a given issue are gathered.

Once this initial mapping has been done, tables can be drawn-up to indicate which
questions, or topic-areas, should be asked to each of the selected key interviewees. This will
help to build-up the full matrix of questions against stakeholders/interviewees and be the
basis of developing interview question guides.

It is important to remember that for some questions, there may not be a ‘correct’ answer or
information but it will be important to gather potentially different perspectives on the same
question from different stakeholders and key informants. For these, and many other of the
proposed example questions set out below, it will be important to ask “why” respondents
have a particular perspective and probe into these issues.




                                                                                                71

E.2       Institutional responsibility mapping and stakeholder analysis

Initial institutional responsibility mapping
As a first step in the process, data for this will come primarily from more neutral observers and key
informants, the researchers own knowledge, and secondary sources.

   Identify which actors / agencies have formal institutional responsibilities for particular aspects
    of FSM (e.g. containment, emptying, transport, etc.) as well as local FSM policy and strategy.
   Categorise these within broader groupings – e.g. national government ministries; local
    government agencies; private sector; etc.
   For each actor or agency, indicate whether they have formal responsibilities for particular
    aspects of FSM in the following table. This should be the formal responsibilities they have, not
    what actually happens in practice.
   Where there are any stakeholders who do not have formal responsibilities but in practice
    undertake particular activities of tasks, not these down for inclusion in subsequent mappings
    but also decide whether they should also be interviewed.

Institutional mapping of formal responsibilities for local FSM
                                                                FSM infrastructure development and service delivery
                                                                 Containment

                                                                                          Transport




                                                                                                                  End-use /
                                                                               Emptying

Local government departments




Local government enterprises

Individuals / households



This will feed into the initial stakeholder analysis below, and help identify key informants and
stakeholders for subsequent interviews.

Initial stakeholder analysis
Using the list of actors / agencies with formal responsibilities identified above, establish whether
there are particular individuals or groups within each broader category who have particular
responsibilities or levels of influence over FSM. Ensure that these stakeholder groups are broken
down sufficiently in order to understand potentially different and competing interests and influence
                                                                                                                              72
FSM global study - Data collection instruments


within broader stakeholder groups. It is important that the analysis unpacks broad terms such as
‘government’, ‘civil society’, ‘community’ or ‘private sector’ and identifies relevant actors (individuals
as well as groups or organisations) within these.

Use the template below to present an initial stakeholder analysis. For each relevant stakeholder,
outline the key points under each heading and the reasons respondents have stated particular
points.

For this initial analysis, data will come from interviews with external key informants.

Refer to the Table on the following page.

Using these initial analyses or responsibilities, interests, characteristics and influence, etc.,
prioritise which individuals and/or agencies it will be most important to interview. The rationale for
selecting an individual might include, for instance, high levels of responsibilities or high level of
influence over a particular element of FSM, etc.

The particular responsibilities or interests will also help select questions that are relevant and also
identify further questions to probe into the issues in more depth.

Based on these two stages and an analysis of data collected during interviews, the further stages
of building-up a Stakeholder Matrix and the Process mapping can follow, to complete the PEA.

Annex F                Focus Group Discussion guide

FGDs provide an opportunity to gather qualitative data that will compliment, validate, or perhaps
challenge responses made during the household survey. Questions are likely to focus on obtaining
information relating to:

    the household sanitation practices of “others” – especially as individuals may not talk openly or
     honesty about their own, or their family, practices;
    peoples’ understanding of the risks associated with poor FSM services;
    issues affecting the community as a whole (service standards and costs, choice of technical
     and service options available, pollution, impacts of legal issues (insecurity of tenure), etc.);
    levels of support received/ perceived as being focused on the needs of poor areas of the city;
    what interventions have been conducted before – and the extent to which they have worked/
     not worked, responded/ not responded to the needs of the community;
    what actions the community could take to improve FSM services;
    willingness-to-pay for improved services (see the note below the following table).

The full list of topics that can be discussed in FGDs members are shown in Table 14.

As the number of topic areas is too many to cover in any one FGD, they will be divided into 2 sets
of broad ‘themes’ to gather qualitative information during FGDs with specific focus areas. Each
FGD will focus on one of the themes, which will address:
