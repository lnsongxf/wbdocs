Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools (Institutional Schools)                                                                          Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Central government has the legal authority to set minimum standards for teachers, determine how the curriculum is delivered, and
    establish class sizes. Schools have the legal authority to appoint, deploy, and dismiss teachers without review by central authorities.
    Schools also have authority to determine teacher salary levels, within central guidelines.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    Government sets standards for what students need to learn, by when, and how well. Board exams are administered annually,
    although with limited standardization over time. Government requires schools to undergo a standard term inspection, but no
    standard inspection report format exists. Sanctions include additional monitoring, fines, and as a final measure, school closures.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Regular information is provided to parents on standardized exam results. Student or parents are interviewed as part of the
    inspection process. While the government does not provide tax subsidies or cash transfers, the private sector is legally required to
    provide some subsidized education services for low-income students through scholarships.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    Certification standards that are not linked to education outcomes restrict market entry, including facilities, assets, and proximity to
    other schools. Registration guidelines are made public by multiple sources. Government does not set standardized tuition fees but
    imposes caps. The government allows all of the following organizational types to operate schools: community, not for profit, faith
    based, and for profit. Schools are able to operate while paying two to three types of fees.


Policy Goals for Government-Funded Non-State Schools (Community Schools)                                                                      Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
     Central government has the legal authority to set minimum standards for teachers, determine how the curriculum is delivered,
     and establish class sizes. Legal authority to appoint, deploy, and dismiss teachers, as well as set teacher salary levels, is divided
     between central authorities and schools: central authorities have authority over teachers provided by the government, and
     schools, for privately hired teachers. Schools have legal authority over the management of school operating budgets, within
     central guidelines.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
     Government sets standards for what students need to learn, by when, and how well. Board exams are administered annually,
     although with limited standardization over time. Government requires schools to undergo a standard term inspection, but no
     standard inspection report format exists. Sanctions include additional monitoring, fines, and as a final measure, school closures.
     Government requires schools to report on the use of public funds as a condition of continued funding during a standard term.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
     Regular information is provided to parents on standardized exam results. Student or parents are interviewed as part of the
     inspection process. Schools are allowed to select students based on academic performance or geography. Parental choice is
     restricted by voluntary monetary parent contributions.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
     Certification standards that are not linked to education outcomes restrict entry. Registration guidelines are made public by
     multiple sources. The government allows community, not-for-profit, and faith-based providers to operate schools. Schools are
     able to operate while paying one type of fee. Academic operating budgets are not equivalent to per-student amounts in
     government-funded schools, nor is start-up funding available. Schools receive information on the allocations to be transferred
     to them between one and three months before the start of the academic year.

The four policy goals enable a government to increase
innovation and strengthen accountability among the
critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts, they
can have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.

Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
    4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
       to attend with government-provided funding;
       these schools can be operated by the

Students in institutional schools have outperformed
their peers in community schools in the past

There is some data to suggest that at least in the past,
students in institutional schools have outperformed their
peers in community schools. Data from 2004 indicates
that 10th graders in institutional schools performed
significantly better than their peers in community
schools in math, Nepali, and English in both urban and
rural areas (figure 7). Students in urban institutional
schools also outperformed their peers in rural
institutional schools. Similar findings are seen in
performance data for other years and across school
grades.

        government grants for other teaching staff and
        operating costs. These are referred to as “aided

        community schools still receive grants for
        temporary teachers and other operating costs,
        but do not have official permanent teachers and
        are referred to as “unaided community schools.”
   2. Some community schools (about one-third) have
        been formally devolved to local communities
        and are referred to as “community-managed
        schools.” All community-managed schools are
        aided. Other schools that have not been formally

        schools” regardless of whether they are aided or

Religious schools. These schools are affiliated with a
religion and include gurukuls (Hindu), gumbas
(Buddhist), and madrassas (Islam). Since 2008, the
government has implemented a policy of mainstreaming
such schools, whereby religious schools are eligible to
receive grants for following the national curricula and
using nationally approved textbooks.

Other non-classified schools. There is an additional type
of school in Nepal known as public trust schools. These
are not-for-profit schools that are owned and managed
by a public board of trustees with Ministry of Education
representation. They are considered institutional schools
in Nepal, but they do not fit the SABER-EPS “independent
private school” classification because of government
financing and management oversight. They are eligible

         The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
         initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
         systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
         associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
         with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
         teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
         accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
         their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
         all children and youth learn.

         This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of engaging
         the private sector in education.
