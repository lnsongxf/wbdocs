THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

                    the registration fees, but also made it more difficult by
DB2015              introducing a requirement to file a declaration before the
                    commencement of business operations. These changes apply
                    to both Delhi and Mumbai.

India is a set of specific procedures—the bureaucratic
and legal steps that an entrepreneur must complete
to incorporate and register a new firm. These are              Legal form: Private Limited Company
identified by Doing Business through collaboration
with relevant local professionals and the study of             Paid in minimum capital requirement: INR
laws, regulations and publicly available information           100,000
on business entry in that economy. Following is a              City: Mumbai, Delhi
detailed summary of those procedures, along with
the associated time and cost. These procedures are             Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
those that apply to a company matching the
standard assumptions (the “standardized company”)
used by Doing Business in collecting the data (see the
section in this chapter on what the indicators
measure).

       Obtain director identification number (DIN) online

       By a notification dated 27 March, 2011, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
       (MCA) has revised the process for obtaining a Director Identification
       Number (DIN). The process for obtaining DIN is as follows:
       1) Downloading and completing e-Form DIN-1. This form has to be
       submitted along with a photograph of the applicant and a scanned
       copy of supporting documents.
       2) Scanning the supporting documents. These include an Affidavit
       containing the applicant's name, middle name and date of birth. In
       addition, proof of address (not older than 2 months from the date of
       filing of form DIN-1) and proof of identify (a copy of the applicant's
       Income Tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card and passport)
       must be filed. The Affidavit has to be executed on non-judicial stamp
   1   paper and must be duly notarized.                                             1 day           INR 100
       3) The e-Form must be digitally signed by a practicing professional (i.e.
       Chartered Accountant/ Company Secretary/Cost and Works
       Accountant) or the Company Secretary in full time employment of the
       company. By doing so, the practicing professional verifies the
       particulars of the applicant as mentioned in the application form.
       4) After the certification of a practicing professional, the applicant
       submits the completed application to the MCA website and obtains a
       DIN-1 number.

      Obtain a digital signature certificate

      To use the new electronic filing system under MCA 21, the applicant
      must obtain a Class-II Digital Signature Certificate from a certification
      agency authorized by the Controller of Certification Agencies. These
      include private agencies like NIC, E-Mudhra, MTNL Trust line, to which
      company directors submit the prescribed application form along with
      notarized proof of identity and address.

      A Class-II Digital Signature Certificate can be obtained for either a
      period of 1 year or a period of 2 years, and then needs to be renewed
      for another 1 or 2 years upon payment of renewal fees. Each agency                      INR 400 to INR
2     has its own fee structure, ranging from INR 400 to INR 2650. The cost         1 day
                                                                                                  2,650
      will vary in accordance with the duration of the Digital Signature
      Certificate. Once the Digital Signature Certificate is obtained, the
      authorized personnel (directors/manager/secretary) are required to
      register the same with MCA for statutory e-filing. This process is to be
      done online with MCA after the DIN has been obtained.

      Reserve the company name with the Registrar of Companies (ROC)
      online

      The guidelines briefly list out the conditions and norms that must be
      fulfilled while a name is selected for a company. Names that are
      offensive or are similar to already existing names would not be
      registered. The Name Availability Guidelines prescribe a time period of
      one to two days for registering the name of a company, however, due
      to the large number of applications received, typically this process takes
      up to 3 days, and is as follows:

3     1. Check availability of the proposed name by checking on the MCA21           2 days       INR 1,000
      portal for other companies or LLPs having similar names. Alternatively,
      engage a professional (practicing chartered accountant, company
      secretary or cost accountant) to perform the check on the MCA 21
      portal and provide a search report which can be attached to the
      application.
      2. Prepare the application in eForm 1A with all relevant details and
      declarations. If a professional has been engaged to check availability of
      name, have the professional certify and digitally sign the eForm 1A.
      3. Upload the eForm 1A to the MCA 21 portal and pay fees of INR 1000
      electronically (net banking or credit card).
      4. If the e-Form 1A has been certified by a professional (as described

      above), the proposed name shall be approved by the Registrar of
      Companies on a priority basis via the Straight Through Process ("STP"),
      provided the name is not similar to any existing trademark, any of the
      words proposed in the company's name does not exactly match any
      existing company's name and the name does not consist of a single
      word (other than private limited).
      5. The name, if made available to the applicant, will be reserved for the
      applicant to use for 60 days from the date of approval. If the proposed
      company is not incorporated during this 60 day period, the approval
      will lapse and the name will be available to other applicants.

      This is in accordance with the Name Availability Guidelines 2011,

      Pay stamp duties online, file all incorporation forms and
      documents online and obtain the certificate of incorporation



      As of January 1, 2010 it has been made compulsory to pay all stamp
      duties on incorporation documents online through the Ministry of
      Corporate Affairs (MCA) website. As a result of these reforms, the mode
      of payment of stamp duty through affixation of adhesive stamps on
      Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association has been
      replaced by the e-payment of applicable stamp duty on Articles and
      Memorandum of association through MCA portal. The reforms also
      provide that the documents on which e-stamping has been done, need
      not to be filed physically: electronic filing of the same would be
      sufficient.

      For registration, e-forms 1, 18 and 32 are required to be electronically
4     filed on the website of the Ministry of Company Affairs. In addition,     5 days on average   see comments
      scanned copies of the signed Memorandum and Articles of Association,
      must be attached to e-Form 1. Proof of location Registered Office in the
      Form of Lease Deed must be attached to e-Form 18. The 3 forms as well
      as the memorandum and articles of association must be certified by a
      practicing professional for accuracy of the information/declarations. The
      certificate of incorporation is immediately issued by the Registrar of
      Companies, signed digitally and sent via email to the Company.

      The Employee’s individual insurance is a separate process and occurs
      after Employer’s registration. The Employer is responsible for
      submitting the required Declaration Form and employees are
      responsible for providing correct information to the employer. The
      employee temporary cards (ESI Cards) are issued on the spot by the
      local offices in many places. The temporary cards are valid for 13 weeks
      from the date of appointment of the employees. It takes about 4 to 5
      weeks to get a permanent ESI card. In order to insure that all the
      insured persons receive their identity cards to enable them to receive
      cash and medical benefit, the identity cards will be delivered to the
      insured persons directly by the ESI Corporation rather than through the
      employers.

      The ESI Act applies to all establishments employing 20 or more persons.
      The ESI Act provides for sickness benefits, medical relief, maternity
      benefits for women workers, compensation for fatal and other
      employment injuries, etc. Every employee who receives wages up to INR
      25,000 per month is covered by this Act. Employers can now submit
      application online for registration under ESI Act on the ESIC website
      (www.esic.in).

      to UTI Investor Services Ltd, which was authorized to set up and

      Tax office. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) has also
      launched PAN operations effective June 2004, setting up TIN Facilitation
      Centers. The PAN application is made through the above mentioned
      service centers on Form 49A, with a certified copy of the certificate of
      registration, issued by the Registrar of Companies, along with proof of
      company address and personal identity. A fee of INR 93 (plus applicable
      taxes currently at 12.36%) applies for processing the PAN application.
      IT PAN Service Centers or TIN Facilitation Centers will supply PAN
      application forms (Form 49A), assist the applicant in filling up the form,
      collect filled form and issue acknowledgement slip. After obtaining PAN
      from the Income Tax department, UTIISL or NSDL as the case may be,
      will print the PAN card and deliver it to the applicant. The application
      for PAN can also be made online but the documents still need to be
      physically dropped off for verification with the authorized agent. For

       BuildCo submits application form with plans and all required
       documents, as prescribed by Section 337 of the BMC Act, at the
       Andhuri Building Proposal Office of the BMC. If all documents are in
       order and the file is complete, BuildCo can proceed to pay the scrutiny
       fees in the same building by cash or bank draft.

       Once the fees have been paid, the application file is forwarded to the
       concerned officer in the Building Proposal Office. Then the file is
       forwarded to the Survey Office, which will remark on the application file

      Obtain Intimation of Disapproval and pay fees

      After the site inspection, the application file returns to the Building
      Proposal Office to receive an intimation of disapproval (authorization).
      The concerned Sub Engineer reviews the proposal and forwards the
      report to the Assistant Engineer and Executive Engineer. The proposal is
      approved at the Executive Engineer’s level if no concessions are
      involved. There are 3 executive engineers in the main Municipal
      Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) office and 2 in the Andhuri
      office (the latter is the office considered for the purposes of this study).

      Complete applications that do not require concessions (i.e. claiming of
      areas free of FSI as per provision in DCR 1991, deficiency in open
      spaces etc.) can be approved within a week. However, the majority of
      applications require some concessions and further scrutiny so they
      must be forwarded to the competent authorities. This latter process
      may take 30 -- 90 days to complete.

      The intimation of disapproval is issued with a list of NOC’s which the
      applicant must obtain separately from various departments and
      government authorities. Final clearance to build will only be given once
      BuildCo obtains all NOC’s. The NOC’s assigned to the intimation of
      disapproval are case specific. For the purpose of this study, Doing
3     Business has determined 7 basic NOC’s that are required of almost all          29 days      INR 996,260

      • Sewerage Department
      • Hydraulic Department
      • Environmental Department (concerned with debris management)
      • Traffic and Coordination Department
      • CFO (fire clearance)

      BuildCo’s architect must take the Intimation of Disapproval and the
      design plans to each clearance office separately. NOCs can be applied
      for simultaneously, but NOC offices are spread out so the submission
      for these 7 NOC’s is likely to take some time.

      The cost for this procedure is INR 66 per square meter for commercial
      buildings + development charges of INR 700 per square meter for
      commercial buildings

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
