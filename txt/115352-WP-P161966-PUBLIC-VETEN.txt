What is the Lagging Regions Initiative
The scope of the EU Cohesion Policy is to narrow development gaps and reduce disparities between Member
Countries and regions. To this extent, around €454 billion of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds
have been allocated to help EU regions become more competitive. However, not all EU regions have been able
to fully take advantage of the benefits of EU growth, due to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis and due to
a host of structural problems.

To this end, Corina Crețu, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, together with the Task Force for Better
Implementation has started the Lagging Regions Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to identify what holds
back growth in less developed regions, and to provide targeted actions for unlocking their growth potential.
Thus, these lagging regions will be assisted to involve a broad range of stakeholders (regional and local
administrations, educational institutions, business support institutions, SMEs, entrepreneurs, investors, NGOs,
IFIs) to help respond to concrete needs they have and to maximize the impact of regional investments. Two
types of lagging regions have been identified:

•	   LOW GROWTH REGIONS, which cover the less developed and transition regions that did not converge to
     the EU average between the years 2000 and 2013 in Member States with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below
     the EU average in 2013. These include almost all the less developed and transition regions in Greece, Italy,
     Spain and Portugal

•	   LOW INCOME REGIONS, covering all the regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average
     in 2013. This group covers the less developed regions of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Poland and Romania are the first countries to pilot this initiative, with two regions each – Swietokrzyskie and
Podkarpackie in Poland, and North-West and North-East in Romania. In April 2016, Commissioner Crețu together
with Marshal Adam Jarubas in Swietokrzyskie and Marshal Wladyslaw Ortyl in Podkarpackie have officially
launched the Polish part of the Lagging Regions Initiative called „Catching-up Regions Poland”. The „Catching-
up Regions Poland” is an implementation-focused program that aims at providing tailored support to the two
Polish regions to boost the impact of EU and private investments in specific areas selected by the two regions.

Over a year of joint work, the World Bank provided hands-on technical assistance and helped coordinate five
activities that were selected by the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions in coordination with the European
Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and the Bank. The five selected activities were:

•	   Improving the commercialization of Research & Development (R&D) results generated by public research
     facilities and enabling better utilization of existing technology transfer centers in the Podkarpackie region.

•	   Strengthening the vocational education and training system in the Swietokrzyskie region, using best practice
     examples from around the world and tailoring them to the regional context.

•	   Activating entrepreneurship in deprived areas in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions.

•	   Identifying ways to improve conditions for starting a business in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie
     regions.

•	   Supporting the creation of in-house financial instruments in the Podkarpackie region.

6   WORK-BASED LEARNING IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE ŚWIĘTOKRZYSKIE VOIVODSHIP
Overview

This Report has been prepared as part of the pilot project of the European Commission titled: Catching-up
Regions Initiative, implemented in 2016-2017 in selected regions of two European Union states, i.e. Poland and
Romania. In Poland, the pilot project included Świętokrzyskie and Podkarpackie regions.1


The initiative objective is the identification of economic growth restrains in lagging regions of Europe and –
on that basis – provision of advisory assistance consisting of individualised activities (specific for each region),
contributing to the reduction of those restrains to improve conditions for investment and economic growth.
The scope of advisory activities was determined with participation of the European Commission, regional and
central government (in Poland: Marshal Offices of both regions and the Ministry of Economic Development)
and the World Bank which also played the role of an entity implementing advisory services.


One of the intervention areas, agreed for the action plan for Podkarpackie, were matters related to the development
of regional mechanism of supporting micro, small and medium enterprises in accessing financing (Task no. 4).
The subject of advisory services performed by the World Bank experts specifically concerned management of
funds allocated in the region under the Regional Operational Programme for 2007-2013 (Podkarpackie ROP
2007-2013) to financial engineering instruments, subject to return following project implementation by financial
intermediaries (approximately PLN 135 million). The objective was, therefore, to develop a strategy for this and to
choose organisational form and to design operational model of re-engagement of funds, also considering the
next programming perspective of EU aid (European Structural and Investment Funds) for 2014-2020, which also
includes support of financial instruments.


As part of advisory services, activities leading to incorporation of a limited liability company in Podkarpackie have
been taken already. The company is to be called Podkarpacki Fundusz Rozwoju [Podkarpacki Development
Fund - PDF]2 and it will take over tasks related to the organisation and management of financial instruments
based on funds returned from Podkarpackie ROP 2007-2013 financial instruments and (like in the past) other
financing sources.


This document constitutes final report on advisory services performed from November 2016 to March 2017 in
the scope described above.

      Strengthening the Implemention of WORK-BASED LEARNING IN
      VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING in the
      Świętokrzyskie Voivodship




       A                         Introduction




                                   Global context
                                 Worldwide, Vocational Education and Training (VET) is receiving increasing
                                 attention, particularly as a potentially useful instrument to address high
                                 unemployment rates among youth. By improving the employment and earnings
                                 potential of VET graduates, and addressing skill constraints of enterprises, VET is a
                                 possible means to improve the alignment of skill supply with demand.

                                 Across countries, there are substantial differences in the way that VET systems
                                 are designed, the share of students that are enrolled in VET compared to those
                                 that participate in general education, and the extent to which VET succeeds
                                 in preparing graduates for productive careers. For example, the percentage of
                                 upper-secondary level students in VET programs varies from 25% in Hungary, 31% in
                                 Greece, and 34% in Spain, to 70% in Austria and 73% in the Czech Republic. Enrollment
                                 in Poland is between these extremes and in 2014 was 49% (Eurostat, 2016).

                                 Despite the substantial differences across countries in the design, scope
                                 and performance of VET systems, one concept that appears to be broadly
                                 accepted are the benefits of ensuring that students gain practical work
                                 experience during their training. Through Work-Based Learning (WBL), students
                                 develop essential skills by participating in activities on enterprise premises, including on-
                                 site training and particularly contributing to business operations. When implemented
                                 effectively, the technical skills that students acquire are better aligned with actual
                                 labour market demand than those that are gained through other learning methods,
                                 such as classroom teaching or training in venues that aim to simulate work situations. In
                                 addition, it is assumed that the ‘real work-floor experience’ of WBL equips students with
                                 essential non-technicalskills (such as the ability to work in teams, problem solving, and
                                 communication) to an extent that is not achieved through other learning approaches.3

                                 Various countries, particularly in Europe, have well-established VET systems
                                 that historically emphasize integrating WBL in training provision. In addition
3
  There is not yet a globally agreed definition and grouping of skills. For the purpose of this report, we define ‘non-technical skills’ as socio-
emotional and higher-order cognitive skills that transcend the skill needs of a particular occupation, such as those related to communication,
team work, and problem solving.

8    WORK-BASED LEARNING IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE ŚWIĘTOKRZYSKIE VOIVODSHIP
to countries such as Austria and Switzerland, this includes particularly Germany, where
the approach to apprenticeships is considered to be so successful that effective WBL
implementation is colloquially referred to as ‘the German model’. In Germany, in 2014,
87% of students in upper-secondary VET engage in apprenticeships, compared to
the EU average of 34%. The employment rate of recent VET graduates in Germany
is substantially higher than the EU average, i.e. 90% compared to 77%, respectively, in
2015 (CEDEFOP, 2017).

The relatively sound labour market performance of graduates from VET systems
which integrate strong WBL elements, has resulted in a desire to emulate the
approach elsewhere. The European Commission, for example, has highlighted
the need to strengthen linkages between VET and the labour market in country
specific recommendations, and has developed a set of practical recommendations
for Member States on the implementation of WBL (European Commission, 2013).
The European Alliance for Apprenticeships (EAfA), a platform bringing together
governments, business, social partners, VET providers, and other stakeholders, aims
to strengthen cooperation in the field of WBL at the European Union level. Outside
of Europe, Singapore and South Korea are examples of countries which have also
successfully introduced strong WBL elements in their VET provision. However, in other
countries, especially those where traditional VET provision is largely school-based or
where the private sector is weak and unorganized, efforts to strengthen WBL in VET
are not always immediately successful. In quite a few cases, stakeholders struggle
to translate intent into concrete actions that result in the strengthening of WBL, and
subsequently, improved employment outcomes of VET graduates.




    Poland’s context and the Catching-Up
    Regions Initiative’s to strengthen WBL in
    Świętokrzyskie
Whereas basic vocational schools in Poland offer programs with a considerable
WBL component, training provision in upper-secondary level technical
schools remains largely school-based. Less than 8% of Polish students engage
in in-firm activities beyond the obligatory four weeks that students are required
by education regulations to spend in firms throughout their training program. In
Swietokrzyskie, this share is lower still, at 4.3%. Nearly 8% of students in the region
do not meet the regulatory minimum requirement of participating in a four week
traineeship at employers’ premises.

In 2016, the World Bank started providing technical assistance to the self-
government of Poland’s Świętokrzyskie region, aimed at strengthening the
implementation of WBL in technical schools. This support was part of a formal
programme of collaboration between the Government of Poland, two regional self-
governments, the European Commission (EC), and the World Bank, with the aim to
improve the impact of EU financing allocated to improve innovation, employment, and
economic growth in catching-up regions in Poland.4 The two regions, Świętokrzyskie
and Podkarpackie, participated in the program since structural challenges to economic
and employment growth substantially impede their potential to converge toward

 The Poland Catching-up Regions Initiative was part of a more extensive “Lagging Regions” project launched by the EC’s DG REGIO,
composed of theoretic and practical strands.
                                                                                                             A - Introduction      9
                       European levels. As part of this programme, the World Bank provided technical
                       assistance to the regional governments on a number of priority areas as proposed
                       by the regions. In the Świętokrzyskie region, the regional government selected the
                       strengthening of the implementation of WBL in VET as one of the priority areas.

                       This report summarizes the main activities, findings, and outcomes of
                       the collaboration to strengthen WBL in VET in Świętokrzyskie. During the
                       implementation of the programme, which took place during a ten-month period
                       between May 2016 and March 2017, the World Bank worked closely with the regional
                       self-government, as well as the national government, the European Commission,
                       and other stakeholders, to pave the way for further interventions that will structurally
                       increase the incidence and effectiveness of WBL, including those that will be financed
                       from EU funds. This report summarizes the applied approach; the main findings from
                       the analysis of strengths and weaknesses for WBL implementation in Świętokrzyskie
                       and of international approaches to address key challenges; and the pilot project to
                       strengthen WBL implementation that was designed based on these findings.

                       in Świętokrzyskie:
                       Approach




                       The approach taken to strengthen WBL implementation in Świętokrzyskie
                       consisted of four phases, of which three were supported by the Catching-Up
                       Regions Initiative. The first phase comprised the identification of the main strengths
                       and challenges to effective WBL implementation in Świętokrzyskie – and to an extent
                       in Poland as a whole. The second phase included a review of practices applied in
                       other countries to address the main challenges that were identified in the preceding
                       analysis, and an assessment of the replicability of these practices in in Świętokrzyskie.
                       During the third phase, a program to pilot interventions to strengthen WBL was
                       designed, and approved to benefit from EC funding. The final phase, implementation
                       of the pilot project, is expected to take place during the period of 2017-2020. The
                       phases of the approach are illustrated in Figure 1 and further described, below.

The analysis of strengths and weaknesses of WBL in Świętokrzyskie was based
on the 2015 European Commission’s publication ‘20 guiding principles of high-
performing apprenticeships and work-based learning’.5 The analysis included
desk reviews of relevant regulations and literature, as well as extensive consultations
with key stakeholders, including representatives of VET providers, firms, and local,
regional, and national government officials. This effort resulted in the identification
of six ‘key dimensions’ that pose a significant challenge to WBL implementation in
Świętokrzyskie, as follows:
1. An appropriate governance and financing framework;
2. Effective mechanisms for stakeholder consultation and coordination;
3. Adequate incentives and capacity of VET providers;
4. Adequate incentives and capacity of firms;
5. Quality assurance (QA) mechanisms for WBL;
6.A facilitating role for Centers for Practical Training (CPT).

The review of international WBL practices focused on policies and
interventions that address the key dimensions that were identified as main
challenges in the region. The analysis of international practices was based on desk
reviews and supplemented by a stakeholder study visit to Latvia.6 In collaboration with
regional stakeholders, the relevant practices were subsequently reviewed in terms of
replicability in the Polish, and particularly the Świętokrzyskie, context.

The design of interventions to strengthen WBL in Świętokrzyskie culminated
in the preparation of a pilot project proposal that is expected to receive
financing through the European Social Fund (ESF). The project was developed
following intensive consultations with national and regional stakeholders, and based
on the preceding analyses of key regional challenges and international practices. It is

 Latvia was selected for a study visit since it recently started implementing a comprehensive set of interventions to transition from a VET
system that is mostly school-based to one that incorporates strong elements of WBL.

                                  In 2015, the European Commission published guidance on the main aspects
                                  that influence the effective delivery of WBL.7 The ‘20 guiding principles’
                                  identified in this report (summarized in Textbox 1) are clustered in four categories
                                  relating to mechanisms for governance and engagement of social partners; support
                                  for companies; the attractiveness of WBL and career guidance for students; and
                                  quality assurance in WBL.

The initial ‘20 principles’, combined with a review of relevant policy
documentation and intensive stakeholder consultations, were used to
identify the priority dimensions that need to be addressed to strengthen WBL
implementation in upper-secondary VET in Świętokrzyskie. Key considerations
that informed the identification of the regional priorities were the following:

       • Ensuring focus by prioritizing among the ‘20 principles’: criteria applied to
         prioritize among the dimensions included:
                - A focus on dimensions that are directly and exclusively related to WBL,
                 such as the legal framework for WBL provision and support to firms for
                 WBL implementation;8
                - A focus on dimensions that are structurally impeding overall WBL
                 implementation.

       • Adding relevant priorities: an important impediment to WBL implementation
         in Świętokrzyskie that was absent from the original ‘20 principles’ relates to
         weak incentives and capacity of both VET providers and CPTs. This aspect was
         thus added as a key priority for the region.
8
  Largely due to the scope of the assistance that was provided under the Catching-Up Regions Initiative, this approach excluded a focus on
aspects such as education pathways and career guidance, since these are dimensions that determine the quality of VET provision in general,
and are not exclusively related to WBL.

                                The resulting dimensions that were determined to be key priorities in Świętokrzyskie
                                are the following:


                                Six Priority Dimensions
                                for Strengthening WBL in Świętokrzyskie:


                                Combined, the six dimensions result in a strong focus on facilitating key
                                stakeholders by providing them with the appropriate incentives and capacity
                                to effectively implement WBL. The requirements for each of these dimensions to
                                contribute appropriately to effective WBL implementation are as follows:




  1        An appropriate governance and financing framework
           •	   The regulatory framework guiding WBL is clear and prescribes sufficiently high minimum criteria for the incidence and
                duration of WBL, while providing adequate flexibility to providers and firms to implement context-appropriate solutions;
           •	   Monitoring, accountability, and financing mechanisms facilitate effective implementation of WBL.




  2        Effective mechanisms for stakeholder consultation and coordination
           •	   Regional and/or local stakeholder platforms with a broad range of participants to provide strategic directions and identify
                and address key constraints to WBL implementation, with a focus on strengthening collaboration between VET providers
                and enterprises;
           •	   Stakeholders coordinate and collaborate to ensure that effective support mechanisms exist to address key constraints of
                individual stakeholders to engage effectively in WBL.9




  3        Adequate incentives and capacity of VET providers
           •	   VET providers have sufficient incentives to transition from school-based VET provision to an increasingly WBL-based VET system;
           •	   VET providers have the technical and financial capacity to increase the incidence, duration, and quality of WBL;




  4        Adequate incentives and capacity of firms
           •	   Firms are aware of the direct and longer term benefits of WBL provision;
           •	   Firms have the capacity to engage in WBL in a manner that maximizes direct firm benefits, and minimizes the costs
                associated with WBL provision;
           •	   Firms receive appropriate financial incentives and technical assistance to facilitate the provision of high-quality WBL.




  5        Quality assurance mechanisms for WBL
           •	   The achievement of appropriate learning outcomes is assured through clear and effective QA mechanisms, within which
                the division of responsibilities between VET providers, firms, and students is clearly delineated.




  6        A facilitating role for Centers for Practical Training
           •	   Training provided in CPT is responsive to skill demand, facilitates (rather than competes with) WBL provided in firms, and
                simulates the working environment to the extent possible.




9
  These support mechanisms would, principally, address key constraints related to the other key dimensions for effective WBL implementation,
especially those related to incentives and capacity of firms and VET providers, and quality assurance.

For each of the key dimensions, specific challenges were identified that
constrain effective WBL implementation in Świętokrzyskie. In some cases,
these challenges apply nationally, particularly where they relate to constraints related
to the national-level regulatory, governance, and financing framework. These key
challenges are summarized in Table 1, below.

 Focus area                       Key challenges

                                 •	   Low minimum requirements for the duration of in-firm learning
                                 •	   Elements of regulations related to WBL are ambiguous
     Appropriate governance      •	   Accountability mechanisms do not explicitly promote WBL
 1   and financing framework     •	   Financing mechanisms are not effective in providing incentives for WBL
                                 •	   The regulatory environment is unstable and not strongly reinforced by measures that facilitate
                                      its implementation

                                 •	   A structural mechanism for effective coordination and collaboration among a wider range of
                                      stakeholders remains to emerge (existing coordination and collaboration is mostly limited to
     Effective mechanisms for         partnerships between an individual VET provider and enterprise);
 2   stakeholder consultation
                                 •	   Stakeholders lack incentives, capacity, and financing to engage in WBL;
     and coordination
                                 •	   No “WBL champion” has yet emerged to facilitate the establishment of effective consultation
                                      and collaboration mechanisms.

                                 •	   VET providers lack the technical capacity, tools, and human resources to engage in effective
                                      WBL implementation.
                                 •	   VET providers have concerns about the quality of training that can, at this stage, be provided
     Adequate incentives and          through WBL.
 3   capacity of VET providers   •	   Schools have incentives to provide practical training through Centers for Practical Training,
                                      rather than in firms.
                                 •	   Reform resistance is exacerbated by concerns about the impact of increased WBL on the
                                      demand for teaching staff and teachers’ skills.

                                 •	   Costs associated with engaging in WBL tend to be high, and actual and perceived benefits
                                      tend to be low.
                                 •	   Costs are relatively high, since firms tend to lack the capacity and tools to efficiently engage in WBL.
                                 •	   Functional mechanisms to provide financial compensation to firms are largely absent.
     Adequate incentives and     •	   Firms do not reap direct benefits from WBL, since students tend not to contribute to
 4   capacity of firms                production processes.
                                 •	   Employers do not take into account all potential medium and long-term benefits of WBL.
                                 •	   WBL engagement tends to be insufficiently marketed to have a notable impact on a firm’s image.
                                 •	   Enterprises do not necessarily consider VET providers as sound partners.



                                 •	   The current QA system for VET does not yet incorporate key recognized good practices to

                                 facing Świętokrzyskie were identified and reviewed.10 Subsequently, the
                                 extent to which these international approaches could serve as useful examples for
                                 strengthening WBL in Świętokrzyskie was examined. A summary of this analysis is
                                 presented below.

                                 Stakeholder collaboration and coordination mechanisms can be organized in
                                 different ways, taking into account several dimensions such as territorial, sectorial,
                                 and organizational considerations. Examples of coordination and collaboration
                                 mechanisms include Apprenticeship Offices in Austria, and Local Training Committees
                                 in Denmark. The Austrian Apprenticeship Offices are located in the regional
                                 Economic Chambers, and are the main contact point for companies for questions
                                 and information related to apprenticeships. The Danish Local Training Committees
                                 comprise representatives of actors with a stake in demand-responsive VET provision,
                                 and among others work to ensure suitable WBL placements for students.

                                 In Świętokrzyskie, a ‘critical mass’ of key stakeholders appears to have
                                 increased their interest in WBL implementation as a result of the recent
                                 engagements in WBL under the Catching-Up Regions Initiative, and would
                                 benefit from coordination and collaboration mechanisms. These stakeholders
                                 include VET providers and enterprises, as well as the regional and several local
                                 governments. While capacity to implement WBL is still rather low (which reinforces

   Considering the regional focus of the Catching-Up Regions Initiative, the review of international approaches focused on interventions that
can be taken at the regional level; a review of approaches to strengthen the national-level regulatory, governance, and financing framework
was hence not included in this exercise. The review did not include an in-depth review of national practices. Considering the strong WBL
elements incorporated in basic vocational education in Poland, a review of the determinant of successful WBL implementation in this VET
segment could provide useful insights, in addition to those generated by the review of international practices.

the need for strong coordination and collaboration mechanisms), this development
implies that there are stakeholders willing to actively engage in coordination and
collaboration activities.

An effective entity that will lead WBL coordination in Świętokrzyskie is unlikely
to emerge unless constraints related to incentives, capacity, and financing are
addressed simultaneously. International practices highlight that strong institutional
structures to support individual VET providers and firms are essential to ensure WBL
implementation. This is also assumed to be the case in Świętokrzyskie. However,
while first steps have been made to pave the way for stakeholder coordination (e.g.
through the VET cluster under the Special Economic Zone, or by the Regional Center
for Teacher Development), there are scant signs that a ‘champion entity’ is already
emerging to lead WBL coordination activities.




 Adequate incentives and capacity of
 VET providers
Analyses carried out by the European Training Foundation (ETF) in a number
of countries which made efforts to make the transition from largely school-
based to increasingly firm-based training provision, underline a few
critical elements that facilitate the process. While these elements relate to all
stakeholders involved in promoting and implementing WBL, they are particularly
relevant for effectively engaging VET providers. They include, among others, the need
to involve all key stakeholders and ensure that they share the same vision; avoiding
competition between the new approach and existing approaches to WBL or other
forms of practical learning (such as, in the case of Poland, practical training provision
in CPTs); starting with pilot programmes and ensuring that lessons learned can be
incorporated in subsequent activities; investing substantial efforts in developing tools
and building stakeholder capacity; and actively marketing and communicating the
new approach to all key stakeholders.

In Świętokrzyskie, good practices related to stakeholder engagement and
communication, producing tools and building capacity, and upgrading teacher
competencies can be introduced at the regional level without the need for
national-level reforms. Some WBL pilots are already taking place in Świętokrzyskie
(and in other parts of Poland), and a worthwhile start could be to generate and
disseminate their lessons learned to a broader audience. While the challenge of
competing approaches and incentives for practical learning cannot be addressed
at the regional level alone, as they are likely to require national-level reforms, there
appear to be no insurmountable barriers to initiating regional or local initiatives to
implement the other identified good practices. What this does require, however, is a
champion and a critical mass of stakeholders to manage and engage in collaboration
and coordination activities (see also above), as well as sufficient financing and technical
capacity to develop tools, provide capacity building activities, and develop processes
such as for in-firm training of teachers. Concerning financing, whereas currently EU
financing can be applied to fund the proposed activities, this is not a permanent
source of funding, and an alternative and sustainable financing mechanism (possibly
through a mix of public and private sector contributions) would eventually need to be
identified to ensure a consistent service provision.
                                                     D - International Approaches to Strengthening WBL   17
                         Adequate incentives and
                         capacity of firms
                       Across Europe, a plethora of varied initiatives are being implemented to
                       incentivize and support firms in offering sound WBL. Each of the mechanisms
                       aim to address constraints that also apply to firms in Świętokrzyskie. Examples include
                       voluntary sectoral training funds that provide compensation to firms participating in WBL
                       in Austria; training officers providing advice and support to firms who receive students
                       in Norway; and a website for in-company trainers in Germany; and the presentation of
                       awards to firms with special achievements in apprenticeship training in Austria.

                       In Świętokrzyskie, firms’ constraints related to incentives and capacity would
                       ideally be addressed simultaneously, since they are reinforcing determinants
                       of WBL provision. On the one hand, weak capacity increases the costs of WBL
                       provision, which reduces firms’ incentives to engage in WBL. On the other hand,
                       lacking incentives for WBL provision reduces the motivation of enterprises to build
                       knowledge and capacity for its provision.

                       In the short term, funding schemes that are initiated, managed, and financed
                       by the private sector are unlikely to emerge in the region, and hence public
                       or external financing could be considered. Considering the low degree of
                       organization of the private sector, combined with little confidence in the possibility to
                       implement WBL effectively, the establishment of a financing scheme for WBL is likely
                       to require engagement and funding from other stakeholders, especially government
                       actors. Once trust in the WBL approach increases, and ideally collaboration among
                       firms strengthens, both the appetite and ability of the private sector to manage and
                       sustainably finance WBL can be expected to increase.

                       With numerous examples of mechanisms to support firms in WBL
                       implementation available, a pragmatic approach to identifying schemes that
                       are workable within the Świętokrzyskie context, may be advisable. Considering
                       the weak capacity and financial constraints among all stakeholders, the region might
                       want to opt for approaches that require relatively limited efforts and resources. For
                       example, developing guidance material for WBL implementation and training of
                       workplace instructors, and ensuring their online dissemination, may be a more feasible
                       approach than aiming to establish an extensive and costly network of apprenticeship
                       liaisons. Rewarding firms with strong WBL performance through awards ceremonies
                       could be considered a cost-effective and relatively easy-to-implement approach to
                       generating publicity and to incentivizing firms to increase their engagement in WBL.




                         Quality assurance (QA)
                         mechanisms for WBL
                       International practices highlight that the quality of WBL provision should
                       be taken into account from the moment when firms are considered for
                       WBL provision, until the final examination of VET graduates. In particular, QA


18   WORK-BASED LEARNING IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE ŚWIĘTOKRZYSKIE VOIVODSHIP
considerations come into play when identifying firms for WBL provision; assuring the
competences of in-firm tutors and trainers and a sound organization of WBL in firms;
identifying learning outcomes incorporated in the curriculum that should be achieved
through WBL, as well as assessing these learning outcomes and ensuring that they
are adequately covered in (final) examinations.

Examples of QA and quality improvement measures applied in EU member
states with strong WBL systems include a range of both internal and externally
executed measures, such as the screening of firms before they engage in
WBL; self-evaluation tools for firms; clear training plans; student education
portfolios; and WBL monitoring mechanisms that help direct support to firms
who most need it. Specific examples include, among others, formal firm screening
and accreditation processes in Belgium; the provision of tools to allow the self-
evaluationof firms in Switzerland; the mandatory inclusion of a clear training plan in
WBL contracts in Norway; and the development of a ‘personal education portfolio’
by students in Denmark.

In Świętokrzyskie, considering the absence of effective oversight and support
mechanisms for quality assuance and improvement in WBL, in addition to
weaknesses in the overall QA mechanism for VET, an approach that “starts
small and expands gradually” appears appropriate. For example, while external
QA measures such as through a formal accreditation mechanism for firms that engage
in WBL may eventually be appropriate, there is currently no credible institution that
could ensure its implementation, and it might deter firms’ willingness to participate in
WBL. Similarly, establishing an elaborate WBL support system where ‘WBL-advisors’
provide relatively intensive tailor-made support to individual firms, may be unfeasible
in the short term, given (among others) the financial constraints facing the VET sector.
Options that appear more feasible are those that require relatively limited resources
and institutional capacity. This could include, for example, the development and
online dissemination of tools and templates, including for (self-)evaluation of firm
readiness to provide WBL, preparing WBL training plans, and guiding students in the
preparation of education portfolios.




 A facilitating role for Centers for
 Practical Training (CPT)
Internationally, there are few examples of institutions like the Polish CPTs,
which are public entities providing almost exclusively practical training, and
that are not fully integrated in individual VET schools. If not through actual work-
floor learning, most practical training options are either an integrated part of individual
VET schools, or operated by the private sector. A well-developed system of ‘shadow
apprenticeships’ exists in Austria for students who cannot find regular apprenticeships.
In this set-up, a government-run workshop mimics the employer, e.g. by operating
quasi-commercially as a restaurant or a furniture production company. This is used
to provide apprenticeships to those who cannot find regular apprenticeships. Private
sector initiative include large companies, such as Siemens in Germany, which have
workshops separate from actual production facilities where novice apprentices


                                                     D - International Approaches to Strengthening WBL   19
                       receive initial training. In some industry sectors in Switzerland, firms jointly own and
                       run a workshop to provide either basic skills needed by all apprentices in the sector,
                       for novices; or specialist skills needed by apprentices but not available in the individual
                       training company. Such a model can be particularly useful to tackle the challenges of
                       apprenticeships in SMEs.

                       In many countries, entities that aim to address a lack of appropriate WBL
                       placements in enterprises tend to focus on promoting firm collaboration and
                       supporting students in finding placements, sometimes complemented by
                       practical training provision outside of firms. In Germany and Austria, in case one
                       firm is unable to ensure that a WBL-student achieves all necessary learning outcomes,
                       initiatives exist to promote collaboration between this firm and other enterprises or
                       with training providers. In Denmark, Centers of Placement, in addition to supporting
                       students in identifying WBL places in firms, provide practical learning to students for
                       whom in-firm placements were not available.

                       In Świętokrzyskie, due to the scarcity of WBL places, the provision of practical
                       learning outside of firms (including by CPTs and VET schools) will remain
                       relevant on the short term. As long as in-firm training opportunities remain limited,
                       practical learning provided by CPTs and VET schools will be the only option for VET
                       students to acquire practical skills, and hence it will be justified to continue offering
                       this opportunity. As WBL incidence and duration increases, the offer of practical
                       learning options through CPTs and schools would be envisaged to (gradually) reduce.

                       However, for CPTs to promote (rather than discourage) WBL provision,
                       their operating model needs to substantially move away from a sole focus
                       on practical training provision, to one that emphasizes facilitating WBL.
                       Depending on capacity, needs, and preferences, a variety of roles of the CPTs can
                       be envisaged, ranging from serving as an intermediary between school and firms,
                       to taking on a more substantive role in the management and organization of WBL,
                       training in-firm instructors, and serving as a location for learning assessments. As this
                       would entail a rather substantial change in operating approach of the CPTs, such
                       changes would require substantial efforts from the CPTs managing authorities (the
                       poviat government), as well as sufficient technical assistance to effectively achieve
                       these changes.

                       CPTs are potentially well-placed to play an important role in the strengthening
                       of WBL. Since CPTs have strong linkages with schools and (to an extent) with
                       enterprises, they could in principle play a strong role in functioning as an intermediary
                       to help identify WBL placements. For example, the practical training instructors at
                       CPTs could not only be engaged in identifying appropriate WBL placements, but also
                       potentially engage in activities such as WBL supervision and the training of in-firm
                       instructors. CPTs could facilitate collaboration among firms in case students need
                       placement in more than one enterprise to acquire all relevant skills through WBL, or
                       help determine the appropriate mix of practical learning that will take place in-firm
                       and in the CPT.

                       Moreover, as long as CPTs continue to provide practical training, they should
                       improve the relevance of training through strengthening the engagement of
                       the private sector. One option to achieve this is to increase the extent to which
                       the private sector determines the scope and content of training provision. While
                       limited information is available on the manner in which CPTs currently determine
                       their training offer, there generally appears to be ample scope to improve demand-

responsiveness. This can be achieved, for example, through formalized mechanisms
of consultation between the private sector and CPTs, or by including a strong private
sector representation in the oversight and management of CPTs. Another option to
strengthen private sector engagement is to increase their involvement in training
provision, for example by inviting firm staff to provide ‘guest lectures’ or to help design
student assignments that reflect ‘real-life’ problem solving activities.

CPTs can promote the acquisition of essential non-technical skills by increasing
the extent to which CPT-training simulates the work environment. For example,
project and team based assignments are likely to contribute to the acquisition of skills
related to problem-solving, time management, and team work, which tend to be
highly valued on the work floor and are less likely to be acquired when the focus of
teaching is solely on equipping students with technical skills.

General recommendations for
strengthening WBL in Świętokrzyskie
The relatively large number and diversity of identified constraints to WBL
implementation in Świętokrzyskie raises the question whether WBL is
best strengthened through a narrowly targeted or a more comprehensive
approach. A narrowly targeted approach, aiming to address one or two main
constraints in depth, could for example entail an exclusive focus on strengthening
coordination platforms or financial incentives. A comprehensive approach would aim
to simultaneously address, at least to some extent, all or most of the identified key
dimensions that require addressing in the region.



         E - Next Steps: Recommendations and the Pilot Project to Strengthen WBL in Świętokrzyskie   21
                       The recommendation for Świętokrzyskie is to apply a comprehensive
                       approach, simultaneously targeting all key dimensions that are intertwined
                       and considered to be reinforcing. The current context can be described as a
                       ‘vicious circle of constraints’. For example, the absence of incentives to engage
                       in WBL at all contributes to a lack of stakeholder willing to establish and maintain
                       effective consultation platforms. The justification for a comprehensive approach is
                       that addressing several key challenges creates the possibility of creating a ‘virtuous
                       circle’, where progress in one area will boost the positive impact of activities in other
                       areas. For example, increased incentives for WBL participation are expected to boost
                       stakeholders’ interest in engaging in consultation platforms, which in turn would
                       strengthen capacity for WBL implementation, which would subsequently further
                       strengthen motivation for WBL.

                       A second recommendation is to apply a pragmatic approach, initially focusing on
                       facilitating WBL participation of those firms, VET providers, and students that show the
                       highest motivation and capacity. The justification of this approach is that it is expected
                       to increase the likelihood of being able to showcase early success. In practice, this
                       approach may imply that in the early stages of WBL implementation, participating
                       stakeholder will be concentrated among larger-size and more competitive firm,
                       better-managed VET providers, and higher performing students for which there
                       is particularly strong demand in the labor market. However, it is also possible that
                       initatives emerge that incldue participants who are generally harder to reach, such
                       as groups of smaller-size enterprises, or firms that are willing and able to cater to
                       students with special needs. Particular incentives and assistance could be directed
                       to such initiatives, to ensure that while the support system for WBL implemenation
                       develops, mechanisms targeting these groups are incorporated from the start.

                       Within the above-described framework, a range of specific recommendations
                       was developed to strengthen the incidence, duration and quality of WBL.
                       While specifically developed for the Świętokrzyskie region, where employment
                       outcomes and economic dynamism tend to be weaker than in most other regions of
                       Poland, the recommendations are to a substantial extent considered to be applicable
                       nation-wide. The recommendations are summarized below, starting with those that
                       require national-level interventions, and following with those that can be initiated at
                       the regional level.




                         Recommendations for
                         interventions at the
                         national level

                            1
                                  Adapt the VET regulatory framework to clarify
                                  regulations, increase incentives, and introduce quality
                                  assurance mechanisms.
                       In particular, revisions are proposed that would:
                       •	   Clarify definitions and provisions that currently lead to ambiguities and
                            misinterpretations, such as the difference between practical training and
                            vocational practice, which may be superfluous;


22   WORK-BASED LEARNING IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE ŚWIĘTOKRZYSKIE VOIVODSHIP
•	   Increase incentives for VET providers and their managing bodies to engage in
     WBL, by increasing the minimum requirements for the share of learning that is to
     take place in firms;
•	   Introduce clear mechanisms and procedures to assure the quality and relevance
     of WBL including, among others, related to identifying and assessing learning
     outcomes.

The above regulatory changes may need to be accompanied, at least in their initial
stages, by support measures to VET schools and other stakeholders, to ensure their
awareness of the changes as well as their ability to comply with them.




     2
           Adapt the accountability and governance framework to
           increase incentives for engagement in WBL. In addition to
          adapting the regulatory framework, further national-level interventions
could be considered to strengthen WBL implementation. These could, for example,
include introducing performance-based elements in accountability and financing
mechanisms, which may need to be preceded by activities to strengthen monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms that accurately keep track of performance. Similar to revising
the regulatory framework, such reforms may potentially need to be accompanied by
support measures to VET providers and other stakeholders, to ensure that they have the
desired impact. After all, increased accountability and results-based financing will only
have the desired impact when providers are able to meet performance requirements.




 Recommendations for interventions at
 the regional level

     3
           Invest in promoting stakeholder coordination, but avoid
           ‘paper tigers’. Stakeholder coordination and consultation platforms can
            provide essential direction to individual VET providers and firms in providing
relevant VET in general, and effective WBL in particular, including ideally through the
development and dissemination of sound regional or local VET strategies that are
based on relevant labor market information. However, international experience shows
that efforts to establish such mechanism are not always successful: when incentives
and capacity are lacking among key stakeholders, such platforms may be short-lived
or ineffective. For Świętokrzyskie, the recommendation is to apply a gradual approach
to promoting stakeholder coordination, starting with the facilitation of effective
coordination and collaboration between a limited number of those stakeholders
that show particular and concrete interest in implementing WBL. Building on these
experiences, broader and more formalized coordination mechanisms (such as through
sector skills councils) can be foreseen in the future.




     4
           Address constraints related to incentives and capacity
           with a well-balanced package of financial and technical
           support for all key stakeholders. International practices show
that strong support structures are in place in those countries that have a sound WBL
implementation. Particularly in contexts where VET provision is still largely school-
based, such as in Poland, the availability of effective support is even more important

                       to facilitate the transition to increased WBL. The following broad principles are
                       recommended to apply when determining the exact scope and nature of support:
                       •	   Include all essential stakeholders: effective WBL implementation depends on
                            the willingness and capacity of both firms and VET providers and, to a somewhat
                            lesser extent, CPTs and government authorities. Support measures therefore
                            need to include all these stakeholders. For exmaple, ensuring incentives and
                            capacity of VET providers, but not of firms (or vice versa), is unlikely to generate
                            the desired impact.
                       •	   Provide a well-balanced mix of technical and financial support: technical
                            support builds capacity and reduces the (transaction) costs of implementing WBL;
                            financial support further improves incentives for participation in WBL.
                       •	   Tailor technical support to stakeholder needs: sound stakeholder consultations
                            should inform both the scope and the delivery methods of the technical support
                            that will be offered.
                       •	   When determining the level of financial support, consider that stakeholders
                            may require more substantial financial support during the ‘transition period’
                            than in a mature WBL system, since:
                                   - In a mature WBL system, VET providers will have adjusted their human
                                     resource planning to ensure that sufficient staff can allocate time to
                                     supporting WBL. During the transition period, providers may need to
                                     (temporarily) recruit additional staff with the appropriate skills.
                                   - Both the real and perceived cost-benefit ratio of firms participating in
                                     WBL is higher than in a mature system, because (i) it may take some time
                                     for firms to acknowledge the long-term benefits of WBL; (ii) the actual
                                     immediate benefits of WBL for firms may initially be relatively low, as
                                     firms may only gradually learn how to ensure the contribution of WBL-
                                     students in firms’ production processes; (iii) costs of WBL provision will
                                     initially be relatively high, as it will take some time for firms to develop
                                     the most efficient way to guide students during their WBL experience.
                       •	   Consider the broader implications of transitioning from a school-based system
                            for VET providers. Substantially strengthening the provision of VET through
                            WBL comprises a significant systems’ change, with potentially relatively strong
                            implications for, particularly, VET schools and CPTs. Support provided should
                            acknowledge the need for appropriate change management which could
                            include, for example, reallocating and training teaching staff so that they can be
                            effectively engaged in the process of WBL implementation, and training teaching
                            staff to ensure that they are up to date with the production processes and skills
                            requirements in firms that offer WBL places.




                            5
                                   Support stakeholders with the implementation of
                                   sound quality assurance mechanisms without creating
                                   additional barriers for engaging in WBL. Feasible and
                       appropriate QA approaches are considered to be those that can be implemented
                       taking into account the limited capacity and resources of stakeholders, and that are
                       not so stringent and time-consuming that they discourage stakeholders (especially
                       enterprises) from engaging in WBL. Over time, as capacity and incentives for WBL
                       implementation increase among stakeholders, QA mechanisms can be added or
                       strengthened to gradually arrive at an overall system that inspires a sufficient level of
                       confidence among all relevant actors about the quality and relevance of WBL (and
                       overall VET) provision.


24   WORK-BASED LEARNING IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE ŚWIĘTOKRZYSKIE VOIVODSHIP
 6
          Adapt the operating model of Centers of Practical
          Training so that they facilitate WBL and provide more
          demand-responsive training. A revised operating model of CPTs
that includes objectives, procedures, and incentives that are geared to promoting in-
firm training and applying workplace simulations only when needed, and which more
explicitly and effectively takes into account the need to provide demand-response skill
development activities (for example by giving the private sector a stronger role in their
management), could greatly improve the extent to which these actors contribute to
the acquisition of relevant skills by VET students. An option to consider would be to
engage CPTs in coordination or capacity building activities that are described above.




 The Świętokrzyskie
 Pilot Project
 to Strengthen WBL
Supported by the TA provided under the Catching-Up Regions Initiative,
the Marshal Office of the Świętokrzyskie voivodship, in collaboration with
key stakeholders, designed a pilot project to strengthen WBL. The project is
expected to be financed by the ESF in the framework of the Operational Program
Knowledge Education Development (OP KED) under the Social Innovation priority
axis, and will be implemented during the period 2017-2020.

The project’s objective is to pilot a variety of approaches to promote the
incidence, duration, and quality of WBL, based on the knowledge generated
through the Catching-Up Regions Initiative. The project will target WBL provision
to students of upper-secondary technical schools as an integral part of the formal VET
program, with the ultimate objective to improve the employability of VET graduates.
In addition to strengthening VET implementation in Świętokrzyskie during the
project implementation period, the project is expected to generate lessons learned
that will serve to inform further interventions to strengthen WBL after 2020, both in
Świętokrzyskie and in other regions in Poland. The manner in which the pilot project
will address the various key dimensions that are described in the earlier section of this
report, are summarized in Table 2, below.

Under the project, a grant mechanism will be established to provide
financing to regional stakeholders who develop viable pilot approaches for
WBL implementation, which meet the minimum criteria, established for
project implementation. Among others, these criteria concern requirements for
the identification of the actors who will be involved in grant implementation (firms,
schools, and supervising authorities); the establishment of clear and adequate
coordination mechanisms among the implementing partners; the number of hours
that students will engage in in-firm learning activities; the clear identification of WBL
learning outcomes; and the application of quality assurance mechanisms.

The pilot project will address identified constraints related to capacity
and incentives through a combination of financial support and technical
assistance. Eligible expenditures as part of the financial support include, among
others, the financing of in-firm instructors, training materials, and work stations; work
attire, health and safety training, transport, and remuneration for students; and a flat

                                  rate compensation per WBL-student to VET providers. Technical assistance financed
                                  through the pilot project will be provided by external experts contracted by the Marshal
                                  Office, and will include support to project beneficiaries on, among others, appropriate
                                  coordination mechanisms between schools and firms; the development of templates
                                  and guidance material for WBL agreements and quality assurance mechanisms;
                                  and the monitoring of WBL processes and outcomes. Technical assistance will also
                                  be provided to the Marshal Office to strengthen its ability to manage and provide
                                  oversight to project implementation.

                                  Several aspects of the design of the pilot project will help to ensure that the
                                  lessons learned generated through the pilots can feed into future activities
                                  to strengthen WBL in Świętokrzyskie and beyond. First, the templates and
                                  other guidance material that will be developed through the project are expected to
                                  facilitate stakeholders who implement WBL beyond the direct grant beneficiaries.
                                  Second, with the technical support that will be procured by the Marshal Office, a
                                  sound monitoring and evaluation mechanism will ensure that the strengths and
                                  weaknesses of the various implemented approaches are recorded, and can be readily
                                  disseminated. Third, to lay the groundwork for the establishment of a structural
                                  coordination and support mechanism to facilitate WBL implementation in the
                                  future, relevant stakeholders beyond the direct grant beneficiaries will be invited to
                                  engage in the implementation and monitoring of the pilot project; these may include
                                  for example the Regional Center for Teacher Development, the VET cluster of the
                                  regional Special Economic Zone, and the regional labour offices, depending on these
                                  institutions’ preferences and capacity.
