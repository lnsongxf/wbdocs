The Low-Carbon Zones Handbook draws heavily on the lessons learned from the joint IFC and World
Bank project on Low-Carbon Zones in Bangladesh. This project, funded by the Korea International
Cooperation Agency (KOICA), European Union (EU) and the UK Department for International Develop -
ment (DFID), was one of the first Low-Carbon Zone initiatives undertaken by a lower-income country
and sought to develop an approach to transform the existing old-style Export Processing Zones into
more environmentally friendly Low-Carbon Zones. The team would therefore like to sincerely thank
members of the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority for their continuous contributions
and efforts in the roll-out of the project and the strong support from the Prime Minister’s Office of
Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. Special appreciation goes to the
Korean Industrial Complex Corporation (KICOX) and Dr. Hung-Suck Park for their innovative support
of introducing industrial symbiosis into the project design. The project work was carried out under the
supervision of Paramita Dasgupta (Manager, IFC Investment Climate in South Asia).

An Economic Zone (EZ) is a specific geographic area designated to produce goods,
often primarily for export, and to generate employment on a substantial scale.1
Governments have long used these zones to promote and improve industrial activi-
ties and production. EZs are usually exempt from many of a country’s business laws
regarding taxes, tariffs, foreign direct investment (FDI) limitations, quotas, labor
laws, and others,2 which allows goods produced in the zones to be sold at globally
competitive prices. Countries that are particularly focused on increasing exports,
attracting FDI, increasing foreign exchange earnings, and creating local employment
often create EZs that specialize in manufacturing exclusively for export; these are
known as Export Processing Zones (EPZs).

EZs, in general, and EPZs in particular, have generated significant benefits for some
of the countries in which they have been established. They have attracted substan-
tial FDI and increased foreign exchange earnings. They have also been successful in
generating substantial employment, particularly improving income opportunities for
women, as well as contributing to the building of human capital, both at the worker
level and also at the supervisory and managerial levels.3

On the other hand, EZs have achieved mixed success. Anecdotal evidence turns up
many examples of investments in zone infrastructure resulting in “white elephants,”
or zones that largely have resulted in an industry taking advantage of tax breaks
without producing substantial employment or export earnings. Moreover, many
of the traditional EPZ programs have been successful in attracting investment and
creating employment in the short term, but have failed to remain sustainable when
labor costs have risen or when preferential trade access no longer offers a sufficient
advantage.4 The negative environmental impacts of production activities within
these zone have also raised concerns. EZs are often large users of energy of all kinds


1  Depending on the circumstances, EZs are sometimes known as free zones (FZ), free trade zones (FTZ),
industrial parks or industrial estates (IE), free ports (FP), free economic zones, or urban enterprise zones.

Bangladesh has been stopping new gas
connection set-ups at industrial enterprises,
because of dwindling domestic gas reserves.
This has resulted in rising gas prices, which has
adversely affected the profitability of several
factories established within Bangladesh’s EPZs.
In the past five years, industrial power rates were
raised five times in the country’s Chittagong EPZ,
which employs more than 150,000 people.

within a relatively limited and well-defined geographical area, making them signifi-
cant emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are a major contributor to climate
change.

With climate change becoming one of the core development challenges of our
time, these concerns have assumed growing importance, and require urgent consid-
eration and response. EZs face a series of challenges and also opportunities in this
evolving global economic, political, and social environment, including:

     Growing energy insecurity: As a whole, EZs are large consumers of
       electricity and other forms of energy, and energy costs are usually a signifi-
       cant component of the overall cost incurred by enterprises operating within
       an EZ. Energy prices are increasing across the board, and price fluctuations
       can be quite volatile.5 In addition, many EZs are located in less-developed or
       developing countries where a steady and reliable supply of energy, particu-
       larly electricity, can be a challenge. Uncertainty in energy supply is further
       complicated by governmental energy subsidies that lead to under-investment
       in the energy sector, which is often state-owned.

     Evolving national climate change agendas: With increasing aware-
       ness about the potential long-term detrimental effects of climate change,
       governments are actively seeking to address these issues. As the majority of
       GHG emissions result from electricity production and industrial processes,
       improving the efficiency of electricity generation and end-use and identify-
       ing opportunities to improve industrial practices and processes can help
       significantly reduce emissions. EZs, with their concentration of moderate-
       to-large energy-intensive industrial processes, are a good place to pioneer
       and pilot many GHG-emission-reduction efforts. The introduction of more
       energy-efficient technologies and industrial processes in an existing EZ could
       be an important first step toward developing a test case and scaling-up any
       successes.

                   Changing preferences of global buyers: Global buyers are increasingly
                     focused on the sustainability of their supply chains, often driven by concerns
                     raised by consumers. Increasingly, these buyers are imposing standards and
                     criteria on their suppliers related to higher resource efficiency, lower GHG
                     emissions, lower local pollution, and waste minimization and recycling. To
                     ensure compliance with basic standards, many companies have launched
                     supply chain performance standards and now pre-assess both direct and

               Table 1 provides some examples of standards and initiatives introduced by leading
               brands that typically procure in large volumes from EZs. Research and interviews
               with many of these leading global brands show that trends toward sustainable
               procurement will increase in the future, driven by stricter government regulations in
               many countries.

               I. Low-Carbon Zones
               One way to address these challenges and opportunities is to create specialized Low-
               Carbon Zones (LCZs), or to transform existing EZs into LCZs. Such specialized zones
               will lower the carbon footprint of the industrial and related operations within the
               zone and provide a testing ground for pilot projects and policies for reducing the
               environmental footprint of industrial operations. With demand for green and low-
Introduction




               carbon products on the rise, LCZs are expected to attract maximum investments
               and establish the new norm for production standards.

               By promoting resource efficiency and sustainable operations, LCZs provide a number
               of important benefits both for the companies operating within them and for the
               national economy. These benefits include:

                    Boosting competitiveness through resource efficiency: Increased
                      energy efficiency enhances the profitability and long-term competitiveness
                      of enterprises. While certain additional costs might be incurred in the begin-
                      ning, these are usually offset within a relatively short time period. It is esti-
                      mated that energy efficiency alone can lead to operating cost savings of 24
                      percent for industrial enterprises.6 Lower energy import needs and reduced
                      production costs also enhance competitiveness.

                    Improved brand image: LCZs result in improved reputation and position-
                      ing in the global marketplace for both the zone authorities and the individual
                      enterprises, allowing them to offer a differentiated value proposition to
                      would-be investors and customers. Most export-oriented developing econo-
                      mies supply products to global companies, many of which are placing in-
                      creased emphasis on sustainable sourcing and green supply chains. Increased
                      resource efficiency and environmentally-friendly processes and practices can
                      give these suppliers a competitive advantage in this changing global market.

         LCZ enterprises that make final products may also use the low-carbon di-
         mension of their brand as part of their market strategies.

     Developing new low-carbon-related industries: As LCZs compel en-
       terprises to adopt resource-efficient practices and projects, they create new
       demand for energy-efficient and low-carbon equipment, technologies and
       services, increasing opportunities for vendors to develop their manufacturing
       capability or start importing such equipment and technologies. For example,
       China manufactures LEDs on a large scale, and a significant portion of these
       products are supplied to its own EZs.

     Attracting high quality “green” FDI: LCZs can bring in more foreign
       investment in the form of “green” FDI, by offering investors access to
       infrastructure, finance, knowledge and institutional support for implement-
       ing low-carbon projects and earning a healthy commercial return. Green FDI
       can then attract higher-quality foreign investments, facilitating a shift from
       simple processing, assembly and low-level manufacturing toward research
       and development, high-end design, state-of-the-art manufacturing tech-
       niques, modern logistics, and other new areas. The spillover effect of green
       FDI creates new industry value chains, generates employment, and contrib -
       utes to skill development of workers, engineers, and managers. A recent
       UNCTAD study indicates that, between 2003 and 2012, $500 billion in FDI
       was invested in clean energy generation, low-carbon processes, and green
       products and services, resulting in the creation of more than 200,000 jobs.7

               A. Framework for developing a Low-Carbon Zone

               While the benefits of LCZs are clear, the transition is unlikely to be straightforward.
               A lack of awareness, knowledge, and institutional capacity to implement LCZs
               remains a key challenge to their adoption. In addition, many policymakers and busi-
               ness owners are concerned by the immediate costs of the renovation or retrofitting,
               despite the potential for lucrative new opportunities. At a technical level, innova-
Introduction




               tive products and services often need time to be developed and refined prior to
               adoption and diffusion. Key technologies and practices gain maturity at different
               times, making it difficult for business owners to prioritize and commit to long-term
               investments. Even though there may be successful pilot projects, the scale effects of
               large-scale adoption of the new methods of production remain unknown.

               Thus, to guide the successful development and implementation of an LCZ, it is
               important to operate within a robust framework that includes the following four
               important components:

                   1. GHG mitigation target setting: An LCZ should have the requisite method-
                      ologies and processes in place to support regular GHG emissions inventories,
                      allowing the zone authorities to measure and analyze the zone’s perfor-
                      mance related to lowering emissions.

                   2. Sustainable infrastructure: In order to promote the successful develop-
                      ment and adoption of low-carbon infrastructure, LCZs should be able to
                      demonstrate commercially viable and implementable solutions that will not
                      only reduce GHG emissions but also result in cost savings and other co-bene-
                      fits, such as skill development and job creation.

                   3. Low-carbon policy and institutional framework: Most LCZs fail to thrive
                      on purely voluntary initiatives and need to be supported by a sound policy
                      framework of both compliance requirements and incentives, as well as effec-
                      tive governmental and non-governmental institutions.




10
     4. Carbon financing: Demonstrable reductions in GHG emissions can help at-
        tract additional financial resources from clean development mechanisms and
        voluntary carbon markets, helping to compensate for unattractive short-term
        returns. Developing the market for energy service companies (ESCOs) can
        also support companies that lack the financial resources to fund their mitiga-
        tion projects.


B. Options for developing Low-Carbon Zones

There are two basic options for developing an LCZ, depending on specific circum-
stances and any comparative advantage that a particular location might have. The
first approach is to plan and design a new LCZ.

Perhaps the quickest and most likely approach to establishing an LCZ, however, is
to transform an existing EZ into an LCZ. In 2008, there were approximately 3,000
zones in 135 countries,8 and they represent a significant opportunity for not only
pursuing the LCZ transformation agenda but also for demonstrating large-scale im-
pact. Existing EZs provide an opportunity to make more effective use of an existing
asset. The participating enterprises and their energy-, process- and performance-re -
lated characteristics are known, zone authorities have an ongoing relationship with
the enterprises, and LCZ-related goals and objectives could be set through a highly
participatory, consultative, and collaborative process.

     Box 1: Transformation of the Ulsan Industrial Park of
            Korea into an Eco-Industrial Park

     In, 2005, with a focus on improving resource efficiency and abating
     industrial pollution, the Korea National Cleaner Production Center
     (KNCPC) started a 15-year, three-phase project titled, “Eco-industrial
     Park (EIP): Construction for establishing infrastructure of cleaner
     production in Korea.” The Ulsan Industrial Park was selected as one of
     five demonstration sites for the project.

     Currently, the Ulsan Industrial Park comprises 897 enterprises across
     a varied set of industries, including petrochemicals, automobiles, and
     heavy industry. With total production of USD 155 million and exports
     of USD 68 million, Ulsan industrial park is a significant economic vehicle
     for Korea’s industrial growth.

     Through systematic application of industrial symbiosis techniques (such
     as exchange of steam between two enterprises), the Ulsan EIP initiative
     has already generated investments of USD 79 million and annual profits
     of USD 84 million. There are currently 22 industrial symbiosis projects
     in Ulsan industrial park, which have attracted R&D support funds to
     industrial symbiosis of USD 2.5 million and avoided 331kMt of annual
     CO2 emissions.9

II. About This Handbook
This handbook is designed to aid practitioners in understanding LCZs and the systematic process
required to eventually develop and operate such zones. Interested readers may include both owners,
managers, and engineers of the private enterprises located in the zone, as well as the relevant officials
of the zone authority, developer, or co-developer of the zone.

    Chapter 2 presents a detailed explanation of the five key steps and activities involved in a low-
      carbon zone initiative, both for transforming an existing EZ and for establishing a new LCZ.
      While many of these activities are broadly applicable, they should nonetheless be tailored to
      each particular EZ. This chapter will be most useful to the zone developers, zone authorities,
      and zone enterprises that are involved in the implementation and operation of a zone.

    Chapter 3 explores the policy and institutional requirements for developing an LCZ and offers
      recommendations on how the LCZ-specific policies and institutions can be effectively integrat-
      ed with national policies and institutions to accelerate further reforms to promote sustainable
      industrialization. While Chapter 2 deals with zone- or site-specific policy and institutional devel-
      opment, the low-carbon transformation of an EZ transcends local boundaries and stakeholders,
      and requires a national perspective. Developing and/or strengthening the low-carbon policy
      and institutional framework are national prerogatives, with ramifications beyond any single
      LCZ. National policy makers and regulators have a significant role to play in shaping these ef-
      forts, while the zone authorities or developers can catalyze policy implementation at the zone
      level. Sound enabling policies, regulations and institutions are vital to the successful promotion
      and scale-up of low-carbon initiatives, particularly in developing and under-developed coun-
      tries, and, for this reason, a separate chapter is devoted to these issues.

    The handbook concludes with a set of practical tools for that can be used by the relevant prac-
      titioners to make key decisions and/or plans and develop projects and programs related to LCZ
      implementation. More tools are available at http://bit.ly/lczhandbook.

Voluntary actions alone have rarely led to successful low-carbon transformations at
scale. For this reason, the zone authority or zone developer has a critical pioneer-
ing and catalytic role to play in the development of an LCZ, primarily in setting the
vision, mission, and goals, creating an enabling policy/institutional environment, and
monitoring progress of implementation activities.

Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility for an LCZ initiative must lie with the zone’s
private enterprises, which will eventually have to conceptualize, plan, and imple-
ment the low-carbon measures. While policies and regulatory mandates create an
enabling environment, real implementation and scale-up happens only when en-
terprises appreciate the business case for low-carbon measures and have sufficient
technical and financial capacity to implement them.

This chapter focuses on the steps necessary to transform an operating EZ into an
LCZ, the most frequent path for low-carbon development in economic zones. At the
end of the chapter, there is a brief discussion about the process of planning and de-
signing an entirely new LCZ project and the ways in which this approach compares
to the transformation process.

The transformation of an existing zone into an LCZ involves five main steps, each of
which includes several distinct activities (see Figure 1). Because no two zones are ex-
actly alike, each zone should work through the process in a way that suits its unique
conditions and configuration, while ensuring that the process is collaborative and
consultative. The zone authority or developer should take the lead in the planning,
implementation, and monitoring of the transformation initiatives, in coordination
with the national and/or regional governments and all other agencies and depart-
ments that have a role in the operations of the LCZ. They should also work closely
with the private enterprises and financial institutions that play a primary role in the
regular functioning of the zone.

 JJ Assess the political economy of low-carbon development

 Low-carbon development of economic and economic zones needs political and
 bureaucratic support and, in some cases, assistance from international development
 partners. This is why it is important to assess the level of commitment and support
 for the LCZ at the political and ministerial level, by asking the following key ques-
 tions:
                   What are the existing national frameworks, strategies, policies, and institu-
                     tions related to climate change and sustainable industrial development?



                                                                                                                        19
                                        Are key stakeholders encouraged to pursue sustainable industrial develop-
                                          ment, especially within EZs, as part of the economic strategy of the country?

                                        What are the key obstacles that might impede stakeholders from committing
                                          resources to low-carbon transformation of EZs?

                                   Although an LCZ initiative ideally should benefit a majority of stakeholders, the zone
                                   authority and other implementation partners should recognize that there will be

                                   measures. Thus, from the start, the transformation process should involve civil
                                   society organizations and local communities whose livelihoods depend directly or
                                   indirectly on the zone’s activities.

                                   Stakeholders can be broadly categorized into three groups:

                                        1. Public stakeholders include government bodies and agencies that are respon-
                                           sible for driving the initiative by introducing relevant policies, regulations,
                                           fiscal incentives, and penalty mechanisms. Examples of government stake -
                                           holders include ministries of finance, industry, commerce, planning, energy,
                                           power, and the environment; energy or electricity regulatory commissions;

                                        2. Private stakeholders are typically enterprises within the zones and other in-
                                           dustrial complexes, potential national and international investors in the zone,

       institutions, energy experts, local legal experts, and local and international
       policy experts. These stakeholders are the actual implementers of low-car-
       bon initiatives and also the beneficiaries of the LCZ.

    3. Community stakeholders typically include the local community and NGOs
       who would benefit from a cleaner environment and the spillover benefits of
       new knowledge and skills. They play an important role in ensuring that the
       local community also benefits from the LCZ.

All relevant stakeholders should be identified at the outset of the transformation
process. Through direct interaction with stakeholders and consultation with knowl-
edgeable experts, planners should map which group each stakeholder belongs to or
can reasonably be associated with, their positions on the transition issue, the level
of influence (power) they hold to be able to promote those positions, and the level
of interest they have in any specific reform measures or initiatives. (See Table 2 for
an example of stakeholder mapping categories for a typical low-carbon transforma-
tion.) Together, these attributes will determine the capability that a stakeholder has
to either block or promote any low-carbon transformation activities.

JJ Establish organization and leadership

Successful transformation into an LCZ will depend on a zone’s institutional structure,
governance, policies, and leadership. With strong leadership and good governance
in place, the zone authority can garner wide support. Forward-looking leadership
that is responsive to new ideas can make an enormous difference in the way a zone
is operated or a new zone is designed, helping to ensure that projects and initiatives
are implemented on time, resources are deployed optimally, and benefits are shared
and distributed in a fair and equitable fashion.

As the first step, all relevant policies and regulations should be studied and analyzed
in depth, to understand the gaps and deficiencies in the existing framework. Special
emphasis should be placed on national-level and zone-specific (if any) policies, rules,
and regulations on energy, environment, water, and waste, in addition to the gen-
eral rules and laws of business.

A preliminary diagnostic review can be conducted to understand the roles and
responsibilities of relevant institutions and their capacity to contribute to the LCZ
initiative. Interactions with top officials of the zone authority and other concerned
government ministries and departments can reveal any capacity gaps and identify
the need to strengthen institutions or develop new organizational mechanisms.

It is also important to establish and promote low-carbon “champions” (either indi-
viduals or a group of individuals or enterprises) for any zone, to promote the initia-
tive among the enterprises. In most developing countries, the awareness level and
knowledge base of industries and government institutions on low-carbon issues is
quite low. Champions help in capturing, showcasing and disseminating knowledge
and driving real change.




                                                                                          25
     JJ Create a vision statement

     To support the transformation of an EZ to an LCZ, zone authorities should create
     a vision statement that provides a picture of the future state the zone aspires to
     achieve. The vision statement should clearly set out the objective for low-carbon
     transformation, to guide the entire process and make sure that all enterprises,
     people, departments, organizations and utilities within the zone support the plan
     and are working toward the same goal. The vision statement (which may be part of
     a broader objective) should relate to the zone’s character and configuration and link
     energy and emissions goals to the zone’s overall economic objective.

     It is important to ensure that this vision is then translated into targets and approach-
     es that are followed throughout the process, so that the low-carbon objective is
     achieved. Stakeholder consultation should be carried out periodically to confirm that
     the vision remains relevant and to adjust the vision as and when needed.

 major trends and opportunities, so that it can assess the potential for energy and
 emissions reduction projects to meet its sustainability goals.                                    STEP 4:
                                                                                                     PLANNING &

 The activities involved in this step are highly technical and require specialized
 knowledge and experience if they are to be carried out effectively. Therefore, the                STEP 5:
                                                                                                     MONITORING &
 zone developer or authority should work with expert consultants, who can not only                   REPORTING
 advise on this process but also transfer knowledge and build capacity within the
 zone authority to make the initiative sustainable in the long-run.

                                   A GHG inventory is an accounting of all greenhouse gases emitted to or removed
                                   from the atmosphere in a certain area over a certain period of time. The inventory
                                   can be established based on both utility bill data (top-down approach) and prelimi-
                                   nary surveys of energy consumption (bottom-up approach).11 A completed GHG
                                   inventory will identify the chief sources of emissions in the zone, to help guide the

                                   11 There are two primary approaches to data collection while performing GHG emissions accounting: (i) In a
                                   top-down approach, aggregated data, such as electricity generated within the zone or bought from the grid,
                                   is collected at the zone level. (ii) In a bottom-up approach, the relevant data is collected at the enterprise level
                                   by auditing the energy consumption of individual pieces of equipment; this data is then aggregated at the zone
                                   level to arrive at zone emissions.

The GHG inventory should be completed using internationally accepted guidelines
and standards, such as “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol – A Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard,” published by the World Business Council for Sustain-
able Development (WBCSD) and World Resources Institute (WRI), or the ISO 14064
standard, which specifies principles and requirements at the organizational level for
quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and removals (see Figure 4). Based
on these broad principles, IFC has designed an Excel-based tool called the Carbon
Emission Estimator Tool, which can help with GHG accounting.12 For more details
on this process, please see Tool 1: GHG Emissions Accounting, in the Toolbox at the

     Box 2: Technical diagnostics to estimate a GHG
            inventory for an industrial park, China

     A recently published study by Bin Chen et al, “Greenhouse Gas Inventory
     of a Typical High-End Industrial Park in China,” uses a cradle-to-grave
     inventory methodology to perform GHG diagnostics in a southwest
     Beijing industrial park that is known for its good environmental quality
     and high-end industry concentration. The table below summarizes the
     methodology used by the researchers to estimate the GHG inventory
     of the industrial park.

Using this methodology, the Beijing-based industrial park was
estimated to emit ~1.9 million tons of CO2 during its entire life cycle,
with the construction stage accounting for approximately 5 percent
of total emissions, the demolition stage barely 0.1 percent, and the
operations stage more than 95 percent. As operational activities
have the most significant contribution to life-cycle GHG emissions,
industrial park authorities and enterprises are focusing on them for
the implementation of low-carbon measures. The chart below breaks
down the operations-related emissions, illustrating the fact that
attention needs to be devoted to electricity and heat consumption
activities, along with sewage treatment.

                                   An energy audit is used to review the energy consumption patterns and energy ef-
                                   ficiency of equipment and to identify opportunities for improvement by bringing in
                                   new equipment, improving current equipment, and/or changing the way the exist-
                                   ing equipment is used. Audits are a centerpiece of energy policy in many countries,
                                   including Japan, Korea, and India, where energy auditing is now mandatory for
How to Develop a Low-Carbon Zone




                                   large companies with intensive energy consumption.13 Table 3 provides more details
                                   on the two main types of energy audits, walk-through and investment grade.

                                   Before beginning an energy audit, it is important to decide whether the audit will
                                   be carried out for all firms in the zone or only for a selected set of firms. If only a set
                                   will be audited, that sample set can be selected through an energy survey, in which
                                   all firms complete pre-designed questionnaires detailing their basic utility (power/
                                   water/different fossil fuel consumption) and production data. Based on this data,
                                   those enterprises that cumulatively contribute to about 80 percent or more of the
                                   zone’s energy consumption can be selected for the full audit. This set should include
                                   a good spread of enterprises across the different sectors present in the zone. A
                                   sample questionnaire for an energy survey can be found in the additional tools avail-
                                   able online at http://bit.ly/lczhandbook.

                                   Certified auditors14 should be employed to carry out the energy audit. Primary
                                   data for each of the enterprises and cost centers identified can be collected either
                                   through existing monitoring equipment or with the help of portable meters. The
                                   energy audit will identify major energy cost centers and GHG-intensive processes in
                                   the zone, and provide a holistic map of energy consumption and loss patterns of the


                                   13 In Korea, as per the Energy Use Rationalization Act, energy audits are mandatory for companies consuming
                                   more than 2,000 Tons Oil Equivalent (ToE) per year. In India, under the Perform-Achieve-Trade Scheme of
                                   the Ministry of Power (part of the Energy Conservation Act of 2001), energy audits are mandatory for 478
                                   Designated Consumers. The Energy Conservation Law of Japan provides for a regulatory framework for
                                   mandatory energy audits.
                                   14 Certification of energy auditors requires an overarching national legal framework and is often the first
                                   policy tool toward improving energy efficiency across the industrial base of a country. For instance, in India,
                                   within the framework of the Energy Conservation Act, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is empowered to
                                   certify Energy Managers/Auditors. The BEE has retained the National Productivity Council (NPC) as the National
                                   Certifying Agency, which would conduct the National Level Certification Examination for Energy Managers &

various equipment and processes being utilized in the zone. After the audit is com-
pleted, the 80-20 rule should be followed, to focus on the 20 percent of processes/
equipment that consume 80 percent of the total energy or emit 80 percent of the
GHG emissions.15


Table 3: Types of energy audits

 Walk-through energy audit

 This is the simplest form of audit and involves:
  	
    minimal interviews with site operating personnel;
  	
    a brief review of the facility’s utility bills and other operating data;
  a
    	 walk-through of the facility to become familiar with the building operation and to
    identify any glaring areas of energy loss or inefficiency; and
  a
    	 brief description of corrective measures, including quick estimates of implementation
    costs, potential operating cost savings, and simple payback periods.
 This type of audit usually takes about 4-5 hours16 per facility, and typically, only major
 problem areas are uncovered during the process.

 Investment-grade energy audit

 This is a more complex form of audit conducted by enterprises aiming to upgrade their
 energy infrastructure, where:
  such investments compete for capital funding with non-energy investments; and
  both energy and non-energy investments are rated based on financial indicators, such
    as expected return on investment.
 Such audits entail a complete, detailed engineering study to identify technical and economic
 issues that would justify an investment in upgrading energy infrastructure. Depending on
 the size of the facility, this can take up to 15-20 days.

Figure 5 provides more detail on the energy audit process, while Figures 6, 7, and 8
illustrate some typical outcomes of the energy audit process. For more information
on how to conduct an energy survey and audit, and the equipment that is used dur-

A zone-level GHG inventory is a summation of all the GHG inventories of the differ-
ent enterprises in the zone. This total will represent a baseline for the entire facility
and can be used for target setting and as a basis for comparison in monitoring and
reporting on progress in the low-carbon transformation. To ensure that the reported
zone-level baseline is accurate, each individual enterprise’s reported GHG emissions
data should meet the following conditions:

    Relevance: A GHG inventory should appropriately reflect the GHG emis-
      sions of the enterprise and serve the decision-making needs of users – both
      internal and external to the enterprise. An important aspect of relevance is
      the selection of an appropriate inventory boundary that reflects the reality of
      the enterprise’s business relationships.

    Completeness: It is important to ensure that all GHG emission sources and
      activities within the chosen inventory boundary are accounted for in the
      inventory. Any specific exclusion should be clearly stated and justified.

    Consistency: The consistent application of accounting approaches, inventory
      boundaries, and calculation methodologies is essential to producing com-
      parable GHG emissions data over time. Any changes to the data, inventory
      boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors in the time series should be
      clearly documented.

    Transparency: All data and information used to develop the GHG inventory
      should be well-documented and based on a clear audit trail. Any relevant
      assumptions and appropriate references to the accounting and calculation
      methodologies and data sources used should be documented.

    Accuracy: Data should be sufficiently precise to enable intended users to
      make decisions with reasonable assurance that the reported information
      is credible and accurate. The quantification of GHG emissions should be
      neither over- nor under-estimated, and uncertainties should be reduced as
      far as practicable.




                                                                                            39
                                   JJ Create a pipeline of “bankable” mitigation projects

                                   The identification of “bankable” GHG mitigation projects is the most important
                                   and crucial step in the entire low-carbon transformation process in a zone. It is
                                   vital to ensure that there is interest in investing in those energy efficiency and GHG
                                   mitigation projects that will tangibly improve the energy and emission performance
                                   of the zone enterprises. The low-carbon transformation process, therefore, requires

                                   an emphasis on comprehensive evaluation of investment opportunities, based on
                                   their potential financial return as well as their GHG abatement potential and other
                                   social and economic development impacts. This exercise will result in a repository
                                   of well-defined low-carbon projects that can be pursued with enterprises, financial
                                   institutions, potential partners, and the international donor community.

                                   Before beginning to identify possible GHG mitigation projects, it is important to get
                                   a good idea of how prepared different enterprises inside the zone are for low-car-
                                   bon development, by looking at their basic awareness, willingness to invest, invest-
                                   ment capacity, etc., and then cataloging the energy efficiency and clean technology
                                   initiatives that they have already implemented.

                                   Often at this stage, a broader consultation process using group discussions, brain-
                                   storming sessions, or focus groups can be quite useful to understand historical
                                   activities, future plans of the enterprises and also the implementation challenges
                                   they have faced. This information can be gathered through face-to-face interviews
                                   or structured questionnaires (see Table 4).




                                   Once the existing initiatives have been documented, new GHG mitigation opportu-
                                   nities may be identified. GHG-reduction opportunities primarily arise from energy-
                                   efficiency levers, which can be categorized as demand-side or supply-side measures.

                                   Many enterprises in economic zones are small and medium enterprises (SMEs), such
                                   as light manufacturing, chemical processing, garment, and textile industries, which
                                   typically employ simple processes. As such, improvements in energy efficiency
                                   represent a significant proportion of their GHG mitigation potential. An energy
                                   audit would identify major energy cost centers and GHG-intensive processes for

                                   the form of electricity or other fuels.

                                   There are two major categories of demand-side GHG mitigation measures: (i) energy
                                   efficiency retrofit/process improvement, including equipment modernization and (ii)
                                   industrial symbiosis. Enterprises can achieve a quick payback through these mea-
                                   sures, which do not usually require complex technological applications, are quite
                                   common in industry and have established vendors who can help with implementa-
                                   tion.

                                        1. Energy efficiency retrofit, renovations, and modification, including
                                          equipment modernization: These measures range from incorporation of
                                          small changes within processes to complete replacement of existing equip-
                                          ment with modern technology. Energy efficiency retrofit opportunities are
                                          “quick-fix” solutions for zone enterprises, as they are less capital intensive,
                                          easier to implement, and do not involve any major process change. By
                                          contrast, energy efficiency renovation and modification measures involve
                                          relatively higher capital costs and medium-to-long payback periods. Unlike
                                          retrofit measures, renovation or modification may require a plant shutdown
                                          for several days.

                                   Table 5 illustrates the demand-side measures that were identified in the Chittagong EPZ study. Most
                                   of these measures have a fairly rapid payback (less than five years) and low capital investment require -
                                   ments, offering quick-win solutions for companies to significantly improve their bottom-line (through
                                   savings generated by reduced energy consumption) without affecting the quality of their products.

           2. Industrial symbiosis: Industrial symbiosis is a novel concept that provides simple
             but cost-effective solutions to resource efficiency and waste minimization within
             an EZ through an exchange of energy, waste and material resources between
             firms, so that the waste or excess material of one enterprise becomes the input
             to another’s production activities. This allows significant optimization and savings
             of energy and resources and vastly cuts down on the resource losses and environ-
             mental impact of the zone as a whole. Also, the waste material can be converted
             into valuable products that could find their own markets. Examples of industrial
             symbiosis opportunities include (i) creating a company-to-company industrial sym-
             biosis network through a waste-heat-recovery steam generator, (ii) development
             of a solid waste collection, segregation, and recycling network, and (iii) a waste-
             water reclamation and reuse network involving the installation of microfiltration
             and purification equipment. Successful applications of industrial symbiosis have
             taken place in the Kalundborg eco-industrial park in Denmark (see Box 3) and the
             Ulsan eco-industrial park in South Korea.


     JJ 
           Box 3: Industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg Eco-
                  Industrial Park

           Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park, in Denmark, is perhaps the best
           example of the application of industrial symbiosis in an EZ. In addition
           to several companies that participate as recipients of materials or
           energy, the industrial symbiosis ecosystem comprises six main partners:
               1. Asnaes – a power station;
               2. Statoil – an oil refinery;
               3. Novo Nordisk – a biotechnology company;
               4. Gyproc – a Swedish company producing plasterboard for the
                  building industry;


46
   5. Bioteknisk Jordrens – a soil remediation company; and
   6.    The town of Kalundborg, which receives excess heat from
         Asnaes for its residential district heating system.

The primary resource exchanges include:
      Water: Statoil’s refinery supplies its purified wastewater, as
        well as its used cooling water, to Asnaes power station, thereby
        allowing this water to be used twice and saving an additional 1
        million m3 of water per year.
      Steam: Asnaes power station supplies steam to both Statoil and
        Novo Nordisk for heating of their processes. By functioning in
        a co-generation mode, the power station is able to increase its
        efficiency.
      Gas: Excess gas from the operations at the Statoil refinery is
        treated to remove sulfur, which is sold as a raw material for the
        manufacture of sulfuric acid, and the clean gas is then supplied
        to Asnaes power station and to Gyproc as an energy source.
      Raw material (gypsum): Asnaes power station installed a
        desulfurization unit to remove sulfur from its flue gases, which
        allows it to produce calcium sulfate (gypsum). This is the main
        raw material in the manufacture of plasterboard at Gyproc.
        By purchasing synthetic “waste” gypsum from Asnaes power

        mass from its synthetic processes, and the company has realized
        that this can be used as a fertilizer, since it contains nitrogen,
        phosphorus, and potassium.

                                   Supply-side measures

                                   Supply-side projects can be implemented at the zone level, or first at the enterprise level and then
                                   scaled up to the zone level. Although these projects typically require higher capital investments and
                                   involve relatively complex technological applications, they also result in considerable GHG emissions
                                   reductions. Success of these large projects is dependent on skillful planning and project management.
                                   Policy reforms, such as higher electricity tariffs and fiscal incentives, can improve the commercial

                                   zone. The steam will be produced
                                   by recovering waste gas from the

JJ Establish the business case for the identified opportunities and
     prioritize the mitigation projects

Once a set of potential low-carbon projects has been identified, each project should
be assessed using the following parameters, to evaluate its viability and potential
impact and allow planners to identify priorities for investments of time, money, and
equipment. All of these analyses should be performed based on the current energy
profile of the zone and current energy prices, including for electricity and other fossil
fuels:

    Rationale of the measure in the context of the zone: How the project will ad-
      dress the technical gaps and inefficiencies identified during the energy audit.

    Technical modifications: The exact technical details and specifications for the
      project, including the required installations, process of operation, and related
      control systems and mechanisms.

    Uniqueness of the project: The potential replicability and scalability of the
      project, including any technical peculiarities or boundary conditions that may
      be necessary for implementation.

    Energy and GHG savings potential: The direct GHG emissions reduction,
      based on avoided energy consumption due to improved efficiency or the use
      of clean energy inputs. One or more technical assumptions may be required,
      for example the number of hours of operation, number of instances of
      project implementation, etc. This data can be based on existing systems or
      standard engineering assumptions.

    Target industry: The identified sectors where this project can be successfully
      implemented.

    Equipment supplier: Potential suppliers for the equipment required for the
      measure.

    Implementation barriers and plans: Expected barriers to implementation of
      the measure and a tentative implementation plan. Large capex investments
      will typically require a shutdown of operations.


                                                                                            51
     In addition, a thorough financial analysis of each proposed project will be neces-
     sary to demonstrate its financial feasibility, explore avenues for sourcing investment
     funds and, ultimately, determine whether it should be a priority for low-carbon de-
     velopment moving forward. This analysis should look at required capital investment
     expenditure, as well as operational expenses, such as fuel cost, repair and mainte-
     nance costs, or human resources expenses, for the proposed project. In addition,
     it should evaluate expected revenue from the project, including both avoided costs
     resulting from reduced energy consumption and any revenue that might be earned
     from selling a direct output of the project, such as power from a renewable energy
     (RE) project. Finally, the evaluation should examine financial incentives that might
     accrue to the project as incremental revenue; these may take the form of a fiscal
     measure like a feed-in-tariff for RE power or a capital/tax subsidy on energy efficient
     investments.

JJ Establish different emissions scenarios

Target setting should consider how the energy consumption, and hence GHG emis-
sions, of the zone might evolve under different scenarios. GHG emissions should
be estimated for the zone for the latest year and then projected for another 10
years into the future, for both a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and a low-carbon
scenario. In order to verify the results, computation of the BAU scenario should be
completed using both a top-down approach (GHG emissions are estimated based
on total fossil fuel and electricity consumed in the zone) and a bottom-up approach
(fossil fuel and electricity consumption of each enterprise is collected and added up
to arrive at GHG emissions).

For the low-carbon scenario, mitigation of emissions using different identified op -
portunities is estimated, to draw a predicted emissions trajectory for the future. A
more aggressive low-carbon scenario may also be drawn up, assuming higher levels


                                                                                                            53
Box 5: GHG emissions
       reduction targets in
       Economic Zones

Many economic zones have set targets
for GHG emissions reduction, either
based on business-as-usual (BAU)
projections of GHG emissions or GHG
emissions of a specified base year. The
Incheon Free Trade Zone in South Korea
has a target to reduce GHG emissions
by 30 percent of the BAU projection
for 2020, while Jilin EZ in China has a
GHG emissions reduction target of 37
percent compared to the BAU projection
for 2030. EZs in Belgium have a target
to reduce 20 percent of GHG emissions
(below the 1990 level) by 2020, while
Falta EZ in India has a target to reduce
GHG emission intensity by 20 percent in
2020 from 2005 levels.
of adoption of GHG abatement opportunities within the zone. In building each of
these scenarios, the zone authority or developer has to remain conscious of the
national targets on GHG mitigation and how they can have a bearing on the future
performance of the companies within the EZs.


JJ Set the target GHG reduction based on the timeline

A zone-wide GHG mitigation target should be based on a realistic set of low-carbon
opportunities, as identified in the previous steps (see Box 5). The target can be con-
sidered voluntary for the first few years, before it becomes mandatory for the zone
enterprises. Providing this initial voluntary target period will allow the zone enter-
prises to gradually build up their strategy and action plans for low-carbon measures
and, once they start realizing the benefits, it will be easier to introduce mandatory
targets. This gradual transition will also ensure that investors do not feel discour-
aged at the prospect of higher costs to meet the low-carbon targets.

It is important to set realistic and viable zone-wide targets that are also meaningful
to stakeholders. Although the level of detail contained in an established target will
vary, all successful plans rely on measurable targets. For the first draft of an energy
and emissions plan, targets should be overarching (applicable to broader sectors
rather than specific projects) until more is understood about the potential opportu-
nities and constraints in each sector.

Figure 9 shows an example of different GHG emissions scenarios for a zone. The
BAU scenario shows the emissions trajectory under the business-as-usual case,
including the addition of new enterprises in the zone. Low-carbon scenario-1 gives
the emissions trajectory once certain low-carbon technologies are adopted by the
enterprises and the zone authorities have introduced low-carbon zone policies.
There could be several such low-carbon scenarios. The aggressive low-carbon sce-
nario in this example would include extensive adoption of low-carbon technologies
and several policy/regulatory enablers, as well as financing schemes, such as fiscal
incentives or grant schemes, being implemented by the zone/national authorities.

                                   Notes:
                                   (1) The “trigger point” is the year when implementation of GHG mitigation initiatives begins.
                                   Based on the awareness level within the zone and ongoing activities, a minimum of six months
                                   to one year could be required to plan mitigation initiatives in any zone.
                                   (2) The gestation period, which may vary from one-to-three years, begins at the trigger point.
                                   At the end of the gestation period, the GHG mitigation technologies come into effect.




                                   The zone authority or developer should clearly assess the costs and benefits of any
                                   GHG mitigation targets. While enterprises will be more concerned with the direct
                                   financial costs and returns, the zone authority or developer should take a broader
                                   view. The latter should consider the long-term economic and environmental benefits
                                   in light of the capital invested in providing infrastructure and institutional support to
                                   the enterprises and deploying appropriately trained manpower to monitor the prog-
                                   ress. A complete picture of the economic benefits of an LCZ will include co-benefits,
                                   such as increased productivity, skill development, additional job creation, ambient
                                   air quality improvement, etc.




56
JJ Develop consensus around the possible target and its
    achievement

Without stakeholder support, low-carbon transformation initiatives will be very diffi-
cult to implement. Internal and external stakeholders, including national authorities,
government departments, enterprises, and other stakeholders (such as investors in
the zone) should be consulted in the finalization of the GHG emissions reduction
target, and the low-carbon zone policy direction communicated in a consistent
manner. It is very important for all relevant government or zone departments and
agencies to buy into the low-carbon zone initiative, and they should be made aware
of related guidelines and invited to participate in capacity-building workshops. All
private sector stakeholders, including investors, suppliers, and NGOs, should also be
consistently made aware of the LCZ messages. A strong and consistent communica-
tions program will also help enhance the zone’s image of responsible citizenship to
global investors and mobilize responsible investment into the zone.

Communications and awareness-raising can be facilitated by including LCZ guide-
lines as an annex to all new environment-related zone permits/clearances and in
other media, such as zone websites or brochures. Zones can compete for interna-
tional zone rankings, such as in FDI Magazine or The Financial Times, and individual
enterprises can be encouraged to participate in voluntary GHG emissions disclosure
programs. The progress of LCZ initiatives might also be presented at international
conferences (e.g., UNFCCC conference, world EZ conference, UNIDO EE conference,
etc.).




                                                                                         57
     Box 6: Low-carbon development in Jilin Industrial City

     The low-carbon development process of industrial establishments in
     Jilin, China, is a good example of the development of scenarios for
     GHG abatement potential – a key step toward setting a GHG reduction
     target over a specific time period. In a detailed assessment undertaken
     by Energy Research Institute (ERI), in collaboration with Jilin University,
     three scenarios were drawn up, showing energy consumption and
     related CO2 emissions through 2030. These scenarios show how, with
     the help of state-of-the-art technologies, Jilin City can reorient itself
     away from a business-as-usual (BAU) trajectory toward a low-carbon
     pathway. The scenarios also demonstrate the technical feasibility and
     investment affordability of a shift to a low-carbon economy in Jilin City.
     Scenario analysis can be a valuable tool for analyzing the effect of a
     combination of policies on energy and emissions.

     Within the scenario analysis, more than 400 existing and potential future
     technologies were considered, on both the demand and supply sides.
     By adjusting assumptions about the development and deployment of
     these technologies, three scenarios were developed, as depicted in
     table and graph below.

     The findings clearly suggest that low-carbon and energy-saving policies
     could dramatically improve Jilin City’s emissions situation – to such
     a degree that emissions for Jilin City could peak in about 2020 and
     decline to 60 percent of the business-as-usual scenario by 2030.

However, low-carbon policies and institutions can rarely be dealt with in such isola-

so that they will influence all LCZ initiatives within the country. These broader policy

     Box 7: Low-carbon projects at Chittagong Export
            Processing Zone

     During the low-carbon transition of the Chittagong EPZ, several
     enterprises adopted low-carbon initiatives, for example:
          A footwear manufacturing enterprise installed 4-watt LED bulbs
            at the needle point of 30,000 sewing machines, instead of the
            less energy efficient and more GHG emitting T-5 lamps. As a
            result, the enterprise is realizing an annual energy savings of 2.3
            GWh and avoiding 1,724 tCO2 of GHG emissions.
          A terry towel manufacturing enterprise installed a condensate
            recovery pump to increase the energy efficiency of three of its
            boilers. Condensate recovery allows the enterprise to heat the
            feed water to the boilers and thereby reduce gas consumption
            by the boiler itself. The enterprise is realizing an annual energy
            savings of 7.9 GWh and avoiding 1,603 tCO2 of emissions.
          The independent power producer at the zone is considering the
            installation of waste heat recovery systems to cogenerate steam
            along with electricity. It is expected that the enterprise will be
            able generate 25TPH of steam while reducing annual energy
            consumption by 87 GWh and avoiding 17,670 tCO2 of annual
            emissions.

JJ Develop a detailed plan for project implementation

For each of the priority projects identified earlier in the process, the interested EZ
companies should develop a detailed plan for project implementation, carefully
considering the following factors:

    Alignment with the LCZ strategy: From the outset, each project should be
      aligned to the zone’s GHG emissions mitigation strategy, to help contribute
      to the overall target.

    Project content: A conceptual design and feasibility study should be under-
      taken to cover major technical characteristics of the project, including de-
      tailed cost-benefit assessment of capital costs, operations and maintenance
      costs, savings or revenue estimation, and the financial and economic return
      from the project. The study should also specify the resource requirements.

    Scheduling: The feasibility study should assess any need for plant shutdown
      (complete or partial) to implement the new GHG mitigation project. If a shut-
      down is required for several days, it can be scheduled during annual plant
      maintenance.

    Technology and vendor selection: It is important to select the right technol-
      ogy and vendor for each project, based on cost and experiences in similar
      regions and industries. Especially when an enterprise is doing this exercise for
      the first time, it is advisable to appoint an experienced consultant who can
      develop an implementation plan and make connections with the appropriate
      vendors.

    Financing needs: Once the total project costs are estimated, the enterprises
      should determine whether the financing needs can be met through their
      own equity, or if external funds will also be required.

    Training and manpower needs: The most cost-effective available training
      (including workshops for key staff, training programs for energy services,
      and donor-funded capacity-building activities) should be identified. Key staff
      may also need one-on-one training from experts who have implemented

                                          about similar projects in the region. In-house training also provides an op-

                                          as a platform for future collaboration. In addition, the minimum number of
                                          staff required to implement and operate the new projects should be deter-
                                          mined. Keeping staffing costs low is critical to minimizing project overhead.

                                   There is growing interest among financial institutions (FIs) and the international
                                   donor community in supporting sustainable and energy-efficient infrastructure,
                                   processes, and practices within economic zones and industrial clusters. However,
                                   there are challenges in successfully mobilizing financial resources for such activities,
                                   including:

                                       defining an achievable goal;
                                       identifying a well-vetted set of bankable projects that can be readily com-
                                         municated to potential investors;
                                       ensuring adequate capacity of the zone authority and the enterprises to
                                         execute and oversee implementation; and
                                       designing metrics to measure performance.

                                   Financial institutions often tend to shy away from extending debt-capital to low-car-
                                   bon investors, because they are unfamiliar with the related concepts and technolo-
                                   gies. It is, therefore, important that project developers help officials from banks and
                                   FIs to clearly understand both the value and expected return of low-carbon invest-
                                   ments.

                                   In many developing countries, international donors are working with the coun-
                                   tries’ central banks or other FIs to develop criteria and guidelines for lending on
                                   green projects. Once such criteria are integrated into the investment appraisal and
                                   decision-making framework of banks and FIs, mobilization of funds for low-carbon


64
projects is much easier. In some countries donors have also established a dedicated
credit line and mobilized concessionary funds through a local bank, thereby reduc-
ing the initial burden on the lending institutions.

Along with capacity building of FIs and rationalization of energy prices, introduction
of appropriate financing mechanisms is also vital for mobilizing financial resources
toward implementation of many of the identified GHG mitigation projects. A de -
tailed review of existing and new sources of financing should be completed. Poten-
tial financing mechanisms for promoting energy-efficiency projects can be broadly
classified into two categories: fiscal-incentive-driven financing and market-based
financing (see Table 7). These financial mechanisms can be further classified accord-
ing to their ability to finance specific types of GHG mitigation projects (see Table 8).

Box 8: Energy service company financing for energy efficiency
       projects18

Energy service companies (ESCOs) develop, implement, and provide or arrange upfront
financing for energy efficiency investments by their clients. The fundamental concept
of the ESCO business model is that the client does not have to come up with any
upfront capital investment and is only responsible for repaying the investment made
or arranged by the ESCO.

Among the two dominant structures of ESCO financing, the most relevant and
frequently used in developing countries is the shared-savings model. In a shared-
savings model, the ESCO finances the total upfront capital cost of the project and
is responsible for repaying the lender. The client pays the ESCO a percentage (or it
can be a fixed amount) of its achieved savings from the project, large enough for
the ESCO to repay the project investment to its lenders, and to cover monitoring and
verification costs and any other associated costs. The energy end-user assumes no
direct contractual obligation to repay the lender; only the ESCO has this obligation.

Vietnam has had some initial success with ESCO financing mechanisms. Viet ESCO,
established in 2012, has been negotiating energy efficiency solutions for many
businesses from different sectors, including hotels, public lighting systems, and factories.
These solutions help businesses reduce their energy costs by 15-30 percent, while the
related investment capital can be recovered within two-to-three years. Viet ESCO has
succeeded with financial assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (Vietinbank), and the
Dragon Capital Group, as well as cooperation from many businesses.

monitoring framework to evaluate the success of its transition to an LCZ. Table 9
gives some examples of potential indicators and how they can be interpreted.

     Box 9: Planning and Designing a New LCZ and/or Sustainable
            Innovation Hub

     While the majority of LCZs will likely be developed by transforming an existing economic
     zone, there will be some cases when new zones are developed as LCZs. The steps
     for developing a new LCZ would be very similar to those for transforming an existing
     zone to an LCZ. However, a new zone has the advantage that low-carbon practices
     and resource-efficiency features can be incorporated into land-use planning and design
     considerations from the start, rather than retroactively. Table 11 compares the process
     for developing a new LCZ to that of transforming an existing EZ.

     Several additional considerations should be kept in mind during the land-use planning
     for a new LCZ, and integrated into the overall EZ policy framework, including:
           No LCZs should be planned in sensitive areas, such as forests, mangroves, coral
             reefs, archeologically important sites, sensitive ecosystems, etc.
           While planning the new LCZs, care should be taken to ensure that the enterprises
             falling in the hazardous category are sited at least a minimum stipulated distance
             from the nearest boundary of any ecologically sensitive areas.
           Layout and use should maximize potential for industrial symbiosis opportunities
             among the zone’s enterprises.
           New LCZs should provide a common area to collect and store recyclable waste.
           Green areas should be considered in open areas that are not reserved for
             development of units or infrastructure.
           LCZs with industrial installations with effluent and hazardous waste potential
             should include a common effluent treatment plant (CEPT) and a hazardous waste
             treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) as an integral part of the zone
             proposal.

Successful development of LCZs will require a broad policy and institutional frame-
work at the national level that can accommodate various types of zones at different
locations across a country, so that low-carbon industrialization becomes part of
the wider economic and political strategy. There is a fundamental debate in public
policy about whether economic zones promote country-wide economic policy
reforms by serving as “demonstration areas” and catalysts of new development,
or whether they instead act as “pressure valves” for unemployment, reducing the
incentive to reform and diverting the direction of reform. A 1992 World Bank study
raised serious concerns that EPZs could be used by developing countries to “muddle
along without reforms,” and emphasized the need to use zones as a supplement to
country-wide reform, rather than just creating isolated free market enclaves (World
Bank 1992).

Because the overall national benefits of EPZs are low when zones are isolated from
the domestic economy, it is important to ensure that the zones and their strategies
are integrated with the local business community and supported by national policies
and institutions. The same is true for LCZs. Sound policy on LCZs should both guide
independent actions inside the zone and also help incubate policies and accelerate
reforms in the national economy. LCZs can act as demonstration sites for best prac-
tices and catalysts for reform by introducing low-carbon development strategies into
the economic, industrial, and trade policies of a country, while sustainable practices,
knowledge, and technology can be transferred between zone-based enterprises
and domestic firms outside the zone. In this way, countries can leverage low-carbon
industrial growth as a major enabler to transform their domestic industries and
clusters.

The national government has an important role to play in ensuring that low-carbon
development strategies become part of the broader EZ policy framework. The gov-
ernment can introduce a mix of policy instruments, including fiscal incentives and
mandates, that provide the signals for change. At the same time, the government
should develop good practice guidelines for zone enterprises and establish institu-
tions to promote and facilitate the implementation of projects and monitor results.

The goal for government policy making should be to develop a comprehensive

                                                          policy framework that is conducive to low-carbon investment. This overall policy
                                                          framework should include regulations that facilitate the entry, treatment, and
                                                          protection of foreign investment in low-carbon areas, as well as sector-specific low-
                                                          carbon related regulations that benefit industries both inside and outside the zones.
                                                          For example, a policy designed to attract FDI in renewable energy creates opportu-
                                                          nities to develop a dedicated zone for manufacturing renewable energy equipment
                                                          and also provides avenues for investors to install and operate renewable energy

                                                          Successful development of LCZs also requires strong market drivers for low-carbon

                                                          as feed-in tariffs, renewable portfolio standards, blending mandates, mandatory

                                                          can be used to build new business opportunities and create markets for low-carbon
                                                          products and technologies.

                                                          A sound policy framework designed to achieve low-carbon objectives, coupled with
                                                          an effective promotional effort, can enhance the value and attractiveness of the

                                                          their supply chains. The national or local Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) can use
                                                          a green marketing strategy to attract foreign investors and create new low-carbon
                                                          opportunities. Government policy should also encourage the sharing of technology
                                                          and best practices between the foreign investment entity and the domestic firms to
                                                          maximize the value of FDI in low-carbon development.

                                                          LCZs can also serve as testing grounds for new policy interventions to promote low-

                                                          such measures at the EZ level, policy makers can then choose whether to scale them
                                                          up at the national level for the greater benefit of industries. In China, for example,
                                                          the government experimented with market-oriented FDI, land, and tax policies in
                                                          SEZs before extending them to all enterprises. SEZs in a number of Middle Eastern
                                                          countries are being used to pilot dramatic liberalizations in foreign investment own-
                                                          ership policies. The same can be done with low-carbon policies.

ment goals, and help the government to later mainstream the LCZ concept into the            FRAMEWORK
national EZ policies and also into the broader trade and industrial policy framework
of the country.

Thus, in the preliminary stages of LCZ development, the zone authority or developer
should engage in a systematic, in-depth review of existing national policies and
frameworks, first to identify the current gaps and then to develop feasible zone-
specific solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders. In specific cases, the zone
authority or developer can advocate with national policy makers for broader policy
reforms that benefit the zones and also industries residing outside the zone.

Table 12 lists examples of the national policies and laws that a zone authority or de-
veloper would need to review before developing a specific LCZ guideline and policy
framework or setting a GHG mitigation target for the zone. A thorough review of
these policies will allow zone authorities and developers to develop a baseline policy
scenario for EZ enterprise performance and a comprehensive understanding of the
relevant policy issues that can influence low-carbon projects within the EZ.

If any key policy gaps are identified, the zone authority may want to make additional
policy recommendations and proposals at the national level. Because amendments
in national policy or regulations take time, a first attempt should always be made to
introduce LCZ policies within the legal framework laid out by the existing national
EZ policy. However, if the existing frameworks fail to accommodate low-carbon de-
velopment goals, broader reforms should be initiated. In either case, active con-
sensus-building activities should be organized to bring on board relevant national
stakeholders associated with the LCZ initiative. This will help to reduce resistance
and smooth the approval process for the reforms.

Successful development of LCZs will depend on the presence of a strong institu-
tional ecosystem that not only includes the enterprises, zone developer, govern-
ment departments, and ministerial bodies, but also the business service providers,
engineers, consultants, operations and maintenance professionals, equipment
suppliers, financiers, academic institutes, and vocational training centers. Since LCZ
is a relatively new concept, the recruitment of skilled engineering professionals and
consultants is vital for enhancing awareness among industries about low-carbon
industrial practices and technologies and supporting them in actual implementation.
Experienced consultants can share best practices, perform technical audits, develop
project feasibility studies, and subsequently connect the interested enterprise with
vendors, technology providers, and financiers. The concept of low-carbon industrial-
ization is also increasingly a part of engineering curricula at universities and voca-
tional training courses, meaning that new engineers and technicians will be familiar
with the relevant ideas, tools and techniques.

     Box 11: The Green Cell at Bangladesh Export
            Processing Zones Authority


     In its current form, the BEPZA is primarily responsible for facilitating
     investment in economic zones in Bangladesh by providing tailored
     infrastructure and business services to the enterprises. However,
     promotion of sustainable practices in the EPZs is beyond BEPZA’s
     purview. With World Bank support, BEPZA has recently taken a first step
     toward bridging this institutional gap by developing an Environmental
     Management System (EMS) to improve the environmental performance
     of the enterprises in its eight EPZs. The scope of this program is
     restricted to basic environmental monitoring and inspection activities
     and should ideally be extended to include the broader dimensions of
     energy efficiency, GHG mitigation, and waste and water management.

     In this context, the creation of a Green Cell (GC) has been proposed,
     to serve as an executive body within BEPZA in order to bridge the
     institutional and capacity gaps and drive conceptualization, planning,
     implementation, and evaluation of green activities in the EPZs. The GC
     will oversee the EMS counselors, whose roles fit well with the GC’s
     agenda. Functionally, the GC will drive active coordination with the
     EPZ enterprises and other private and government stakeholders and
     identify and support green investments beyond those already made by
     the enterprises in the zone.




98
The chief objectives of the GC are to:

      drive the transition of current and upcoming EPZs to LCZs, by
        conducting regular and focused capacity-building programs on
        the environmental and energy performance of enterprises;

      support EPZ enterprises in implementing energy efficiency
        projects and other low-carbon projects by acting as the first
        point of contact (FPOC) and the single point of contact (SPOC)
        for all low-carbon development-related queries and activities
        within EPZ;

      formulate and implement EPZ-level rules, guidelines, and
        governance mechanisms on GHG emission mitigation, energy
        efficiency, and waste and water management. These policies
        will be aligned with national acts, laws, regulations and other
        development priorities; and

      facilitate and assist BEPZA in inter-departmental and inter-
        ministerial coordination and communications, to ensure that
        respective government agencies are informed and their policies
        are taken into consideration, and to encourage these agencies to
        provide necessary inputs and feedback.

Presently, the GC is being instituted in a pilot capacity to support
the low-carbon transition of Chittagong EPZ, and once it has been
mainstreamed, the GC will be scaled up to support all the other zones
under BEPZA.

zontal and vertical. Horizontal policy integration involves cross-sectoral measures                           FRAMEWORK
and procedures undertaken to mainstream or bring about comprehensive integra-
tion of low-carbon goals into EZ policy. Typical examples would include broad
climate change strategies and the integration of climate policies into the preparation
and adoption of new regulations and the annual budget. Vertical policy integration
within the zone levels involves the integration of climate policies into a specific sec-
tor.

Table 14 presents best practice guidelines for how low-carbon development can
be integrated into the five key components of a national EZ policy framework:20 (i)
core policy, (ii) incentives, (iii) regulations, (iv) institutional structures, and (v) physical
development and management.

Although the scope and role of the zone authority in national energy- and envi-
ronment-related policies and regulation is limited, zone authorities can influence
enterprise-level behavior through voluntary programs and targeted incentives. These
programs can then influence development of national policies and low-carbon initia-
tives at other enterprises around the country.

An effective way to communicate the zone’s low-carbon strategy to existing facili-
ties and developers is to develop a Low-Carbon Zone Roadmap and Low-Carbon
Zone Guidelines and disseminate them widely among the existing and future
zone investors and government and private sector stakeholders. Such documents
constitute the collective vision for building or transforming an economic zone into a
low-carbon zone and delineate strategies that can be implemented both at the zone
level and at the national level (see Box 12 for information on Chittagong’s Low-
Carbon Zone Roadmap and Guidelines).



                                                                                             103
      Box 12: Low-Carbon Zone Roadmap and Guidelines

      The IFC-led technical assistance program at Chittagong EPZ produced
      two key documents, the Low-Carbon Zone Roadmap (LCZR) and
      Low-Carbon Zone Guidelines (LCZG), to help enable the low-carbon
      transition of all EPZs in the country. Following the official adoption of
      these documents, BEPZA is now overseeing the LCZ transformation
      process.

      The LCZR provides BEPZA with strategic and systematic guidance on
      facilitating the transition of the EPZs into competitive, low-carbon, and
      resource-efficient economic zones. It covers topics such as potential
      GHG emissions mitigation, developing implementation plans, and
      establishing a policy framework to promote low-carbon development
      in zones and other industrial areas such as industrial estates, high-tech
      parks, industrial complexes, and clusters. Using existing tools available
      to businesses and policy makers, the LCZR covers five key steps that are
      instrumental in transformation of EPZs to LCZs:

            1. GHG emissions accounting

            2. Energy audit and energy survey

            3. Identification of mitigation opportunities

            4. Financial assessment and prioritization of opportunities

            5. Target-setting for GHG emission reduction

      The LCZR concludes by outlining the enabling policy environment to
      support the above steps.


104
The LCZG is the tactical policy document to be implemented by BEPZA
on a day-to-day basis. In its current form, the LCZG provides a step-by-
step guide to enterprises and governing agencies on low-carbon and
resource-efficient practices. The purpose of the LCZG is to promote the
development of low-carbon zones or the transformation of the current
EPZs under BEPZA and to streamline the role of BEPZA to facilitate
implementation of the guidelines. The guidelines can also be adopted
by other economic zone authorities and are applicable for other
categories of economic zones, such as EZs, High Tech Parks, Industrial
Estates, and Industrial Complexes. Please see Tool 6 in the Toolbox at
the end of this handbook for the full text of the LCZG.

CONCLUSION
LCZs must continue to evolve in response to global climate change, the energy
scarcity challenges and changing dynamics of international trade, and the rise of
regional free trade areas. While zones cannot and should not compete on the basis
of fiscal incentives alone, they can differentiate themselves in terms of facilities,
services, and best practices and, most importantly, by providing successful demon-
stration cases of modern and sustainable production and distribution concepts and
approaches. This demonstration effect can be magnified by creating an enabling
policy and regulatory environment and building institutional capacity. In many coun-
tries, LCZs will also play a critical role in incubating and accelerating policy reforms.
Several pilot LCZ initiatives should be tested in various parts of the world to make
the concept more acceptable and familiar to the wider industrial and business com-
munity. Eventually, these pilot zones can facilitate the mainstreaming of low-carbon
development into the trade and investment policies of the countries, so that future
economic zones will be designed, developed, and operated with LCZ considerations
from the start.

Already, developing countries are showing strong interest in adopting the LCZ
concept as a transformative way to address their energy and resource scarcity chal-
lenges. Through LCZs, both developed and developing countries can deliver on their
voluntary low-carbon goals. The future of EZs will, therefore, intersect with LCZs.
As the market for low-carbon technology matures, the cost-effectiveness of LCZs is
only expected to improve, which will further catalyze the mainstreaming of the LCZ
concept within the overall framework of EZs.

TOOL 1: GHG EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING

“The Greenhouse Gas Protocol – A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard,”
published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
and World Resources Institute (WRI), is commonly referred to as the WBCSD GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard. It provides standards and guidance for companies,
organizations, business leaders, and policy makers to understand, quantify, and
manage GHG emissions.

ISO 14064-1:2006 specifies principles and requirements at the organization level for
quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and removals. It includes require -
ments for the design, development, management, reporting, and verification of an
organization’s GHG inventory.

Based on the above methodologies, a three-step approach, detailed below, can be
adopted by any practitioner to calculate GHG emissions from industrial operations:

       Determine organizational & operational boundary

       Identify and categorize GHG sources and sinks

       Develop GHG inventory & carbon intensity of processes in different
         enterprises of the zone




                                                                                       111
           JJ Determine organizational & operational boundary

              Selection and validation of base year: An enterprise may need to track emis-
                sions over time as a requirement of a variety of business goals, such as public
                reporting, establishing GHG targets, managing risks and opportunities, or
                addressing the needs of investors and other stakeholders. The preliminary
                use of the GHG inventory is to develop future abatement, mitigation, and
                management strategies. A meaningful and consistent comparison of emis-
 Toolbox




                sions over time requires setting up a performance datum with which to com-
                pare current emissions; this datum is the base year. For consistent tracking
                of emissions over time, the base year emissions may need to be recalculated,
                as there may have been significant structural changes, such as acquisitions,
                divestments, and mergers. The base year may be a single year or a multi-year
                average. The selection of a base year may depend on the availability of verifi-
                able GHG emissions data for that year.

              Determination of the organizational boundary: In setting organizational
                boundaries, an enterprise selects an approach for consolidating GHG emis-
                sions and then consistently applies the selected approach to define those
                businesses and operations that constitute the company for the purpose of
                accounting and reporting GHG emissions. The WBCSD Protocol defines two
                approaches for establishing the organizational boundary:

                   	 quity Share Approach: In this approach, an enterprise accounts for GHG
                 E
                   emissions from operations according to its share of equity in the opera-
                   tion. The equity share reflects economic interest, which is the extent of
                   rights an enterprise has to the risks and rewards flowing from an opera-
                   tion.

                 Control Approach: In this approach, an enterprise accounts for 100
                   percent of the GHG emissions from operations over which it has control.
                   It does not account for GHG emissions from operations in which it owns
                   an interest but has no control. Control can be defined in either financial
                   or operational terms:




112
             Financial control: An enterprise has financial control over an opera-
               tion if the former has the ability to direct the financial and operating
               policies of the latter, with a view to gaining economic benefits from
               its activities.

             Operational control: An enterprise has operational control over an
               operation if the former or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority
               to introduce and implement its operating policies at the operation.

    Determination of the operational boundary: Assessment of the operational
      boundary involves identifying the emissions associated with the operations,
      categorizing them as direct or indirect emissions, and then choosing the
      scope of the emissions (see Figure 12).

           JJ Identify and categorize GHG sources and sinks

           To help identify direct and indirect emissions sources, improve transparency, and
           provide utility for different types of organizations and different types of climate poli-
           cies and business goals, three “scopes” are defined for GHG accounting and report-
           ing purposes (see Table 15 below). Scopes 1 and 2 are defined to ensure that two or
           more companies will not account for emissions in the same scope, thus eliminating

           the chances of double counting of GHG emissions.

               Estimation of various emission factors: This data can be collected from
                 international or national databases and/or locally available sources, such as
                 the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and other
                 sources, including DEFRA, US-EPA, EIA, etc. However, for the computation of
                 the electricity emission factor, the following should be considered:

 Power supplied only within the zone: The consumption of the fuels (coal,
   gas, diesel, etc.) used to generate the power is already accounted for under
   Scope 1 emissions of the utility company. However, for other enterprises
   within the zone, the consumption of this power falls under Scope 2 emis-
   sions, and the emission factor is calculated using the following equation:

               Emission factor = ∑(Qi x NCVi x EFi) x 1000 / (EG)

           Where,
           Emission factor is in tCO2/kWh

TOOL 2: ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

A thorough economic evaluation can assess the financial attractiveness of a low-
carbon project and also compare it with other competing investment options.
Economic evaluation shows the benefits of projects relative to their capital costs. It
is difficult to find any single parameter for economic evaluation. Instead, there are
different measures, each of which highlights different aspects of a project and has
its own strengths and weaknesses. Two possible approaches are:

Simple investment method: This approach is used for preliminary financial assess-
ment of energy efficiency projects. Assessment of investment efficiency is based on
non-discounted cash flows, and a rise in prices is not considered a cash flow. The
parameters of the project’s effectiveness are estimated without financing (from the
point of view of all the project investors), and the results show if it is reasonable to
proceed with technical and economic calculations for the project.

The most frequently used simple investment methods are calculation of rate of
return and calculation of payback period. However, the disadvantage of these ap-
proaches is the inaccuracy of the calculations, as activity after the payback period
is not taken into consideration. Simple investment methods cannot be used for
comparing variants with different project durations.

Discounting method: The essence of this method is in preliminary discounting of
the estimated cash flow based on the feasible discount rate. Most commonly, the
real discount rate (cleared from the inflation rate) is used when the energy projects
are evaluated. Inflation expectations are not taken into consideration when the
project cash flow is structured. When the rate of energy cost increase is defined, the
total inflation index is not taken into consideration.

There are several different types of discounting methods, each of which has its own
advantages and disadvantages. The net present value (NPV) method considers the
value of money but not the risks, and the fact that money is the absolute measure
does not allow for comparison of projects with different levels of financing. The


                                                                                           117
 Toolbox




           internal rate of return (IRR) method addresses these disadvantages but does not
           take into account the cost of capital and does not have any economic definition
           (for example as NPV); this indicator is a bit more complicated. Finally, there is the
           payback period method, which does not take into consideration the time value of
           funds. A project payback period without absolute and relative project income does
           not provide a full picture of the effectiveness of the investments.

TOOL 3: MARGINAL ABATEMENT COST CURVE

The marginal abatement cost curve (MACC), developed by McKinsey, is a useful
prioritization tool for low-carbon investment programs. The focus of MACC is to
compare multiple low-carbon investment options against the dual criteria of cost of
one unit of GHG abatement and volume of GHG abatement. MACC has become
an essential planning tool as governments look to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and improve energy security. Even in low-carbon transformation of EZs, the MACC
tool is used as an analytical framework to answer the following key questions:

    Among available mitigation options, which will be the most efficient and
      cost-effective?

    What are the potential results associated with each option?

    What does it cost to implement each option?

MACC analysis can help an EZ authority or planning agency to compare the costs
and benefits of alternative emissions reduction options. The cost-benefit assess-
ments are based on cash flow projections over the lifetime of the projects and
include the applicable fiscal incentives, if any. The options that have positive costs
per unit of GHG abatement are the ones that require further support in the form of
incentives to make them financially viable. It also enables the planning authority to
assess the total investment needed to shift toward low-carbon growth. Once the
requisite incentives are worked out, an EZ authority could take policy initiatives to
introduce some of them at the zone level (if they have the adequate mandate to do
so) and/or advocate policy reform at the national level by approaching the relevant
national government agencies.

The World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is devel-
oping software that provides an easy way to build marginal abatement cost curves,
and to calculate break-even carbon prices. The user-friendly interface will guide
users through a simple data entry process that is otherwise a typically laborious
process. However, at this point in time, the software version of the MACC tool is yet

           to be fully developed and is only available in a beta version.22 The following section
           elaborates on the technicalities of operationalizing and using MACC.

           The MACC has two major inputs: the marginal cost of the low-carbon option and
           the total abatement potential of the low-carbon option at the sector level and at
           national level. The abatement cost is calculated as an incremental cost by compar-
           ing the NPVs of the investment, operations costs, and revenue for the technologies

           implemented in the baseline and low-carbon scenarios.




           The approach can be expressed mathematically as follows:


                                                           NPVOptionA - NPVBaseline-OptionA

           22 http://esmap.org/MACTool
           23 The baseline situation for a low-carbon option is defined as the situation or the option that would have
           existed in the absence of the low-carbon option for that specified sector.



120
The net present value of the low-carbon option and the baseline alternative will be
calculated using standard financial models, using the following formulations, with
alterations specific to project/options for each case:


                                           (1 + r)t
                             CAPEX x                    + OPEX - REV
                                         (1 + r)t - 1
                    NPVi =
                                             (1 + r)t


            CAPEX              Capital expenditure for the option “i”
            OPEX               Operation expenditure for the option “i”
            r                  Discount factor
            t                  Lifetime of the technology
            REV                Revenue from the option “i”

The revenue from the low-carbon option will be cash inflow as a result of sale of
product, for example sale of power in the case of a renewable energy project or
super critical power project.

In calculating the net present value of the options, the projected value of the energy
can be used. The projection can be done on the basis of the appropriate escalation
factors.

The emissions reduction or GHG abatement by implementation of the low-carbon
option will be calculated as a product of appropriate emission factors with:

    energy-saving potential calculated based on standard methodology of
      UNFCCC, IPCC, or similar standard international methodologies for energy-
      efficiency projects;

    total power generated by the power generating station, in case of the imple-
      mentation of an energy-efficient power generation project or renewable-
      energy-based power generation project; and

    total amount of avoided process emissions for industrial process change or
      product change projects.

                                                                                         121
           Therefore, for calculation of the emission reduction or GHG emission reduction, the
           energy-saving potential, power-generation potential, or avoided process emissions
           needs to be estimated. These values can be further used for the development of the
           MACC.

           Development of the MACC serves as an economic analysis of the low-carbon
           scenario. It reveals both the economic costs and benefits of moving toward a lower-
 Toolbox




           carbon-development pathway. It also helps analyze and assess the conditions under
           which the proposed low-carbon options could be effectively implemented.

           The MACC provides a two-level assessment:

                  1. A cost-benefit analysis comparing individual low-carbon options to the
                     baseline scenario; and

                  2. An assessment of the conditions under which the proposed low-carbon
                     options could become attractive to investors in lieu of the more carbon-
                     intensive options found in the reference scenario.

           The MACC can be used to prioritize the low-carbon options and analyze GHG miti-
           gation policies. This MACC represents in graphic form the economic attractiveness
           of the low-carbon option in light of its potential mitigation size. The area under the
           curve therefore represents the total cost or benefit that can be achieved by imple -
           mentation of the low-carbon option over and above the baseline alternative.

           In the second approach, the curve represents the investor’s perspective on the low-
           carbon options. The incentives that would be required for the proposed low-carbon
           options to become attractive to the country’s investors are estimated, and the
           minimum internal rate of return is computed for each of the options, considering
           the capital investments, operational costs, and the revenue from the project. Then
           the incentive that would be required to take the IRR above the minimum expected
           return level is estimated. The minimum expected return level is considered to be the
           benchmark for investment. The expected return varies across sectors, and thus the
           benchmark IRR will be different for different sectors in the country.



122
The market incentive is determined as the USD per tCO2e that would make the NPV of the low-carbon
options equal to zero, using the benchmark IRR as the discount rate. While low-carbon options with
an IRR above benchmark will be attractive without any incentive, those with IRRs below benchmark
will require additional incentives. The level of such incentives represents the break-even carbon price.
When the break-even carbon price for a low-carbon option is negative, implementation of such a
measure is attractive. The area under the curve in this MACC represents the total volume of incentive
that will be required to implement the low-carbon options. Figure 13 shows the typical output from a
MACC analysis.

TOOL 4: DRAFT TOR TO CARRY OUT AN ENERGY AUDIT IN
        AN ECONOMIC ZONE


Background

[Provide introductory details of the economic zone, including its geographic loca-
tion, overall land area, and any other physical attributes, such as proximity to a
major port, etc. Include date of establishment of the zone, types and numbers of
enterprises present, annual physical output of the enterprise, total volume of ex-
ports/imports, both in physical and monetary terms, and employment data, among
others.]


Objective

The objective of the assignment is to perform a comprehensive energy audit of eco-
nomic zone “X,” to establish a baseline of energy use of its constituent enterprises.
The economic zone features enterprises from a variety of sectors that are expected
to have different energy-use characteristics. The selected energy auditor will be
expected to perform a bottom-up analysis at the enterprise level and then consoli-
date the results at the zone level to arrive at an overall understanding of all types of
energy use and consumption patterns.

The idea behind the audit is to lay the groundwork for a future assignment that will
analyze the baseline energy use in zone X to identify cost-effective opportunities
for enhancing the energy efficiency of the zone. Detailed TORs for this follow-up
assignment will be floated separately after successful completion of the energy audit

           Scope of Work

           The broad scope of the audit exercise is as follows:

              Energy Survey

              [If there are a large number of enterprises in the economic zone, a survey could
              first be conducted to gather energy consumption data and then a detailed audit

              of only a sample set of enterprises could be conducted. However, if the number
              of enterprises is reasonably small, a comprehensive audit could be performed on
              all enterprises, in which case this step need not be included as part of the TOR.]

               1. Design and circulate an energy survey questionnaire among all enterprises in
                  the zone to gather energy consumption data from all enterprises.

               2. Based on the gathered data, select the top 20 percent of the enterprises in
                  terms of energy consumption and complete the following steps.

              Study of Energy-Consuming Devices

               Conduct a thorough assessment of energy use at each plant site and prepare
                 a detailed report on the energy savings potential at the site. The report will
                 also indicate what energy efficiency improvements might be considered,
                 what would be the investment requirement for such improvements, and
                 what would be the payback periods for each of those investments.

               Study equipment constraints that result from operations and maintenance
                 (O&M) limitations.

              Study of the Human Aspect in Energy Conservation

               This activity will assess the level of awareness among managers and techni-
                 cians on the shop floor about energy efficiency issues. If required, the report
                 will propose specific skill enhancement or training programs to improve
                 awareness about energy-efficiency-related issues among the plant profes-
                 sionals.

Financial Analysis

 Payback period will be calculated for each of the investments being pro-
   posed, considering the real cost of money and net present value of the
   investment made.

 The study will indicate any risk and uncertainty associated with the invest-
   ment decision and also suggest appropriate risk mitigation strategies and the
   cost of these mitigation actions.

TOOL 5: DRAFT TOR FOR A STUDY TO IDENTIFY LOW-
        CARBON INTERVENTIONS IN AN ECONOMIC ZONE


Background

[Provide introductory details of the economic zone, including its geographic loca-
tion, overall land area, and any other physical attributes, such as proximity to a
major port, etc. Include date of establishment of the zone, types and numbers
of enterprises present, annual physical output of the enterprise, total volume of
exports/imports, both in physical and monetary terms, if any, and employment data,
among others.]


Objective

The objective of the assignment is to build on the outcome of a comprehensive en-
ergy audit report and identify cost-effective opportunities for reducing the energy-
use-related GHG emissions in economic zone “X.” The exercise of identifying these
“low-carbon interventions” will necessarily have to bring into consideration the
following two possibilities:

    reduction of GHG emissions through implementation of energy-efficiency
      measures; and

    reduction of GHG emissions through implementation of clean, alternative
      energy options.

It is expected that once the low-carbon interventions are identified, a follow-up as-
signment may be initiated to provide implementation support to enterprises willing
to implement the identified measures.




                                                                                        131
           Scope of Work

           The broad scope of work will involve the following:

               Analysis of the energy audit outcomes: The first task of the assignment
                 will be to analyze the complete set of energy data generated through the
                 audit exercise, to develop a comprehensive understanding of the energy use
                 profile of the zone X. Based on the energy audit outcome, the consultant
 Toolbox




                 will identify a sample set of enterprises that they think will best represent the
                 energy profile of the zone.

               Projection of GHG emissions: The consultant will be required to do a five-
                 year business-as-usual (BAU) projection of energy-related GHG emissions for
                 the zone. The exercise will draw heavily on the energy audit data and involve
                 active consultation with the zone authority to incorporate reasonable estima-
                 tions about projected growth of operations of the zonal enterprises.

               Field visit: The consultant will have to perform field visits to the chosen
                 sample of enterprises to get a better understanding of their energy con-
                 sumption patterns. This step is designed to familiarize the consultant with
                 the ground realities related to the energy profile of zone X.

               Identification of low-carbon interventions: Based on the previous two
                 steps, the consultant will identify a broad set of low-carbon measures, which
                 will then have to be prioritized on the basis of their potential impact on
                 avoiding GHG emissions, estimated financial costs, technological maturity,
                 and assessment of implementation capacity in the zone X. Active consulta-
                 tion with the sample enterprises is deemed necessary at this stage to validate
                 the acceptability of the identified broad measures.

               Detailed analysis of low-carbon interventions: The prioritized set of
                 low-carbon interventions will be subjected to detailed analysis, which will
                 include thorough pre-feasibility assessments of the requisite technologies,
                 including implementation economics, GHG abatement potential, and market
                 readiness. As part of the detailed analysis, the consultant is also expected to
                 build scenarios of the possible impact of implementation of the prioritized


132
       set of interventions on zone GHG emissions.
    Development of business models for implementation of low-carbon
      interventions at the individual enterprise level: The consultant will
      draw out the business model for implementing one or more measures at the
      chosen sample set of enterprises, including the identification of technology
      suppliers and implementation partners. The consultant will also advise on
      innovative mechanisms to finance the chosen interventions, including CDM
      and leveraging of available fiscal assistance.

    Policy Analysis Expert: The consultant must engage a senior policy analysis
      expert with at least five years of relevant work experience in analyzing the
      policy environment for low-carbon business model implementations. The ex-
      pert will help the implementation team understand the policy implications of
      low-carbon projects and advise economic zone authorities in conceptualizing
      a better policy environment that will help the businesses proactively pursue
      low-carbon initiatives in the zone.


Expected Outcome

The report will seek to establish business cases for implementation of low-carbon
interventions in specific enterprises in zone X that will not only help reduce GHG
emissions but also improve energy efficiency. These business cases will have to be
well-supplemented by a feasibility analysis to support their economic and financial
viability.

           TOOL 6: LOW-CARBON ZONE GUIDELINES FOR AN
                   ECONOMIC ZONE


           INTRODUCTION24

           Background
 Toolbox




           Economic zones such as Export Processing Zones and Economic Zones are well-
           established centers of foreign investment, trade promotion, industrial development,
           and job creation, and have contributed immensely to the economic growth of de-
           veloping economies. However, with rising energy scarcity and global climate change
           concerns, the traditional carbon-intensive growth model of these economic zones
           is not sustainable in the long run. Enterprises within these economic zones should
           adopt energy- and resource-efficient production techniques and engage in best-in-
           class operating practices to improve productivity and reduce waste. There are several
           international industrial energy performance standards available that enterprises can
           consider when planning for low-carbon initiatives within a zone. Two such standards
           are:
                3. ISO 50001:2011 - Energy management systems – Requirements with guid-
                   ance for use. This standard presents requirements for energy management
                   systems (EMS) and establishes a framework for industrial plants, commercial
                   facilities, and entire organizations to manage energy.
                4. ISO 14000: 2004- Environmental management systems – Requirements with
                   guidance for use. This standard provides practical tools for companies and
                   organizations looking to identify and control their environmental impact and
                   improve their environmental performance. It maps out a framework that a
                   company or organization can follow to establish an effective environmental
                   management system. Benefits of using ISO 14001:2004 can include reduced
                   waste management costs, savings in consumption of energy and materials,
                   lower distribution costs, etc.

           24 These guidelines are modified from an actual case involving transformation of an EPZ into an LCZ.



134
Governments and zone authorities can support such low-carbon endeavors through
policy and regulatory intervention, institutional capacity building, knowledge and
information support, and investment in building low-carbon infrastructure in the
zones.

Through a set of well-planned activities, an existing economic zone can be trans-
formed into a low-carbon zone. Improving the energy and environmental perfor-
mance of enterprises at this scale would make a significant contribution to the
enterprises and the zone management and to sustainable development of the sur-
rounding community. The resulting economic zone would have a more sustainable
community of enterprises, supporting each other’s business successes. New services
offered by the zone authority would yield opportunities for new revenue streams.
At the same time, for newly planned economic zones, low-carbon considerations
should be integrated into site development, infrastructure, and industrial planning
activities from the start.

A low-carbon zone is a means of improving the sustainability of industry through
local and regional action, thus creating a position of leadership and leverage for the
region’s industrial community. In brief, a low-carbon zone seeks to achieve:

    resource efficiency in energy, materials, and water, with the cost savings
      gained through higher efficiency;

    cleaner production through good operation, reduction and substitution of
      waste materials, separation of by-product or residual materials, etc.;

    use of renewable energy and materials to replace fossil fuel sources and
      finite material supplies;

    rehabilitation of existing buildings to higher energy and environmental
      standards and use of green architecture and engineering in new facility and
      infrastructure design;

    continuous enhancement of resource and energy efficiency in unit process,
      and at the plant and economic zone level through industrial symbiosis;



                                                                                         135
               climate-friendly site planning and industry allocation based on a clear under-
                 standing of the availability of cleaner and non-conventional resources and
                 the feasibility of mobilizing those resources across the zone area (applicable
                 for new economic zones); and

               a new climate-friendly brand of economic zone that attracts investment from
                 the world’s leading companies.
 Toolbox




           Low-Carbon Zones are continually transforming systems that seek to gain multiple
           benefits from each activity. For instance, an integrated resource recovery and indus-
           trial symbiosis system increases industrial resource efficiency, lowers environmental
           degradation, creates opportunities for entrepreneurs and workers, and strengthens
           the local and national economy.




           Purpose of Low-Carbon Zone Guidelines (LCZG)

           The purpose of the Low-Carbon Zone Guidelines (LCZG) is to promote the devel-
           opment of low-carbon zones or the transformation of existing EZs under a zone
           authority, and to streamline the role of the zone authority to facilitate implementa-
           tion of the guidelines.

           The LCZG is the official document that would be implemented by the zone authori-
           ty. Conformity to the guidelines can help ensure a low-carbon transformation of the
           EPZs, EZs, High Tech Parks, Industrial Estates, Clusters, and Complexes and enable
           the enterprises in these zones to operate in a more resource-efficient and climate-
           friendly fashion.

           For new and upcoming EPZs (if any), EZs, High Tech Parks, Industrial Estates,
           Industrial Clusters, or Complexes, the Guidelines can be also referenced to enable
           planning, development, and deployment of low-carbon infrastructure, technologies,
           processes, and practices.

CHAPTER 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS

Item 1: Key Definitions

   [1.1.] ‘Guidelines’ mean indication of policy direction or procedure by which to
   determine or encourage, on a voluntary basis, a course of actions for regulators
   as well as the private sector.

   [1.2.] ‘LCZG’ stands for ‘Low-Carbon Guidelines,’ which are a voluntary set of
   Guidelines to be followed by the economic zone’s authority and enterprises in
   the economic zone. The LCZG aims at streamlining a particular set of actions,
   such as use of energy efficient technologies, processes and practices, use of
   renewable technology, etc., in order to achieve lower GHG emissions in the
   economic zone. Guidelines are not legally binding or mandatory.

   [1.3.] ‘Roadmap’ means a detailed plan of actions to guide progress toward a
   specific goal/target. A Low-Carbon Roadmap in the context of an economic
   zone refers to detailed technical and financial analysis of the identified GHG
   mitigation levers, policies, and regulatory actions that will enable implementa-
   tion of these levers, and a monitoring and review framework to ensure that
   these levers generate desired outcomes.

   [1.4.] ‘Rule’ means a standard for different activities. In the guidelines, it refers
   to any directive or authoritative regulation concerning particular methods or
   procedures for solid/liquid/gaseous emissions and consumption of resources that
   is issued by a relevant authority with the power to make rules.

   [1.5.] ‘Industrial/economic zone or cluster’ is a geographic region with groups of
   inter-related or non-inter-related industries/businesses that drive wealth creation
   in a region.

   [1.6.] ‘Green Cell’ is a proposed institutional structure aimed at facilitating low-
   carbon transformation of economic zones. The Green Cell will formulate the


                                                                                           137
           guidelines/rules for the enterprises, help them implement low-carbon measures
           and finally monitor progress toward the overall green transformation of the
           zone.

           [1.7.] ‘Energy’ means the electricity, steam or heat, gas, petroleum product,
           coal, peat-coal, nuclear, biomass, bio-fuel, bio-gas, hydro-power, solar, wind,
           geothermal, hydrogen cell, tidal and wave, or any other form of energy.
 Toolbox




           [1.8.] ‘Greenhouse gases’ (GHG) are gases in the atmosphere that absorb and
           emit radiation within the thermal infrared range, causing the greenhouse effect,
           which leads to climate change. The Kyoto Protocol recognizes six such GHGs
           that are emitted due to anthropogenic activities: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
           (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFC), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC),
           and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

           [1.9.] ‘Energy audit’ means verification, monitoring, and analysis of machinery,
           appliances, and the processes of utilization of energy entity and determination
           of its efficiency.

           [1.10.] ‘Industrial symbiosis’ refers to the collective collaboration of industry,
           for example the sharing of services, utilities, and by-product resources among
           diverse industrial actors in order to add value, reduce costs, and improve the
           environment. Industrial symbiosis aims to develop industrial ecosystems that
           behave in a similar way to natural ecosystems, wherein everything gets recycled.

           [1.11.] ‘Kyoto Protocol’ is an international agreement linked to the United Na-
           tions Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of the Kyoto
           Protocol is that it sets binding targets for certain industrialized countries and the
           European community for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under the
           treaty, countries must meet their targets primarily through national measures.
           However, the Kyoto Protocol offers them an additional means of meeting their
           targets by way of three market-based mechanisms: emissions trading, the clean
           development mechanism (CDM), and joint implementation (JI).



138
[1.12.] ‘Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)’ is a flexibility mechanism under
the Kyoto Protocol that allows emissions-reduction projects in developing coun-
tries to earn carbon credits or certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each
equivalent to one tonne of CO2. These CERs can then be traded and sold, and
used by industrialized countries to a meet a part of their emissions reduction
targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The mechanism stimulates sustainable devel-
opment and emissions reductions, while giving industrialized countries some
flexibility in how they meet their emissions reduction limitation targets.

[1.13.] ‘Programme of Activities (PoA)’ is a modality of project development
under CDM of UNFCCC that allows replicable projects with low and physi-
cally spread-out GHG emissions into CDM. This type of project often generates
higher sustainable benefits but is too small to pay back the transaction cost
involved in the CDM process.

[1.14.] ‘Life-cycle GHG impact’ is an estimation of the GHG emissions through-
out the full life-cycle (i.e., from raw material extraction through materials pro -
cessing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or
recycling) of a product or system (cradle to grave GHG analysis).

[1.15.] ‘ESCO’ stands for ‘energy service company,’ which is an entity that
provides a broad range of comprehensive energy solutions, including design and
implementation of energy-saving projects, energy conservation, energy infra-
structure outsourcing, power generation and energy supply, and risk manage-
ment to ensure energy savings. The savings in energy costs are often used to
pay back the capital investment of the project over a five-to-20-year period, or
reinvested into the building to allow for capital upgrades that may otherwise be
infeasible. If the project does not provide returns on the investment, the ESCO is
often responsible for paying the difference

[1.16.] ‘HVAC’ stands for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and is the
technology of indoor and automotive environmental comfort. HVAC systems can
be designed to optimize energy efficiency.

             [1.17.] ‘International boiler and pressure vessel code’ (BPVC) is approved and ad-
             opted by the governing council of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
             (ASME). The license for access to the standards is provided by the American
             National Standards Institute (ANSI). These are internationally accepted standards
             and codes for boiler design, operation, and maintenance.

             with high energy content, such as hot flue gases (exhaust) from diesel generator.

             [1.19.] ‘Zero waste’ is a concept involving the elimination of all discharges to
             land, water, or air that are detrimental to the environment and human/animal/
             plant health. It means designing and managing products and processes to sys-
             tematically avoid and eliminate the volume and toxicity of waste and materials,
             conserve and recover all resources, and not burn or bury them in landfills


           CHAPTER 2: LOW-CARBON ZONE

    and also for the enterprises in the zone. Training for the zone authority staff
    shall focus on imparting operational and management best practices on GHG
    mitigation, energy savings, water and waste management and related issues,
    methods of conducting energy audits, and providing energy or GHG, water and
    waste related performance improvement suggestions to the enterprises.

    [2.5.] The zone authority shall set up a ‘Green-Cell’ to provide institutional
    support to the enterprises in terms of technical, informational, and knowledge
    services. This Green Cell shall also help the industries access finance for imple -
    menting low-carbon projects and connect the enterprises to technology suppli-
    ers, equipment vendors, and engineering consultants. The Green Cell may also
    assist in clean technology transfers.

    [2.6.] The zone authority shall set a voluntary GHG emissions reduction target
    for the entire zone and annually monitor progress toward this goal by setting ap-
    propriate performance standards, such as GHG intensity (tCO2e/ tons of produc-
    tion) and energy intensity (kWh/ tons of production or kCal/ tons of production).
    In setting such energy- and/or GHG-related performance standards, the zone
    authority shall consult several national, regional, and sectoral studies commis-
    sioned by the government, donor agencies, research institutes, and other non-
    governmental agencies.


Item 3: Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation Mechanism

    [3.1.] The zone authority shall develop and circulate specific formats and
    protocols25 to each enterprise in the EZs to gather information on total energy
    consumption (kWh, kJ), specific energy consumption (kWh/tons of production,
    kJ/tons of production), specific water consumption (cu meter/ton of production),


25 Specific formats and protocol can be adopted from energy efficiency programs or policy frameworks, to be
introduced by national government agencies, wherever it is appropriate.



                                                                                                              141
             and other relevant utility and production data as deemed necessary to track and
             monitor energy and GHG performance of the enterprises.

             [3.2.] All enterprises shall monitor and report their energy and GHG perfor-
             mance in the pre-circulated format to the zone authority at regular intervals as
             decided by the zone authority.
 Toolbox




             [3.3.] To make the monitoring, reporting, and review mechanism work effi-
             ciently, the zone authority will implement and operate an EZ-wide information
             system that will:

                    a. support inter-enterprise communications;

                    b. provide a centralized data acquisition and analysis system to monitor
                       energy, GHG, and water flow data; and

                    c. inform enterprises on local and national situations related to energy
                        and environmental issues.



           CHAPTER 3: ENERGY EFFICIENCY

           Item 4: Use of Energy Efficient Technologies, Processes, and
                   Practices

             [4.1.] Enterprises can adopt retrofit and/or process improvement and/or equip -
             ment modernization measures to reduce specific energy consumption (kWh/
             tons of production, KJ/ tons of production, etc.) of their operations and report
             on a yearly basis their specific energy performance to energy regulatory authori-
             ties and other relevant authorities through the stipulated reporting format.

             [4.2.] LCZG recommends that each enterprise demonstrate a specific energy
             improvement (decrease in energy consumption per unit of production) of 1%
             every year up to two years from the adoption of the Guidelines and report the
             improvement to the energy regulatory authority and other relevant authorities


142
   on an annual basis. This specific energy improvement target will be revised by
   the energy regulatory authority and other relevant authorities after two years,
   based on a review of each enterprise’s performance.

   [4.3] During planning and construction of new factories and buildings in existing
   EZs or during the development of a new EPZ, both enterprises and the zone
   authority shall include energy efficiency and low GHG emissions as important
   considerations for site development, building construction, infrastructure laying,
   technology selection, equipment purchase, and operational planning.


Item 5: Energy Audit

   [5.1.] Enterprises having an electrical load of 200 kVA or more and steam con-
   sumption of 5 TPH or more are strongly recommended to conduct an energy
   audit and submit the energy audit report and energy efficiency improvement
   plan to the energy regulatory authority and other relevant authorities every year.

   [5.2.] Enterprises emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e per year should
   cooperate with the zone authority to quantify their direct and indirect emissions
   amount and sources in accordance with internationally recognized methodolo-
   gies and good practice.

   [5.3.] Enterprises can seek necessary assistance from the zone authority to
   conduct an energy audit and develop actionable energy efficiency improvement
   plans in line with the GHG emission reduction target of the zone.

   [5.4.] The zone authority shall organize workshops, training, and learning
   sessions to help enterprises conduct energy audits and adopt best practices in
   energy efficiency.

 Toolbox




              [6.1.] Enterprises whose air-conditioning requirement in factory and building
              premises is more than 500 TR can generate an air-conditioning effect utiliz-
              ing the waste heat available from their manufacturing process (for example, by
              installing a vapor absorption machine) subject to availability of the right qual-
              ity and quantity of waste heat. In case no waste heat source is available, the
              enterprises can generate the air-conditioning effect using steam available from a
              centralized steam network or steam from other enterprises.

              [6.2.] Enterprises are recommended to procure energy efficient air conditioning
              machines and operate them efficiently, to minimize the wastage of energy.


           Item 7: Use of Energy Efficient Lighting

              [7.1.] New enterprises are strongly recommended to use LED lamps in all build-
              ings, factories and spaces (such as corridors or washrooms) where there is no
              fixed luminance level requirement.

              [7.2.] Enterprises with existing buildings, factories, and spaces (such as corridors
              or washrooms) where there is no fixed luminance level requirement are strongly
              recommended to replace existing lamps with LED lamps in the next three years.
              Enterprises should also consider maximum usage of daylight instead of electric
              lamps, light coloring of floors and walls, etc. in these areas of no fixed luminance
              level.

              [7.3.] The zone authority shall facilitate the process by organizing workshops



144
   and consultation sessions to help enterprises phase out the existing lights and
   install LED lights.


Item 8: Energy Efficient Use of Boilers

   [8.1.] Proper operation and maintenance is key to energy efficient use of boilers.
   Enterprises are recommended to maintain separate logs to monitor boiler oper-
   ating performance, such as steam generation, fuel consumption, inlet air flow,
   exhaust gas temperature etc.

   [8.2.] Each operating boiler(s) of the enterprises is recommended to undergo
   a boiler efficiency measurement (direct or indirect method) every year by a na-
   tional testing agency and submit the test report to the zone authority. (For more
   information on direct and indirect methods of boiler efficiency measurement,
   please see the additional tools at http://bit.ly/lczhandbook]


Item 9: Energy Efficient Steam Distribution System

           CHAPTER 4: ENERGY SUPPLY (POWER AND HEAT GENERATION)

           Item 10: Waste Heat Recovery

             [10.1.] Enterprises are strongly recommended not to release any waste gas or
             waste heat to the atmosphere without recovering its heat content to the extent
             achievable, subject to the availability of techno-commercially feasible solutions
 Toolbox




             to recover this heat. The waste heat can be recovered to generate steam/hot wa-
             ter and/or power and utilized for the enterprises’ own consumption or supplied
             to other consumers.

             [10.2.] Power generators in EZs (centralized and captive) are strongly recom-
             mended to optimally recover and reuse heat content of waste gas, subject to
             availability of commercially feasible technology and provisions for associated
             infrastructure. The waste heat can be recovered to generate steam/hot water
             and/or power and supplied and distributed to consumers in the EZ. Surplus
             steam/hot water or power (if any, after being supplied in the EZ) can be sold to
             third parties.

             [10.3.] The enterprise and/or power generator interested in entering into the
             cogeneration/heat recovery steam generation, supply, and distribution business
             (hereby referred to as Steam Generator) should be approved by the relevant
             authorities before the commencement of its operation.

             [10.4] The Steam Generator shall be responsible for operating and maintaining
             boilers, pipelines, and the entire steam network as per standards provided by
             the national boiler inspectorate authority. Steam pipelines shall further adhere to
             international codes and standards, such as ASME and ANSI.

             [10.5] Scheduled maintenance of the boiler, steam pipeline, and network shall
             be performed by the Steam Generator and the same shall be built into the con-
             tract between the Steam Generator and the consumers. The Steam Generator
             should also perform a half-yearly safety audit of the steam generation, supply,

  [11.1.] Enterprises are recommended to explore opportunities to source and
  utilize renewable energy resources subject to availability of commercially viable
  technology, infrastructure, and other support mechanisms. Enterprises can seek
  technical assistance and facilitation on financial and contractual matters from
  the energy regulatory authority and other relevant authorities.

  [11.2.] The Power Generator and enterprises with captive generators more than
  1 MWp are encouraged to invest in renewable energy for a minimum of 2% of
  the total generation capacity by 2015. Over a period of 15 years, the same may
  be extended to at least 5% of the total power generation capacity.

  [11.3.] Enterprises, Power Generator, or operator of the Centralized Effluent
  Treatment Plant (CETP) can deploy commercially viable technology to utilize solid
  waste (such as CETP sludge and others) as a source of power and heat genera-
  tion. Enterprises, Power Generator, or CETP operator may seek assistance from
  the zone authority to enable linkages with agencies that can provide technologi-
  cal knowhow, implementation support, financial assistance etc.

  [11.4.] The zone authority can install solar panels for street lights and other
  buildings of the zone authority in the EPZ with automatic dusk-to-dawn opera-
  tion facility and be responsible for the operation and maintenance of these
  lights.

  [11.5.] Pursuant to 11.4, the zone authority may consider the option of con-
  necting the street lights to both solar and grid-connected power. In case solar
  power falls short of lighting requirements, grid power may be used as back-up,
  especially during monsoon seasons.


                                                                                      147
             [11.6.] Enterprises can explore the setting up of rooftop solar panels, either to
             generate electric power (off-grid) or to generate hot water that can be used for
             process or non-process applications. The zone authority will facilitate linkages
             with experienced vendors who can provide and install rooftop solar panels.

             [11.7.] Enterprises are encouraged to explore the potential for carbon revenue
             flow for implementation of renewable energy projects.

             and national waste management guidelines and to support enterprises to treat
             waste in an environmentally friendly way.




148
Item 13: Sludge Waste

  [13.1.] CETP sludge waste may be re-utilized based on its hazardous characteris-
  tics. If the generated sludge from a single CETP unit is insufficient, then the zone
  authority may take responsibility for accumulating sludge wastes of CETPs of all
  EZs and delivering it to suitable reuse facilities.

  [13.2] The zone authority shall try to facilitate linkages, based on availability,
  with vendors that collect sludge waste from a single CETP or CETPs/ETPs across
  EZs. The zone authority shall promote public-private partnerships to attract
  investment in sludge waste management and re-use infrastructure.

  [13.3] Following international practices, the zone authority shall encourage
  the achievement of ‘zero waste’ status for each of the existing EZs, subject to
  technological, infrastructural, financial, and informational constraints in each
  individual EZ.

  [13.4] New EZs should be planned and developed to be ‘zero waste’ from the
  beginning of their operations. The zone authority should facilitate linkages
  between the new EZ developer(s) and international expert organizations with
  expertise in waste management

  and linkages with green building consultants and vendors.



                                                                                          151
             [17.8.] Until the time that a national green building code is enacted, the zone
             authority shall provide knowledge/information support and disseminate best
             practices on green/energy efficient building designs or retrofit. On establishment
             of a national green building code and a national nodal agency such as a Green
             Building Council, the zone authority shall coordinate with the nodal agency to
             conduct capacity development, training, and knowledge dissemination on green
             building techniques in EZs.

           CHAPTER 8: CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM AND CARBON
                      CREDITS

           Item 18: Explore CDM Potential and Participate in Carbon Market

             [18.1.] The zone authority will conduct annual workshops to develop capacity
             on CDM and also to showcase successful CDM cases from the country. The case
             studies should discuss the CDM modalities and flow of carbon revenue to the
             projects. This will also encourage enterprises in CEPZ to explore CDM potential
             for GHG mitigation projects.

             [18.2.] Enterprises shall identify potential CDM projects from the set of energy
             efficiency and low-carbon initiatives being implemented by them. Enterprises
             shall seek assistance from the zone authority to connect them with experts and
             validators who will help them in moving projects through the CDM process
             (project validation and registration) and realizing further monetary benefits.

             [18.3.] The zone authority shall also look into the possibility of developing
             Programmes of Activities (PoA) for potential CDM projects in collaboration with
             DoE. This will help reduce CDM transaction costs for individual enterprises.
