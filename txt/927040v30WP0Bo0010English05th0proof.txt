                               Foreword from the Full Report
Dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world,
damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk.
    Across the three regions studied in the report, record-breaking temperatures are occurring more fre-
quently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions like the Mediter-
ranean are getting dryer. A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity is affecting the
Caribbean and Central America.
    There is growing evidence that warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is locked-in to the
Earth’s atmospheric system due to past and predicted emissions of greenhouse gases, and climate change
impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.
    As the planet warms, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes which occur once in hundreds
of years, if ever, and considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the “new climate
normal” as we approach 4°C—a frightening world of increased risks and global instability.
    The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change,
diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. Ending poverty, increasing global prosperity and reduc-
ing global inequality, already difficult, will be much harder with 2°C warming, but at 4°C there is serious
doubt whether these goals can be achieved at all.
    For this report, the third in the Turn Down the Heat series, we turned again to the scientists at the
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics. We asked them to look at the likely
impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming on agricultural production, water resources, cities
and ecosystems across Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe
and Central Asia.
    Their findings are alarming.
    In Latin America and the Caribbean, heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse
effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. In Brazil, at 2°C warming, crop
yields could decrease by up to 70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat. Ocean acidification,
sea level rise, tropical cyclones and temperature changes will negatively impact coastal livelihoods, tour-
ism, health and food and water security, particularly in the Caribbean. Melting glaciers would be a hazard
for Andean cities.
    In the Middle East and North Africa, a large increase in heat-waves combined with warmer average tem-
peratures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for regional
food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5–2°C and by almost 60 percent at 3–4°C.
At the same time, migration and climate-related pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict.
    In the Western Balkans and Central Asia, reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat
as temperatures rise toward 4°C. Melting glaciers in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows

will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods. In the Balkans, a
higher risk of drought results in potential declines for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In
Macedonia, yield losses are projected of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C
warming. In northern Russia, forest dieback and thawing of permafrost threaten to amplify global warming as
stored carbon and methane are released into the atmosphere, giving rise to a self-amplifying feedback loop.
    Turn Down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal builds on our 2012 report, which concluded
the world would warm by 4°C by the end of this century with devastating consequences if we did not take
concerted action now. It complements our 2013 report that looked at the potential risks to development
under different warming scenarios in Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South Asia, and which
warned that we could experience a 2°C world in our lifetime.
    Many of the worst projected climate impacts outlined in this latest report could still be avoided by
holding warming below 2°C. But, this will require substantial technological, economic, institutional and
behavioral change. It will require leadership at every level of society.
    Today the scientific evidence is overwhelming, and it’s clear that we cannot continue down the current
path of unchecked, growing emissions. The good news is that there is a growing consensus on what it will
take to make changes to the unsustainable path we are currently on.
    More and more voices are arguing that is possible to grow greener without necessarily growing slower.
Today, we know that action is urgently needed on climate change, but it does not have to come at the
expense of economic growth. We need smart policy choices that stimulate a shift to clean public transport
and energy efficiency in factories, buildings and appliances can achieve both growth and climate benefits.
    This last report in the Turn Down the Heat series comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, the UN
Secretary General’s Climate Summit unleased a new wave of optimism. But our reports make clear that
time is of the essence.
    Governments will gather first in Lima and then Paris for critical negotiations on a new climate treaty.
Inside and outside of the conference halls, global leaders will need to take difficult decisions that will require,
in some instances, short term sacrifice but ultimately lead to long term gains for all.
    At the World Bank Group we will use our financial capacity to help tackle climate change. We will
innovate and bring forward new financial instruments. We will use our knowledge and our convening
power. We will use our evidence and data to advocate and persuade. In short, we will do everything we
can to help countries and communities build resilience and adapt to the climate impacts already being felt
today and ensure that finance flows to where it is most needed.
     Our response to the challenge of climate change will define the legacy of our generation. The stakes
have never been higher.

The Latin America and the Caribbean region encompasses a huge diversity of landscapes and ecosystems. The region is highly
heterogeneous in terms of economic development and social and indigenous history. It is also one of the most urbanized regions in
the world. In Latin America and the Caribbean, temperature and precipitation changes, heat extremes, and the melting of glaciers
will have adverse effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes, and biodiversity. In Brazil, without additional adaptation,
crop yields could decrease by 30–70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat at 2°C warming. Ocean acidification,
sea level rise, and more intense tropical cyclones will affect coastal livelihoods and food and water security, particularly in the
Caribbean. Local food security is also seriously threatened by the projected decrease in fishery catch potential. Reductions and
shifts in water availability would be particularly severe for Andean cities. The Amazon rainforest may be at risk of large scale forest
degradation that contributes to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and local and regional hydrological changes.

     The Pacific slopes in Colombia receive on average more than

     Box 1.9: Surface Ozone Concentrations
     Surface ozone concentrations have negative impacts on agricultural yields. The impact on crop yields strongly depends on the seasonal and
     regional distribution of surface ozone, as it is not distributed evenly in the atmosphere (Teixeira et al. 2011). Declines in yield levels currently range
     from 7–125 percent for wheat, from 6–16 percent for soybeans, from 3–4 percent for rice, and from 3–5 percent for maize; wheat and soybeans are
     especially sensitive to surface ozone (Van Dingenen et al. 2009; Teixeira et al. 2011). Jaggard et al. (2010) noted that the impact of ozone on crop
     yields has been neglected in many climate impact projections and found that the benefits of the CO2 fertilization effect (see Box 2.4) could be offset
     by the negative effect of increased ozone concentrations on C3 plants (and even lead to a yield reduction of five percent in C4 plants). By 2030,
     increasing surface ozone could lead to yield declines in Latin America by up to 7.8 percent for wheat, 2.9 percent for maize, and 7.5 percent for
     soybeans depending on the emissions levels of ozone precursors (Avnery et al. 2011).

     Box 1.10: Critical Ecosystem Services of High Andean Mountain Ecosystems
     A highly critical ecosystem service provided by the LAC region is that of carbon storage. For example the ecosystems of the Andean mountains,
     including tropical montane cloud forests, the high-altitude wetlands, and the páramos ecosystem, store large amounts of carbon. Despite the fact
     that they cover a mere 3 percent of global land area they store about 30 percent of the global carbon stock of terrestrial ecosystems (Peña et al.
     2011). Further, numerous large cities (such as Quito, Bogota or La Paz) extract part of their water supply from páramos areas.

     Years indicate the decade during which warming levels are exceeded with a 50 percent or greater change (generally at start of decade) in a business-as-usual scenario
(RCP8.5 scenario) (and not in mitigation scenarios limiting warming to these levels, or below, since in that case the year of exceeding would always be 2100, or not at all).
Exceedance with a likely chance (>66 percent) generally occurs in the second half of the decade cited. Impacts are given for warming levels irrespective of the timeframe (i.e.,
if a study gives impacts for 2°C warming in 2100 then the impact is given in the 2°C column). If a study refers to a warming level by the end of the century, this is marked
with an asterisk (*). Impacts given in the observations column do not necessarily form the baseline for future impacts. Impacts for different warming levels may originate
from different studies and therefore may be based on different underlying assumptions; this means that the impacts are not always fully comparable (e.g., crop yields may
decrease more under a 3°C than a 4°C scenario because underlying the impact at 3° warming is a study that features very strong precipitation decreases). Moreover, this
report did not systematically review observed impacts. It highlights important observed impacts for current warming but does not conduct any formal process to attribute
impacts to climate change.
