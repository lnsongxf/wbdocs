           Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
           X   Increasing the rehabilitation of the water infrastructure and improving its reliability. Although
               there has been much progress in the replacement and rehabilitation of the water and sanitation
               infrastructure, water losses in some utilities remain very high, evidence that more replacement
               work is needed. In addition, the hydrological drought of 2011–2012 proved that numerous water
               supply systems may experience serious problems in case of prolonged drought.
           X   Improving monitoring and reporting practices. The only effective monitoring system currently
               is the water quality monitoring scheme. There are no other utility performance monitoring and
               reporting systems, such as on water balance, water losses, and nonrenewable water. This makes
               monitoring of improvements in operational efficiency and sound economic management of water
               utilities almost impossible.

Economy. Slovenia has been an EU member since 2004 and has one of the highest per capita GDPs in Central
Europe. Slovenia has experienced one of the most stable political transitions in Central and South-Eastern Europe.
However, long-delayed privatizations and an increasingly indebted banking sector have fueled investor concerns since
2012. The 2008–2009 economic crisis hit Slovenia especially hard in the real estate and construction sectors, and
the unemployment rate rose to 13% in 2014, according to the Slovenia Statistical Office (SURS 2015). The country’s 2
million inhabitants are evenly distributed between urban and rural areas, but there are regional disparities between the
wealthier and more developed central and western regions and the less developed eastern regions.

Governance. Public administration is organized at the national and municipal levels. Slovenia is a parliamentary
republic composed of 212 municipalities. Local self-government units perform activities such as local spatial planning
and development and provision of local public services including water and wastewater services.

Water resources. Slovenia has good-quality and sufficient water resources. Eighty-one percent of the Slovenian
territory belongs to the Black Sea basin, and the rest is part of the Adriatic Sea basin (ICPDR 2010). With 15,411 m3/
capita/year, there are sufficient quantities of water on average in Slovenia, and most of it is in a good ecological state.
However, agriculture has had a severe impact on groundwater quality, and there is a concern about the decreasing
groundwater level in certain areas due to overabstraction. Industrial and domestic pollution of surface water is
present in the Sava River and in coastal waters, where heavy metals and toxic chemicals threaten water quality.
Runoff and river flow characteristics have changed significantly due to urbanization, transportation, and construction
of hydropower plants. As a result, floods, especially flash floods due to hilly terrain, are more frequent and more
intense, causing extensive material damage to infrastructure (including water and wastewater assets) and concerning
more than 15% of the country’s territory (ICPDR 2010). Due to the increasing concentration of population located
at the bottom of basins and broad valleys (where almost two-thirds of Slovenes reside), a significant share of the
population now lives in areas exposed to floods. This is the case for both rural and urban settlements. Climate change
is expected to reinforce flood and drought frequency and amplitude. However, no action plan has been implemented.

Water supply sources. Drinking water supply relies almost exclusively on groundwater. Surface water is
predominantly used for the production of electric energy in hydroelectric power stations, while groundwater provides
97% of the raw water for potable public supply (ICPDR 2015). Industry is another significant user of water. Only a

small share of water consumption is used for agriculture, tourism, services, and fish farming. The major source
of surface water pollution comes from point sources (emissions from industrial and communal wastewaters and
rainwater from urbanized areas). In still or slow-flowing surface waters, the occurrence of eutrophication due to
excessive amounts of nutrients is a significant problem. Groundwater is mostly susceptible to diffuse pollution from
agriculture and urbanization, which is most pronounced in the very north-eastern part of Slovenia. Critical pollutants
significantly contributing to this pollution are desetilatrazine, nitrates, and atrazine. Concentrations of atrazine and
desetilatrazine are generally declining, however, due to the ban on their use (ICPDR 2010). Karstic characteristics of
more than one-third of the Slovene territory result in specific management issues for water utilities, such as turbidity
and risks of microbiological contamination in case of intensive precipitation or difficulties managing drinking water
protection zones (ICPDR 2010).

Capacity and training. Staff capacity building and training is an important issue in the water sector. Water
services management staff is appointed by municipal representatives, and political influence is exerted on the utility
management board. However, turnover according to political cycles is not necessarily the rule. Staff training has
mainly been driven by individual initiatives from water utilities, which are largely undocumented and one-off. The
lack of well-trained technical and financial personnel has led to inefficiency in the technical operations and financial
management of some water utilities. Thus, there is room for improvement of staff training and for development of
staff capacity in the water sector. The national water association does not currently provide training or technical
assistance to water stakeholders.

Economic regulation. Local government units are in charge of service quality and tariff setting. The water
sector in Slovenia is regulated through a public self-regulated model, since there is no national regulatory agency.
A partial benchmarking approach has been adopted by the Ministry of Environment, but it is not being used as an
economic regulatory tool (MOP 2015a). Service quality and tariff setting are the responsibility of municipalities,
which must follow a mandatory methodology spelled out in a decree issued in January 2013. This new pricing
mechanism is based on the cost recovery principle. Tariffs are revised on an annual basis by utilities and must
be approved by municipal councils. Prior to this decree, water tariffs were controlled by the central government
and were kept very low.

Ongoing or planned reforms. There has recently been little change in the water supply sector. Many water utilities
in urban areas have been in continuous operation for more than a century. After the transition process in the 1990s,
the number of municipalities increased from 60 to 212, and the number of water services increased to 98 utilities.
Prompted by the EU integration process,1 large investments were made to improve wastewater collection and
treatment, and to a lesser extent to enhance water supply. Currently, however, there are no significant institutional
reforms ongoing in the sector.

Service infrastructure. One-fourth of the Slovenian water network was installed before 1920. From 2000 to
2010, the rehabilitation of water supply systems was boosted by EU grants and funding specifically dedicated to
water infrastructure improvement. Slovenian water pipes are made of polyethylene high-density (PEHD) (53%), of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (10%), cast iron (8%), or asbestos and cement (10%). This latter material (now discarded
in modern water systems) is liable to cracking and leakage. Among the 486 water treatment plants, 72% rely on
chlorine disinfection and 13% on mechanical and chemical treatment.

Quality of service. Drinking water quality in Slovenia improved during 2004–2013 for both microbiological and
chemical parameters. The compliance rate has steadily increased over the last decade to 92% in 2013 (Figure 4).
However, there are still some potable water quality issues in small settlements. Average water consumption is 114
liters per day and service is continuous throughout the day.

Customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of the population with the service provided in their city is very high, at 90%
(Gallup 2013), higher than in most countries in the region.

Overall efficiency. Because there are few data on efficiency, a proper assessment of the efficiency of the water sector
cannot be made. However, we can say that in 2012, nonrevenue water amounted to 31% or 7 m3/day/km, in line with most
countries in the region. The metering level is high at 95%. There are no data regarding staff productivity.

Recent trends. The evolution of the efficiency of the water sector cannot be analyzed due to lack of data. No information
regarding the evolution of the efficiency of utilities is available. The water sector needs to be better assessed and monitored
in order to monitor future improvement in efficiency.

Investment needs. To meet investment needs, the annual per capita capital expenditure would have to triple. At
present, investments are needed for the renovation of existing water infrastructure and to reduce water leakage. In the
Operational Program for Urban Waste Water Drainage and Treatment, the investments in wastewater management
from all financial sources (EU funds, the national budget, the local community budget, and the environmental water
pollution tax) for 2009–2015 are estimated at around €1.6 billion, or approximately €266 million per year or €114 per
capita per year.

Cost recovery. Utilities only recover operation and maintenance costs through tariffs. With water tariffs controlled
by the central government until January 2013, water utilities struggled to generate adequate revenues to cover their
costs. According to the national legislation on water tariff setting, local government units can partially subsidize the
water price using their municipal budget. However, this option is not often used.

Tariffs. Water tariffs are composed of a fixed and a variable             Figure 8: Share of potential average water and
fee and amount to an average of €2.14/m3. According to                    sanitation expenditure in income
the January 2013 decree, the water tariff comprises a fixed
charge for service availability, which is set depending on                5%

the meter diameter, and a volume charge proportionate to
water consumption. This tariff structure is uniform for all               4%
categories of water users (households, public institutions,
industry). However, in specific cases, very large industries              3%
can directly negotiate water tariffs with the local public
provider. The average water price is €0.98/m3, including                  2%
the fixed charge. The average sanitation price is €1.16/

Affordability. The water and sanitation tariff does not currently trigger any affordability issues. The share of
water and wastewater expenses in average household income has remained stable over time at 0.8% in both 1996
and 2013. For the bottom 40%, potential water expenses are 1.1% of household income, which does not trigger an
affordability issue at present (Figure 8).




Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
To evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment was done,
taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services, and financing
of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For each indicator,
best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest to those best
performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology to assess the
sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube Water Program.
The outcomes of this assessment for the Slovenia water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also shows average and
best practices in the Danube region. The Slovenian sector sustainability score is 84, which is above the Danube average
sustainability score of 64. The assessment shows that, on average, the country performs well in terms of access to
piped water and flush toilets, affordability, continuity of service, customer satisfaction, nonrevenue water, and collection
ratio. The main deficiencies of Slovenia’s water sector identified through the sector sustainability assessment are
wastewater treatment coverage, operating cost ratio, and investment level (Figure 9).

The main sector challenges are:

X   Increasing the rehabilitation of the water infrastructure and improving its reliability. Although there has been
    much progress in the replacement and rehabilitation of the water and sanitation infrastructure, water losses
    in some utilities remain very high, evidence that more replacement work is needed. The funding required must
    be secured. In addition, the hydrological drought of 2011–2012 revealed that numerous water supply systems
    may experience serious problems in case of prolonged drought. The reliability of the water supply under extreme
    hydrological conditions needs to be improved.
