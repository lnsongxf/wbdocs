Executive Summary

         This paper is a review of the Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA) Program operated by
the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR). The objective is to present a general assessment of the
main characteristics of the program and a preliminary examination of what ACCA has accomplished in
three years of operation. The analysis compares ACCA’s approach to the provision of housing and
infrastructure in low-income areas, to more common ways of managing slum upgrading and housing
finance.

         The analysis shows that, in the countries where the macroeconomic and institutional context
exclude the urban poor from financial solutions and access to services, the community finance
mechanisms implemented through ACCA and the creation of community development funds offer a
reliable alternative in the provision of housing and infrastructure for low-income communities. This
alternative does not aim to replace already existing institutional and financial structures, but through its
incremental process, promotes deep transformational and systemic changes.

        The program achieves this through relatively simple steps, but is conceptually elaborate in that
it addresses a composite nexus of market and government failures, which affect the urban poor and
diminish the dynamism and livability of the cities where they live. The program carries out four
functions: it subsidizes small scale infrastructure, provides finance, gets involved in land market
development by securing land rights for slum dwellers, and often provides them architectural and
planning assistance.

         When compared with other approaches to upgrading low income areas, such as public housing
or sites and services programs, ACCA appears to perform well through its carefully-designed and
targeted subsidy, its capacity to detect “signals of seriousness” on the part of the community (thereby
targeting assistance to those who value it the most), and its capacity to slow down the process of real
estate development in ways that reduce some of the speculative waves that often characterize urban
redevelopment. Furthermore, the demand-side orientation, augmented where necessary by technical
assistance, promises to provide a more efficient way to channel resources so that poor people become
more engaged in addressing their circumstances. Not only does the community’s involvement as
decision-makers have a strong role to play on the cost effectiveness of the investments undertaken, it
also creates communities which have successfully interacted with local government in ways that are
likely to lead to deeper and more constructive engagement with their local officials.

        This preliminary assessment of the assistance provided by ACCA suggests that it has a
transformational, systemic effect. The ACCA program achieves this through a small subsidy that can
elicit major and seemingly on-going actions. While ACCA has only been in operation for 3 years and its
longer-term impacts have not yet been fully evaluated, this particular form of demand-responsive action
has been previously implemented successfully on a national level, through the Community Organization
Development Institute (CODI) in Thailand. ACCA has successfully pushed this approach on a broader
regional scale to a number of poor, institutionally weak countries.

1. Introduction

         This paper is a review of the experience of the Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA)
Program operated by the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR). The objective is to examine what
ACCA has accomplished in three years of operation (2009-2012) under a Gates Foundation grant. The
review is based on field visits to three of the countries served by ACCA – Thailand, Cambodia, and
Vietnam—and discussions with community leaders from three other countries – Nepal, the Philippines,
and Sri Lanka. Numerous discussions were held with the ACHR leadership, staff from the Community
Organization Development Institute (CODI) of Thailand, and the Thailand Development Research
Institute (TDRI).1 In addition, a review was conducted of the literature prepared by and about ACHR, as
well as a filtering and synthesis of the status of the cities and countries that made use of ACCA in terms
of their broader economic conditions and local governance capabilities. Given that ACCA operates in
more than 150 cities in 19 countries, this review is by no means an audited account of its activities.

       1.1. The Asian Coalition for Housing Rights2

         The Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR) was founded in 1988 as a forum for urban social
activists, non-government organizations (NGOs), professionals and grassroots or community groups
working in Asian cities. Its initial emphasis was on housing rights and the problems of evictions of the
poor in Asian cities. This was supplemented by activities for ACHR partners including cross country
learning, exchange visits, regional workshops, training, new country action programs and research.

        In the 2000s, the organization introduced community savings and credit activities, and
supported the development of many Community Development Funds in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Nepal, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Philippines and India. It also helped respond to the 2004 tsunami
through community-driven relief and rehabilitation. The organization engages in policy advocacy,
working with local and national governments. Some ACHR approaches have been integrated into
government policies, while others have been successfully up-scaled without government support. ACHR
is the Asian branch of the Habitat International Coalition and an Executive Committee member of
CITYNET. It also works closely with Slum/Shack Dwellers International (SDI) and collaborates with various
United Nations organizations and the World Bank.

        ACHR has been implementing the Asian Coalition for Community Action Program, the subject of
this paper, since 2009.

       1.2. The Asian Coalition for Community Action Program – Overview

community for a larger housing project; it helps the community design its housing and infrastructure by
providing architectural and planning assistance; and it helps the community acquire formal land title, by
negotiating land purchase, a land grant or a long-term lease from the owners.

       A major element of the ACCA program is community savings. ACCA often takes a city-wide
approach, surveying communities in an entire city at a time, helping them learn from one another’s
experiences, and linking their savings into a larger City Development Fund. It also leverages funds from
government and other sources for inclusion in the City Development Fund.

       These seemingly simple steps address a composite nexus of market and government failures.
The program aims to bring about social cohesion and empowerment through the development of
community groups who work together as part of the project and make decisions about their own
development. The demand-responsive, people-driven nature of the approach is its key principle.

    1.3. Summary of ACCA Activities 2009-2012

         The initial target of the ACCA program was to support a process of citywide slum upgrading in
150 Asian cities. By the end of its third year, in 2012, the program had supported activities in 165 cities,
in 19 countries (see Figure 2). In all these 165 cities, citywide community surveys are being conducted,
and are being used to identify, prioritize and plan settlement upgrading projects. These projects are
then carried out by the communities, in partnership with their city governments. Housing projects being
implemented with ACCA support have so far helped 42,760 urban poor families, and have also
facilitated the creation of City Development Funds, which are now operating as new joint financial
mechanisms in 98 of these cities. Small upgrading projects (like walkways, drains, toilets, water supply,
community centers and solid waste systems) have been implemented in 963 poor communities and
have benefited 146,000 families. The amount of ACCA’s financial support is usually small, only $58,000
per city. (ACHR, 2012)

         The following section describes the components of the ACCA program, starting with its
institutional and financial structure, followed by its activities: surveying and mapping, small grant-
financed infrastructure projects, larger loan-financed housing projects, community finance, negotiating
land tenure, disaster relief, and design support.

         Section 3 then compares ACCA’s approach to alternative ways of carrying out its main activities:
that is, providing subsidies, finance, and a framework for urban real estate development. The strengths
and weaknesses of each component of the ACCA program are compared to alternative rationales in
terms of the market or government failures addressed. A final section explores potential avenues for
support by the donor community to the program, and areas for future research.

2. The ACCA Program
The information in this section is adapted mainly from ACHR’s publication “165 Cities in Asia: Third Yearly Report of
the Asian Coalition for Community Action Programme” released in November 2012. Additional information is taken
from ACHR’s website.

       2.1. ACCA Institutional Structure 3

         ACHR sees the basic working unit of the ACCA program as the city, as opposed to the project or
the individual community. The ACCA program is implemented by groups already working in the project
cities on issues of urban poverty and housing, with established links with community groups and local
governments. Most of these organizations are already part of the ACHR network. The ACCA program
creates a city-wide mechanism for implementing projects it supports. The program also supports the
setting up of national mechanisms to facilitate the same coordination, learning and mutual support at
the country-wide level. Some sub-regional groupings have also emerged, in which groups in neighboring
countries assist each other (e.g. South Asia).

         The first step of the program in a city is city-wide surveys and mapping of settlements. This is
followed by bringing these groups together through forums, meetings and workshops. Through these
means, the poor in these communities form networks, which include existing community organizations.
They decide on a common citywide development agenda for the program in that city. These networks
also allow communities to learn from each other, conduct the city-wide surveys and mapping exercises,
create joint savings, and negotiate collectively for land or other resources.

        Project plans are prepared by community groups, following the program’s guidelines, and
proposed in batches every two or three months to the Regional ACCA Committee, which reviews the
proposed projects. The Regional ACCA Committee has 15 members: 9 representatives from countries
currently active in the program, 3 community representatives, 2 ‘senior’ representatives, and 1
representative of the ACHR Secretariat. Besides reviewing project proposals, the Committee’s
responsibilities include supporting the cities involved in the program, and knowledge sharing through
exchange visits, forums of communities and community architects, and linking with international
organizations. In addition to the Regional Committee, many countries also have national committees,
and most cities have city development committees.

        The ACHR Secretariat coordinates the ACCA program by facilitating the ACCA process in the
countries, producing documents and reports, and linking the program to global donors and
development agencies. ACCA links its project cities with other, non-ACCA cities into what it describes as
a larger, country-wide learning process, which “nudges” various development initiatives already
underway towards a more community-driven model. These national networks are in turn linked to
regional knowledge-sharing platforms, through meetings and site visits in various countries in Asia.

        Local governments also become involved in the ACCA program, with partnerships between
communities and the government having been formed in 102 out of the 111 ‘big’ projects. This takes
several forms. Joint city development committees have been set up in 145 cities so far. The government
has provided land in 64 cities. In many cities, local governments have provided infrastructure (such as
paved access roads, drains, sewers, electric and water connections), and in some cases, technical help,
building materials and the loan of heavy construction equipment. Such partnerships facilitate future
joint activities. In some cases, governments have responded to ACCA efforts by adjusting existing
planning standards to better suit the needs of the poor. As described in later sections, local
governments also provide budget support to City Development Funds and projects.

    2.2. ACCA Program Finances

         As of November 2012, at the end of the program’s third year, the program’s total budget was
US$ 11 million. This money, from a Gates Foundation grant, is administered by the International
Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). However, the ACCA money constitutes the least of
the total budget required for community activities—the greater share is provided by government (local
and central, much of it in the form of land), and by the communities themselves (see Table 1). Most of
this budget is used by the communities themselves for building large housing projects and small
upgrading projects. The maximum ACCA spends per city is just US$ 58,000. The large projects are
financed through loans to the communities. The repayments of these loans are used to seed (or expand
existing) City Development Funds. While most of the small upgrading projects are funded by ACCA
grants, some community groups in Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines and Indonesia have used these
grants as loans also, repaying the amount to a revolving fund in a similar manner to support future
rounds of upgrading projects.

Table 1: Contributions to ACCA projects by source




         While the grant and loan amounts are fixed, communities are given flexibility in how to utilize
the funds. The grants are intended to mobilize community action and also to leverage funds from other
sources and catalyze partnerships within the city. Of the US$ 58,000 per city, the program sets aside just
US$ 3,000 for city-level activities such as surveys and meetings. In most countries, US$ 10,000 is used for
national-level activities, such as events and advocacy. According to ACCA, the modest, fixed budget
ceilings for its activities (see Box 2) induces clarity and transparency, and takes the emphasis off budget-
related aspects, instead encouraging communities to use the limited allocations in strategic and creative
ways.

     Box 2: ACCA’s $58,000 budget per city

     $15,000 for at least five small upgrading projects, in at least five different communities in each
     city.

     $40,000 for one big housing project with a maximum of seven or eight big housing projects per
     country (not all ACCA cities have implemented big housing projects).

     $3,000 for city process support, to cover a variety of joint development processes within the
     city, such as surveying and mapping, network-building, support for savings activities, local
     meetings and exchanges.

     In addition, $10,000 per country per year for national coordination, including meetings,
     exchange visits, advocacy.

        Figure 3 provides a breakdown of ACCA’s expenditures, and shows that over 70% of the budget
is passed on to the poor, another 21% of the budget goes to capacity-building activities, and only 8%
goes to administration and coordination (ACHR and IIED).

   2.3. Surveying and Mapping

        In almost all ACCA cities, some form of city-wide information gathering about poor communities
has taken place. These activities may include comprehensive socio-economic surveys and mapping,
including mapping of vacant land in the city and planned development projects affecting communities.
Other information gathering activities may be restricted to the settlements and communities involved in
the program.

         National surveys have been carried out in 10 countries. These include two national surveys of
communities with insecure land in 27 cities in Cambodia by teams of national community leaders and
City Development Fund staff; a 20-city survey of slum communities in Nepal by the two community
federations with support from an NGO; a national survey and mapping of urban poor communities in 33
cities in high-risk and disaster-prone areas by the Homeless People’s Federation in the Philippines; and

and in eight cities in Indonesia. The ACHR Secretariat is working on developing a database of ACCA
activities that can be used by communities.

                                           (Source: ACHR, 2011)


    2.4. Small Projects
        ‘Small’ projects under ACCA must be physical upgrading projects for shared infrastructure, e.g.
they may not be equipment for income generation for households. The rationale is that physical
upgrading is visible, and the visibility of this collective draws the attention of local authorities and
challenges existing power relations. They are also intended to pull together the community, and to
strengthen their negotiating power with authorities. While the funding for these small projects is usually
given to communities as grants, some local community groups may give them to communities as
revolving loans.

        Figure 4 shows the sources of funds for these ‘small’ projects. The grant from ACCA is meant to
provide an incentive for communities to mobilize other sources of funds. As the figure shows,
communities have successfully leveraged an equal amount from government, from community
contributions and others.

INDONESIA

        Ledok Gajah is a river-side settlement of 45 families, located between a river and a drainage
canal in central Yogyakarta. Their road-paving project came out of an organizing process that started
with ACCA, with support from a group of local architects. After mapping and surveying their settlement,
setting up a women’s savings group and linking with other riverside slums, they planned and built this
135m paved road, with side drains, which links all the houses. A US$500 grant from ACCA was topped up
by another US$600 from community members, who did all the work themselves, working together one
day a week.

VIETNAM

        Before and after shots of the paved alley-way which links 150 poor households in Block 3, Ward
5 in the city of Ben Tre. Like all Vietnamese ACCA cities, the communities in Ben Tre use ACCA small
project funds as loans (at 4-6% annual interest) through their CDF, rather than as grants, so the money
can revolve and help more communities. And like most other small projects in Vietnam, this community
used the ACCA loan (US$3,369) to leverage a much bigger amount from community members ($3,190)
and from their Ward Office (US$5,199) to replace a muddy and perpetually flooded walkway with a
paved road they built themselves.




MONGOLIA

        41 out of 74 of the small ACCA projects implemented by savings groups in Mongolia so far have
been playgrounds and parks. But this savings group in Ulaanbaatar’s Khan-Uul District used their small
ACCA grant of US$3,000 to set up a cement paving-block manufacturing operation. They used the paving
blocks to lay sidewalks along the muddy, unpaved and often-flooded roads in their ger area.

FIJI

         A fifth of the population of Lautoka, Fiji’s second largest city, lives in 34 informal settlements.
The People’s Community Network is using the small projects to organize these communities around
activities which directly improve their living conditions and strengthen their negotiations for secure
land. The Natabua community (left) used a US$3,000 ACCA grant (matched by another US$1,000 from
the community and US$3,000 from the local government) to improve their drains and roads. The
Navoata community (right) used their ACCA grant to build a stone sea-wall along their fast-eroding
coastline.




LAO PDR

        In Muang Kong District in southern Lao PDR, people live along shores of the Mekong River and
on tiny islands in the river. Most of the water is too polluted to drink, so the five ACCA small projects
have involved developing underground drinking water supply systems. So far, they have built 141
artesian wells and electric pumps (like this one at Baan Beungngam, which cost just US$175) which serve
several houses. All the ACCA small project funds in Lao are managed as no-interest loans (repayable in 6
months) to the women’s savings groups, through their district-level community funds.

   2.5. Big Projects

        ACCA’s ‘big’ projects focus on housing provision and aim to provide “new, comprehensive and
people-driven housing alternatives” (ACHR, 2012). As of November 2012, 47 housing projects were
completed, with 54 underway. Ten projects were unable to begin due to difficulties related to land. Only
18% of the big projects (20 projects) involved the relocation of whole communities, while more than
49% (54 projects) had been able to upgrade or reconstruct in place. Twenty-one percent of the projects
(23 projects) provided loans for housing improvements to households in scattered locations, and 12%
(14 projects) created new communities of previously scattered squatters on new land. Figure 5 shows a
breakdown of the kinds of projects included.


                                 Figure 5: Types of ‘big’ ACCA projects




        As with the small projects, the ACCA funds are expected to leverage additional funds. Table 2
shows that 80% of the total budget for the ‘big’ activities comes from the government, while ACCA’s
grant constitutes a mere 4%. The balance is contributed by the communities themselves and others.

PEAM RO DISTRICT, CAMBODIA

         Pro Lay Toek was a small community of 33 extremely poor evicted households in Peam Ro
District, living in thatched huts on a long strip of flood-prone land along a canal. They used support from
ACCA to plan and upgrade their settlement in-situ, with land filling, infrastructure and new 2-story row
houses. They used their planning as a bargaining chip to persuade the Commune Council authorities to
give them the land for free, on a collective land title. The people used a US$ 4,500 loan from the Urban
Poor Development Fund to buy an extra 1.5m strip of land to slightly widen the individual house plots
and make room for an access road.




                                                             20
YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA

        Ledok Gajah Wong is a river-side settlement of 45 families in central Yogyakarta. With support
from a group of young architects, they mapped and surveyed their settlement, set up a women’s savings
group, linked with other river-side slums and built a 135m paved walkway, with a small project grant
from ACCA. Now they have used the US$ 40,000 big project funds from ACCA to set up a citywide
revolving loan fund for house improvements, with the first loans going to Ledok Gajah Wong. Since then,
they have been able to negotiate long term leases in this and another riverside settlement from the
government.




YANGON, MYANMAR

         The country’s first-ever community-planned, community-built and collectively-owned urban
poor housing relocation project has been completed by 50 landless squatters in Hlaing Tar Yar Township,
on the outskirts of Yangon. After years trying to buy government land for relocating, they formed a
savings group, collectively bought a small piece of agricultural land nearby and made a housing project
on it. The US$ 40,000 ACCA big project funds were used as loans (US$ 800 per family for both land and
                                                  21
house), which the women will repay in 5 years, in monthly installments, to the new citywide community
development fund.




CALOOCAN, PHILIPPINES

        In a context where relocating poor communities to remote resettlement sites is still the norm,
the housing project being built by the Binina Homeowners Association is an important example of “in-
barangay” relocation. These 76 squatter families collectively bought a small piece of private land
(1,260m2) in the same barangay for US$ 71,820, partly with their savings and partly with loans from the
Community Mortgage Programme. The US$ 40,000 from ACCA is being used to seed the new citywide
revolving loan fund, with the first batch of housing loans going to the families at Binina to construct
double unit row-houses, with one loft-unit up and one down.




                                                  22
VINH, VIETNAM

        When the city announced plans to evict and redevelop all of the old collective workers housing
in Vinh, 29 families in one of those communities, in Cua Nam Ward, decided to propose to redevelop
their housing themselves. The plans they developed, with help from the community architects, included
widening the lanes, laying drains and rebuilding their small houses in an efficient layout of 2-story row-
houses on 45m2 plots. They used this redevelopment plan, and the availability of housing loans from
ACCA, to negotiate with the authorities, which finally agreed to the people’s proposal. The project is
now completed.




LAUTOKA, FIJI

        When the government in Lautoka announced plans to evict about 400 households in 5 fishing
communities along the coast, to expand an industrial zone, the community network used its citywide
survey as a tool to negotiate a compromise, where some families who depend on fishing would stay in
one consolidated area, and 200 families would relocate to a big 10-hectare piece of fully-serviced nearby
land being provided by the government, on long-term community lease. The community architects
helped the people plan the new layout, and the US$ 40,000 from ACCA is being used to give housing
loans to the first 20 families.




                                                   23
RANGSIT, THAILAND

        When the community network in Rangsit surveyed the city, they found 87 communities with
insecure land. In the citywide planning process that followed, they divided these communities into those
that can negotiate to stay and upgrade in situ and those that need to relocate - many to several big
tracts of government land they have negotiated to get, on long-term lease. Most of these projects are
being financed by CODI, but for poor families who cannot get loans or for various finance gaps (like this
relocation of riverside squatters at Sang San), they give loans from their citywide network fund, which
was set up with seed capital from ACCA.




MUANG NGOY, LAO PDR

        Riverside villagers in Lao PDR are being evicted by the thousands to make way for big dams
being built in the government’s push to export hydroelectricity. The housing project at Buam Nalay, in
the remote Muang Ngoy District in northern Lao, is an attempt to show a more humane, more
collaborative and more people-driven alternative to these impoverishing evictions. 92 poor farming
families, from 3 villages scheduled to be submerged by a dam, have been resettled to 16 hectares of
free government land nearby. The ACCA funds are being used to develop basic services and housing
improvements.

    2.6. Community Finance

         The funds for big projects serve two purposes: to finance the project as well as to seed (or add
to) a city-based community development fund. The project loans are channeled through this fund, and
repayments are made back to it. ACHR sees the creation of the fund as the more important long-term
achievement than the funding of the initial project. The sequence of development of these funds has
varied between countries – in some countries, it started with national funds (Cambodia and Sri Lanka);
in some, with started with city-based funds (Nepal, Myanmar and Vietnam); and in some, from strong
savings groups on the ground (Mongolia and Lao PDR).

        Ninety-eight City Development Funds have been created, with over 274,000 active savers. Some
funds stay in the city, while others revolve back into a national fund and are used in various cities at
different times, as in Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Philippines and Mongolia. Of these 98 city funds, local
governments have contributed to 55 in 8 countries. While this amounts to only 11% of the total amount
in these funds (see Table 3), ACHR interprets these contributions as an important signal of government
support. ACCA funds also help leverage funds from other sources. As Table 2 in the previous section
shows, ACCA’s funds account for only 4% of the total budget of the big projects.

        In 2010, the ACCA Regional Loan Fund was launched as an additional, experimental fund. This
new fund draws from the ACCA big housing project budget (up to US$ 400,000), and would give loans of
up to US$ 50,000 to country groups at 4% annual interest, to be repaid in half-yearly repayments over a
four or five year term. One of the innovations of this experimental fund has been that the loans are
given in US dollars, but the repayments are calculated in the local currency, according to the exchange
rate at the time the loan was given. This makes repayment easier, since any fluctuations in exchange
rates are absorbed by the fund and not by the local groups. Since the funds come from ACCA’s big
project budget, loans from the new fund should be used to buy land or construct houses - or as a
guarantee fund to access other sources of finance within the countries. So far, the fund has given eight
loans to groups in the region, and all but one have followed the repayment schedules, with most
repayments being made in cash (ACHR, 2012).

    2.7. Land Tenure

         As of late 2012, almost 43,000 households, in 78 projects, had received secure land tenure. In a
little under half of the big projects, the communities already owned the land, or were able to purchase
it. However, just as frequently, the governments and municipal agencies have contributed land. Out of a
total of 111 ‘big’ projects underway in Asia, 55 have been able to leverage 511 hectares of land from the
government (both in-situ and through relocation), worth US$ 62 million. Most of the land was either
given for free or as a long-term lease. In Cambodia, for example, the networks have been able to
leverage free government land in most of the big project cities, and then use the ACCA program to fund
a first batch of 30 or 40 housing loans, with a clear longer term plan and eventually a second batch of
housing loans coming from the national Urban Poor Development Fund (UPDF). By the end of three
years of the program’s operations, 64 of the 111 ‘big’ projects were on government land. Table 4 shows
a breakdown of these projects by type of tenure.

       Thirty-six projects (32%) involve some form of collective tenure (leasehold or ownership), while
68% involve individual tenure. While less common, collective tenure is in fact the arrangement preferred
by ACHR, as, according to them, it helps create “a real community” (ACHR, 2012).

    2.8. Communities and Disasters

         Community networks in several countries are using ACCA support for disaster relief and
rehabilitation. By the end of November 2012, a total of 30 community-driven disaster rehabilitation
projects had been approved, in 10 countries: Cambodia (1 project), Nepal (1 project), Myanmar (3
projects), Philippines (7 projects), Vietnam (3 projects), Sri Lanka (1 project), Thailand (1 project),
Pakistan (1 project) and Japan (1 project).

        Some examples of disaster relief projects include those in response to Cyclone Nargis in
Myanmar, in which ACHR estimates that communities built 750 personalized houses for a cost at which
international donors were only able to build 100. After Typhoon Mirinae in Quinhon, Vietnam, ACCA
provided a US$ 25,000 grant to women’s groups who engaged in house repairs, livelihood revival, by
distributing both loans and grants to community members. These groups later helped communities in
other Vietnamese cities after they were hit by subsequent typhoons. ACCA funds have also been used to
provide relief after a typhoon and a fire in Manila, Philippines, as well as an earthquake in Yushu in
Tibet, China.

   2.9. The Role of Community Architects

         With support from a Rockefeller Foundation grant as well as ACCA, the Community Architects
Network (CAN), a network of young professional designers has been working with communities on their
upgrading projects, both under ACCA and otherwise. Of the 15 countries involved in the ACCA program
so far, 12 have active groups of community architects. The organization helps bring together groups of
local architects in each country to work with communities, through design workshops tied to actual
projects, training seminars and lectures, regional knowledge-sharing events, and publications. A small
amount, US$ 5,000 per country, has been spent in 9 countries to support these activities.

    2.10.   Policy Changes

         ACHR notes that during the three years of the ACCA program, several countries have begun to
revise policies to accommodate a “people-driven model” of development. Some of these changes in EAP
include:

        CAMBODIA: A new national housing policy based on the citywide, community-driven and
partnership-based community upgrading strategies has been implemented. The government has also
started providing free land for housing the poor.

        INDONESIA: The government is providing political support for people-driven housing in 4 cities.
In Makassar, Surabaya, Yogyakarta and Kendari, the urban poor networks have negotiated big
breakthroughs in free land for housing, government support for infrastructure upgrading and permission
to upgrade riverside settlements in-situ.

       KOREA: “Vinyl house” squatter communities have won the right to house registration (which is
necessary to access various government entitlements like schools, health-care and services).

         PHILIPPINES: In Mandaue, for the first time ever in the Philippines, public land is being given free
to the communities who had been squatting on that land. Several other cases of free land for housing
have followed. The first housing board has been set up in Quezon City, in which the citywide urban poor
coalition is represented on the board which oversees city budgeting, urban development and land use
planning. A City Shelter Code has been enacted in Iligan City, which provides a legal framework for the
urban poor to take part in city government decisions on issues of housing and land tenure, and creates a
provision for housing and resettlement allocation in the local government budget. The poor also helped
write the City Shelter Plan for Kidapawan, where the Homeless People’s Federation has also persuaded
the city to allocate a portion of its annual budget to support self-help land acquisition, site development
and housing projects of the urban poor - especially families living in high-risk areas.

        FIJI: ACHR has signed an MOU with the Ministry of Local Government and Housing and the
People’s Community Network to jointly do citywide upgrading in 15 cities in Fiji. This partnership has
already yielded 290 hectares of public land for housing 2,794 poor families in six of the seven ACCA
cities.

         THAILAND: The ACCA projects which helped to pilot new city-based development funds in a few
cities have helped to ignite a city-fund movement in the country, where previously there were no city
funds, except the national CODI fund. City-based funds are now being operated by community networks
in over 200 cities.

        LAO PDR: In a country with no history of community housing projects, the ACCA housing
projects have set a new alternative, in which on-site upgrading is carried out by the communities
themselves and the government provides the secure land. These projects are the first cases of squatter
communities being given long-term leases to the public land they already occupy.

        VIETNAM: Collective housing redevelopment standards have been changed. As a direct result of
the ACCA project in Vinh, the local government has changed its policy on redeveloping the city’s run-
down collective housing. Previously, the existing residents were mostly evicted and redevelopment was
done by contractors, to a set of standards which were unaffordable to even those who remained. Under
the new standards, the communities can rebuild their own housing and infrastructure themselves and
get land title.

3. An Assessment of Key Features of the Program

    3.1. Subsidies, and the Grant Element

        The program’s subsidy is very small—US$ 4,000 to 5,000 for an average of 40 to 50 families —
and spatially targets run-down areas which are occupied largely by poor people. It is intended to induce
related investments, leveraging large amounts of resources from the community and some from local
governments.4 ACHR believes that the program’s transparency and the minimal grant size assure that
there is little room for corruption or leakage of resources to other tasks. Finally, it is designed to build
the social capital of the community in ways that while difficult to measure, have a transformative
impact.

        The subsidy is generally provided to initiate the undertaking of a small local public good – often
a concrete footpath of a kilometer or so through what had previously been a muddy, fetid passageway.
The key point about the grant is that it consists of an investment selected by the community. Upon
receiving the grant, community members engage in construction, and come together, often for the first
time, as a community group. Local officials see the neighborhood enthusiasm and more often than not
engage with it by bringing additional resources to bear. Community action almost always induces local
and sometimes central government support.5

        The subsidies provided by the program are considerably lower, by at least an order of
magnitude, than those provided under typical housing programs operating in the region. The grants
provided by the program represent an extremely small per capita transfer—slightly more than US$ 100
per family—but, according to ACHR, still remain surprisingly catalytic. The data in Table 2: ‘ACCA Big
Projects Underway: Breakdown of Financial Contributions’ suggests that these transfers are in fact able
to leverage large amounts of additional resources and social capital from the communities involved.
They are also able to catalyze both imitators, and what were often previously indifferent local officials.

        The program also operates in such a way that it can detect “signals of seriousness” on the part
of a community, thereby avoiding the adverse selection problems which eliminate donors’ ability to
target assistance to those who value it the most (poor targeting, in turn, significantly increases the costs
of providing assistance to the most needy).6 The result is that the subsidized infrastructure investments
are much more likely to be maintained, thereby avoiding one of the most serious problems with making

 The exact amount of ACCA funds leveraged is difficult to pinpoint precisely at this point but it is many multiples of the
amounts granted and lent.

5
  Myanmar is an example of both inducing central government support and the weakness of public institutions. Following
ACCA’s successful efforts there, the central government agreed to support 100 such communities per year. At the same time, it
continued demolition of slums.

6
 Adverse selection is a problem in markets with asymmetric information – in this case, the beneficiary knows better than the
donor whether or not it values the specific kind of transfer being made. The beneficiary will of course accept the “free” or
heavily subsidized good whether or not any value is attached to the specific activity being subsidized.

                                                             33
effective infrastructure investments.7 One example of how ACCA uses such measures of seriousness to
discriminate between beneficiaries who value the assistance more is provided by the eligibility
requirements to be able to receive a loan from the City/Community Development Funds (CDF) set up by
the program. Before such loans can be accessed, the communities must first show that the grants were
used effectively to improve the neighborhood. Thus, through sequencing its assistance the program gets
a stronger sense of the way in which the community is likely to use the funds.

        In effect, the program follows the dictum raised by John Turner (1972), that housing is what
poor people provide for themselves, and that giving them a little assistance in doing this is far less costly
and much more effective than attempting to build housing units for those who need them.
Unfortunately, in most countries this practice is not followed, with the result that much fewer units can
be constructed. The lion’s share of the subsidies are captured by the middle class and/or the builders
through capitalized subsidies, particularly in countries where there is little or no mortgage finance to
serve those who can afford to borrow (Buckley and Kalarickal, 2006). 8 The evidence is now
unambiguous that demand-side subsidies are, in almost all instances, much more efficient than are
supply-side programs such as publicly-produced housing.9 Therefore, the ACCA program represents a
creative way of channeling resources to such demanders of funds, with low transaction and supervision
costs.

        However, ACCA expenditures may still represent only a drop in the ocean relative to the urban
housing and infrastructure needs in the region. Unless they are systematically mainstreamed, such
projects remain, in many respects, much like distributing lottery payoffs to a fortunate few.

     3.2. Providing Finance to Address Market Failures

           3.2.1.         Community Development Funds

        An overview of the ACCA program reveals that CDFs have become an important mechanism
fostering holistic interventions in the amelioration of the living conditions of the urban poor. Their

 The recently completed World Bank study of infrastructure in Africa details the serious problems posed by lack of
maintenance in infrastructure provision (Banerjee et al, 2008).

  On the order of one-third or more of the housing produced in China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand is
produced by the public sector. The Singapore “model” is the best known of these and often discussed as a hig hly successful
program in which more than 80 percent of the population now lives in what was public housing. The problem with this
conclusion is that the program relies on the use of provident funds to support the production of housing that subsequently
became quite valuable as a result of Singapore being such a successful port – the world’s busiest -- in a part of the world that
underwent a 30 year economic boom. It also is able to charge very high taxes on wages for contributions to these funds – which
because they paid off in the value of the underlying land makes the tax less onerous. It is also a city-state with relatively modest
rates of controlled urbanization. Without these favorable circumstances it is very likely that the value of the investments
funded with provident funds would not have been realized.

9
 Perhaps the clearest example of this evidence is the shift by virtually all European nations to housing voucher programs which
provide subsidies to demanders of assistance from housing production programs which were previously heavily relied upon.

                                                                34
increased involvement suggests that community groups offer a new perspective based on a demand-
oriented paradigm in the provision of housing and infrastructure for low-income communities.

         Given that low-income community groups are often the major contributors in the CDFs created
through ACCA, the challenge has been to use the small amount of funds effectively. The budget ceiling is
established at US$ 58,000 per city: US$ 40,000 for large upgrading projects, US$ 15,000 for smaller ones,
US$ 10,000 for administrative purposes (such as coordination, meetings and exchanges) and US$ 3,000
to cover a variety of joint development processes within the city, like surveying, network-building,
support for savings activities, local exchanges and meetings (ACCA, 2012). As seen in Table 2,
governments and municipalities support the initiatives of the urban poor through financial
contributions. These varying government contributions remain low (11 percent, equivalent to under US$
600,000 in total). This can be explained both by the poor institutional framework of the majority of
countries that ACCA operates, but also by the fact that the program is fairly new, and that most CDFs are
initiated through ACCA-ACHR and the established federated savings groups. The fact that government
contributions in the first two years amounted to only 5 percent (ACCA, 2011) before rising to 11 percent
in the third year suggests that governments are gradually stepping up their involvement as the program
progresses and displays results.

           3.2.2.         Comparing Community Finance with Other Forms of Finance

        The loans ACCA provides can be described as a new form of finance: community finance. This
new type of finance helps provide long-term assets to the poor in a more affordable way. However, it is
also distinct in other ways from related forms of finance which also provide such services, such as
municipal, microenterprise, and housing finance. In comparison to the related forms mentioned above,
community finance has been less studied and has been largely overlooked in the broader discussions of
financial development.10

        The interest rate charged through community finance – on the order of 7 to 8 percent – does
provide a subsidy, relative to the higher rates that would be charged on mortgage finance, if such
finance existed: the neighborhoods which borrow are often considered relatively higher risk from
traditional mortgage loans. However, based on evidence provided through the strong repayment record
of ACCA-disbursed loans, community finance, when carefully done, can carry relatively low risks.

         Moreover, as detailed in the annex and with a few exceptions, in the countries where ACCA
operates, mortgage finance itself is not available. Importantly, with the exception of Vietnam, where
inflation rates are higher, the finance provided by ACCA responds to these sorts of market failure in a



10
  Oxfam International does support community finance along the principles discussed here. However, it is mostly for rural
based lending. Community finance has elements that are similar to microfinance, Roscas, and other forms of informal finance,
but it also has some distinct features of denomination, and credit risk allocation. In particular, the interest rates are such that
the funding could be provided on a cost-recovery basis by a wholesale borrower, such as the government. If, instead, like
microfinance, funding had to be raised locally, the administrative costs would require much higher interest rates.

                                                                35
way that is consistent with the lack of supply of finance. That is, the finance provided by ACCA is
provided at a cost which exceeds the cost of government borrowing.

                 3.2.2.1.            A Comparison to Housing Finance

        Perhaps the closest analogue to the community finance provided by ACCA’s CDFs is housing
finance. It also bears similarities to microfinance and even stronger similarities to shelter microfinance
as described in Table 5.

         As the table suggests, community finance loans tend to be of shorter term than housing finance
or shelter microfinance, and generally require some subsidy for land development and/or infrastructure
to catalyze the process. Still, the central difference between community finance and housing finance
relies on collateral concerns. This difference arises from the realization that families who do not have
clear titles to the places where they live, quite reasonably, invest less in improving them. Often these
families spend their free time, or in many cases valuable hours from work and other income generating
activities, guarding the premises rather than improving them.11 The threat of the structure being
demolished without compensation is omnipresent in many low-income settlements. As Hernando de
Soto’s Mystery of Capital (2000) argues, if property rights can be clarified, it is reasonable to expect an
outpouring of energy and investment to enhance and make better use of the wealth involved.12

        Improving access to housing finance has many of the same objectives: to stretch payments out
over time to make housing more affordable, particularly for the poor. The most fundamental difference
between ACCA finance and housing finance is that under the ACCA approach it is community members
who borrow – as a community, not as individuals – to undertake investments.

         This way of defining who is responsible to repay the debt can create problems because lenders
prefer recourse against individual borrowers, or better yet, they prefer what is known as joint and
several recourse against many borrowers, in case of default, as was done for many years with Danish
mortgage bonds.13 Lenders prefer this individual recourse because the house financed provides strong
collateral in the event that the borrower does not repay. The community finance aspect of the program,
with its joint responsibility for repayment, not only obviates the strength of individual housing units as
collateral, it can turn business risk into political risk. Rather than being able to seize the asset of an
individual to remedy a default, with community responsibility, lenders must move against an entire
community. It is, as a result, not surprising that lenders are reluctant to get involved with such lending
and would only do so by charging a higher risk premium.


11
  Erica Fields (2004) details how the lack of such rights caused families to reduce their work effort so that they could protect
their home belongings.

12
     Erica Fields (2005) shows that providing property rights in Peru significantly increased investment in slum communities.

13
  See Buckley, Chapter 1, for a discussion of the Danish experience and some historical background on mortgage market
development in Chiquier and Lee (2011).

                                                                 36
        So since lenders bear greater risks when lending to a community rather than to an individual,
why rely on a community finance mechanism? One answer is that in many instances this approach helps
build and maintain community engagement, as it is the community, rather than individual households,
which is responsible for repayment. For instance, if the grant finances a concrete pathway, the
community takes actions to keep the drainage and pathway clear. So, community finance, contributes to
asset maintenance as well as social cohesion.

        In addition, by becoming part of a community savings scheme, individuals are able to rely upon
their neighbors for financial assistance when there is a sudden emergency rather than on money
lenders. As the recent study The Portfolios of the Poor (Collins et al, 2010) makes clear, this ability of
very low-income families to smooth consumption – particularly when living near subsistence levels – is
extremely valuable. Hence, a community finance based financial structure contributes to the ability of
the neighborhood to become demanders of local public services.

         How these sorts of benefits compare to the higher credit risks implied by the weaker collateral
involved is a difficult empirical question. But two indirect forms of evidence suggest that the benefits
can often outweigh the risks involved by a considerable margin. First is the evidence of how much the
poor pay to money lenders in urban communities in order to be able to cope with sudden emergencies.
Banerjee and Duflo (2009) document that rates in excess of 50 percent are not uncommon. That level of
cost implies that poor households would be willing to pay a considerable amount to avoid such risks.
Second, the Soros Foundation, successfully funded exactly such an insurance program during the early
years of South Africa’s anti-apartheid reforms. Because of the concern that mortgage loans made in
black townships would go into default through political action, bankers were reluctant to provide loans
to such locations. The foundation provided deductible insurance against this risk so that lenders were
subject to the usual business risks of mortgage lending but the foundation would take the catastrophic
risk associated with political risks. In the event, like the ACCA experience, the risks were taken without
losses. 14

                3.2.2.2.           A Comparison to Microfinance

         While community finance borrowing patterns require mutual indemnification, like microfinance
 and shelter microfinance, it is for longer tenures and at much lower interest rates. While microfinance
 could in principle ultimately satisfy the credit demands of these community groups, it would almost
 certainly eliminate most of the advantage realized by the infrastructure grant in catalyzing community
 and local government investment. Real interest rates in excess of 15 to 20 percent would necessarily
 slow, if not completely impede, most of the neighborhood-wide investment incentives catalyzed by the
 infrastructure subsidy. Community finance also provides a credit risk record that private lenders may
 be able to use to determine the relative risks of lending on a community rather than for individually-
 collateralized loans. In this respect, community finance represents once more a distinct form of
 finance.

     Based on literature on the ACCA program and interviews with community leaders.

                                                              37
            3.2.2.3.         A Comparison to Municipal Finance

        An important distinction between community finance and traditional municipal financing is that
 borrowing is usually on a much smaller scale and more neighborhood-focused than is municipal finance
 – again, assuming that municipal finance is available in the countries involved, which is not the case,
 except perhaps for Thailand and the Philippines. If this finance can be provided at rates exceeding the
 government’s cost of funds, then a logical question would be why such type of finance is not provided
 by municipalities. The answer is that even though such financial terms are sustainable, the size of the
 community and related household investments undertaken are too small for municipal finance to
 undertake—large individual ACCA projects are for US$ 45,000, a fraction of the typical municipal
 finance loan—if indeed municipal finance is available at all.

         Additionally, the neighborhood accountability mechanisms – a basic prerequisite of ACCA’s
operation, are not in place at the municipal level. A standard tenet of fiscal federalism is that local public
goods are most effectively financed over the area to which they provide services. In that case, the fee
paid is similar to a market price rather than a tax. Hence, the administrative costs and credit risks of
attempting to finance these investments through municipal finance would be considerably higher.

        In conclusion, the finance provided by ACCA overcomes a market failure in the provision of
finance to high return investments. This failure arises for at least two reasons: due to the general lack of
financial sector development or, in cases where there is a functioning financial sector, the high costs of
information—about the likely repayments of communal borrowers and/or the costs of title search to the
properties—which prevent more of this kind finance from being provided.

    3.3. A Comparison to Standard Slum Upgrading Projects

       In addition to its differences from housing finance, the ACCA approach also differs significantly
from the approach of other slum upgrading projects, in a few key ways.

        Traditional Slum Upgrading Project                   ACCA Project

    1. Beneficiaries and projects are selected by            There is a self-selection process, with community
       governments or donors, with some                      groups applying for funding for projects of their
       community feedback.                                   own choosing.

    2. It is difficult to differentiate the appetite for The self-selection process, followed by the
       planned investments between various               utilization of the small initial grant, acts as a
       potential beneficiary communities.                “signal of seriousness” of the communities. Larger
                                                         loans are dependent on how the grants are used.

    3. Community involvement follows                         Communities initiate the process, with politicians
       government action.                                    and other officials becoming attracted to the
                                                             work after seeing its initial success and wanting to
                                                             share in it. This empowerment of the poor inverts
                                                             the traditional power dynamic.

    4. There is usually a one-time investment.               There is incremental investment, with the initial
                                                             grant encouraging the community to first
                                                             organize and prepare for the larger loan.

    5. Investment per community are large                    The ACCA budget for an entire city is $58,000.

    6. While some slum upgrading projects may                Loans make up the majority of funding, requiring
       have loan components, it is usually a small           communities to take full ownership of the
       portion, and the overall project is still seen        project.
       as a government responsibility.

    7. The focus is on specific slums.                       ACCA takes a city-wide approach, by conducting
                                                             city-wide surveys and mapping, drafting a city-
                                                             wide strategy, and linking communities to a City
                                                             Development Fund.

    8. Land tenure issues are often ignored.                 ACCA helps communities negotiate for land titles,
       Where titles are granted, they are usually            and has been very successful in this regard,
       to individual households, which encourages            particularly in getting free land from
       them to sell to meet immediate needs, and             governments. The preferred form of tenure is
       reduces their bargaining power.                       community-held title, which helps strengthen and
                                                             consolidate the community, and provides
                                                             collective bargaining power.

     3.4. Urban Real Estate Market Development in Emerging and Transition Economies

        Of the countries visited, five are ranked in the bottom fifth of countries on a per capita income
      15
basis. Their ranking based on governance indicators is even lower, and, in many cases, deteriorating
over time. As the Global Integrity Index suggests, they also have a “very weak” governance structure.16
In conjunction with poor economic and governance performance, the countries are rapidly urbanizing in
an idiosyncratic context where decentralization of governance to lower levels of government is still
embryonic. If we further consider their overall politico-economic past we see that the majority of
countries—Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka—have operated for many
years as authoritarian, insulated, non-market economies. Their general financial sector development,
with the exception of Thailand and Vietnam, is similarly deeply under-developed. As a result, the general
economic environment in which the program operates is one that is littered with market and
government failures: extremely weak institutions, little to no decentralization of government, nascent
financial systems, usually no housing or municipal finance, high levels of corruption, and urban
populations which are growing rapidly but which have very limited transportation opportunities.

          Cities throughout most of East Asia—with the exception of China and Korea—have significant
slum populations, 35 percent of the population or more.17 Often these communities are located on
central city properties—along canals, railroad tracks, or other public property—and have been occupied
by the same households for a number of generations. In most places, the conventional wisdom, that
these slum communities are temporary “way stations” on the path of migration from rural to urban
living, is no longer accurate. Cities grow around these slum pockets and large numbers of the population
are effectively excluded from many of the basic aspects of inclusive economic development. Moreover,
this situation is likely to get far worse in the coming years, as urbanization trends throughout the region

   In an annex we provide a comprehensive background by looking at seven country-cases (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar,
Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) in order to assess the current macro-economic and institutional context through
which low-income communities operate. More specifically, we look at the urbanization levels, the recent economic
performance, the institutional and governance quality, the depth of institutional decentralization, the financial and housing
finance sector development and the infrastructure shortages faced by the urban poor. This shows that in the majority of cases,
the possibilities for the urban poor become extremely narrow due to the poor economic and institutional environment.

16
  As detailed in the annex, all of the countries served by ACCA except Thailand have “very weak” governance structures except
Thailand which is rated simply as “weak.” Perhaps even more discouragingly, if one ranks the countries served by ACCA,
including middle income Thailand, each of them has a lower relative rank on the quality of institutions compared to their
rankings in terms of per capita income. In other words, if one suspects that the quality of institutions is broadly highly
correlated with the level of income – higher income countries can either pay for better institutions or, alternatively, better
institutions create the conditions to generate higher incomes, for the countries served by ACCA, performance on institutional
quality is lower than would be expected and corruption is higher. As far as decentralization goes, Cambodia, according to one
recent Bank study, is the second least decentralized country of more than forty countries examined. Vietnam remains a
centralized country as detailed in the Vietnam Urbanization Review.

17
   As detailed in the annex, these estimates are from UN Habitat. The Bank’s Vietnam Urbanization Review indicates that the
share of slums there was over-estimated. And, while there have been problems with such estimates and the incentives to
exaggerate the scale of the problem, it is, nevertheless, clear that in most cities in the region the share of slum populations is
significant and often growing.

                                                               41
imply enormous urban population increases, while institutional quality measures imply that local
governments have little authority and even less capacity to address the issue.

        Cumulatively, this situation implies considerable, sometimes overt, conflict over the use of
rapidly appreciating inner city land. The conflict is between those who would exploit emerging market
economies and the poor who have often lived for many years on the now valuable land. The rapid rates
of economic growth and transformation of many of these poor economies create extraordinary pressure
on urban land prices, particularly in the central city locations that—due to the weak transportation
options and non-market structures of the economies—were home to many poor communities. These
price increases have led to real estate market bubbles even in more sophisticated market economies
and were important contributors to Thailand’s and Indonesia’s roles in the Asian financial crisis, as noted
by Quigley (2001) among others. Additionally, in many urban centers there is a crowding-out
phenomenon, whereby people of higher-income brackets are living in housing which could be utilized by
people from lower-income brackets.18 Under these conditions, for low-income groups working in the
informal sector and usually residing in informal settlements, the alternatives are seriously restricted.

        Urban poverty is also manifested in infrastructure shortages and the lack of access to basic
services. Even though most urban residents in the sub-region have access to improved water sources,
ranging from household connections to public standpipes, in many cases, water is supplied
intermittently and contamination, due to waste entering the pipes or unsanitary storage conditions, is
common. In several cases, widespread environmental degradation has devastating health effects for the
low-income groups. Piped sewer systems reach only a small percentage of the urban population of the
Philippines; 15 per cent of the population of Manila has a sewer connection. 192,000 tons of domestic
waste enters the drains and groundwater yearly with minor treatment in un-maintained septic tanks.19
Rivers in Vietnam's major cities are seriously polluted by untreated industrial wastewater. Lakes,
streams and canals serve as sinks for domestic sewage and municipal and industrial wastes.20 In the Lao
PDR, pollutants from roads, commercial and industrial areas and private properties wash into drains and
watercourses, which act as secondary sewers carrying industrial discharges, septic tank seepage and
overflows in wet weather.21

       3.5. Placing the ACCA Program in the General Context

       In this context, ACCA attempts to operate as a bridging mechanism between those who live
often on low-lying, previously undesirable, inner city land, and those who would now put this land to

  In Indonesia, the government estimates that there is a current backlog of 1.7 million houses with a need for approximately
800,000 additional units on an annual basis.

different uses. The intent is to give the poor an opportunity to become part of the development process,
instead of being pushed aside, without stopping development altogether.

        Slowing the process by which land can be redeveloped does not mean that the land is
permanently placed in a use that is significantly below that of its highest and best use. The CODI
program, for instance, provides assisted communities with long-term leases for 30 years that allows
them to eventually realize some of the gains that can be made on their properties. These leasehold
agreements, which warrant further study, appear to be an effective way of providing poor community
members with a basis for discussions with private developers. This mechanism seems particularly useful
in areas where the land being considered for development is public land, as in Thailand, and in
opposition to privately-owned but encroached upon land, as in the Philippines. In the former case, a
transfer to a lease-hold allows the current residents to achieve an ownership status that offers the
opportunity to engage developers in discussions of how and when the area they occupy can be
developed. The potential for shifting the locus of discussion from the public sector, which does not
operate transparently, to those most directly affected has enormous potential benefits in terms of more
equitable and less speculative real estate development. Therefore, these agreements produce a slower
development process, but one that is less prone to booms and busts and additionally, a process that
does not overlook the implied if not ownership then long-term resident rights of the poor.

        The efforts of physical improvements through isolated community-driven upgrading programs
have been documented in the literature, but less attention has been given to the financial mechanisms
that enable the urban poor to access funds for the improvement of their living environment. Frequently
though, the narrow outreach of institutional finance in developing countries represents a major
impediment, obliging the majority of low-income citizens to rely solely on household savings and
untrustworthy informal moneylenders. In contrast, institutions like the CDFs offer new alternatives and
enhance the access of urban poor to finance by filling in the fissures left from the embryonic and
exclusionary private financial institutions. In this, CDFs overcome an important market failure in the
provision of finance to high return investments.

        This alternative does not aim to replace already existing institutional and financial structures
but, through the incremental process gains it produces, it focuses on promoting systemic change by
influencing policy orientations and the overall institutional architecture of each country.

   3.6. The Key Program Feature – Demand-Responsive Action

         The demand-side orientation of the ACCA program, augmented where necessary by technical
assistance, appears to provide a more efficient way to channel resources so that poor people become
more engaged in addressing their circumstances. Not only does the community’s involvement as
decision-makers have a strong role to play on the cost effectiveness of the investments undertaken, it
also creates communities which have successfully interacted with local government in ways that are
likely to lead to deeper and more constructive engagement with their local officials.


                                                  43
        The assistance appears to have the sort of transformational systemic effect alluded to earlier.
The ACCA program suggests that very a small subsidy can elicit larger and seemingly on-going actions.
This particular form of demand-responsive action has been tested on both a national level, through
CODI, and now on a regional level in a number of very poor, institutionally weak countries. 22

       3.7. The Community Organization Development Institute’s Experience

        It is important to note that ACCA’s rationale, while new to many of the countries involved, has
been tested, with apparent success, at a national level in the specific context of Thailand. The rationale
of the program is clearly based on the Thai example, a precursor in the field as well as in institutional
architecture, which is being replicated in other ACCA operating countries such as Cambodia.

     With the exception of Thailand and the Philippines these countries are all IDA-eligible.

                                                                  44
  Figure 9: The approach to housing taken by CODI, on which ACCA is modeled (Source: ACHR, 2011)




         The US$ 100 million Thai government program was designed by the director of ACHR, and
borrowed from the structure used in the Community Mortgage Program in the Philippines. She was also
the first director of CODI, so, unsurprisingly, the CODI structure is quite similar. In other words, ACCA’s
structure and operation is built very carefully on the Thai experience, which grew out of an NGO
movement and now provides about US$ 20 million per year of similarly structured assistance to
communities throughout Thailand. Like CODI, ACCA focuses on community engagement as the key
stratagem in allocating resources and assuring that those resources are used effectively and maintained.
Thus, while ACCA is indeed a new program, its conceptual component is based on the same
organizational traits and developed by the same people who conceived and implemented the CODI
program.

         Indirect evidence as to the likely success of an expanded ACCA program can be garnered by
examining the evidence on the effectiveness of the CODI program, which was recently subjected to a
rigorous statistical evaluation. This evaluation is a quasi-experimental empirical analysis by the Thai
Development Research Institute (TDRI), a well-regarded Bangkok-based think tank. Discussions with the
authors indicate that communities assisted by the program have had significantly improved conditions
relative to those in similar communities which did not receive assistance. House values increased by
significantly more than the subsidy amount, implying that the market value of the subsidy was higher
than the government expenditure. In addition, families in assisted communities increased their

                                                    45
educational expenditures for their children, and had much improved business prospects than those in
similar, but unassisted communities. The subsidy expenditures per unit under this program are much
lower than those realized by the parallel housing program operated by the Thai government and by the
sorts of housing programs generally adopted by governments. One of the findings of the study was that
with much larger amounts of funds over a long period of time, a public sector agency that engages with
local communities can expand its reach enormously, and improve basic living conditions of many more
households than equivalent traditional public sector supply-side programs. In many ways, the CODI
program represents what might be viewed as the best practice frontier for public sector engagement in
slum upgrading.

        Consequently, in many ways, the ACCA program can be viewed as the regional implementation
of a Thai national program. However, instead of being run by a government—particularly in countries
with very low public institutional strength—it is managed by a long-serving effective NGO which has
been instrumental in creating a government program where such a program can operate. Importantly, ,
in the ACCA program, as in the CODI program, decision-making has been decentralized to a network of
like-minded local organizations, and these organizations, in most instances, appear to have shown that
they too are able to work credibly and effectively with poor community groups.




                                                 46
4. Conclusions and Recommendations

        The ACCA program provides well-designed subsidies, a new form of finance, and a stronger
negotiating platform for the poor in the urban land development process. Such a platform can
simultaneously help moderate the sorts of extreme real estate price movements that have been
experienced in the region, while it builds greater social cohesion, unlocking what appears to be the
considerable energy and resources of the poor. It also induces local officials to become more engaged in
the process of making their inner cities more livable and healthy.

        The ACCA mechanism appears to be a cost-effective means to address what is inevitably going
to be a major problem in the region, and to build the kind of inclusiveness that plays such an important
role in countries’ growth trajectories. The region has the advantage of not having the severe income
inequality that characterizes many other countries, and particularly those with large slum populations.
However, it is unquestionably the region of the world where higher economic growth is having the most
profound effect on urban land markets in ways that are likely to continue and intensify. Against this kind
of background, it is clear that there is no single best answer to address the issue of how to avoid the
expansion of slums and exclusion in the region’s growing cities. But what also seems clear is that unless
attention is focused on some of the more cost-effective approaches, such as those embodied in the
ACCA mechanism, the region will experience increasing problems with slums.

        Given the limited scope of this study, which could only examine a very limited number of the
many assisted locations, it is difficult to draw firm empirical inferences about the ACCA program’s
effectiveness. As mentioned above, econometric evidence is beginning to be produced about the
beneficial effects that community projects have had in the improvement of the living situation of the
urban poor, as in the TDRI study of the CODI project.

        Success is also defined by more conceptual but perhaps even more important notions like those
of gender and community empowerment. Discussions with many of the women-driven savings groups
involved in the projects of ACCA reveal important information in this regard: for the most part, illiterate
women who know and understand their communities demonstrate a deep confidence in and
understanding of the process. They are able to articulate not just their communities’ work but also their
motivations for involvement in the community groups. This suggests that small amounts of funding
involved in the ACCA program generate significant response from community members. Future analysis
should capture this kind of transformation of long established societal relationships between the often-
excluded urban poor and the rest of the city.

        In sum, while this study is by no means an audited account of what the ACCA program has
accomplished over its short history and its geographically diffuse spread of activities, it suggests that the
concept is strong. The empirical evidence on the soundness of the approach is clear for Thailand.
Moreover, the central differences between the places where ACCA operates and the successful CODI
program—weak institutions, corruption, lack of finance and almost no decentralized government—are
such that NGO provision is much more likely to be successful in such locations than is public provision of

                                                     47
these services. Hence, the choice of an NGO as the implementing instrument for these countries
appears to be sound and, in the limited number of sites visited, is demonstrably effective.

     4.1. Directions for Future Research

        The ACCA approach may not be adequate in all circumstances. A range of preconditions – such
as house price conditions relative to income levels, whether the land is publicly or privately owned,
whether the local government is accountable and responsive, and basic environmental concerns – may
make the ACCA approach very relevant in some countries in the region, but possibly less effective in
others.23 Further research into the 19 countries’ experiences with the program would be required to
understand better the replicability and scalability of this approach: Under what set of country and local
circumstances is this kind of instrument likely to provide an effective way for governments and donors
to transform the agenda so that more inclusive cities are developed? Why have some countries (e.g.
Vietnam, Nepal, and Thailand) managed to leverage more government funds than others (e.g. India,
Philippines and Lao PDR). Why have certain countries succeeded in establishing CDFs at the national
level (Cambodia and Sri Lanka), while others have not? Once a set of hypotheses on the conditions
under which the ACCA approach works best is developed, these can be tested and researched further.
Eventually, new or existing ways of doing business can be formulated or modified in order to help use
this mechanism to expand the reach of assistance and finance to the urban poor.

         Further research into the efforts under the ACCA program should also further explore various
aspects of its community finance element. How is repayment ensured, and what factors influence the
ability of communities to repay, such as income levels of community members, the structure and
capacity of the community organization, exogenous shocks, etc. How is the problem of free-riders
mitigated? How are interest rates and repayment periods determined? Is the fund subject to regulation?
Is there a distinction between funds used for private and public goods? The flexible approach that the
ACCA program takes to these questions appears to be one of the reasons for its success so far, but
documenting various practices and their relative strengths and weaknesses can help chart a course for
future action.

        One of ACCA’s most noteworthy features has been the success it has had in helping
communities negotiate land rights, in an environment where governments are often eager to relocate
the poor away from areas with high land values. While this study touched on land grants and long-term
land leases by governments, the issue of land tenure needs to be further explored. What have been the
key ingredients in this success? Where have negotiations been difficult or unsuccessful, and why? How
does the ACCA approach adapt to varying property regimes? Which approaches have worked better
than others? How does a community’s perception of its tenure security influence the kinds of
investments made?


23
   See Figure 3.1 in Vietnam Urbanization Review (2011) for a discussion of how income and housing standards affect
affordability across the income distribution.

                                                        48
         In order to fully understand the impact of this program on communities, a detailed study over a
period of time is required, ideally with a non-participating community as a control group. It would entail
an institutional analysis of the participating government and non-government organizations at local and
national levels, how they interact with communities, who facilitates these interactions, and how the
community groups themselves are organized and run.

         Lastly, while ACCA appears well-suited to providing community-level small infrastructure across
a city, how this is linked and coordinated with primary trunk infrastructure also needs to be better
understood.

    4.2. Recommendations for Donors

         Perhaps the most important step for donors is to recognize that the problem to be addressed is
not one that can be resolved simply by producing more housing – as has been emphasized by almost all
government programs – or lowering the standards of the housing and related services provided by the
public sector. The number of families who now live in slums in Asian cities, and the hundreds of millions
who will soon to be added to them, requires a fundamental rethinking of two factors: the per unit costs
of assistance that can be accommodated on the scale required, and the institutional structure through
which the assistance can be provided.

        At the per unit subsidy costs implied by the ACCA program, more than 20,000 families could be
reached by a program similar in size to a recent World Bank loan to Vietnam for US$ 40 million.
Moreover, most of that funding would be sustained in a revolving fund that could continue to grow and
assist more families. Indeed, such a program would be sufficient to generate US$ 10 million in annual
loan disbursements, about half the size of the current Thai program.

         The ACCA/CODI program has shown that it is able to engage local communities at very low per
unit cost in projects that induce very high rates of leverage of local resources and energy. Indeed, given
the small size of the initial grant it is remarkable that the grants have as much attractiveness as seems to
be the case. Such effective targeting has much to recommend as far as costs are concerned. The fact
that ACCA exploits a highly decentralized approach to community decision-making also appears to play a
significant role in containing costs and keeping expectations realistic. The decentralized transparency
that characterizes the ACCA program is likely to play a key role in being able to increase the scale of this
program, as most of the administrative costs are in effect borne by community members who engage
and organize community activities.

         One measure that is likely to result in efficiency gains is to work on separating the grant and
loan programs, so that ACCA focuses on grants while loans are provided by other related mechanisms. A
potential longer-term weakness of the ACCA program is how well the finance will be sustained over the
longer term by institutions, Urban Poor Funds, which are not professional intermediaries. While these
organizations are not professional financers, neither are most microenterprise finance institutions, at
least in the early years. Nevertheless, if ACCA were to focus on the grant element of the program, with

                                                    49
the finance undertaken by more experienced financial organizations, it may make the program more
sustainable and accountable.

        One way that ACCA could be structured to accommodate aid from other donors would be to
channel the resources through CODI, or a similar institution which could serve as a regional implementer
of programs with which it has a great deal of national experience. At the same time, it is important not
to move the policy discussion to the central government level, away from the local level where decisions
about inclusion and space for engagement between communities and government take place. For
instance, the Vietnamese discussions, which are more government based, appear to be less effective
than the Cambodian discussions which are much more localized.

        The experience of ACCA and CODI suggest that it is possible to scale up to a much larger
program. Exactly how large a program could be developed, whether it should be a governmental
organization like CODI or continued to be based on NGOs, and who should fund it should be the subject
of careful analysis.

   5.2. Data on Regional Economies

        This annex brings together data on the characteristics of selected countries served by ACCA to
provide some perspective on the likely demand for such services and the ability of the government to
respond to these demands. We begin with showing that the countries in the program are urbanizing at a
rapid rate. Only Thailand is urbanizing less rapidly than the regional average.

Figure A.1 Urban Population % and Growth in Selected Southeast Asian Countries




Source: World Development Indicators, World Bank.

Urbanization in Southeast Asia Southeast Asia is steadily urbanizing. In 1950, 15.5 percent of its
population lived in urban areas. In 2010, it was 41.8 percent and the number is expected to increase to
50 percent by 2025. In general, the urban population growth rate in Southeast Asia is higher than the
average population growth rate. All of the selected countries below -- besides Thailand -- have an urban
population growth rate higher than the average of the region. An important characteristic of the
urbanization process is the development of secondary cities. Although, the major cities of the region
such as will continue to grow rapidly, the most important increase in the urban population is indeed
predicted to occur in smaller cities and towns.

Economic Growth and Urban Poverty. Southeast Asia has emerged strongly from the global financial
crisis. The average economic growth rate of six countries in the region (Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) is projected to reach 7.3 percent in 2010, more than twice
the world average growth rate. Figure A.2, depicts the important increases in the growth rate of GDP for
most of the seven countries studied.

Figure A.2 GDP Growth in Selected Southeast Asian Countries (2010)

        Still, beyond the rapid economic growth and the resilience to the global financial crisis, most
Southeast Asian countries face acute urban poverty, with close to half the urban population in many
countries residing in informal areas, according to UN Habitat estimates. To be very conservative, halving
these estimates would still result in enormous numbers of slum dwellers.

Table A.1 Slum Populations in Southeast Asia




Institutions, Governance and Decentralization A great variety of historical experience has influenced
the evolution of institutions, governance and local government structures in the Southeast Asian region,
ranging from the intermarriage of longstanding local traditions of self-governance to organizational
forms imported through the colonial experience and Marxist-Leninism. Traditions of community or
grassroots self-governance have long existed in the region, though not necessarily in the more
                                                   53
sophisticated organizational forms of local government that exist today. Further on, compared to the
rest of the world, the extent of decentralization in the majority of countries examined remains low, with
a decentralization index extending from .004 for Cambodia to .066 for Philippines. (Figure 3).

Figure A.3 Decentralization Index World Map




         Based on the Governance Indicators Database maintained by the World Bank, the institutional
quality varies largely with Thailand and the Philippines performing far better than the other countries
(Table A.2). What seems alarming is the fact that with the exception of Philippines and Vietnam, the
institutional quality over a period of ten years has deteriorated from what are already very low levels.
Myanmar, for instance, is now one of the world’s worst governed countries. And even Thailand, which
has a relatively high ranking on institutional quality has a lower ranking on this score than it does on per
capita income on which it ranks at the 47th percentile.

Additionally, the 2009 Global Integrity Report places Vietnam and Cambodia in the Grand Corruption
Watchlist, among a restricted group of 16 countries where key anti-corruption safeguards are so weak
that the risk of large-scale theft of public resources was greater than in most countries (Figure A.4).

Financial Sector Development. Over the past decades, the emerging economies of Southeast Asia have
seen substantial growth and deepening in their financial systems. For the majority of the countries in
this study, however, financial development has been very slow. With the exception of Thailand, which
its financial system stands out as the most developed the rest of the countries M2/GDP is relatively low.
The Philippines follow Thailand while Vietnam has had by far the most impressive growth. The rest of
the countries remain rather underdeveloped in terms of depth of their financial sector (Figure A.3).

        This result is accentuated by recent data from the financial inclusion database (FINDEX). In a
recent study that measures financial inclusion worldwide, Kunt and Klapper (2012), suggest that
financial depth and financial inclusion are distinct dimensions of financial development—and that
financial systems can become deep without delivering access for all. Therefore, large amounts of credit
in a financial system—both commercial and consumer— do not always correspond to broad use of
financial services, because the credit can be concentrated among the largest firms and wealthiest
individuals. Indeed, the use of formal accounts is imperfectly correlated with a common measure of
financial depth—domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP— particularly in the
bottom half of the distribution of economies. Country examples bear this out. In our case, Vietnam has
domestic credit to the private sector amounting to 125 percent of GDP, but only 21 percent of adults in
the country report having a formal account. Comparing the 6 countries of our study to East Asia and the
Pacific average (developing countries only), we clearly see that in most cases inclusion– besides in
Thailand – is far lower than the regional average (Figure A.6).

Depth of Housing Finance and Low-Income Housing . Over the last 20 years, market-based mortgage
finance systems have flourished across Southeast Asian countries. This expansion, especially to lower
middle-income countries, has had significant results. However, in their majority, the emerging Southeast
Asian housing markets remain quite underdeveloped. The mortgage debt-to-gross domestic product
(GDP) ratio, a measure of the depth of a country's housing market, is well below 15 percent in a number
of countries (ADB, 2009). This statistic is particularly striking when compared with other emerging
market regions. For example, the average mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio in South Asia is 2.9 percent, and
in East Asia and the Pacific it is only 1.5 percent. This compares with a mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio of 7
percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 11 percent in sub-Saharan Africa (ADB, 2009).

        Furthermore, the lack of longer-term funding sources coupled with a limited understanding of
housing finance causes financial institutions to restrict mortgage lending in terms of volumes and
market segments. This results in a lack of understanding of a particular market's needs, as well as
untapped opportunities. Because of lenders’ conservative practices, and due to the difficulties in
obtaining standard credit information, financial institutions often do not have the capacity and tools to
assess creditworthiness of individuals, particularly those who are self-employed, which serves to
reinforce higher-income lending practices that are currently notable in many markets throughout Asia.
Given a large informal labor market in Southeast Asian region, mortgages remain inaccessible to the
majority of the population. This reality is evident through the serious shortages of adequate housing
throughout the region.
