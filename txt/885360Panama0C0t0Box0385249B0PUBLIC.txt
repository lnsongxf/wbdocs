I.      Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Panama
       perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Panama regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Panama;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Panama;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work, and communication and information sharing in Panama;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Panama.
    Use data to help inform Panama country team’s strategy.

II.     Methodology
From June to September 2013, 281 stakeholders of the World Bank in Panama were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s work in the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President/Minister, office of a
parliamentarian, ministries, ministerial departments, or implementation agencies; consultants/
contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local governments; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations; the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A
total of 51 stakeholders participated in the survey (18% response rate).
Respondents received and completed questionnaires online. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Panama; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the World
Bank; the Bank’s future role in Panama; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing
in Panama.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Panama: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Panama is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in
   Panama, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth, and which best illustrates how the idea of “shared prosperity” would be achieved.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American Development
   Bank, and the International Finance Corporation and their perceived effectiveness of these
   organizations in Panama. They were asked to rate the Bank staff’s preparedness to help
   Panama solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner .
   Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, the most effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Panama, with which stakeholder groups the Bank
   should collaborate more.

       education/skills development, poverty reduction, anti-corruption, social inclusion, and
       water and sanitation.
    D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
       consult the World Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the Bank
       should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
       knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
       development results and its technical quality.
    E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement
       with a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
       “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable
       conditions on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Panama’s institutional
       capacity, and providing effective implementation support.
    F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Panama: Respondents were asked to rate how
       significant a role international cooperation and the World Bank should play respectively
       in Panama in the near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of
       greater value.
    G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they
       get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to
       receive information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s
       websites. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
       Information policy, and whether they used/had used the World Bank website.
       Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they use/consult World
       Bank data more often they did a few years ago, that they find the World Bank websites
       easy to navigate, that they know how to find information from the Bank, and that they
       find the information on the World Bank’s websites useful.
    H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
       specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their
       exposure to the Bank in Panama, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position

Geographic Location

       Nearly all respondents indicated that they were located in Panama city. Because of the
        small number of respondents from other areas (provincial capitals and rural areas),
        statistical comparisons across geographic locations were not possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Panama, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results incr ease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development resu lts.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Panama. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at quality of education/skills development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at trade/exports/logistics; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Panama, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at global/regional integration;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at trade/exports/logistics;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health.
