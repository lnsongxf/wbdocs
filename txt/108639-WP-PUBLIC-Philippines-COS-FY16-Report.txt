I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding
of how stakeholders in the Philippines perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
     General Issues Facing The Philippines
     Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
     World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
     The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
     Working with the World Bank Group
     The Future Role of the World Bank Group in the Philippines
     Communication and Information Sharing
     Background Information


II. Methodology
From March to April 2016, 2,230 stakeholders of the WBG in the Philippines were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President, office of Secretary, office of
Congress, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies, Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects or consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, local government office or staff,
bilateral/multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, private foundations, the financial
sector/private banks, NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs), the media, independent
government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, academia/research
institutes/think tanks, and the judiciary branch. A total of 352 stakeholders participated in the
survey (16% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier, an email invitation, or an appointment with a
representative of the fielding agency. Respondents completed questionnaires via paper and
pencil, online, or with the fielding representative. Respondents were asked about: general issues
facing the Philippines; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and
results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future
role in the Philippines; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY ’13 (response rate was 21%, N=328). The data were weighted to reach similar
stakeholder compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable
comparisons. There were no respondents from academia in FY ’13, so that category, and
stakeholders who identified themselves as “Other” in the stakeholder category options were not
included in these comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the
total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data
reported in the FY ’13 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in this report. For the
weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (see
page 77).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the financial sector/private
       banks were combined with those from the private sector. The few respondents from trade
       unions, faith-based groups, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other”
       category for all further analyses.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
         lower levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY ’13
         Country Survey (weighted mean in FY ’16 = 6.7; weighted mean in FY ’13 = 7.1)1.
        Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean rating = 7.3) compared to respondents who do
         not collaborate with the WBG (mean rating = 5.8).
        Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were
         significantly, strongly correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in
         the Philippines, and moderately, significantly correlated with the extent to which the
         WBG’s work helps to achieve development results and the extent to which the WBG
         plays a relevant role in development in the Philippines.

IV. General Issues Facing The Philippines
Headed in the Right Direction
      Year comparison: Statistically similar to this year’s Country Survey, respondents in the
       FY ’13 Country Survey were more likely to indicate that the Philippines was headed in
       the right direction (percentage of respondents = 85%) than that the Philippines was
       headed in the wrong direction (2%) or that they were not sure (13%).

IV. General Issues Facing The Philippines (continued)
Development Priority
   Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that the most
    important development priority in the Philippines was anti-corruption/transparency/social
    accountability (percentage of respondents = 39%), followed by governance/government
    effectiveness (27%), economic growth (25%), education (25%), agricultural modernization/
    rural development (24%), and poverty reduction (23%).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts

      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to political pressures and
       obstacles (percentage of respondents = 40%) and lack of/inadequate levels of capacity in
       government (37%).




As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
       These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in the Philippines,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-eight
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in the Philippines. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in the Philippines, suggesting that
       ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s
       ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from
       these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at regulatory framework;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates
The World Bank Group’s Work in The Philippines
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had significantly lower
         levels of agreement that “Overall the World Bank Group currently plays a relevant role in
         development in the Philippines” (weighted mean = 7.1) and that “The WBG’s work is
         aligned with what I consider the development priorities for the Philippines” (weighted
         mean = 7.0) compared to respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted means
         = 7.5 and 7.5, respectively)4.

Overall Perceptions
      Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had statistically similar
       levels of agreement regarding the comparable aspects of how the WBG operates in the
       Philippines compared to respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey.
      Stakeholders: Respondents from the office of Secretary and independent government
       institutions had the highest levels of agreement that “The World Bank Group takes
       decisions quickly in the Philippines” whereas respondents from NGOs/CBOs had
       significantly lower levels of agreement. See Appendix B, page 53, for a complete
       breakdown of all stakeholder group comparisons.

VII. How the World Bank Group Operates (continued)
The WBG as an Effective Development Partner
     Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across several of
      these aspects of how the WBG operates in the Philippines (refer to Appendix B, page 53,
      for a complete breakdown). For the most part, respondents from the office of Secretary

Appendix E: Responses to Select Questions by Year12
Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Although the FY13 and FY16 samples were fairly
similar, the samples from both years were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.
