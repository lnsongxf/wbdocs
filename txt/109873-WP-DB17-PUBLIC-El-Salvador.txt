This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        Obtain construction line and site qualification

        To request a construction line, BuildCo must present the deed of
        ownership and a topographical plan with geodesic coordinates.
        This is required to ensure that public works (street or highway)
        will not affect the land. The construction line is the document
        that defines the alignment of new construction with the
        Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (AMSS) road network. It
        describes the right of way, retract area, and transversal section of
        the road projects to be developed, or widening to be undertaken
        in the San Salvador metropolitan area. The document is valid for          11 days             no charge
   2
        5 years. For San Salvador, this document should be requested at
        the Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of San Salvador
        (OPAMSS).

        The site or land qualification defines whether the proposed
        construction is allowed on that land for the use projected. The
        compatibility of land use is based on reference to the soil matrix,
        as defined in the General Plan of Zoning in force for AMSS,
        which indicates the requirements for project development. This
        document is valid for 12 months and should be requested from
        OPAMSS, the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-Ministry of

      Time and cost have been calculated on the assumption that a

      half the time if a premium (double the cost) is paid. The silence-

      automatically if the applicant does not hear from OPAMSS in 30
      days.

      Obtain approval of environmental form (formulario
      ambiental)

      According to Acuerdo Ejecutive No. 23 (Environmental Law on
      the Classification of Activities, Works and Projects) published in
      the Diario Oficial No 162, Tomo No 380 from September 1st
      2008, the warehouse in the Doing Business case study would fall
      under Category 'A' which is exempt from an Environmental
      Impact Study. In this case, all that is required is for the architect
      or engineer to fill out an Environmental Form and submit it to          21 days       no charge
*3
      MARN (Ministry of Environment). The Form outlines the project
      and its potential environmental impact. MARN will then decide if
      the work can be considered exempt from the full impact study. In
      the Doing Business case study, the project would most likely be
      exempt from the full impact study.

      Obtain zoning or road construction revision

      Independently from the environmental revision, BuildCo. can
      start having the the zoning or road construction revision should
      be requested from (Office of Planning of Metropolitan Area of
      San Salvador, OPAMSS), the Municipal Authority, or the Vice-

      the planned construction with the requirements established for
      the use of soil, as established under the General Plan of Zoning
*4    for the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador and its standing              21 days       no charge

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      parties are Tax solvent. In addition to reforms at the registry set out by
      the Law on Standard Procedures of August 2004, an electronic system is
      currently being introduced and, once fully functional, is expected to
      reduce the registration time. In addition, a special service is available
      (mainly used by banks, law firms or companies). Upon signing a special

      than US$ 100). The agreement has to be renewed on an annual basis.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                   After Mirage’s default, the most likely scenario for BizBank would be to start a
                                    foreclosure proceeding in order sale the estate used as a collateral. Mirage
                                    would not be able to request any suspension of the enforcement action to
                                       avoid foreclosure because the law does not provide for this possibility.

                                    In a foreclosure procedure based on the Civil Procedure Code, the creditor
                                     would request the payment by filing a claim before the court. The debtor
Proceeding      foreclosure        would have the opportunity to counter-claim. After that an approval to initiate
                                      foreclosure will be handed down by the Court and an order to set up an
                                    auction will be issued. Once the time allocated by law for appeal lapses, the
                                     court would appoint an auctioneer to sell the debtor's assets pledged as
                                     collateral in a public auction. The Court would subsequently validate the
                                               distribution of the debtor’s assets among the creditors.

                                     The foreclosure proceeding will take approximately 3.5 years in El Salvador
                                    from the moment of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
