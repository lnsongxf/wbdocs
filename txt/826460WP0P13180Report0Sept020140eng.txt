                        BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: PEFA ASSESSMENT

                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE ASSESSMENT
The fiscal system in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is highly decentralized, reflecting the provisions of the
country’s constitution. The general government sector consists of four relatively autonomous units: BiH
Institutions, Brčko District (DB), and two Entities—Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and
Republican Srpska (RS). BiH Institutions are at the central government level (governed by the BiH Council of
Ministers); and each Entity has its own government, extra-budgetary funds (EBFs), and local self-governance
units. The structure in FBiH has 10 cantons that serve as a middle level of government between the
government of FBiH and local self-governance units, and each canton has its own government and some
EBFs. Cantons were not covered by this Report, but could be covered later as a sub-national PEFA
assessment.

Indirect taxation is administered at the level of joint institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina; whilst direct
taxation is administered at the Entity level1 Social contributions are administered by EBFs in FBiH, while in
RS, since January 1, 2010, they have been administered by the RS Tax Administration. Similarly, expenditure
jurisdiction is divided among the levels of governance. According to data from the Central Bank of BiH, of
the total BiH general government consolidated expenditure of around BAM 11.7 billion, BiH Institutions have
a 9% share, FBiH a 58% share, RS a 32% share, and DB a 1% share.

A Fiscal Council was created in 2008, with the objective to coordinate fiscal policies for the sake of common
interest of BH Institutions, Entities and Brcko District. For the most important role of fiscal coordination—
preparing the Global Framework of the Fiscal Balance and Policy—in practice the Fiscal Council decides on
revenues from indirect taxation and the budget of BiH Institutions, thereby creating preconditions for budget
planning at lower level of governments, which are responsible for over 90% of public expenditures. Given that
key government functions (social policy, subsidies, education, etc), are performed at sub-national level, timely
decision making on BiH Institutions’ revenues from indirect taxes is important in enabling timely
implementation of their respective budgets.

Budget preparation. Budget planning procedures and calendars are broadly similar at all four levels: medium-
term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) are prepared each year and adopted in early summer, serving as a pre-
draft of annual budgets, which are prepared in the fall and adopted by the parliaments by year-end. At all
levels, budgets include economic and organizational classifications, while budget requests also include
program formats. Only at the State level is program budgeting information, including program performance
measures, a part of the budget documentation that accompanies the annual budget law in the adoption
procedure.

Fiscal targets. The Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies should set medium-term fiscal targets
each year; however, the only fiscal goal they note is that the primary deficit and total public consumption
should be reduced; while concerning debt they quote the annual ceilings for indebtedness of the budgets of
institutions of: BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB, and in compliance with legal limits.2

   In RS, administration of direct taxes, in terms of accounting, control and collection of all public revenues, fall under
responsibility of RS Tax Administration. After revenue allocation, some of revenues, namely taxes belong fully to RS
Government Budget (e.g. profit tax), others belong to local self-governance unit (e.g. property tax), while some other public
revenues are shared between these levels of authorities (e.g. income tax).

Reporting and audit. All four levels of government use the modified accrual basis3 for accounting, under
which revenues are recognized as they become available and measurable, while expenditures are recognized
when the liability is incurred. There may be concerns that not all government levels within the Entities use
comparable recording. Among the four main government levels in BiH, the charts of account are generally
detailed but are not harmonized. BiH Institutions, FBiH and RS are developing internal audit capabilities,
and all four reviewed levels of government have an independent supreme audit institution (SAI).

Cross-cutting issues. The PEFA ratings and the justifications for them across BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and
DB point to a number of issues that emerge as common themes across all four. While each of the four central
government levels assessed has some particular weaknesses in its PFM system, for all of the four levels the
process of preparing the budget and public investment programme is not well integrated with the medium-term
macroeconomic outlook and overall/sectoral strategic documents (which are in many cases missing or not
properly costed). Credible and comprehensive medium-term macro-fiscal strategies are lacking at all levels.

The coordination of fiscal policy is of particular importance in BiH, not only because of the decentralized
fiscal structure, but also because the country’s monetary policy is based on a currency board. Pursuant to the
Constitution, fiscal policies and medium-term framework are defined in each Entity, while BiH Fiscal Council
has fiscal policies coordination function through Global Framework of the Fiscal Balance and Policy (see
discussion on fiscal targets above). In practice the BiH Fiscal Council decides on revenues from indirect
taxation and the share of these revenues for BiH Institutions.

Despite some recent progress in budget execution, the lack of fully adequate internal controls (especially in
public procurement) makes the PFM systems in BiH vulnerable to inefficiency and waste. In budget reporting,
the fact that the charts of account of the four main government levels are not harmonized hampers access to
consolidated data. Within the Entities (primarily in FBiH), consolidation of data for all general government
levels—government, cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs—is also complex, and data are generally
not used to inform policy decisions. And in the context of budget scrutiny, despite recent improvements, better
follow-up on external audit findings and recommendations is missing. Furthermore, the coverage/quality of
internal audits and of performance audits performed by the SAIs is not comprehensive.

                          BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: PEFA ASSESSMENT
                      I. INTRODUCTION, COUNTRY BACKGROUND, CONTEXT
  A. Country Context and Economic Situation4
  After two years of fragile recovery from the global recession, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) experienced a
  double-dip recession in 2012 (Table 1.1). BiH grew by about 1 percent annually in 2010–11, but then GDP
  shrank by 1.2 percent in 2012. Deteriorating external conditions, a severe winter at the start of 2012, and
  wildfires in the second half of that year hit economic activity, adding to the impact from the second
  Eurozone economic dip. Consumption, investment, and exports were all affected. In addition, industrial
  production dropped sharply in 2012. The sharpest decline was in the export-oriented branches, reflecting
  decreased external demand. Manufacturing experienced a 7.6 percent cumulative output decline in 2012,
  followed by the energy and utility sector (-6.5 percent) and mining (-2.0 percent). Taken together, these
  factors resulted in an increase in unemployment and negative growth in 2012.

  But indicators suggest a modest recovery in economic activity in 2013, supported by exports. Industrial
  production grew by 7.1 percent in during 2013. Manufacturing was up by 17.0 percent, intermediate
  goods by 10.5 percent and capital goods by 19.2 percent, all indicating a revival in the manufacturing
  sector. This revival was supported by export growth, with goods exports up by 6.6 percent in the year.
  Energy exports led the way (up 34 percent), followed by capital goods (up 12.5 percent), and consumer
  goods (durable up 10.6 percent, non-durable up 7.3 percent). Non-energy intermediate goods production
  declined, suggesting that the increase in the manufacture of intermediate goods was largely serving BiH’s
  own manufacturing sector. Overall, the economy is estimated to have grown by 1.8 percent in 2013,
  following recovering exports demand, and is projected to grow by 2 percent in 2014.

The currency board continued to support monetary stability and inflation remained low into 2013. 5
Inflation declined from around 2 percent in 2012 (with core inflation below 1 percent) to turn negative (-
1.4 percent) in 2013. International reserves, which are crucial to maintaining monetary stability, remained
at a comfortable level during 2013, at around 5 months of imports. As a result of a stable nominal
exchange rate and lower inflation in BiH than in major trading partners, the real effective exchange rate
(REER) depreciated slightly during 2013 (-0.6 percent y-o-y). This suggests that the price
competitiveness of the domestic economy increased, in comparison to its major trading partners.

After two years of large current account deficits (CADs), the external position improved during 2013,
after two years of large current account deficits. The trade deficit declined from 32 percent of GDP in
2012 to 29.6 percent of GDP in 2013 thanks to higher exports of electricity and goods. Total exports of
goods increased by 8.7 percent in compared to 2012, reflecting some improvement in external demand. At
the same time, goods imports declined by -1.5 percent. A combination of foreign direct investments
(FDI), remittances, grants and foreign credit financed the Current Account Deficit (CAD). Foreign direct
(FDI) investment reached 1.8 percent of GDP in the first half of 2013, but then disappointed in the second
half of the year, reaching only 1.9 percent over the whole year. The remainder of the CAD was financed
by Other Investments (assets and liabilities of residents), and external borrowing (including from the
IMF).

Remittances continue to be an important source of financial flows for BiH. Remittances held up during
the crisis and remained a major part of the foreign financing, partly due to increased economic integration
with the EU. In 2013, remittances in the narrow definition (workers’ compensation and remittances)
amounted to 10.4 percent of GDP (slightly down from 10.4 percent in 2012), and in the broader definition
(narrow definition plus private current transfers) amounted to 15.6 percent of GDP (down from 16.5
percent of GDP in 2012).

BiH faced significant challenges maintaining a prudent fiscal policy due to the global financial crisis. The
authorities began fiscal consolidation in 2010 and reduced the deficit to 2.6 percent in 2012 (in line with
the IMF program requirements) from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009 (Figure 1.1). This consolidation was
necessary due to reduced revenues (mainly due to growing VAT refunds and tax arrears) and lack of
financing. In 2012, weak economic performance brought revenues down by 1.3 percent of GDP, with
direct taxes and social security hit hardest. There is some concern that net indirect tax revenues have not
yet picked up as projected, with large VAT refunds so far in the year. To maintain a sustainable fiscal

stance in the face of declining revenues, measures were taken to reduce expenditures. Public expenditures
were (and remain) excessively concentrated in non-growth enhancing areas. The authorities rebalanced
expenditures by reducing spending on wages, subsidies and social protection in 2012. At the same time,
capital spending increased. Total expenditure declined by 1.5 percent in 2012.

Total public debt increased slightly in 2012 but is considered sustainable. At the end of 2012, BiH public
debt reached 45.1 percent of GDP and consisted of external debt (27.9 percent of GDP) and domestic debt
(17.2 percent of GDP). External public debt is predominantly concessional debt to international financial
institutions, while domestic public debt is in the form of long-dated bonds.

Growth in BiH is expected to pick up slowly. The medium-term macroeconomic framework is based on
the assumption of a slow start to the economic recovery in both South East Europe and the EU. Over the
medium term, growth is projected to increase gradually to 4.0 percent by 2016, based on increased
exports, continued stable inflows of remittances, and some progress in implementing structural reforms.
Still, the medium-term growth potential of BiH’s economy is constrained by two main factors. The first is
a weak business environment that still requires substantial reforms, and is hampering investment and
growth. The second is a fiscal policy that remains focused on income redistribution rather than growth.
Strengthening public financial management, including both debt management policies and practices, as
well as focusing spending on growth-enhancing areas, will be an integral part of boosting economic
growth. Ensuring the sustainability of the fiscal framework is the key to macroeconomic stability. Fiscal
consolidation is expected to continue gradually over the medium term: from a deficit of 2.7 percent in
2012 to a deficit of 0.8 percent in 2016. Fiscal policy in 2013 targeted a reduction in the general
government deficit to 2 percent. The latest of the Global Fiscal Framework for 2014-2016 (which
determines the overall spending envelope and revenue share for the budget of the Institutions of BiH), is
consistent with the medium term fiscal objectives and was adopted on 17 September 2013.

Revenues are expected to remain stable, but successful implementation of reforms could increase
collections. Revenues are projected to remain broadly unchanged as a share of GDP (around 46 percent)
over the medium term (Table 1.2). There may be scope to increase collections, including a better
understanding of the cause of the current high VAT refunds. Excise taxes – notably on fuels and tobacco
– may be increased over the medium term to align rates with those of the EU.

There is little room to increase expenditures over the medium term. Total expenditure is expected to
decline slightly from 48.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 46.5 percent in 2016. Better control of wages, public
sector hiring, and the revision of veterans’ benefits could generate savings. Spending in these areas is
inefficient and fails to alleviate poverty.

External debt is expected to stay contained over the medium term. In 2012, BiH’s external debt consisted
of the public external debt (28 percent of GDP) and estimated private external debt (25 percent of GDP).
There are no comprehensive statistics on the private external debt in BiH, but the largest share (60
percent) of this debt is owed by foreign-owned banks and mainly represents borrowing by subsidiaries
from their parent banks to finance their operations in BiH. The remaining share of private external debt is
owed by a number of large industrial companies (steel and aluminum manufacturers, large international
retail chains) that are able to borrow directly from commercial banks abroad.

On the domestic side, BiH has limited formal public debt as it did not issue bonds until 2007. They were
issued to address the substantial domestic liabilities from the pre-war period, accumulated as a result of
the 1992-95 war and the fiscal pressures in its wake. In response to a surge of court filings by individual
claimants and vastly different court awards for similar claims, in 2004 both FBiH and RS enacted laws
specifying the total amounts of liabilities, and the method of their settlement. With minor exceptions, the
laws divided the claims into three large groups: general liabilities, liabilities on the basis of savings in
foreign currency and liabilities on the basis of war damages. Repayment of these bonds has begun, and
they will be fully repaid in compliance with terms and conditions stipulated by the Law. Given the limited
development of local financial markets, all the financial resources cannot exclusively be provided from
domestic sources.6

 The very first issuance, by the RS government in May 2011, was for €18.41 million of 6-month treasury bills. In the first quarter
of 2013 two successful auctions of Entity T-bills were recorded: the first on the Sarajevo Stock Exchange with an average 1.89
percent interest rate, which is the record low interest rate and the second on the Banja Luka Stock Exchange, at a record high
average interest rate on 6M T-bills of 3.98% in RS.

Public sector debt is expected to grow slightly in 2013, but is considered sustainable. External public
sector debt is estimated to have grown from 27.9 percent in 2012 to 29.5 percent in 2013, while total
public debt is projected to decrease from 45.1 percent in 2012 to 44.9 percent in 2013. External financing
requirements are projected to decline slightly over the medium term, from 9 percent of GDP in 2013 to
8.4 percent by 2015 (Table 1.3). The scenario is embedded in the overall macroeconomic framework,
which assumes sustained fiscal consolidation through the implementation of the planned reforms. The
scenario would be vulnerable to a sharp depreciation in the currency, a non-interest CAD shock, an
unexpected slowdown in GDP growth, or inadequate fiscal consolidation. In particular, a depreciation of
30 percent would imply an increase in the debt level to around 72 percent of GDP, which represents an
extreme scenario with only small probability of happening.

There are external and internal risks to the macroeconomic outlook and the reform program. External
risks are related to possible delays in Europe’s overall economic recovery. Since the EU countries
continue to be BiH’s largest trading partner, delays in Europe’s recovery would affect BiH’s economic
outlook through their adverse impact on exports, remittances, and capital flows. External economic
developments and the pace of economic recovery in the key export markets are both uncertain and beyond
the control of the authorities. Internally, political risks are the largest cause for concern. BiH’s
challenging political environment presents a tough background for reforms, particularly taking into
consideration pending general elections, which bring clear risks for implementation of required reforms —
including fiscal measures that are needed and that may even have to be further adjusted over time.

B. Link to World Bank Country Partnership Strategy
The World Bank’s 2012-2016 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to support BiH through greater
leveraging of knowledge and advisory services, and with focused and targeted financing. Additionally,
the World Bank will seek to partner with the EU, including through cofinancing of operations and
analytical work. The CPS supports BiH’s EU aspirations.

The CPS is organized around three broad pillars: (a) Sustain Growth and Improve Competitiveness; (b)
Improve Public Service Delivery and Make Growth More Inclusive; and (c) Sustainable Use of Natural
Resources and Climate Change. In each of these pillars, the CPS articulates the range of advisory and
financial products the World Bank is making available across a number of sectors and cross-cutting areas.

The PEFA assessment is closely related to this partnership framework. First, modernization of public
financial management (PFM) in the country is of significant importance to sustain good economic
management and improved governance arrangements (CPS Pillar I). Since transparent and accountable
PFM is a critical element of good governance and efficient use of public resources, the findings from this
PEFA Assessment will inform the PFM reform strategies that will be part of the Bank’s nonlending
assistance to the government.

Second, the performance of PFM systems, particularly in the areas of revenue management and national
investment planning, is significant to supporting government efforts as a regulator and provider/purchaser
of services to/from the private sector. Moreover, well-functioning PFM systems are also important for
ensuring that resources intended for pro-poor growth and poverty reduction actually get allocated to
targeted programs—for example, through improved management of resources in primary and secondary
schools, improved governance in health system expenditures, and improved management to execute
targeted social safety net and social benefit programs (CPS Pillar II).

The PEFA Assessment is also aligned with the CPS principles of building and deepening partnerships
with European institutions. This PEFA assessment is funded by a grant from the Strengthening
Accountability and Fiduciary Environment (SAFE) Trust Fund, which itself is financed with
contributions from the European Commission and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.

C. Objectives of the PEFA Assessment
This 2013 Bosnia and Herzegovina PEFA Assessment is prepared in response to the request of the
governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina for such an assessment to benchmark the country’s PFM
systems against international standards as a basis for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public
spending, supporting the country’s efforts to modernize and better align with EU Directives. It is also
intended to provide a baseline assessment of the BiH PFM system, which would contribute to revision of
existing strategic documents related to the improvement of public financial management, including the
revision of the public administration reform strategy. It also provides the benchmark against which future
improvements in the PFM system could be measured through follow up PEFA Assessments.

D. Methodology
The analysis for the 2013 performance report is based on information collected and data reported for the
year 2012 and earlier years, as required by the PEFA methodology. However specifically for the basic PI
calculations, information collected during the field visits held in January to April 2013 was for the years
FY 2009 to FY 2011. The basic approach was applied to each of the four governments included in this
PEFA assessment:

       Collect and review existing primary information sources, including relevant laws, administrative
        procedures, and financial and other performance data.
                                                     21


       Collect additional information and conduct interviews with officials through field work and
        specific meetings to complete the initial draft assessment.

       Consult with government agencies and other donors to confirm the team’s understanding of the
        performance information and discuss the PEFA ratings.

Detailed consultations were held with other donors during the development of both the concept note for
the assessment and preparation of the report itself. These donors, which have strong interest in PFM,
include the European Commission, which is providing budget support across a broad range of sectors, and
the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, as well as other international partners.

Each of the four governments was closely involved in the PEFA assessment process through provision of
data, interviews, and validation of the draft results of the PEFA assessment. In each government, the
Ministry of Finance was the main counterpart for the report. Consultations were also held with the four
SAIs, Parliaments, Taxation and Customs Services, Public Procurement Agencies, and Public
Procurement Review Bodies. No non-state actors were engaged in the preparation of the Report.

The PEFA assessment took account of recent analytical work on PFM, including Public Expenditure and
Institutional Reviews (2012, 2006), an OECD/SIGMA Public Expenditure Management and Control
Assessment (2011) and Public Procurement Assessment (2011, 2008), and various other donor-financed
studies on PFM in BiH. These reports tend to analyze the progress made in key areas of PFM as part of
ongoing efforts and to suggest a menu of policy reforms. In contrast, the PEFA assessment applies a
comprehensive, standardized, and indicator-driven methodology that focuses on measuring the aggregate
outcome of PFM systems performance.

E. Scope
This first-ever PEFA assessment covers the four levels of government of BiH: the State, FBiH, RS, and
DB. In each of the government assessments, the reviews included line ministries, services, and agencies.
The assessment also captures the activities of state-owned enterprises and local governments (e.g., in
FBiH), to the extent that they raise fiscal risks to the central budget, but it does not include a detailed
review of PFM systems and performance at the subnational level in general. Cantons were not covered by
this report, but could be subject to a separate sub-national level PEFA assessment in the future. Aspects of
decentralization are covered by indicators, as they are applicable for each of the governments assessed:
PI-8 (Framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations); PI-9 (Fiscal risks arising from subnational
governments); and PI-23 (Availability of information on resources at front-line service delivery units).

This PEFA assessment will provide critical knowledge and technical support for the Government to
assess the results achieved to date and to design a coherent, results-oriented, and realistic program for
further reform. Future PFM reform might be expected to focus on the following areas: full compliance
with the EU acquis; strengthening of programs’ results orientation and performance monitori ng as part of
the budget process; compliance with procurement laws and internal controls; improved capacity of
internal audit; prevention and detection of corruption; and further improvements in budget execution.

F. How the Report is organized
As this is the first single, comprehensive PFM assessment of any type for the four levels of government in
BiH, this report has been organized and presented in a format that differs from standard PEFA
Performance Reports.

Chapter 2 presents a high-level overview of PFM responsibilities and functions in BiH and of how they
are allocated across the different governments. Given the unique organization of the country, this chapter
notes the legal basis for the division of responsibilities and describes which budgetary responsibilities are
                                                   22


divided or shared across the governments. Chapter 3 draws from the individual assessments and presents
the most important cross-cutting issues—issues that have been identified and measured through the PEFA
framework as lagging and that, if left unaddressed, may pose important risks to budget integrity and
national development initiatives.

Chapter 4 presents the individual PEFA assessments of each of the four levels of government in four
subsections, presented so that stakeholders will be able to read the government assessment relevant to
their interests. Some caveats about the application of the PEFA indicators:

       Because of the constitutional and legal bases for the division of responsibilities across the four
        levels of government, some PEFA indicators cannot be measured or are not applicable at a
        specific level of government. Some indicators (e.g., public procurement, PI-19) are measurable at
        only one level (the State), even though they may affect the other governments.

In terms of the external debt (including budget support loans) and guarantees, they are for the most part
contracted through the MFT BiH for all government levels in BiH. However, each government level has
external donations which do not necessarily have to be contracted/authorized through the BiH Institutions
for all government levels (although Ministry of Finance and Treasury does keep some data on grants
which go to lower government levels, but only for few donors such as the World Bank and KfW and
mostly in the cases where country-wide coordination/project implementation units are established).
Furthermore, only a small portion of all donations go through government budgets (in comparison to only
available estimate of total external donations) which is estimated roughly by the Central Bank within
Balance of Payments based on the data on official development assistance to BiH published by the
OECD-DAC and some collected directly from the donors present, external donations which go through
the budgets represent a very small portion of total external donations (which were significant in earlier
periods). In addition, among the four central government levels, only BiH Institutions budget includes
some small donations in budget plans (only for those donations which can be planned with certainty),
while Entity Government budgets essentially do not include any donations. However, budget execution
reports at all levels do include review of actually executed donationswhich go through budgets. Thus,
only a very small portion of total external donations seems to go through government budgets, out of
which in turn very small portion (or nothing at all at the Entity level) is planned in government budgets
due in part to lack of predictability. Overall, external donations, as opposed to external budget support
loans, are not an important source of revenue for central governments in BiH, with only small portions
going through the budgets. Even in the cases of external donations which goes through the budgets, they
are either not planned at all in budget plans (at the Entity level) or only a small portion is planned in
budget plan (BiH Institutions), implying poor predictability of inflows of external donations. Given that
most of the donor funding refers to external debt and given than only small external donations are planned
in the budgets (especially in the Entity budgets), the PEFA indicators measuring Donor Performance (D1-
D3) in this Report are applied and measured only at the level of BiH Institutions. The flow of external
debt information (among other dimensions of financial/budgetary reporting) on debt financing is not fluid
across the governments of BiH and is captured by reporting on BiH Institutions Under the Stand By
Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, it is planned that the Entities will improve its reporting on foreign
financed projects in 2014. Chapter 5 presents a brief overview of the different PFM reform initiatives
underway across BiH.

                    II. PFM OVERVIEW OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The fiscal system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is highly decentralized, reflecting the provisions of the country’s
constitution. The general government sector consists of four relatively autonomous units (see Figure 2.1): BiH
Institutions, Brčko District (DB), and two Entities—Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and
Republika Srpska (RS). BiH Institutions are at the central government level (governed by the BiH Council of
Ministers); each Entity has its own government and extra-budgetary funds (EBFs)—six in FBiH, seven in RS,
and two in DB; and each Entity also has local self-governance units (78 municipalities and 2 cities in FBiH
and 57 municipalities and 6 cities in RS). The structure in FBiH has 10 cantons that serve as a middle level
between the government of FBiH and local self-governance units, and each canton has its own government
and some EBFs. In general the assessment of public enterprises and local governments is beyond the scope of
this report (and data for public enterprises and consolidation with general government sectors are generally not
available in BiH); they are only reviewed to the extent that specific PEFA indicators require such a dimension
to be included for measurement. Although Cantons are important (actual expenditures in 2012 according to
Table 2.1: 28% of total FBH expenditures) in terms of overall expenditures at FBH level, were not covered in
detail by this report.

                    Figure 2.1. General Government Structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina




Main revenue jurisdictions. Indirect taxation is administered at the level of joint institutions of Bosnia
and Herzegovina; whilst direct taxation is at the Entity level (with differences between the Entities). In
RS, direct taxes administration, in terms of control and collection of all public revenues falls under RS
Tax Administration responsibility. Some of public revenues, namely taxes are allocated fully to RS
Government budget (e.g. profit tax revenues), others are allocated to local level authorities (e.g. property
tax revenues), while a portion of public revenues is shared between these levels of authorities (e.g.
income tax revenues). Social contributions are administered by EBFs in FBiH, while in RS they have
been administered by the RS Tax Administration.

Expenditure jurisdiction/government functions. State-level authorities include foreign affairs, defense,
State security (through agencies such as Border Police, State Investigation and Protection Agency,
Intelligence and Security Agency, and Directorate for Coordination of Police Bodies), agencies related to
European Union (EU) integration (such as Institute for Standards, Institute for Intellectual Properties,
Veterinary Office, Competition Council, Anti-Corruption Agency), State judiciary, election committee,
                                                       24


and coordinating ministries/agencies for other sectors (e.g., the State Ministry of Civil Affairs has Sectors
for Education, Social Protection and Pensions, Health, Science, and Culture and Sport).

Each Entity has social security funds for pensions, health, and employment, as well as public entities for
roads (in FBiH, cantons also have road, health, and employment funds). Other Entity-level functions
differ between FBiH and RS. The RS government administers expenditures for education, health, local
judiciary (other than the State judiciary), police (other than the State police), and social welfare, while in
FBiH the cantons administer most of these expenditures. Local self-governance units are mostly in charge
of local administrative services (such as birth/death certification, building permits/cadaster, and some
business licensing); local utility/infrastructure for water and sewage, solid waste, and local roads; and
some functions in education (in RS, preschool education and capital improvement of secondary schools;
in FBiH, some expenditures for preschool and primary education in some cantons).

Expenditure jurisdiction among the government levels is not always clearly defined, and there are some
overlaps, especially in FBiH between cantons and local self-governance units (and Sarajevo Canton has
further complexities because of overlap between the city and the municipalities that are under city territory).

According to the Government Financial Statistics (GFS) data for 2011 (consolidated and published by the
Central Bank of BiH, presented in Table 2.1), out of the total BiH general government consolidated
expenditure of around BAM 11.7 billion, BiH Institutions have a 9% share, FBiH a 58% share, RS a 32%
share, and DB a 2% share. In each Entity’s expenditure, EBFs account for almost 50% of total
expenditure (year 2012: for FBiH: 54.6%, and for RS 47%). In RS, the remainder of the Entity’s
expenditure is split between the RS government level, with 38% of the total in 2012, and local self-
governance, with around 15% of total expenditure. In FBiH, local self-governance unit spending is10% of
the Entity’s expenditure, while cantons and the FBiH government split the remaining 40% in a ratio of
around 3:2.

general government (excluding public         nonfinancial assets. Excludes foreign-financed projects, which do not go
enterprises), representing a high burden     through budgets. Foreign debt servicing is presented at the State level here
on the BiH economy.                          (since foreign debt servicing for both Entities and DB goes through the
                                             budget of BiH Institutions).



Macroeconomic and fiscal coordination. BiH’s high level of fiscal decentralization, with no official
harmonized methodology for fiscal reporting, presents a significant barrier to planning and monitoring
fiscal policy in the country. The coordination of fiscal policy is of particular importance in BiH, not only
                                                                 25


because of the complex fiscal structure, but also because the country’s monetary policy is based on a
currency board. Fiscal policy coordination is one of the ways to ensure fiscal discipline which is relevant
within currency board context. Ensuring fiscal discipline and responsibility within the Entities is a
precondition for ensuring fiscal discipline through fiscal policy coordination at the l;evel of BiH
Institutions, Entities and Brčko District.

After a long process of preparation and political negotiations, in July 2008 the BiH Parliamentary
Assembly adopted the Law on the Fiscal Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The responsibilities given to
the Fiscal Council7 in the legislation are as follows:

     1. Coordinating fiscal policy in BiH.

     2. Adopting the proposed document of the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policy in BiH,
        which should contain the following parameters:

              the proposed fiscal targets for the budgets of the institutions of BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB;

              the proposed macroeconomic projections and the projection of the total indirect taxes and
               their allocation for the next fiscal year; and

              the proposed ceiling for borrowing in the budgets of the institutions of BiH, FBiH, RS, and
               DB.

     3. Adopting the proposed short-term and long-term macroeconomic projections.

     4. Monitoring the realization of the set targets and criteria in issuing and executing the budget, as
        well as the taking of certain corrective measures and activities.

     5. Establishing full coordination of the activities to comply with the budgetary calendars in
        preparing, adopting, executing, and auditing the budgets of the institutions of BiH, FBiH, RS, and
        DB.

     6. Proposing priorities for improving the public finance sector in BiH.

     7. Adoption of the budget of the Fiscal Council.

The four levels of Government’s lack of credible macro-fiscal strategies is reflected in the quality of the
Economic and Fiscal Programs it submits to the EU. The European Commission’s assessment of the BiH
2013 Economic and Fiscal Program 8 notes that fiscal sustainability needs to be anchored in credible
medium-term strategies.

Public debt. Another general PFM issue worth noting is the public debt in BiH. According to IMF data,
public debt in 2012 was around 44% of GDP in BiH—a level that is considered to be moderate in
international terms. However, any analysis of debt level in BiH (both countrywide and Entity-specific)
should be approached with caution, given the country’s large infrastructure needs; potential large debt
segments (such as restitution), which are currently excluded; and a recent trend of debt increases that

  The permanent members of the Fiscal Council are the Chair of the Council of Ministers of BiH (who chairs the Fiscal Council
sessions), the Prime Minister of the RS government, the Prime Minister of the FBiH, the Minister of Finance and Treasury of BiH, the
Finance Minister of RS, and the Finance Minister of the FBiH. In addition to the six permanent members, sessions of the Fiscal Council
also require the attendance of the Governor of the Central Bank and the Governor of Brčko District in their capacity as non-voting
observers. Fiscal Council sessions may be held only if at least five members are in attendance; and decisions are valid only if five
members vote in favor of them—that is, at least one representative from each of the constituent’s votes affirmatively.

include large budget support loans (spent in part for current expenditure, which still needs to undergo
structural reforms).

The BiH Institutions has a major legal role in contracting of foreign debt of all levels in BiH, including the
Entities and DB. After the Entity foreign loans have gone through all of the procedures at the Entity
government level, the BiH Parliament must ratify all loans as the BiH is the ultimate guarantor of debt to
international financial institutions (IFIs), and the BiH MFT administers all foreign debt servicing for all levels
in BiH. Thus, virtually all of the countrywide foreign debt servicing (except some very small direct Entity
foreign debt—around BAM 150 million in 2012) is a special part of the BiH Institutions budget (both in
planned budget and in execution reports).

The BiH MFT regularly monitors all of the foreign debt servicing for the entire country, regularly
exchanging information with the Entities and DB. It also monitors the implementation of such loans,
including by reviewing annual project audit reports and approving any withdrawal applications. It reports
monthly on debt monitoring and prepares a report on public debt in BiH (including both external and
internal public debt stock and repayment projections) for the BiH Institutions’ MTEF. In addition, it
annually prepares a separate review of the country’s total public debt, which it submits to BiH Parliament.
Moreover, the regular quarterly, semiannual, and annual execution reports for the budget of BiH
Institutions include a detailed overview of foreign debt servicing execution.

The Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of BiH stipulates that Advisory Committee for Debt
(comprising of two representatives from Council of Ministers one of which is the Finance Minister, one
representative from the Central Bank of BiH, two representatives from the Entity Governments including
Finance Ministers, and Finance Directorate director from the Brčko District), which is supposed to be in
charge of preparing state debt management strategy. However, in practice, this has not been implemented.

Currently, the only debt sustainability analysis is the analysis IMF prepares within their Article IV
Country Reports or periodically in some of the reports in reviews under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
(four such analyses were prepared by the IMF in 2009-2013). The IMF debt sustainability analyses have
so far been performed without active participation of the authorities in the preparation process (other than
data provision) and that the authorities do not use this analysis in their strategic planning process (the debt
sustainability analysis is not linked to a specific government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing
policies and needs at any government level which are large, having in mind large infrastructure needs. In
the forthcoming period, efforts shall be invested on the drafting of a full sustainability analysis with the
assistance of the World Bank team, as well as within IPA projects.

However, it should be noted that the IMF has recently shared its methodology and instructions in terms of
debt sustainability analysis with the Federal Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Federal
Ministry of Finance stemming from the conclusion of recent FBiH Debt Management Performance
Assessment (DeMPA) prepared by the World Bank, which also found that no DSAs are undertaken, no
sensitivity analyses are used, and no medium-term debt management strategy has been developed and it
recommended that the technical assistance is provided to the FMF for the debt sustainability analysis.
Thus, DSA preparation for the FBiH by the FMF can be expected in future, as it is prescribed by the new
Law on Budgets in FBiH adopted in December 2013 that the debt sustainability analysis will have to be
annexed to budget. The IMF DSA template has also been shared with the MFT in past years. But,
currently there is no evidence that the authorities have prepared and used own or IMFDSA in their own
strategic planning process.

A. Legal and Institutional Framework for PFM
The roles and responsibilities of different government levels in BiH are defined in numerous pieces of
legislation, including the following:9

           Constitution of BiH. The constitution defines the main responsibilities of the BiH Institutions
            and Entities (Article III) and provides for the budget of BiH Institutions (Article VIII).

           Organic Budget Legislation. Each of the four main government levels has its own Organic
            Budget Law (Law on Financing of BiH Institutions, Law on Budgets in FBiH Law on Budget
            System in RS, and Law on Budget of DB). The laws mandate the preparation of annual budgets
            and of MTEFs.

            BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB each adopts its own annual budget, and so do lower
            government levels—cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs—separately. Each of the four
            main government levels also adopts a medium-term budget framework. The MTEFs for the
            Entities and DB are supposed to include all general government levels at that level (including
            cantons, local self-governance units and EBFs); however, for several years FBiH has adopted an
            MTEF only for the FBiH government level, while RS adopts MTEF with data covering local self-
            governance units as well as EBFs, projects financed by external sources, and Public Enterprises
            responsible of Roads and Motorways.

            Using GFS methodology (only for Statement of Operations), the Central Bank of BiH, officially
            consolidates budget execution data for all general government sector levels (excluding only
            foreign finance projects, which do not go through budgets, but which IMF estimates for its own
            use). In addition, each month the Macroeconomic Analysis Unit (MAU) of the ITA Governing
            Board10 consolidates administrative fiscal execution data (excluding financing), including at the
            local self-governance level (with some delay in reporting at the lowest levels) in a basic format
            used by the IMF to monitor SBAs (not the full GFS 2011 methodology used by the Central
            Bank). RS reports on government activities including extra budgetary funds, some foreign-
            financed projects (including local government debt and the debt of entities in the ownership of
            RS). In FBiH not all government levels are included: road directorates, foreign-financed projects,
            and off-budget spending from escrow accounts are excluded. Both the Central Bank and the
            MAU publish historical execution data.

           Tax Legislation. The main indirect and direct tax legislation includes the Law on Indirect
            Taxation System in BiH, Law on Value-Added Tax in BiH, Law on Customs Policy and Law on
            Customs Tariff in BiH, Law on Excises in BiH (all countrywide and administered by the ITA),
            Law on Income Tax in FBiH, Law on Profit Tax in FBiH, Law on Social Contributions in FBiH,
            Law on Personal Income Tax in RS, Law on Corporate Profit Tax in RS, Law on Social
            Contributions in RS, Law on Personal Income Tax in DB, and Law on Corporate Profit Tax in
            DB.

           Distribution of Revenues. The main laws include the Law on Payments to the Single Account
            and Revenue Allocation, Law on Allocation of Public Revenues in FBiH, and in RS the
            distribution of revenues is covered by the Law on the Budget System of RS.

           Treasuries. State-level treasury-related provisions are in the Law on Finance of BiH Institutions;
            in addition, there are a Law on Treasury of FBiH, Law on Treasury of RS, and Law on Treasury
            of DB.

9
    Annex 2 lists the full set of normative acts used for carrying out the PEFA assessment.
10
    Although the ITA is only mandated to collect indirect taxes the MAU also reportson direct taxes collected by the Entities.
                                                               28


           Debt Legislation. Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees in BiH; Law on Settlement of
            Liabilities from Foreign Currency Deposit Savings; Law on Debt, Borrowing and Guarantees in
            FBiH; Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees in RS; and Law on Internal Debt of DB.

           Internal Audit. The Law on Internal Audit of BiH Institutions (the revised Law on Financing of
            BiH Institutions also includes some provisions relating to internal audit); Law on Internal Audit
            of Public Sector Institutions in the FBiH; and Law on Internal Audit of Public Sector Institutions
            in the RS (in DB, the Law on Budget of DB includes provisions about internal audit and financial
            control). In addition, a coordination board of all Central Harmonization Units (CHUs) in BiH
            (comprising managers of State and Entity CHUs), was established through the Law on Internal
            Audit of BiH Institutions with a view to harmonizing policies, procedures, and activities in the
            internal audit sphere in BiH; proposing amendments on internal audit legislation; adopting bylaws
            and a code of ethics for internal auditors; and developing/implementing training for and providing
            certification of internal auditors.

           Public Sector Auditing. All four main government levels have their own SAIs, each with its own
            laws and regulations in this area. However, the BiH Constitution does not include a clear
            declaration of the SAI role. The same applies to the constitution of the entities and the role of
            their respective SAIs. Legislation includes the Law on Auditing Institutions of Bosnia and
            Herzegovina, Law on the Auditing Institutions of FBiH, Law on Audit of Public Sector of RS,
            and Law on Audit of Public Administration and Institutions of DB.

           Public Procurement. Unlike other aspects of PFM in the BiH, the Public Procurement Law is
            unique in being enacted at the level of the BiH. All governments regulate their public
            procurement matters in compliance with this law; there is no separate procurement law at the
            level of the Entities or DB. The Public Procurement Law regulates the procurement process and
            defines the roles and responsibilities of different bodies such as the procuring entity, authorized
            agency, and complaint body. The Law still remains to be aligned with the EU acquis.11Under the
            SBA, the authorities have committed to adopt a new law on public procurement (by BiH
            Parliament) by the end of February2014 to strengthen governance, enhance transparency, and
            bring procurement practices in BiH in line with those in the EU.

           Fiscal Council. The Law on the Fiscal Council of BiH.

B. Budgetary Responsibilities
This section explains budget preparation procedures, revenue sharing, fiscal rules, reallocation, data
standards, budget classification, internal controls, public procurement, reporting, treasury operations,
oversight/SAI, and other aspects of PFM in BiH.

Budget Preparation Procedures
The Fiscal Council of BiH and the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH are supposed
to provide the main parameters (macro-fiscal projections, fiscal targets, revenue sharing, and overall fiscal
and debt strategy) for preparing the MTEFs (which each of the four main government levels prepares
annually). In turn, MTEFs are the basis for annual budgets. In addition to the Fiscal Council legislation,
which regulates overall coordination, each of the four main government levels has its separate fiscal
legislation and institutions for the budget processes and procedures.

                                                             29


Budget planning procedures and calendars are broadly similar at all four levels:12MTEFs are prepared
each year and adopted in early summer, serving as a pre-draft of annual budgets, which are prepared in
the fall and adopted by the parliaments by year-end. At all levels, budgets include economic and
organizational classifications, while budget requests also include program formats. Only at the State level
is program budgeting information, including program performance measures, a part of the budget
documentation that accompanies the annual budget law in the adoption procedure (as prescribed by the
Law on Financing of BiH Institutions).

BiH Institutions. The Law on Financing Institutions of BiH defines the preparation, decision, execution,
accounting, reporting, and supervision of the BiH budget, as well as public investments, single treasury
account of joint institutions on the level of the BiH, and the principles, system, and harmonization of
financial management and control in BiH Institutions. The law presents a detailed budget calendar,
including the preparation of an MTEF covering the next budget year and the two following years (which
should be adopted each year by June 30 by the Council of Ministers of BiH) and the adoption of an
annual budget for the BiH Institutions (which is based on the medium-term budget framework and should
be adopted by December 31 of each year by the BiH Parliament).

Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina. The legal basis for preparing the annual and medium-term budgets is
the Law on Budgets in FBiH, which regulates preparation of the MTEFs and annual budgets and covers all
general government levels in FBiH (FBiH government, cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs).
The new Law on Budgets in FBiH adopted in December 2013 strengthened legal prescription of the
preparation of MTEFs and annual budgets. Some improvements in this new legislation include provision of
more detail budget documentation; annexing financial plans of state-owned enterprises to the MTEF,
annexing debt sustainability analysis to the budget documentation; strengthening procedures for adoption of
budgets of extra-budgetary funds; introduction of better connection between economic policy and MTEFs;
introduction of fiscal rule in terms of current budget balance; and establishment of Fiscal Coordination Body
for FBiH. However, preparation of MTEFs of Cantons and local self-governance units is vaguely
prescribed, and the preparation of comprehensive MTEF for entire general government sector in FBiH by
the FMF does appear to be prescribed. Furthermore, the Law prescribes procedures for the FBiH
government and briefly prescribes that the Federal Ministry of Finance also consolidates budget data for the
lower government levels in FBiH, using data that cantons, municipalities, cities, and EBFs are obliged to
submit to the FMF 15 days before adoption. Furthermore, while Law prescribes that the lower government
levels send their budget execution reports to FMF (via Cantons in the case of local self-governance units),
the usage of such consolidated data by the FMF is not clearly defined (as the annual budget execution report
which FMF submits to Government and Parliament does not consolidate the date on execution of all general
government sector levels in FBiH).

Republika Srpska. The new Law on Budget System in RS, adopted in December 2012, regulates
preparation of the MTEFs and annual budgets and covers all general government levels in RS (RS
government, local self-governance units, and EBFs). This law includes separate detailed budget calendars
for the RS government, local self-governance units, and EBFs (local self-governance units and EBFs do
not send inputs for the RS MTEF, but the RS government includes projections for these lower
government levels in the RS MTEF).

Brčko District. The Law on Budget in DB regulates preparation of the MTEFs and annual budgets,
covering the DB government and EBFs. It prescribes a detailed budget calendar.

Tax System and Revenue Sharing


12
   DFID's project Strengthening Public Expenditure Management in BiH provided technical assistance to help the Finance
Ministries introduce broadly harmonized budget calendars and budget instructions, medium-term expenditure planning, and basic
introductory principles of program budgeting at all levels.
                                                             30


Indirect Taxation. Indirect taxation is at the State level. Revenues from indirect taxation (VAT, customs,
excises, and road tariffs) are shared among the State, the Entities, and DB. In the Entities they are further
distributed according to different formulas among the Entity government, local self-governance units, and
public entities for roads in both Entities and also to the cantons in FBiH. The indirect taxation legislation
prescribes that out of total revenues, the revenues needed for BiH Institutions, defined by annual Budget
Law (which is based on Fiscal Balance and Policies Global Framework) are subtracted first as well as
revenues that are reserved for the refunding of indirect taxes (in 2013, 24% of total VAT collected). Then
(based on a decision by the Office of the High Representative), DB gets 3.55% of remaining funds, or a
minimum of BAM 124 million. Using a formula derived from the final consumption data on VAT forms,
the remaining funds are divided between the two Entities: 63.93% for FBiH and 32.52% for RS (as of
August 2013). 13 In practice, in the past five years there have been political problems and delays in
decisions about the amount BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation revenues and disputes
about final consumption data, with consequent delays in decisions on the formula for sharing indirect
taxation revenues between the two Entities.

From the funds available for each Entity, the resources required for servicing the relevant foreign debt of
the entities are subtracted, and the remaining funds are distributed among the government levels within
the Entities according to Entity laws. In FBiH, 36.2% belongs to the FBiH government, 51.48%to cantons
(based on population, area, number of students, and development level of the canton), 8.42% to local self-
governance units (also based on population, area, number of students, and development level), and 3.9%
to public entities for roads. In RS, 72% belongs to the RS budget, 24% to budgets of local government
(based on population, area, and number of students), and 4%”RS Roads” Pubic Enterprise.

Direct Taxation. Direct taxation is administered at the Entity level. In RS, personal income tax is shared
among the government and local self-governance units: the government receives 100% of income tax on
copyrights and intellectual property, capital income, and capital gains; 75% of personal wages and
allowances and income from independent work); and 100% of corporate profit tax. In FBiH, personal
income tax is shared among the cantons and local self-governance units, with cantons receiving 65.54%
and local self-governance units receiving 34.46% (except in Sarajevo Canton, where the municipalities
get only 1.79% of these revenues). Corporate profit tax belongs to the cantons, except for the sectors of
electricity distribution, post offices, telecommunications and games of chance, which belong to the FBiH
government. New amendments to the Law on Distribution of Revenues in FBiH, which are now in the
parliamentary adoption procedures, envisage a decrease of cantons’ share in personal income tax to 59%
and simplify the revenue sharing in Sarajevo Canton.

Property/real estate14 tax revenues (including taxes on transfer of immovable property and rights) belong
to local self-governance units in both Entities. In addition to that, in RS all the real estate in the ownership
of citizens is being taxed, however transfer of ownership has not been subject to taxation since January
2012, when the Real Estate Fiscal Register was established in RS providing all necessary information on
the tax base for this type of tax. In FBiH the property tax is being paid only on weekend homes and the
sales, i.e. the transfer of ownership over property. The system providing information on the tax base for
this type of taxes is incomplete, as it does not contain all the potential property / real estate that should be
taxed, especially in FBiH.

Other Revenues. In addition to the indirect taxation revenues (which constitute around 70% of the
revenues of BiH Institutions), other revenue belonging to the BiH Institutions includes administrative fees
from BiH Institutions, revenue from State-level regulatory agencies (such as the Communications
Regulatory Agency), and a share in the profit of the Central Bank of BiH.

  In RS this tax is called tax on real estate.
                                                        31


In addition to tax revenues, other revenues to the FBiH government include administrative, service, and
penalty fees from federal government institutions, as well as revenues from FBiH assets or natural
resources, including revenues from dividends and profit-sharing from public enterprises. Cantonal
governments, in addition to the tax revenues described above, also have administrative, service, and
penalty fees from cantonal government institutions and revenues from assets or natural resources owned
by the cantons. Local self-governance units in FBiH, in addition to the tax and other revenues they share
with the government of FBiH, also have municipal/city administrative, service, and penalty fees,
communal fees, water protection fees, fees for use of assets or natural resources owned by the unit,
sojourn taxes, and taxes on games of chance.

In addition to the tax revenues described above, the RS government shares some other revenues with local
self-governance units: 70% of fees from the change of agricultural land purpose, 50% of rent fees for land
owned by the government, 70% of concession fees for mineral raw materials, revenues from special water
fees (with different shares for different types, most of which are shared in a ratio of 70:30 with local self-
governance units), and 30% of revenue from confiscated assets. Other revenues of the RS government
include administrative taxes and service and penalty fees from RS government institutions. Local self-
governance units in RS, in addition to tax revenues, also have municipal/city administrative and service fees
and cash penalty and revenues from assets or natural resources they own.

In both Entities and in DB, revenue for EBFs includes social contributions relevant to the specific fund
and part of the indirect taxation revenues for public entities for roads, as well as other road fees and
transfers from the entity governments for some funds.

Table in Annex 2 shows total revenues and expenditure for the general government sector in BiH,
consolidated and published by the Central Bank.

Fiscal Rules
As of recently, both Entity Governments introduced legal fiscal rules that satisfy the usual definition of
fiscal rules (being numerical, serving as a permanent constraint on fiscal policy, and relating to expenditure
or debt levels). In RS, the fiscal rule has been introduced in 2012, when the new Law on Borrowing, Debt
and Guarantees of RS was adopted, which prescribes that the total debt of RS, which covers the public debt
of RS, the debt of public enterprises, the debt of the RS Investment Development Bank, and the debt of
other public sector institutions, cannot exceed the level of 60% of GDP, while the public debt of RS (which
covers the debt of Republika Srpska, debt of units of local self-governance, and the debt of the EBFs for
social insurance) cannot exceed 55% of GDP.

The newly adopted Law on Budgets in FBiH (adopted in December 2013) stipulates a fiscal rule that the
planned current budget must be balanced and, if a current deficit is executed, the government must plan
for a current surplus in the next three years.

There are no fiscal rules for BiH Institutions or DB.

Debt Service. The Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of FBiH stipulates that future servicing of
FBiH public debt cannot exceed 18% of current revenues, while future servicing of cantonal and local
self-governance units’ public debt in FBiH cannot exceed 10% of current revenues. The new Law on
Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of RS, adopted in 2012, stipulates that the public debt of Republika
Srpska cannot exceed 55% of the GDP executed in that year, the total debt of Republika Srpska cannot
exceed 60% of the GDP executed in that year, that units of local self-governance may borrow in long-
term only if in the course of the period of the onset of debt the total amount that accrues for repayment, on
the basis of the proposed debt and the total of accrued, outstanding existing debt, in any of the subsequent
                                                        32


years, does not exceed 18% of the amount of its regular revenues executed in the preceding fiscal year,
etc.15

Fiscal Targets. The Global Frameworks of Fiscal Balance and Policies, adopted by the Fiscal Council
each year, are expected to set medium-term fiscal targets each year (such targets could in theory be
changed each year or set for the longer term). However, the Global Frameworks that have been adopted
so far include illustrative aggregate tables of expenditures, revenues, and financing without explanations;
text that sets the ceiling for the budget of BiH Institutions and establishes the State’s share of indirect
taxation revenues; and briefly mention a target to reduce the primary fiscal deficit and total public
consumption in BiH. The latest Global Framework adopted—that for 2014-2016—notes that the fiscal
goal for 2013 is a continuing reduction of the primary deficit, expressed as the difference between current
revenues and current expenditures corrected by net interest16, and that total public consumption should be
reduced to below 40% of GDP by 2015. It should be noted that the previous Global Framework for 2013-
2015 used exactly the same wording and format for fiscal targets. The Global Framework for 2011-2013
also noted the same fiscal target in terms of reduction of public consumption, while the primary deficit
level was targeted at 2% of GDP for 2011. However, the consolidated report covers a different scope of
data by individual levels of government, specifically17:

        Revenues and expenses of the budget of the Institutions of BiH,
        Revenues and expenses of the budget of FBiH, cantons, municipalities, funds, and cantonal
         directorates for roads in FBiH,
        Revenues and expenses of the budget of Republika Srpska, revenues and expenses of the users of
         the budget of the Republic that operate through their own bank accounts outside of the Main
         Treasury Ledger, of municipalities, cities, and funds in Republika Srpska, as well as external
         projects, funds on the “escrow” accounts and road toll, and
        Revenues and expenses of the budget of the District of Brčko and funds in the District of Brčko.


Debt Strategy. All the Global Framework that have been adopted quote annual limits for borrowing for
the budgets of; BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB, in compliance with legal limits.

Reporting
All levels use the modified accrual basis for accounting, under which revenues are recognized as they
become available and measurable, while expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred, except
in RS. At the level of RS, from January 1, 2013, IPSAS 23 – Revenues that do not originate from
exchange (taxes, contributions etc.) has been adopted and is being applied; as a result the 2013 financial
statements state revenues on an accruals basis. As the European Commission’s latest assessment of the
BiH 2013 Economic and Fiscal Program18 notes, there may be concerns that not all government levels
within the Entities (especially in FBiH) use comparable recording.

Among the four main government levels in BiH, the charts of account are generally detailed but are not
harmonized. Lower levels of the general government sector report their budget execution data to the

consolidated execution data on the general government sector in BiH are prepared and published by the
Central Bank of BiH. However, efforts are being undertaken to make Fiscal Balance Global Framework a
public document, available at web sites of the Ministries of Finance (BH MFT, RS MF, and FBH
MoF),This fiscal reporting to the Central Bank of BiH is based on the bridging tables between the
individual charts of account and GFS methodologies. It includes budget execution data consolidated for
all general government sector levels (excluding only foreign-financed projects, which do not go through
budgets, but which IMF estimates for its own use) by the Central Bank of BiH using GFS methodology
(only for Statement of Operations), as shown in Table in Annex 2.

Reporting to the Central Bank (which has the exclusive mandate to collect, compile, and disseminate
monetary, balance of payments, and GFS data) is based on a formal Memorandum of Understanding
between the Central Bank and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Agency for Statistics. In addition to this
consolidation of GFS data by the Central Bank, which is primarily statistical in nature, in terms of
consolidating GFS data fiscal information GFS data provided by the Central Bank, each month the MAU
of the ITA Governing Board consolidates administrative fiscal execution data (excluding financing),
including for the local self-governance level, in a basic format used by the IMF to monitor SBAs (not the
full GFS 2011 methodology used by the Central Bank). Not all government levels are included: public
entities for roads, foreign-financed projects, and off-budget spending from escrow accounts are excluded.
Thus, both the Central Bank and the MAU of the ITA Governing Board publish historical execution data;
budget plans and the medium-term outlook are approximated for aggregate categories for the purpose of
Global Frameworks and Economic and Fiscal Programs. The MAU with the ITA Governing Board does
not have a clear mandate determined on this issue. IMF has been supporting the strengthening of fiscal
reporting at all levels of government, which included technical assistance to help the authorities improve
their capacity to produce consolidated fiscal reports on a general government basis by providing detailed
bridging tables between the existing Charts of Accounts (which differ among different government levels)
and the GFS reporting. This resulted in significant progress in terms of fiscal reporting, however, all the
steps are not in place yet. The most important remaining step is to identify an institution that will be given
full responsibility for preparing the consolidated reports, hence the necessity of establishing a clear legal
framework.

Internal Audit and Control
Each State and Entity-level Finance Ministry has a Central Harmonization Unit (CHU), and their work is
coordinated through a Coordination Board of Central Harmonization Units, whose members are the
Directors of the three CHUs. The last meeting of the CHU Coordination Board was held in late 2011.

The CHU of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of BiH (BiH CHU) was established in 2010 and
charged with coordinating internal financial control and internal audit across all BiH Institutions which
are financed from the budget. The Unit is mostly staffed, and the necessary rules and procedures have
mostly been adopted by the BiH Institutions. The CHU’s objective is that effective financial management
and control arrangements, including internal audit, should be fully operational throughout the BiH
Institutions, with all the necessary staff in place, by the end of 2016. BiH CHU has published two annual
consolidated internal audit reports. The 2012 Consolidated Report on Internal Audit of BiH Institutions19
notes that significant progress was made in 2012: as of March 2013, internal audit is established in five
BiH Institutions (with a total of 10 internal auditors). BiH CHU coordinates the work of all internal
auditors and reports on the consolidated internal audit reports. In 2012, internal auditors at the level of
BiH Institutions performed 50 internal audits (with 195 recommendations, mostly in the area of planning
systems, public procurement, and travel expenses).

The Federation CHU (FBiH CHU) is charged with coordinating and strengthening financial management
and control throughout the FBiH government, and organizing the internal audit function. FBIH CHU has

published on its website one consolidated annual report, for 2011,20 noting some progress (through the
Coordination Board with the BiH Institutions and RS) in developing common rules for strengthening
financial management and control; however, the necessary decisions to implement these rules are still
pending, and the CHU is not sufficiently staffed. As of 2011, internal audit was established in nine
institutions at the FBiH government level, with total of 11 employees. Furthermore, in seven cantons,
some kind of internal audit role was established, although in some cases changes of organizational
characteristics are needed to align with the internal audit legislation. In 2011, a total of 6621 internal audits
at the FBiH government level were performed, as well as 9322 internal audits at the canton level (there is
no information about internal audits at the local self-governance level). The internal audits included
recommendations in the areas of allowances, travel expenses, expenses for education, contracted services,
public procurement, and vehicle expenses. However, in 2013, on the basis of an announced vacancy
tender, two employees were recruited (one economist and one lawyer), which made it possible to
intensify the operations of FMF CHU. As of the end of 2013, the state of affairs concerning the
establishment of internal audit units was as follows: out of 18 ministries that meet the criteria for the
establishment of internal audit units, 10 have internal audit established, and out of 30 systematized
positions, 15 internal auditors are working; out of 18 institutes that meet the criteria for the establishment
of internal audit units, 7 have internal audit established, and, according to data they have submitted to us,
12 positions are systematized, while 14 internal auditors are working; in 30 municipalities that meet the
criteria for the establishment of internal audit units, 9 of them have internal audit established, but out of
10 systematized positions, 6 internal auditors are working; out of 10 cantons that meet the criteria for the
establishment of internal audit units, 6 have internal audit established, and out of 30 systematized
positions, 15 internal auditors are working. Further on, in the year 2013, upon a proposal of the FMF
CHU, FMF adopted and published bylaws that created additional preconditions necessary for the
development of public sector internal audit in FBiH.

In RS internal audit has been established in 18 institutions of the public sector (5 RS government
ministries, 9 local self-governance units, 3 EBFs, and 2 health institutions/hospitals), with 27 internal
auditors in total. RS has made a start on the introduction of internal audit, and reports are being produced
in some ministries and local self-governance units. The principal legislation, regulations, and operating
instructions are all in place, and they provide for work to be done in accordance with international
professional standards. Training is being given to internal audit staff. RS CHU has published on its
website one consolidated annual report, for 2011.23

DB is not a part of the CHU Coordination Board and does not have an internal audit department.
Guidelines for internal audit legislation in DB are being developed. The legislation is expected to be
adopted by end-2013 and a CHU for DB established.

Under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA),24 the EU is supporting the training and other
steps needed to implement strengthened internal financial control and internal audit at the Entity and BiH
Institutions levels, so further progress is expected.

Supreme Audit in BiH
SAIs are independent of the legislature and the executive. Unlike most other countries, BiH has four
SAIs—one each for the BiH Institutions, the Entities, and DB. Since 2000 the four SAIs have gradually

improved their audit capacity and enhanced their audit coverage—though coverage is uneven across the
two Entities, since in FBiH not all units of the general government sector are regularly audited—
contributing to strengthening the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of financial management in
all of BiH.

Some of the SAIs’ audits have led to court proceedings against officials, and SAI reports receive
considerable public interest. The SAIs also cooperate with the internal audit function. All four SAIs have
formally adopted the standards of the International Organization of SAIs (INTOSAI). All four SAIs have
carried out several initial performance audits, but as with any new initiative, this is a work in progress as
the application of performance audits across governments has been uneven. More information on
performance audits is contained in Chapter 4, in specific reports on the four governments.

A Coordination Board of SAIs is attended by the Auditor Generals and the Deputy Auditor General from
the three SAIs in BiH, that are authorized for audit at the level of joint institutions of BiH, FBiH, and RS.
Namely, the auditor general and its deputies from the Audit Office in Brčko District of BiH do not have
the status of coordination board members. However, all four SAIs cooperate with the Coordination Board,
and the work of the Coordination Board continues to have a positive impact on the SAIs and on the
development and implementation of common approaches. Following the establishment of Committees for
Audit in all three parliaments (DB excluded—in DB audit reports go directly to the Parliament instead of
through Committees), which are specifically dedicated to the examination and follow-up of SAI audit
reports, there has been an improvement in the use of audit reports and in Parliament’s recognition of the
roles of SAIs.



The BiH Tax System
The administrative function for the collection of tax revenue is carried out by tax administration offices in
the entities and the ITA, which are also responsible for supervising the self-assessment system (self-
reporting of taxes) and agreeing on tax liabilities. There are four Revenue Authority (RA) bodies in BiH:

       The Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) is responsible for collecting VAT, excise duties, customs
        duties, and road fees. ITA has four regional branch offices (Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Mostar, Tuzla),
        and its central office is located in Banja Luka.

    The FBiH, RS, and DB Tax Authorities (FBiH RA, RS RA, and DB RA) are responsible for the
    collection of direct taxes and other non-tax revenue: corporate income tax, personal income tax, and
    property taxes (the RS RA also administers the collection of other non-tax revenues).The FBiH RA
    has a central office in Sarajevo, and a branch (cantonal) office in each of the 10 cantons. The RS RA
    has a central office in Banja Luka, and seven branch (regional) offices in the larger towns of RS
    (Prijedor, Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Zvornik, I.Sarajevo, Trebinje).
The RAs function as four separate bodies in all respects—taxpayer registration, revenue collection and
reconciliation, supervising and agreeing on tax liabilities, reporting, and so on. Table 2.2 shows the main
types of tax revenue.

             III. THE FOUR PEFA ASSESSMENTS: CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
A review of the PEFA ratings and the justifications for them across BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB
points to a number of issues that emerge as common themes across all four. This section outlines these
issues in broad terms and discusses the extent to which they are likely to affect the credibility and
performance of the overall PFM system in BiH.

While each of the four central government levels assessed has some particular weaknesses in its PFM
system, for all of the levels the process of preparing the budget and public investment programme is not
well integrated with the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and overall/sectoral strategic documents
(which are in many cases missing or not properly costed). Credible and comprehensive medium-term
macro-fiscal strategies are lacking at all levels.

The Fiscal Council was established in 2008, and responsibilities assigned to it by Law, provide for
coordination of the common fiscal policy issues. The Fiscal Council’s specific actions reflect political
willingness to coordinate polices among governments in BH. In terms of fiscal coordination’s most
important roles include: 1) development of Fiscal Balance and Policies Global Framework, 2) decision on
indirect taxes revenues and 3) decision on BiH Institution’s Budget, which are preconditions for budget
planning at lower levels of government. Timely decisions on BiH institution’s revenues are particularly
importat given that the key government functions (social policy, subsidies, education, etc.) are performed
at sub-national level.

Despite some recent progress in budget execution, the lack of fully adequate internal controls (especially
in public procurement) makes the PFM systems in BiH vulnerable to inefficiency and resources wasting.
In budget reporting, the fact that the charts of account of the four main government levels are not
harmonized complicates the overall consolidation of BiH fiscal data and hampers the policy decision-
making process at the country level. Within the Entities (primarily in FBiH), consolidation of data for all
general government levels—government, cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs—is also
complex, and data are generally not used to inform policy decisions. And in the context of budget
scrutiny, despite recent improvements, better follow-up on external audit findings and recommendations
would be desirable, and of performance audits performed by the four SAIs, as well as a more
comprehensive coverage and quality of internal audits performed by internal auditors.

    A. Budget Planning and Fiscal Coordination
In 2009-2011, budget execution was generally under the original budget plans, primarily because of lower
than planned revenues/receipts (primarily at the Entity level) and partially also because of some within-
year savings measures carried out under the SBA with the IMF (e.g., planned savings from a wage bill
reduction at the BiH Institutions in 2009). Delays in budget adoption (at the BiH Institutions level) and in
some political decisions necessary for part of budget spending also affected budget execution levels and
slowed public procurement procedures, especially for large capital projects at all levels. Furthermore, at
least some levels delayed their accrued payments from previous years to the following year (e.g., FBiH
government and RS Health Fund). In addition, there were generally significant reallocations within the
expenditure structure. Besides these technical issues related to budget planning in recent years, the main
weakness of budget planning at all levels in BiH is a lack of credible and comprehensive mid-to long-
term policy planning, which would be clearly costed in overall/sectoral strategic documents and
integrated in the budget planning process. Despite some recent technical improvements, the budget
planning system at all levels mostly reflects expenditure legal obligations within the available budget
envelope, rather than strategic targeting of the allocation of resources toward social and economic
development objectives. Furthermore, despite some steps toward program budgeting, BiH does not use
results-based budgeting in the budget planning process. Budget planning is largely based on (mostly
short-term) measures agreed annually with the IMF under the SBA. The share of current expenditure
                                                     38


remains high in all budgets, with an especially high wage bill and large general government sector
employment. Parliaments are not sufficiently involved in the budget planning processes, and they
generally lack capacity for thorough budget analysis.

In addition, while legal provisions at all levels demand that all proposed legislation/acts must be approved
by the finance ministries from the perspective of the financial resources needed for implementation, in
practice adopted legislation/acts/strategies are mostly not clear in terms of costing or are adopted although
the full financial needs have not been provided for. This at times results in litigation over legislation that
has been adopted but not implemented.

The process of budget planning is additionally burdened by increasing problems of liquidity and arrears in
the extra-budgetary social funds in both Entities, as well as by revenue shortfall and exceptionally high
(and growing) unemployment—the general effects of the economic downturn, from which the BiH
economy has not recovered yet.

Revenue on BiH depends heavily on indirect tax revenues, which make up almost half of the country’s
total general government revenues. The sharing of indirect taxation revenues among the four main
government levels (BiH Institutions, two Entities, and DB) has often caused budget delays when political
agreement could not be reached on the share of revenues for BiH Institutions. The data and information
captured in VAT return forms the basis for revenue sharing between the Entities. Political disputes over
the data on final consumption from VAT forms have often delayed regular decisions on revenue sharing
and revenue reconciliation.

Indirect Taxes. Reflecting the legislative set-up of indirect taxation and debt, Entity wide distribution of
indirect taxation is performed in such a manner that, after setting aside the funds in the reserve account,
from which the refund of indirect taxation is performed/primarily VAT refund, the funds are allocated for
the financing of BiH institutions, after which the amount of 3.55%, or BAM 124 million at the minimum
is allocated for the financing of Brčko District, and then the remainder is divided between the entities,
according to the share of each of the entities in final consumption. From the corresponding share of
indirect taxation revenues of each of entities the funds necessary to finance external debt are set aside
first, and transferred to special subaccounts with the Central Bank of BiH, and the remainder is
transferred to the entities. The funds remaining in each of the entities are allocated according to the same
principle between entity governments, units of local self-governance, public enterprises for roads, and in
FBIH also to the cantonal level local self-governance The debt of the entities, including for budget
support loans for Entity government budgets, has increased almost threefold since 2005/2006, but it
remains within the range of the relevant legislated constraints; thus, debt service significantly influences
the budgets of lower government levels (cantons and units of local self-governance), even though foreign
debt receipts are used almost exclusively by the Entity governments.

Coordination On June 12, 2013, within SBA, the four Tax Administrations in BH signed Memorandum
of Understanding on tax payer’s data exchange, aimed to enable continuous, smooth and automatic
exchange of records on tax payers. However, at the moment of this assessment there was no effective
information-sharing among the main tax authorities, and the databases of taxpayers, property, and
liabilities were not integrated and were incomplete in some cases. All this hampered tax collection,
especially for property taxation (which is essentially the only tax revenue under municipal jurisdiction in
both Entities). Furthermore, in FBiH a complex revenue sharing arrangements can result in overlapping
expenditure is some areas, while in others the costs may be underestimated.

Expenditures. On the expenditure side, in addition to the long-standing issue of the high share of current
expenditure (especially the wage bill) in the budgets of central governments, the management of Entity
social funds seems to be increasingly difficult. This is particularly the case for health funds, expenditures
have increased over the last three years while arrears have accumulated. For example, in FBiH, the
                                                     39


Solidarity Health Fund has been incurring an increasing amount of arrears as demands for specialist
medical services increase.

Overall, arrears are problematic not only because of their growing amounts but also because
comprehensive, good-quality data on arrears are not available yet (excluding BiH Institutions), and
Treasury systems are just starting to monitor payment due dates, as of end 2013). The Treasury systems
of both Entities do not include all social funds and, in FBiH, do not include all local self-governance
units. Generally, social fund management and fiscal sustainability constitutes a growing risk for the
overall solidity of the PFM system. The Entities differ on the interconnectedness of their single treasury
accounts (STAs): EBFs, cantons, and local self-governance units are not integrated into the FBiH
government STA and in fact not all local self-governance units in FBiH have treasury systems, making
arrears monitoring difficult. By contrast in RS, all local self-governance units (but not EBFs) have been
integrated into one STA since January 2013.

Medium-term budgeting. While each of the main government levels (BiH Institutions, Entities, and DB)
produces its own three-year outlook, in practice these documents are at times delayed (especially for BiH
Institutions and FBiH), do not clearly lay out policy priorities and distinguish between baseline and new
expenditure, and are not sufficiently based on strategic socioeconomic documents. In addition, the
MTEFs mostly serve as a pre-draft of the next annual budget, rather than as a true multiannual
framework, with estimates for the second and third years. Neither Entities (FBH, RS), nor BD use the
previous year’s estimate as a starting balance for the current year. Furthermore, even though all levels
also produce public investment programs, the costing and feasibility of the projects included in these
plans do not seem to be realistic, are not well integrated with the MTEFs, and do not pay enough attention
to the recurrent costs of investment maintenance. Finally, in FBiH the MTEFs do not provide a
comprehensive picture of expenditure in FBiH; in recent years, the FBiH has adopted medium-term
budgets without consolidating with cantons and local self-governance units.

The absence of fully integrated medium-term planning for capital investment projects within the medium-
term and annual budgeting, and the general lack of strategic vision and credible longer-term perspective
(beyond an annual perspective) within the budgeting process negatively affects not only the
comprehensiveness of the medium-term budgeting process, but also the medium-term growth and
development prospects of the country itself.

Fiscal Coordination. The Fiscal Council of BiH is charged with the annual adoption of Global
Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies that include the following parameters: (a) the proposed fiscal
targets of the budgets of the institutions of BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB, (b) the proposed macroeconomic
projections and the projection of the total indirect taxes and their allocation for the next fiscal year; and
(c) the proposed borrowing ceiling in the budgets of institutions of BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB. However, in
practice, the Global Frameworks that have been adopted so far include (a) overall macroeconomic
projections and projections of statewide indirect taxation revenues; (b) illustrative aggregate tables of
expenditures, revenues, and financing without explanations; and (c) set the ceiling for the budget of BiH
Institutions and the State’s share of indirect taxation revenues and mention a vague target to reduce the
primary fiscal deficit and total public consumption in BiH. None of these targets is supported by
explanation of measures or distribution among different government levels, none is monitored or
enforced, and none is placed within the macroeconomic framework outlined within the same document.
Furthermore, in terms of debt strategy, all the Global Framework adopted so far propose a ceiling for the
borrowing of the budget of institutions of: BiH, FBiH, RS and BD.

Within the Entities, lower government levels are not sufficiently included in the process of fiscal planning
in FBiH, and do not receive the information they need for timely budget planning. While in RS there is
fiscal coordination, the FBiH government’s coordination with the lower general government levels is
extremely weak. The coordination in FBiH is further hampered by unclear division of jurisdiction,
                                                    40


especially between the cantons and local self-governance units, and within Canton Sarajevo among the
cantons, municipalities, and City of Sarajevo administrations. For the state-owned enterprises, including
the utility companies, their financial management is neither consolidated nor sufficiently monitored and
integrated.

B. Budget Execution
In executing the budget, for which the majority of transactions involve salary and benefit payments and
payments to contractors for goods and services, all levels lack, in varying degrees harmonized internal
controls and internal audit procedures that would guarantee that funds are being used for the intended
purposes. The CHUs for the BiH Institutions and the Entities, which are responsible for harmonizing
internal procedures largely in line with Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) standards, have recently
made some progress in ensuring the passing of the laws needed to establish internal audit units, and some
internal audits have taken place. However, the coverage of these audits seems to emphasize compliance
rather than performance. Most of the findings so far focus on planning systems, public procurement, and
travel expenses.

At all four of the main central government levels, there seems to be no reason to doubt the accuracy of the
financial transactions performed, as transactions are processed automatically through the STA of each
level. What is not monitored regularly, however, is the substance and nature of these transactions. SAI
reports suggest some questions on the substance of some transactions and the methods followed in
processing them. At lower government levels (cantons in FBiH and local self-governance units in both
Entities), more substantial issues with the substance of recordings are likely, as different methodologies
for some transactions are used. All this hampers the ability to consolidate fiscal data.

Another common area of concern is the public procurement process. While the PEFA findings are not
able to distinguish the performance of each individual government in conducting public procurement in
line with the law and regulations, the general information received suggests certain common trends that
warrant attention, especially as they relate to the principles of competition and transparency in public
procurement. The public has access to bid opportunities and awards, but not to procurement plans and
decisions on complaints. Entities seem to use less open competition methods at times. Even though
contracting authorities notify the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) of their justification for less than
open competition, the PPA not obliged to review these justifications for validity unless the procurements
are over the threshold or there is a complaint. The high incidence of complaints that come to the
independent Procurement Review Board (PRB), and the fact that a large number of these complaints are
resolved in favor of the complainant, seems to suggest that it is largely the contracting authorities’
conduct of public procurement procedures that is problematic, and that improper justifications for less
than open competition are used in many cases. There is a backlog of complaints, because the PRB is
understaffed, and therefore most decisions on complaints are issued after the contract is already awarded;
thus the compensations that the governments must provide to complainants for whom the PRB rules in
favor end up imposing a significant cost on the Treasury that could be avoided.

C. Budget Reporting and Scrutiny
The Chart of Accounts (CoA) is not harmonized across the main four government levels. Within the
Entities, the consolidation of central with lower government levels is complicated by at times inconsistent
recording of transactions at lower levels (primarily in FBiH, where not all local self-governance units
even have established Treasury systems). Only countrywide budget execution at a aggregate level is
consolidated by the Central Bank of BiH using GFS, while consolidated budget plans and medium-term
frameworks are approximated for illustrative purposes for the Global Framework adopted by the Fiscal
Council and for the Economic and Fiscal Programs submitted to the European Commission. In addition,
each month the MAU of the ITA Governing Board consolidates administrative fiscal execution data
(excluding financing), including for the local self-governance level, in a basic format used by the IMF to
                                                                        41


monitor SBAs (not the full GFS 2011 methodology used by the Central Bank 26). At the Entity level,
budget reporting to parliaments does not include lower government levels. All this implies that any effort
governments have made to consolidate countrywide or Entity wide fiscal information falls short of getting
to a point that informs policymaking and analysis in a meaningful way.

Budgets are mainly presented only in administrative and economic classifications. Although reporting
rulebooks at most levels prescribe functional classifications (which are used in MTEFs at all levels and in
annual budget execution reports at some levels, and are mostly not a part of the Treasury system), in
practice functional data are only approximate and are not fully reliable (especially at the local self-
governance level). Program classification (based on program/program budgeting) was roughly introduced
several years ago, but at all levels it still remains underused for budget allocation decisions and spending
accountability; and the quality of programs, and especially of performance measures, is mostly poor
(especially in FBiH). Budget documentation (except in DB) mostly does not provide enough information
on previous years’ data and on financial assets.

Furthermore, only MFT develops supplemental programmatic budget report, based on information
provided by beneficiaries. It includes statements on program objectives and performance indicators. The
proposed budget in programmatic classification is submitted to BiH Parliament as an annex to the budget
documentation, however the adopted budget is based on economic and institutional classification.
Furthermore, budget execution reports are also based on economic and institutional classification.

And in the context of budget scrutiny, despite recent improvements, follow-up on external audit findings
and recommendations could be better. Furthermore, the coverage and quality of internal audits performed
by internal auditors and of performance audits performed by the four SAIs are not comprehensive.

Because BiH’s PFM system as it stands does not seem to lend itself to an easy way of producing reports
and analyses that would enable the identification of trends and policy priorities, it is perhaps not
surprising that no particular emphasis seems to be placed on providing individual parliaments with
enough time and resources for debating and deliberating on the particular government’s budget proposal.
The PEFA findings indicate that the parliaments’ budgetary committees note lack of both time and
technical capacity/expertise to understand and analyze budget content as the main reasons for lack of
sufficient scrutiny of budget proposals. The review of the budget at the end of the year seems somewhat
more structured: the assemblies seem to review SAI reports carefully, and hearings are mostly held with
those budget users whose audit reports indicate most issues. However, at all levels, the follow-up on these
hearings is low: it is not uncommon for the same budget user to be called out on the same issues year after
year. The parliaments usually do not impose sanctions, although in a few instances users with repeated
problems in audit reports were sanctioned by a small reduction in their budget for the next year (in BiH
Institutions and FBiH). However, overall, the environment is such that users of public funds are largely
not held accountable, so the PFM system is vulnerable to ad hoc initiatives and course corrections that are
largely at the discretion of the governing authorities.

     The role of the Central Bank is primarily statistical in nature.

        IV. ASSESSMENT OF PFM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, AND INSTITUTIONS

                                         BIH INSTITUTIONS
                                   Executive Summary – BiH
For the purposes of applying the PEFA performance indicators, data and information from FY 2009 –
2011 were used in the calculations and for scoring the indicators, with more current information used for
some indicators where such information was available.
I. Integrated Assessment of PFM Performance

A. PFM Out-Turns: Credibility of the budget

The performance of the last three fiscal years (2009 -2011) shows a general aggregate underspend due
principally to the complex political context which resulted in frequent delays in budget adoption and
prolonged use of temporary financing. In 2011 no budget for BH Institutions was passed at all and was
formally adopted in 2012, based on actual budget execution. Despite the underspend the composition of
the budget was broadly in line original approved budget; under the PEFA methodology 2011 is treated as
an outlier and had no impact on the overall score for PI-2.

BiH Institutions is largely financed through a block allocation of indirect taxes collected by the ITA (81
percent of total revenues in 2011). As the amount of indirect taxes is defined by democratic agreement
the execution is always the same as the plan, defined by annual BiH Institutions Budget Law. Given that
the 2011 budget was approved only after the event, in effect there was no budget forecast and that year is
treated as an outlier under the PEFA methodology.

The budget is prepared cautiously on the basis of obligations, and there is no evidence of expenditure
arrears.

B. Key Cross-Cutting Issues: Comprehensiveness and Transparency

Budget formulation and execution are based only on administrative and economic classification, which is
not in line with IPSAS or COFOG in official budget plans and execution report —the MFT only sends
budget execution reports to the Central Bank in GFS format, based on existing bridging tables between
the official chart of accounts and the GFS, which was prepared with the assistance of the Central Bank
and IMF. The CoA is not harmonized with the chart of accounts of the other governments. The
information included in the budget documentation is fairly comprehensive. As result the budget
documentation includes: (i) macroeconomic assumptions, including at least aggregate growth, inflation, and
the exchange rate, (ii) fiscal deficit (according to IMF GFS 2001), (iii) deficit financing (composition of
domestic and external financing), (iv) debt stock for the current year and (v) the current year’s budget.
However the BiH Institutions budget documentation do not contain information on the financial assets
(although such information is available in internet in the form of various execution reports, as well as
audited annual reports) and no information on the prior year’s budget out-turn is presented in the same
format as budget proposal.

All key fiscal information, including budget documentation, execution and audit reports as well as
contract awards are made available to the public in a timely manner.
                                                             43




C(i). Policy-Based Budgeting

Despite a well-defined budget calendar approval of the budget is not always done on a timely basis.
Technical work carried out by the executive are carried out on a timely basis however political problems
can arise early in the budget cycle, for example determining the policy framework; as well as later when
detailed proposals are submitted to ministers. The approval of the 2011 and 2012 budget was subject to
significant delays.

Multiyear fiscal forecasts are produced as part of the process leading to the preparation of the MTEF,
including forward estimates of expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming
budget year and the two following fiscal years). Once approved by the Council of Ministers, the budget
year estimates establish the budget users’ budget ceilings for the forthcoming budget year. These forward
estimates are used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings. 27 No comprehensive
debt sustainability analysis has been undertaken by the Government.

Sector strategies with full costing are not formally developed either for BiH as a whole or for the BiH
Institutions. A Draft Development Strategy for BiH (with separate action plans for BiH Institutions,
FBiH, RS, and DB) was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the BiH Council of
Ministers and adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the Council of
Ministers or RS government. The Fiscal Council seems to have little political appetite to endorse or even
discuss such countrywide strategic documents.

All four levels of government prepare a rolling three-year Public Investment Programme (PIP). In
addition, the BiH MFT Sector for Coordination of International Economic Assistance prepares a
consolidated country PIP but also a PIP for BiH Institutions. All PIP proposals and funded investment
projects are captured by the Public Investment Management Information System – PIMIS. That system is
maintained by the Sector for Coordination of International Economic Assistance. PIMIS is an
information management system for the management of public developmental investments that facilitates
all entity and state budget users on line access to planning and monitoring of all projects/programmes that
are defined in the Strategic framework and the mid-term and annual plans and contribute to the realization
of development objectives. PIP database is designed to match public investment proposals with the
Development Strategy for BiH once the strategy is endorsed. The Sector for Coordination of International
Economic Assistance also maintains a donor-mapping database covering donor-funded projects in BiH.

C(ii). Predictability and Control in Budget Execution

The legislative framework for major taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, and there are clear laws
governing administrative procedures. Taxpayers have web access to information regarding tax
obligations, explanatory notices, and administrative procedures and electronic access to their tax records.
The tax appeals system is set up and functional, however decisions are often not issued within the
prescribed timeframe.

VAT taxpayers are registered in a complete database but the database is not linked to other relevant
government databases. There are penalties for noncompliance with registration and declaration
obligations, but they may not always be an effective deterrent. There are annual tax audit plans as well as
a continuous program of tax audits and fraud investigations.


27
   This particularly is evident from the MTEF that provides comparable amounts for the 3 year forward estimates which compare
fairly similar to the previous year budget and execution, information which is also available in the MTEF.
                                                    44

The VAT debt collection ratio was 64% in 2011 and 65% in 2012 and tax in arrears represented 7% and
9% for 2011 and 2012, respectively. All tax revenue is collected in bank accounts controlled by ITA and
is transferred daily to Treasury. Complete accounts reconciliation of tax assessments, collections, arrears,
and transfers to Treasury takes place at least quarterly. The BiH Supreme Auditor has noted that account
reconciliation reports are not always timely and accurate; nor do they provide a complete record of tax
arrears.

Cash flow forecasts are prepared for the year and updated on a monthly basis. Because of the highly
predictable amount of the revenue stream and the practice of prudent budgeting, BiH Institutions have
been able to enter into commitments up to the amount provided in the budget for each spending unit at
any time during the year. No in-year adjustments were imposed on budget users in 2009-2012.

There is complete reporting of the small amounts of BiH Institutions debt. The amount of guarantees is
small and are always approved by the BiH Council of Ministers and BiH Parliament.

The MFT Treasury operates the payroll for all employees of the BiH Institutions except the armed forces.
The Civil Service Agency (CSA) controls all appointments to and promotions in civil service positions
however, there is a complete personnel database, and personnel records and payroll data are regularly
reconciled. While the arrangements provide an audit trail there is less assurance of the accuracy of records
relating to salary supplements. Since appointments can only take effect once all the necessary
notifications have been given, changes to personnel records and the payroll are made without delay, and
retroactive adjustments are rare. Internal and external audits of payroll are undertaken on a regular basis.

Public procurement was assessed at the level of the BiH country since the legislation and institutions
involved in the public procurement are common for all 4 governments. The legal framework for
procurement is clear and readily accessible to the public. Open competition is the default method. The
publication of tender notices and contract awards is transparent, with information publicly available via
the PPA’s website. However, there is no public access to procurement plans or to results of recent
complaints.

Since there is widespread criticism by auditors, and frequent complaints by tenderers are upheld by the
Public Procurement Review Board (PRB), it is clear that the exceptions to open procedures are not
properly justified in many cases. Information is limited to bidding opportunities in the form of
procurement plans (though these plans are not usually published) and contract awards. No information is
available on results of complaints in spite of legal requirements. Although the PRB has managed to issue
many decisions, it lacks sufficient human resources to fulfil all its functions quickly and efficiently.

The expenditure commitment controls over non-salary expenditure are effective and the payments system
works in an orderly manner; however audit reports confirm the need to ensure the operation of stronger
rules and procedures, and to train staff in their operation.

The legal framework for internal audit is in place at the BiH Institutions level, and the criteria for the
establishment of internal audit units have been published. However at present, only 12 auditors are
currently in place in the Ministries of Finance and Treasury (MFT), Defense, and Justice. As a result there
is currently limited coverage of internal audit within the BiH Institutions, the main focus of the reports
remains compliance audit rather than the performance of systems or the achievement of intended results.
Reports issued regularly and are distributed to the audited entity, MFT and (upon request) the SAI. Many
managers do not yet respond to recommendations made in internal audit reports.
                                                    45

C(iii). Accounting, Recording and Reporting

Daily reconciliations of the STA and advances are cleared within 7 days of the end of the period for
which they are given.

In-year reports are complete and comprehensive covering revenues and expenditures, information on debt
servicing and stock of debt, and a balance sheet. Data in the report are prepared in the same format as the
annual budget - by economic and administrative classifications. Reports are prepared on a modified
accruals basis covering both commitments and cash expenditure. While these reports are not published
they are used internally.

The Annual Report on the Budget Execution of BiH Institutions and International Obligations contains
full information on BiH Institutions revenue and expenditure, and assets and liabilities, together with
detailed information on external debt financing. The Report is published on the MFT website. Ministry
of Finance and Treasury has to prepare and submit the annual budget execution report to the Parliament
after it has been submitted to the Council of Ministers and BiH Presidency, within 180 days from the end
of the fiscal year. The statements are submitted for audit as soon as they are completed, and the BiH
Institutions SAI completes the audit within 90 days. The annual statements are prepared in accordance
with rules which are available on the BiH MFT website. These are consistently applied, however there are
gaps between the national rules and IPSAS.

C(iv). External Scrutiny and Audit

There is good coverage of financial audit (FY 2011: 97.3% of BiH Institutions expenditure was audited)
that meets professional standards, and according to the Law the BiH Institutions Audit, SAI is obliged to
audit all BiH Institutions but there is scope for further development of performance audit and for the
application of information technology (IT) audit techniques. Audit reports are submitted to legislature
within 3 months of the receipt of budget execution statements from BiH MFT. There is some evidence of
the follow up on audit reports; more budget users received an unqualified audit opinion for 2011 than for
2007.

The Assembly has not adopted specific procedures for review and approval of the BiH Institutions budget
proposals. The amount of time available for consideration of the budget is, in practice, much less than that
prescribed by the law. Neither the BiH Global Framework nor the MTEF is submitted to the
Parliamentary Assembly for approval, which is in line with current laws. The Global Framework data
provides the basis for Medium-Term Expenditures Framework and is an integral part of budget
documentation, based on which annual Budget Law is adopted. There are clear rules for in-year budget
amendments within overall totals, which allow extensive administrative reallocations.

The Assembly usually completes its work on audit reports within three to six months after receiving them.
Delays occurred only in the review of the audit report for 2009 because of the 2010 general elections and
subsequent political stalemate. Hearings regularly take place with responsible officers from audited
entities. The Assembly makes conclusions and seeks to apply sanctions against spending units that ignore
issued recommendations. These sanctions have been only partially effective, since the executive can
ignore recommendations by the SAI and the Assembly has not sought to enforce its recommendations.

II. Assessment of the impact of PFM weaknesses
This section of the Report analyses the extent to which the performance of the assessed PFM system
appears to support the three high level objectives. These are:

       Effective controls of the budget totals and management of fiscal risks contribute to maintain
        aggregate fiscal discipline.

       Planning and executing the budget in line with government priorities contributes to
        implementation of government’s objective (strategic allocation of resources).

       Managing the use of budgeted resources contributes to efficient service delivery and value for
        money.

1. Aggregate Fiscal Discipline

While technical aspects of the budget preparation process are reasonably well organized this is
undermined by the complex context which results in frequent delays in budget adoption and prolonged
use of temporary financing. Political problems can arise early in the budget cycle and these result in
delays in preparing the policy framework and when detailed proposals are submitted to ministers. All
these factors may explain the persistent under-performance of the BiH budget. Nevertheless a strong
treasury function effectively constrained expenditures are minimal, and there are no expenditure arrears.

2. Strategic Allocation of Resources

The existing budget process does not have a strong policy or strategic focus. A medium term fiscal
framework exists but is not harmonized with BH strategy; and forward estimates are used to anchor the
following year’s budget ceilings. Sector strategies with full costing are not formally developed either for
BiH as a whole or for the BiH Institutions. There is little political appetite to endorse or even discuss
countrywide strategic documents. Improvements in linking sector development strategies to the PIP and
in preparing realistic estimates of financial resources (both capital and recurrent costs) would better
ensure that limited resources are targeted to strategic priorities.

3. Efficient Service Delivery

Weaknesses in the budget process do not allow sufficient discussion on the effective use of resources. The
expenditure commitment controls over non-salary expenditure are effective and the payments system
works in an orderly manner; however audit reports confirm the need to ensure the operation of stronger
rules and procedures, and to train staff in their operation. Internal audit as a function is in its infancy and
audit coverage needs to improve as does the response of management to audit recommendations. Non
observance of competitive tendering processes may create the opportunity for inefficient procurement,
corruption and leakages. While work on performance audits has begun more work focused on the
efficient, effective use of resource would hold the government to account. The legislature could improve
the extent to which it holds the executive to account for audit report recommendations.

III. Prospects for PFM Reforms
All four main levels of government (BiH Institutions, two Entities, and DB) are at the time of this
assessment in the final phases of introducing a Budget Management Information System that should
simplify the budget planning process (including the performance-budgeting/program format) and provide
data sharing between the budget planning and treasury.
                                                     48

Other planned improvements include (a) signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the four tax
administrations on the exchange of taxpayer information (with a view to facilitating the permanent,
unfettered, and automated sharing of taxpayer records); (b) the planned submission of a new law on
public procurement to the BiH Parliament to strengthen governance, enhance transparency, and bring
procurement practices in BiH in line with those in the EU); (c) continued expansion of treasury systems in
both Entities to cover all cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs, and (d) establishment of a
common definition of spending arrears by the BiH Institutions and Entity governments and a requirement
that all due dates of invoices are entered into the treasury system to facilitate the production of arrears
data according to the legal definition.

The BiH Ministry of Finance and Treasury has, in cooperation with the Republika Srpska Ministry of
Finance and the Federal Ministry of Finance, developed and commissioned the new system for public
investment management, PIMIS, and the new form for identification, registration, and monitoring of
projects/programmes. PIMIS is accessible at www.mft.gov.ba. The form for identification, registration,
and monitoring of projects/programmes was designed to meet the highest standards for
public/developmental investment planning. The form facilitates the collection of data of significance for
the process of strategic development planning, as well as for the processes of European integrations.
PIMIS facilitates standardized presentation of projects and includes developed systems for project
prioritization, the monitoring of financial implementation and reporting in several standard and special
user formats. By linking of the PIMIS with the electronic system for budget planning and monitoring, the
BIMIS, the integration of the system of financial monitoring of projects on all the levels of planning shall
be achieved.

On its 94th session, held on May 9, 2014, the BiH Council of Ministers adopted the Information on the
Public Investments Information Management System (PIMIS) and adopted the following conclusions in
connection with that: (i)all budgets users of the Institutions of BiH shall be under obligation to perform
the planning and delegating of projects on line through the electronic form for identification, registration,
and monitoring of projects / programme in the PIMIS system; (ii) at the same time, all budgets users, i.e.
institutions of BiH, shall be under obligation to enter all their projects into the PIMIS system through the
forms, regardless of their type, status, source, and method of financing, and to update them regularly.

             Assessment of PFM Systems, processes and institutions – BiH
PI-1: Aggregate Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the difference between the actual and the originally budgeted primary expenditure
for the BiH Institutions for the last three fiscal years (2009-2011). It is intended to measure the
government’s ability to adhere to its planned total expenditure. Interest payments and expenditure
financed from external sources are excluded because they are largely outside the government’s immediate
control. Direct debt of the BiH Institutions is small (around BAM 29 million) for a few direct loans of
State institutions, such as the Air Navigation Services Agency. It should be noted that, while all of the
country’s foreign debt servicing goes through the budget of BiH Institutions, the ultimate guarantor of the
debt, this report analyzes the debt of the Federation of BIH (FBiH), Republika Srpska (RS), and District
Brčko (DB) in the analyses of those government levels. The BiH Institutions are largely financed through
a block allocation from indirect tax revenues collected by the countrywide Indirect Tax Authority (ITA);
in the BiH Institutions’2011 budget execution, 81% of revenues came from indirect taxation. The BiH
Institutions generally underspend their budget for several reasons—frequent delays in budget adoption,
resulting in temporary financing; delays in the political decisions that are necessary for spending; cautious
budget planning; tight discipline in terms of approving payments—and also because the modified accrual
accounting basis used for the budget execution report shows unspent earmarked revenues (which are high
for BiH Institutions—for example, donor funds, funds from regulatory agencies, and those for the
Refugee Return Fund), which are carried over to the following years to be spent for those earmarked
purposes.

The figures for 2009 and 2010 (Table 4.1.1) are derived from the approved budgets and actual out-turns.
Because of the prolonged political stalemate after the 2010 elections, no budget was adopted for 2011,
and the actual expenditure out-turn was executed on temporary financing based on the 2010 budget
execution. Thus, during 2011 the BiH Institutions continued to spend on established activities at the 2010
rate, in accordance with the temporary financing provisions of the budget law, but no new activities could
be initiated. The implementation of the 2011 fiscal plans was very complicated because of the prolonged
process of passing the budget. BiH Institutions budget was not passed at all in 2011 and was formally
adopted only in February 2012 based on actual budget execution. As result, the 2011 figures are
considered as an outlier in relation to the PEFA criteria. Since the deviation between budget and out-turn
exceeded 10% in one year and FY 2011 is
considered an outlier, the rating is C. It              Table 4.1.1. Percentage Difference between

PI-2: Composition of Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the extent to which the composition of the budget changes from that originally
planned by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) and agreed by Parliament. The PEFA Secretariat
has set out a formula for calculating the variance between the out-turn and the approved budget. The
original provision on each main budget head is adjusted by the overall percentage difference between
budget and out-turn as measured by PI-1, and the differences between these adjusted figures and the
actual out-turns on each line are then summed. This measure of total variance is then represented as a
percentage of the total expenditure out-turn.

The second dimension of the PI looks at the amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve;
the larger the amount charged to the reserve rather than reallocated to specific budget lines, the less
transparent the budget, and the lower the rating. The tables containing calculations for the BiH
Institutions are set out in Annex 3 of this report.

     (i) Additional variance of expenditure composition after allowing for overall variance as measured
     by PI-1
The formula measures the additional variance over and above the overall variance calculated in PI-1 as a
result of resources being reallocated between spending units during budget execution. There can be a
good score on this indicator even if there is a substantial overall difference between the budget estimates
and out-turn as measured under PI-1, provided that the proportionate changes are similar on each budget
head.

The BiH MFT submits the budget and execution tables by                Table 4.1.3. Percentage Variance in Out-
organizational code. In accordance with the PEFA criteria,             turn Composition compared to budget

PI-3: Aggregate Revenue Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator compares actual total domestic revenue to the originally budgeted domestic revenue
estimates. It is not possible to assess this indicator for the BiH Institutions without a clear understanding
of tax policy and administration for the country as a whole (the overall tax system and revenue sharing are
explained in more detail in Chapter 2).

BiH largely depends on indirect tax revenues to fund its operations. In 2011 indirect tax proceeds accounted
for some 45% of all revenues collected by the general government sector in BiH. Other major sources of
revenue are social contributions—pension, health, and unemployment insurance contributions—which
accounted for about 35.5% of all revenues collected by the government in 2011, and personal and corporate
income tax. In addition, each level of government collects various administrative fees and charges.

 Note: Administrative data were collected from the Ministries of Finance of all levels of government, social security funds of
 all levels of government, and Entities’ funds for reconstruction and maintenance of roads. Consolidated FBiH includes FBiH
 government, cantons, local governments (municipalities and cities), social security funds, PE Highways and PE for road
 reconstruction and maintenance, Tuzla, and Central-Bosnia Canton. Consolidated RS includes RS government, local

The system of collection and allocation of indirect taxes has been in force since 2005 when the ITA was
established and relevant mandates for collection of indirect taxes were transferred from the two Entities
and DB to the ITA.

Indirect taxes (taxes on goods and services) consist of VAT proceeds, customs, excise taxes, and road
fees. All such indirect taxes are collected by the ITA and are divided among the BiH Institutions, the two
Entities, and DB according to a set of rules prescribed by the Law on the System of Indirect Taxation.
Article 21 of that law prescribes that the collected revenues are first allocated to the BiH Institutions (as
per adopted budget for the relevant fiscal year) to fund its expenses.28DB receives a fixed 3.55% of the
balance, or BAM 124 million, at the minimum, with the remainder then divided between the two Entities
according to coefficients that are determined on the basis of the data on the final consumption (as per
VAT filings by each taxpayer). External debt service is a first charge on the amounts of revenue from the
ITA Single Account accruing to the Entity governments.

28
  Further details are covered by the Law on Payments into the Single Account and Allocation of Revenues (Articles 11 and 12).

The coefficients for FBiH and RS, which are variable and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in
the final consumption, are formally adopted by the ITA Governing Board;29as of August 2013 they are
63.93% for FBiH and 32.52% for RS.30BiH Institutions received a fixed amount of BAM 75031 million
from indirect taxation revenues in 2013.

In FBiH indirect tax revenue is then shared with the cantons, local self-governance units, and public
entities for roads: 36.2% belongs to the FBiH government; 51.48% to cantons based on population, area,
number of students, and development level; 8.42% to local self-governance units, also based on
population, area, number of students, and development level; and 3.9% to public entities for roads.
Indirect tax revenue is similarly shared in RS:72% belongs to the RS budget; 24% to local self-
governance units based on population, area, and number of students; and 4% to Public Company JP
Putevi RS.

The Entities and DB have their own mandate over direct taxes (the overall tax system and revenue sharing
are explained in more detail in Chapter 2).

The Macroeconomic Analysis Unit (MAU) of the ITA Governing Board is responsible for forecasting
indirect tax revenues, taking into account the macroeconomic projections prepared by the Department for
Economic Planning under the Council of Ministers. The forecasts are taken into consideration by the BiH
Fiscal Council (see Chapter 2 for more details). Forecasting of revenue from direct taxes and other
sources is the responsibility of the different Ministries of Finance.

Though consolidated revenue data from budget execution—collected and published by the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBiH)—are available for the entire country as well as for individual levels of
government, they are available only for out-turns and not for budget plans, so it was not possible to use them
in performing indicator calculations for each government (CBBiH does not consolidate budget plans, as
Chapter 2 explained). Hence, calculations are based on the data received directly from the MFT. ITA
publishes projections of indirect tax revenues for the country as a whole, which the Entity and DB
governments can use when planning their budgets; however, they are not legally obliged to base their budget
estimate of indirect tax revenues on their allotted share of ITA revenues as forecast by the ITA MAU (table
4.1.6). Only BiH Institutions are obliged, under the Law on Financing of BiH Institutions, to set the fixed
amount from indirect taxation revenues that will belong to BiH Institutions within the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF). However, the legal basis for the State’s share in indirect taxation revenue
is ultimately set only in the actual annual budget of BiH Institutions adopted by the BiH Parliament.

revenue planned in the budget of BiH Institutions is divided into daily payments, and transfer is made to the

PI-4: Stock and Monitoring of Expenditure Payment Arrears
This indicator examines whether there are significant expenditure arrears, and whether there is a system
that enables expenditure arrears to be effectively monitored. At the level of BiH Institutions, any
obligation that needs to be paid and that has not been settled fully on the date of accrual is treated as an
arrear.32However In February 2014 the Fiscal Council of BiH adopted a definition of an arrear based on
any amount that is not paid within a maximum of 90 days (or as specified in the law). As of end 2013, the
payment due data have started to be recorded in the Treasuries at the BiH Institutions and Entity
Government level (however, the complete 2013 reports on arrears have not been ready in time to be
included in this Report) Each government levels will adjust their legislation (e.g. FBiH has prepared Draft
Law on Financial Operations which prescribes that contracted payment deadline can be up to 60 days).

     (i) Stock of expenditure payment arrears
BiH Institutions receive from the single account of the ITA a defined transfer amount that was adopted by
the BiH Parliament in the annual budget. Indirect taxation revenues comprise around 75-80% of the
revenues of BiH Institutions (with the remaining revenues mostly being fees for services of BiH
Institutions and other non-tax revenues), and since this is a pre-determined fixed amount, it does not
fluctuate during the year. In practice, BiH Institutions plan the budget cautiously on the basis of all
obligations, and it exercises tight discipline in terms of payments. Thus, no question of expenditure
arrears has arisen at the BiH Institutions level; during 2011, when no budget was agreed and actual
execution was based on temporary financing throughout the year, no arrears were accumulated since only
established expenditure programs could be continued at the 2010 level.

Dimension rating: A

     (ii) Availability of data for monitoring the stock of expenditure payment arrears
The Budget of BiH Institutions is very specific and mostly includes staff expenses (2011 budget: staff
expenses amounted 79.92% of the total expenses for that year). While there is no ageing list of liabilities
being prepared regularly, the BiH Institutions have a system for monitoring all liabilities entered in the
treasury which are due to be paid on a regular basis. Also given that there are strict procedures for
monitoring the payments of liabilities and the fact that there are no arrears on the level of BiH institutions
it can be concluded that the system for monitoring stock of payment arrears is adequate. The system had
been further enhanced for some budget users belonging to BiH Institutions which began to enter invoice
due dates by the end of 2013. The next table shows total current liabilities and cash available at the end
of each reporting period under review of this report clearly showing that there was more than sufficient
funds available for settling all due liabilities :

PI-5: Classification of the Budget
The PEFA criteria look for arrangements that make it possible to compare budget and out-turn for the
same year, and also provide for consistent comparisons from one year to the next, according to
administrative, functional, and economic classifications. Ideally the 10 main functions listed in the United
Nations Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) 33 should be broken down into sub
functions (e.g., different levels of education) or programs. This objective is facilitated by recording all
transactions in accordance with a chart of accounts (CoA) that captures sufficient information about each
transaction to enable reports according to each of the classifications.

Although there has been some progress, Public Finance Statistics still remain fragmented and incoherent
across the different jurisdictions in BiH—a situation that most observers regard as a significant
impediment to proper governance. The EU has paid special attention to the issue; it has been providing
technical assistance in this area since June 2012,34 but progress has not yet been evaluated. IMF has been
also working intensively with the BiH authorities in this area since 2010.

The budget is presented by the economic classification of the expenditure of each administrative unit. The
BiH Institutions operates a Treasury system through which all transactions pass (or at least are recorded;
for externally funded projects, actual payments are made from separate accounts); this provides for
consistent reporting by administrative and economic classifications. The Treasury systems have been
much improved since 2000; however, the four governments’ CoAs are not harmonised, and functional
consolidation is not possible.

For the BiH Institutions, sufficient information is collected about each transaction to enable the BiH MFT to
produce a functional breakdown of actual expenditure, but the budget and out-turn are not presented in a
functional classification. The Reporting Rulebook for BiH Institutions does not prescribe reporting by
functional classification (or program classification), and there is no clear and detailed methodology for
dividing expenditures into function. Only approximation—that is, the total spending of each budget user is
mostly assigned to one function that best describes its responsibilities—of main functional categories is
done for the purposes of preparing BiH Institutions’ MTEFs.

                                        and execution report—the MFT only sends budget execution reports to the

PI-7: Extent of Unreported Government Operations
Annual budget estimates, in-year execution reports, and year-end financial statements should cover all
budgetary and extra-budgetary operations of the government. This indicator evaluates the extent to which
operations under government control, including those of so-called extra-budgetary funds (EBFs), are not
reported at both budget estimate and out-turn stages. It also looks at the extent to which donor-funded
projects are included in fiscal reports.

     (i) The level of extra-budgetary expenditure that is not included in fiscal reports
The BiH Institutions do not currently operate any EBFs. The various regulatory agencies that are being
established to meet the requirements of eventual EU membership have so far been treated as part of the
BiH Institutions budget. A different situation might arise if such agencies were to be financed outside the

    (ii) Inclusion in fiscal reports of income/expenditure information about externally funded projects
Although the BiH MFT monitors information about externally financed projects (from project
information units), only the government cofinancing element of project expenditure and already
committed donor grants—that is, grants that are known at the budget planning stage is included in the
actual budget plan (adopted budget). Total actual expenditure is reported at the out-turn stage for those
externally funded projects that are recorded in the budget. The BiH Institutions MFT is working to
establish a database that will make it possible to integrate aid flows into the budget and the Public
Investment Programme (PIP).Thus, at present, information about donor-funded projects is included only
to the extent it is available at the time budget proposals are prepared, while the data on actual flows is
reported at the out-turn stage for all donor inflows which go through budget is much higher. For example,
in the 2012 budget, only BAM 7 million were planned, while preliminary budget execution figures show
the execution of about BAM20 million (mostly from grants that were not planned/committed to in the
budget planning procedures)—more than the ceiling of 2% of expenditure for a rating of A. Furthermore,
total externally financed projects are much larger than those shown in budget execution, since not all of
them are recorded through the budget. Given that the externally funded projects are mostly being reported
at the out-turn stage, while there are large donor funds which do not go through budgets at all, the
decision was to assign a C rating.

PI-8: Transparency of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
This indicator evaluates the transparency of and accountability for the resources that were transferred
between different levels of government. It also assesses the timeliness and reliability of the information
passed to subnational governments on their allocations.

Given the specificities of the BiH fiscal sector and the approach taken by this PEFA assessment, under
this indicator the report considers the intergovernmental relations for the four main government levels
separately. However, in addition to the fiscal relations that are specific to each of the four main levels,
there is one common aspect of fiscal relations among these four levels—indirect taxation. Since indirect
taxation is under the jurisdiction of the ITA, this section discusses it as well as aspects that are relevant
only to BiH Institutions.

Indirect taxation revenues constitute almost half of the total revenue of countrywide general government
sectors. The BiH ITA, one of the budget users in the BiH Institutions budget, has jurisdiction over
indirect taxation. The revenues are mostly transferred to the Entities; less than 15% of the total indirect
taxation revenue is assigned to the BiH Institutions budget.

    (i) Transparency and objectivity in the horizontal allocation among subnational governments
.

Since BiH Institutions has no EBFs or lower tiers of government, there are no issues related to the
transparency and objectivity of horizontal allocations.

Dimension rating: NA- the BiH Institutions does not have local self-governance level

    (ii) Timeliness of reliable information to the different governments on their allocations
The budget planning process is intended to provide, by April of each year, macroeconomic projections and
revenue forecasts on which, in May each year, the Fiscal Council would base the following year’s
allocations of indirect taxation revenues—drawing on the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies
in BiH. Entity governments, cantons, local self-governance units, and public entities for roads could then be
given a credible and timely projection of the resources that would be available to them for the following
year. Thus each level of government would have the information needed to prepare their MTEF (i.e., fiscal
plan for the following three years, see PI-12) and, subsequently, for the forthcoming budget.

In the budget planning process for BiH Institutions, the Law on Financing of the BiH Institutions
stipulates that the Directorate for Economic Planning of the BiH Council of Ministers provides
macroeconomic projections for the country in March each year. On the basis of these projections, in
April each year the MAU of the Governing Board of the ITA provides projections of total indirect
taxation revenues. The BiH MFT then prepares projections of their own revenues (other than indirect
taxation revenues). Using the macroeconomic and fiscal projections for all four main levels, the Fiscal
Council is expected to prepare the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH, which in turn
would serve as a basis for each Finance Ministry to prepare its MTEF by end-May. In practice, the Fiscal
Council usually delays its adoption of the Global Framework, and adoption of the BiH MTEF is therefore
usually delayed. The adoption of annual budgets has also been delayed in recent years because of lack of
political agreement on indirect taxation revenue allocation for BiH Institutions and on the overall size of
the BiH Institutions budget.

Dimension rating: NA- the BiH Institutions does not have local self-governance level

    (iii) Extent of consolidation of fiscal data for general government according to sectoral categories
BiH Institutions does not have any EBFs or local levels and therefore does not need to consolidate such
fiscal data. As regards consolidation of BiH Institutions’ fiscal data by sectors, the reporting rulebook does
not require reporting by functions, and functional classification is not presented in budgets and in budget
execution reports. Only MTEFs include an approximation of main functional categories.

In terms of consolidation of fiscal data for the whole country, each year the CBBiH compiles comprehensive
information on consolidated general government revenue and expenditure by economic classification, including
cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs. This is out-turn information only (no consolidated information is
available for budget estimates), and does not include any functional/sectoral analysis. Only data on countrywide
functional expenditures are prepared as part of the Economic and Fiscal Programmes that BiH authorities submit
to the European Commission, but even they are based on a rough approximation.

PI-9: Oversight of Aggregate Fiscal Risk from Other Public Sector Entities
This indicator assesses whether the government adequately monitors and manages the fiscal risks35 arising
from public sector activities or operations outside its direct control. There are two dimensions: the first looks at
the activities of public enterprises (PEs) and autonomous government agencies (AGAs) operating outside the
budget, and the second at the possible risks from the activities of subnational governments.

     (i) Extent of monitoring of public enterprises and autonomous government agencies
The BiH Council of Ministers does not control any PEs,36 and the development of AGAs outside the budget has
been slow. In principle such bodies will be needed to meet the EU acquis obligations (for example, the BiH Air
Navigation Services Agency and bodies for the licensing of drugs), but their development has been very slow
because of a lack of political consensus on the extent of powers to be transferred to the level of the BiH
Institutions. For the time being, arrangements for reporting to and control by MFT are sufficient. The Public
Radio-Television Service of BiH (PE) and State Electricity Regulatory Commission are (PE) also under the
auspices of the BiH Parliament.All of these bodies report regularly to the Government (Council of Ministers of
BiH) and Parliament. They are obliged to have an annual audit conducted by the private independent audit firms,
and can also be subject to audit by the BiH SAI.

rather that the government only passively monitors PEs.

PI-11: Orderliness and Participation in the Annual Budget Process
This indicator aims to assess whether budget formulation adheres to a fixed and predictable budget
calendar each year and is organized in a way that facilitates effective participation by budget users. It also
assesses whether the instructions given to budget users for the preparation of their budget submissions
reflect high-level political decisions about the allocation of available funding, and whether the budget
circular fixes spending ceilings within which budget users have to work.

    (i) Existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar
Despite a well-defined budget calendar and processes at the BiH Institutions level, approval of the budget
is not always timely.

The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget are set out in the Law on Financing of the BiH
Institutions. Amendments to the law adopted in 2009 specify exact dates by which most of the key steps
in the budget calendar ought to be completed.

The budget process begins in January each year with the distribution of Budget Instructions No. 1, setting
out the requirements (and forms), responsibilities, and timelines for each stage of the budget cycle.
However, as has been mentioned, the calendar is not always adhered to. The 2013 budget was approved
on December 7, 2012, but the 2012 budget was not approved until May 2012, and the 2011 budget was
approved only retrospectively in February 2012. Those aspects of the budget calendar that depend on
technical work by civil servants generally appear to be adhered to, but the experience of 2010-12 shows
                                                             63

that work can be effectively and indefinitely delayed by political problems that can arise at the earlier
stage of the budget cycle when the policy framework is being determined, as well as at the later stages
when detailed proposals are submitted to ministers.

Table 4.1.120 sets out the budget calendar presented in the Law on Financing of the BiH Institutions and
the actual dates each task was completed during the 2013 budget process. One of the main reasons the
actual budget calendar deviated significantly from the timetable prescribed by the law is that the political
coalition forming the Council of Ministers changed during 2012. Even so, the budget was adopted on
time in 2013 for the first time in the last three years, largely because it was a condition of the SBA. In
addition, representatives of the BiH Institutions on the Fiscal Council (Council of Ministers Chairman and
the Minister of Finance and Treasury) were in consensus with the Entities’ representatives on decreasing
the BiH Institutions budget. According to the budget calendar the instructions for the 2013 budget were
distributed on June 20 and submitted by budget users on July 1.

    (ii) Clarity/comprehensiveness in the guidance on the preparation of budget submissions (budget
    circular or equivalent)
Two sets of budget instructions are issued. Budget Instructions No. 1 sets out the detailed guidelines and
instructions for the preparation of Budget User Priority Review Tables (BUPRTs), including high-priority
new spending proposals, proposed revenue measures, and savings options, consistent with the priorities of
the Council of Ministers. Following the submission of the BUPRTs, the MFT prepares a draft MTEF that
                                                                 64

sets out, among other things, the underlying macroeconomic indicators and fiscal outlook, proposed
budget expenditure priorities for the budget and forward estimates period, and budget ceilings for each
budget user. Once the Council of Ministers has approved the MTEF, the MFT issues Budget Instructions
No. 2, setting out the budget ceilings for each budget user (in accordance with the MTEF) for the next
year, together with instructions for the preparation of budget requests. Budget users are required to
prepare their detailed budget estimates in accordance with these ceilings. The MFT and budget users carry
out discussions following the distribution of the Budget Instructions No. 2. Some adjustments to the
ceilings may be permitted in accordance with government policy priorities and subject to the approval of
final budget ceilings by the Council of Ministers. Since there have been cases of lack of strict adherence
to the calendar (in terms of ceilings being approved by the Government before being sent to MDAs), the

PI-12: Multiyear Perspective in Fiscal Planning, Expenditure Policy, and Budgeting
This indicator refers to the extent to which the authorities of BiH plan their fiscal framework, expenditure
policies, and budget plans over the medium-term. Four dimensions are considered: (i) multiyear fiscal
forecasts and functional allocations; (ii) scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis; (iii) existence
of multiyear costed sector strategies; and (iv) linkages between investment allocations and forward
functional expenditure estimates.

     (i) Preparation of multiyear forecasts
Article 5(b) of the Law on the Fiscal Council requires the Fiscal Council to adopt the Global Framework
of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH, which set out the following:

        the proposed fiscal targets of the budgets of BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB;

        the proposed macroeconomic projections and the projection of the total indirect taxes and their
         allocation for the next fiscal year; and

        the proposed ceiling on the borrowing in the budgets of BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB.

All these elements were contained in the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH 2014-
2016, which was adopted by the Fiscal Council in September 2013 (Global Frameworks are not
published, however, efforts are being undertaken to publish them soon)37. The Global Framework that
have been adopted so far include (a) macroeconomic projections prepared by the Directorate for
Economic Planning; (b) indirect taxation revenue prepared by the MAU of the ITA Governing Board; (c)
overall tables of total aggregate categories of revenues, expenditures, and financing for BiH institutions,
FBiH, RS, and DB, which are set out only as an illustration and are not binding; (d) several sentences that
briefly set out the ceiling for the budget of BiH Institutions and the State’s share of indirect taxation
revenues, and mention a target to reduce both the primary fiscal deficit in BiH and total public
consumption over the medium term; and (e) proposal for the ceiling for the borrowing of the budgets of
institutions of: BiH, FBiH, RS, and DB.

Fiscal Council is a coordination body, which, by using necessary inputs (macro-projections developed by
Economic Planning Directorate, indirect taxes revenue projections developed by OMA), aiming to
establish , through Global Framework, consistent budget planning parameters at all levels of government
in BH. Ultimately, legislative authorities of each level of government are responsible of fiscal policy
pursuant to Constitutional responsibilities.

However, not all categories of general government expenditures are included in the data presented in
Global Frameworks—for example, public entities for roads—and data provided in the Global Framework
differ from the data consolidated by the IMF and Central Bank of BiH. Additionally, the definition of
fiscal balance by the Fiscal Council Law (and used in Global Frameworks) is primary balance calculated
as differences between current revenues and current expenditures, which differs from internationally
recognized definitions of fiscal balance (e.g. also taking into account capital expenditures).

Multiyear fiscal forecasts are produced as part of the process leading to the preparation of the MTEF,
including forward estimates of expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming
budget year and the two following fiscal years).Once approved by the Council of Ministers, the budget
year estimates establish the budget users’ budget ceilings for the forthcoming budget year. Forward
estimates are used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings.

The budget and forward estimates in the MTEF are prepared by administrative and economic
classification in accordance with the CoA. The MFT also prepares the budget and two-year forward
estimates in a separate (informal) functional table in the MTEF (Annex 3, pp 117-119, MTEF 2013 –
2015).The annual budget proposal does not include forward year estimates.

Dimension rating: C

       (ii) Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis
The MFT maintains a database of the external state debt, debt of the entities and the District of Brčko, and
issues orders to CBBiH, which are preceded by written consents of the entities, for the payments of
interest and the principal. The servicing of the relevant external debt of the entities is performed from the
revenues of the entities (indirect taxes) from the sub-account of the entity opened with the CBBiH, and
before the indirect taxes are made available to the entities, except for the direct external debt of the
entities, when the servicing is performed from the revenues of the entities (direct taxes) from the Single
Treasury Account, which is opened with commercial banks. In the latter case entities pay their liabilities
directly to the creditor. Total public debt is reviewed annually by MFT, CBBiH, and the Fiscal Council
through the regular Article IV consultations with the IMF, and this scrutiny is currently intensified under
the monitoring required by the SBA.

The MFT Debt Management Sector also maintains a database of internal and external debt at all levels of
government of BiH. Limited debt sustainability analysis (DSA)—which refers to the percentage of
external debt in relation to GDP—is usually presented in the information published by the debt
management department of the MFT. However, it cannot be considered as an appropriate full DSA during
the debt forecasting exercise. Detailed analysis of the entire external and internal public debt stock of the
State and the Entities and debt servicing prepared by the MFT is also given in the BiH Institutions
MTEF.38

The Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of BiH stipulates that Advisory Committee for Debt
(comprising of two representatives from Council of Ministers one of which is the Finance Minister, one
representative from the Central Bank of BiH, two representatives from the Entity Governments including
Finance Ministers, and Finance Directorate director from the Brčko District), which is supposed to be in
charge of preparing state debt management strategy. However, in practice, this has not been implemented.

Currently, the only debt sustainability analysis is the analysis IMF prepares within their Article IV
Country Reports or periodically in some of the reports in reviews under the SBA (four such analyses were
prepared by the IMF in 2009-2013). Since the IMF debt sustainability analyses have so far been
performed without active participation of the authorities in the preparation process (other than data
provision) and that the authorities do not use this analysis in their strategic planning process (the debt
sustainability analysis is not linked to a specific government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing
policies and needs of any government level (which are large, having in mind large infrastructure needs),
the performance rating for this indicators is reduced.

However, it should be noted that the IMF has recently shared its methodology and instructions in terms of
debt sustainability analysis with the Federal Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Federal
Ministry of Finance stemming from the conclusion of recent FBiH DeMPA prepared by the World Bank,

38
     See for example: http://www.mft.gov.ba/bos/images/stories/budzet/2013/DOB%202013-2015%20-S.pdf
                                                     67

which also found that no DSAs are undertaken, no sensitivity analyses are used, and no medium-term
debt management strategy has been developed and it recommended that the technical assistance is
provided to the Federal Ministry of Finance for the debt sustainability analysis. Thus, DSA preparation
for the FBiH by the FMF can be expected in future, as it is prescribed by the new Law on Budgets in
FBiH adopted in December 2013 that the debt sustainability analysis will have to be annexed to budget.
The IMF DSA template has also been shared with the MFT in past years. But, given that currently there
is no evidence that the authorities have prepared and used own or IMF DSA in their own strategic
planning process, the performance rating for this indicator is lowered as noted.

Dimension rating: D, since there is no appropriate DSA during the debt forecasting exercise
    (iii) Existence of costed sector strategies

No costed sector strategies are formally developed either for BiH as a whole or for the BiH Institutions. A
Draft Development Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina(with separate action plans for BiH Institutions,
FBiH, RS, and DB) was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the BiH Council of
Ministers and adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the Council of
Ministers or RS government. The Fiscal Council seems to have little political appetite to endorse or even
discuss such countrywide strategic documents.

The Institutions of BiH PIP was prepared in the format of a development document for the purpose of
creating the preconditions necessary for a gradual introduction of the system of mid-term financial
investment planning in compliance with strategic development plans and mid-term plans of the
Institutions and the BiH Council of Ministers. In view of the lack of adopted strategic development plans
on all the levels, the testing of the new structure of the Institutions of BiH PIP was performed in
cooperation with the Directorate for Economic Planning, in comparison with the Draft Development
Strategy and the Draft Strategy for Social Inclusion (SR/SSU). The structure of the development portion
of the 2011-2013 Institutions of BiH PIP is in that context adjusted to follow the structure of the strategic
goals of the Draft SR/SU.

The projects in the Institutions of BiH PIP are classified according to the development criterion on the
basis of which the Development Investment Programme was drawn from the Institutions of BiH PIP,
which covers the projects that directly contribute to social or economic development of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Development Investment Programme is based on the programme structure that contains
4 operational programmes.

The BiH MTEF includes an analysis of “medium-term budget priorities”—covering the forthcoming
annual budget and the two following fiscal years—based on the budget users’ submissions for costed new
spending proposals. Such proposals tend to be for specific individual initiatives or spending requirements
based on adopted pieced of legislation, rather than forming part of a broader overall or sector strategies.
Only a few sectoral strategies are adopted at State level (e.g., the Justice Reform Strategy), reflecting lack
of political will for countrywide and BiH Institutions strategic planning. Budget and forward estimates are
prepared for each budget user.

The MFT produces a supplementary budget statement by program, based on information submitted by
budget users. It includes statements of program objectives and performance indicators. Budget proposal in
the form of program budget is submitted to BiH Parliament as an annex to the budget documentation in a
form of information in the process of budget adoption, however the budget itself is adopted only in
economic an institutional classification. Furthermore, budget execution statements are also prepared
using only economic and institutional classification.

While the program budget statement is submitted to Parliament along with budget documentation for
information only, the budget and budget execution statement continues to be formally appropriated by
economic item for each budget user.

Dimension rating: D

   (iv) Linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates
All four levels of government prepare a rolling three-year PIP. Programme (PIP). In addition, the BiH
MFT Sector for Coordination of International Economic Assistance prepares a consolidated country PIP
but also a PIP for BiH Institutions. All PIP proposals and funded investment projects are captured by the
Public Investment Management Information System – PIMIS. That system is maintained by the Sector for
Coordination of International Economic Assistance. PIMIS is an information management system for the
management of public developmental investments that facilitates all entity and state budget users on line
access to planning and monitoring of all projects/programmes that are defined in the Strategic framework
and the mid-term and annual plans and contribute to the realization of development objectives. PIP
database is designed to match public investment proposals. The Sector for Coordination of International
Economic Assistance MFT also maintains a donor-mapping database covering donor-funded projects in
BiH. All projects from the PIP are classified according to COFOG and DAC nomenclature.

The Sector for Coordination of International Economic Assistance’s preparation of the PIP for BiH
Institutions is a separate process from the preparation of the budget of BiH Institutions by the Budget
Sector in the MFT. However, the processes are synchronized, and the MTEF also reflects approved and
funded projects in the PIP. In the course of negotiations with budget users it is obligatory to include a
representative of the Sector for Coordination of International Economic Assistance. Approved and
planned projects are harmonized with the funds planned in the Budget Framework Paper. The use of
multiyear estimates in the MTEF helps ensure that future recurrent costs of completed capital investment
projects are reflected in the MTEF. However, because the PIP is planned separately from recurrent
expenditure, it is not fully consistent with sector development strategies. In addition, the investments
listed in PIP are not always realistic in terms of financial resources and implementation plans. The
aforementioned lists include all delegated projects. The projects are directed towards the realization of
development objectives in compliance with the strategic framework that is represented by development
strategies and other strategic documents. Projects have a filled out Form for identification, registration,
and monitoring of projects/programmes.

Although investments are planned separately from current expenditure, the current investment costs are
taken into account in the course of preparation of the MTEF.

PI-13: Transparency of Taxpayer Obligations and Liabilities
This indicator examines three dimensions: (i) whether tax legislation and regulations are clear and
comprehensive and limit the discretion of authorities, especially with regard to decisions on tax
assessments and exemptions; (ii) whether taxpayers have ready access to information about tax liabilities
and administrative procedures; and (iii) whether a functioning tax appeals mechanism exists.

     (i) Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities
The legislative framework for indirect taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, and there are clear
laws governing administrative procedures. Due to a strict application of administrative procedures in
practice, the discretionary powers of the tax inspectors are fairly limited. While the VAT law will be
harmonized with the EU directives, some of the important taxation principles are currently not clearly and
consistently reflected in the legislation and interpreted in practice—for example, place of taxation for
services and input VAT deduction for financial institutions. ITA is working on changes in the legislation
to improve harmonization with the relevant OECD guidelines (Twinning Project with the Austrian
Ministry of Finance). Discretionary powers in assessing tax liabilities are fairly limited.

Dimension rating: B

     (ii) Taxpayer access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures
Taxpayers have web access to information regarding tax obligations, explanatory notices, and
administrative procedures (www.uino.gov.ba), and taxpayers have electronic access to their tax records
(“e-VAT”). There is a network of ITA regional branch offices where taxpayers can obtain specific
explanations or instructions and copies of tax records. An information desk/telephone hotline is available
in the ITA Central Office, and taxpayers’ questions are generally answered in due time and with due
professional care. Workshops or seminars for taxpayers are not organized regularly. Official binding
interpretations about tax applicability can be requested individually. In 80% of cases responses are
received within the timeframe of 30 days.39 Delays are evident only in the case of large taxpayers, due to
the limited number of inspectors, and because of the legal obligation to perform inspection in advance40.

Dimension rating: B

     (iii) Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism
The BiH tax appeal system comprises three levels: (a) objection and appeal to the ITA branch office
making the assessment; (b) appeal to the ITA Central office in Banja Luka; and (c)lawsuit before the to
the Administrative Court of BiH(Administrative Department of the Court of BiH).The decision process
usually lasts longer than the timeframe specified in the rules/regulations—the backlog of cases before the
court is such that any decision is likely to take several years. Decisions are not publicly available. Appeals
are reviewed by bodies whose members rarely include experienced professionals from the private sector
and civil society. Issued decisions are binding for all parties, with no discrimination in respect of rights to
appeal. Consequently, the issues that need to be addressed are transparency (i.e. making decisions
publicly available), improving time efficiency, and improving the technical understanding of the VAT
principles (i.e., including in the review process professionals from the private and NGO sectors).

Reforms after the Assessment Period
On December 31, 2013, the Law on Amendments to the Law on the Procedure of Indirect Taxation
(“Official Gazette of BiH”, issue No. 100/13) came into effect, and it amended Article 52 that had
stipulated the confidentiality of data on indirect taxes. The amendment to the aforementioned Law opened
up the possibility of public disclosure of lists of debtors, which has improved transparency. The lists are
published separately for the debtors owing VAT, excises, and customs duties. Upon the publication of the
first list of debtors, the total of BAM 21.3 million had been paid within the first month, by 348 debtors
included in the list of debtors.



PI-14: Effectiveness of Measures for Taxpayer Registration and Tax Assessment
This indicator examines how effective a tax administration is in identifying taxpayers and assessing their
liability to pay, using three dimensions: the effectiveness of the administration in identifying taxpayers
and getting them to register, the effectiveness of penalties for noncompliance, and the planning and
monitoring of tax audit and inspection.

     (i) Controls in the taxpayer registration system
VAT taxpayers are registered in a single electronic database that covers the whole country. The
registration process is automated, using specialized software. 41 Taxpayers are assigned a unique Tax
Identification Number (TIN), which is used for VAT, customs, excises, and external trade operations. Tax
authorities and taxpayers are obliged to use TINs in all official correspondence. The VAT database of
registered taxpayers is available and easily accessible on the website. Potential (non-registered) taxpayers
can be identified through such control mechanisms as special construction schemes and joint controls of
the supply chain participants.TINs can be directly assigned only to BiH residents. The mechanism for
registration of non-residents is referred to as “VAT Representative,” and the VAT TIN for non-residents

41
  VAT is fully administered in a specialized software ALICE (A Logical Integrated Computerised Environment), which is used for
registration of taxpayers, processing of tax declarations, processing and accounting of payments, tax refunds, enforced payments, control
of payments, analysis of taxpayer’s risk, reporting. ALICE is also used to support the service of e-VAT, a service allowing taxpayers to
have real-time access to their unique taxpayer account.
                                                              71

is assigned through a resident taxpayer. However, because of lack of efficient exchange of information
with foreign tax authorities, ITA does not have an effective mechanism to enforce registration on non-
residents who are identified as potential tax payers for VAT.

Importers are also registered in a single database using specialized software. Unique customs ID numbers
are assigned to each importer and used in all official correspondence.42There is no direct, i.e. automated
linkage between VAT and customs databases, but the databases are being reconciled on the monthly
basis.

The VAT and the customs registration systems are not linked to other relevant registration systems such
as pension funds, commercial court registers, and so on.

Dimension rating: C

     (ii) Effectiveness of penalties for noncompliance with registration and tax declaration
Taxpayers of indirect taxes are liable to a penalty of a minimum of 1000 BAM for late registration, plus
an additional 100% of unreported liabilities which have directly resulted from late registration.43Penalties
for late submission of VAT returns range from 500 BAM to 1000 BAM.44Penalties of up to 5000 BAM
are also imposed on responsible persons (company directors).45The penalties appear to be high enough,
but they may not always be an effective deterrent.46

Dimension rating: B

     (iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit programs
VAT reporting applies the self-assessment method. Tax audit plans are produced monthly and annually.
In 2012, 7,610 audits of VAT taxpayers were carried out. The selection of taxpayers for audit is based on
automated risk assessment criteria, identified from tax declarations entered into the system. The system
runs queries based on indications such as high tax refunds or unusual tax base changes. In addition, the
Group for Risk Control performs risk analyses in the Risk Analysis Module. However, according to the
2012 Report of the BiH Supreme Auditor, risk assessment criteria have not been sufficiently implemented
in practice. During 2012, 30% of planned tax audits were not carried out, and 60% of performed tax
audits were not based on risk analyses issued by the Group for Risk Control and automated risk module
findings. 47 Fraud investigation activities are carried out by the ITA’s Sector for Implementation and
Compliance with Customs and Tax Legislation, and include identifications; inquiries; documentation and
processing of all types of smuggling; customs and tax frauds, or other breaches of customs; VAT; and
excise duties legislation.

Reform after the Assessment Date
On June 12, 2013, the Indirect Tax Authority, the Tax Administration of Republika Srpska, the Tax
Administration of the Federation of BiH, and the Tax Administration of the Brčko District of BiH signed
the Memorandum on Institutional Cooperation and Data Exchange and formed a Coordinating Body with
8 members. Regular meetings of the Coordinating Body have been held since it was formed.

PI-15: Effectiveness in Collection of Tax Payments
This indicator assesses the effectiveness of a tax administration in actually collecting the amounts of
revenue due, covering three dimensions: the tax administration’s effectiveness in keeping tax arrears
under control; arrangements for transferring revenue collected to the Treasury; and the performance of the
tax administration in reconciling the detailed accounts of each individual taxpayer with the overall totals
assessed and collected, so that it knows exactly the amounts owed by each taxpayer as well as the total
amount of revenue outstanding, and can also reconcile the amounts it has collected with the records of
total payments to the Treasury.

     (i) Collection ratio for gross tax arrears
The VAT debt collection ratio was 64% in 2011 and 65% in 2012. The amount of tax in arrears was 224
million BAM in 2011 and 293 million BAM in 2012. Total tax collections were 3,149 million BAM in
2011and 3,165 million BAM in 2012. Therefore, tax in arrears represented 7% and 9% for 2011 and
2012, respectively.48

In terms of debt recovery through foreclosed assets, none of the foreclosed properties were sold during
2012.49 Tax-related penalties (i.e., a percentage of additionally assessed tax liability) are levied when tax
returns are carelessly or deliberately prepared incorrectly, which results in unreported tax liability.
Interest is assessed on late payments of taxes, as well as enforced collection. The interest in the amount of
0.04% (until December 31, 2013, it had amounted to 0.06%) and enforced collection fee amounting to 5%
of the value of the liability (until December 31, 2013 it had amounted to 10%) were amended in Article
52 of the Law on Amendments and Addenda to the Law on Procedure of Indirect Taxation (“Official
Gazette of BiH”, issue No.100/13).

PI-16: Predictability in the Availability of Funds for Commitment of Expenditures
This indicator assesses the extent to which the government provides reliable information on the
availability of funds to budget users to enable effective resource management. It is intended to measure
performance over the last completed fiscal year before assessment.

     (i) Extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored
The Treasury Department of the BiH Institutions MFT produces a cash flow forecast that is updated
monthly. Because of the limited range of the BiH Institutions’ responsibilities, and the high proportion of
the budget devoted to employee compensation (73.9% of current expenditure in 201152) cash flows are
reasonably predictable. On the revenue side, the BiH Institutions receive a predetermined amount that is
paid out of ITA revenues before the balance is divided between the Entities and DB. Once this amount
has been set, the BiH Institutions can be confident of receiving this amount even if overall revenues fall
short because of deterioration in the economy.

PI-17: Recording and Management of Cash Balances, Debt, and Guarantees
This indicator looks at debt management in terms of contracting, servicing and repayment, and the
provision of government guarantees, including the following dimensions:

        maintenance of a debt data system and regular reporting on the main features of the debt
         portfolio;

        identification and consolidation of cash balances in all government bank accounts (including
         those for EBFs and government-controlled project accounts); and

        the proper recording and reporting of all government borrowing and all government-issued
         guarantees, and the approval of all borrowing and guarantees by a single government entity (e.g.,
         the ministry of finance or a debt management commission) against adequate and transparent
         criteria.

    (i) Quality of debt data recording and reporting
The BiH Institutions have so far contracted only small amounts of debt on their own behalf. With the
exception of some externally financed projects, all current and capital expenditure has been met from
revenues. Although the entity governments are responsible for servicing almost all the country’s public
external debt, all external loans of IFI (regardless of whether the Entities are using it and repaying it),
must be approved by the BiH Council of Ministers, BiH Presidency, and BiH Parliament.
                                                         75

CBBiH publishes quarterly figures for total external public debt, including any element applicable to the
BiH Institutions.

The MFT of BiH maintains a comprehensive database of the country’s external public debt (most owed to IFIs),
and issues an order to the CB BiH for the payment of the relevant external debt of the entities, pending prior
consent of the entities, and of the direct state debt. The servicing of the relevant external debt of the entities is
performed from the revenues of the entities (indirect taxation) from the subaccount of the entity that is opened
with CB BiH, and before the indirect taxation revenues are put at the disposal of the entities, except for the
direct external debt of the entities, when the servicing is performed from the revenues of the entities (direct
taxation) from the Single Treasury Account of the entity that is opened with commercial banks, and in such a
manner that the entities are paying their obligations to the creditor directly. Total public debt is reviewed
annually by MFT, CBBiH, and the Fiscal Council through the regular Article IV consultations with the IMF,
and this scrutiny is currently intensified under the monitoring required by the SBA.

The MFT Debt Management Sector also maintains a database of both the stock of internal and external
debt at all levels of governance of BiH, based on its own data and regular exchange of information with
the Entities and DB. However, FBiH debt reporting tends to be delayed (in terms of local self-governance
units), and thus overall reporting for BiH is also hampered and cannot qualify for the highest score.

Detailed analysis of the entire public debt stock of State and Entities (both external and internal) and debt
servicing prepared by the MFT is also given in the BiH Institutions MTEF (including debt stock
information and debt repayment projections)53 and in the annual reports of Debt Stock of BiH that the
MFT prepares. 54 Each quarterly execution report for the budget of BiH Institutions includes detailed
information on foreign debt servicing, and the annual budget plans of BiH Institutions include detailed
projections of foreign debt servicing.

Limited DSA—referring to the percentage of external debt in relation to GDP—is usually presented in the
reports published by the debt management department of the MFT. However, it cannot be considered as
an appropriate full DSA during the debt forecasting exercise.

Dimension rating: B

     (ii) Extent of consolidation of government cash balances

This dimension deals exclusively with the level of BiH Institutions, since each of the main government
levels has separate payments systems. All BiH Institutions’ transactions pass through the STA. Since the
BiH Institutions have underspent their budgets and thus did not use all their cash revenues, they
accumulated some cash balances, which were held partly in CBBiH and partly in the commercial banks
through which payments are made. The totals of the balances and all cash balances are calculated daily.

Dimension rating: A

     (iii) Systems for contracting loans and the issue of guarantees
BiH Institutions can issue, on behalf of BiH, external guarantees for the financing of capital
investments. 55 The total amount of externally issued guarantees guaranteed by BiH (mostly for IFI
investment projects implemented in the Entities) stood at BAM62.9million at the end of 2012 (less than
1% of total BiH general government expenditure56). These guarantees are always approved by the BiH

Council of Ministers and BiH Parliament. The Entities can also issue guarantees, which are discussed in
their sections of this report.

BiH Institutions has contracted, through the MFT, relatively small amounts of external direct state loans.
The total outstanding direct state debt stood at BAM28.6million at the end of 2012, or about 3% of BiH
Institutions annual expenditure.57Such loans are also approved by the BiH Council of Ministers and BiH
Parliament.

The objectives for debt are not linked to medium-term fiscal targets, as there are no proper debt strategy
in terms of how much additional debt will be issued (generally, the ‘strategic documents’ such as Global
Framework and MTEFs discuss overall legal debt/debt repayment limits). So, rating B is most appropriate
- contracting of loans and issuance of guarantees are made within limits for total debt and total
guarantees, and always approved by a single responsible level of governance.

PI-18: Effectiveness of Payroll Controls
Payroll and related charges represent a significant percentage of current costs of the BiH Institutions. This
indicator is intended to cover all significant government payrolls—that is, all civil servants and other
government employees, including the armed forces, police, and EBF employees—considering four
dimensions: (i) the degree of integration between personnel and payroll records; (ii) the timeliness of
changes to personnel records and the payroll; (iii) the operation of internal controls over changes to
personnel records and the payroll; and (iv) the existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses.

    (i) Degree of integration and reconciliation between personnel records and payroll data
The MFT Treasury operates the payroll for all employees of the BiH Institutions except the armed forces.
The Civil Service Agency (CSA) controls all appointments to and promotions in civil service positions,
and has a complete database of all civil servants. The positions and organization structure for each agency
are specified in the Rulebook on Organization and Systematization of Workplaces.

The creation of positions and changes to a budget user’s organizational structure require amendments to
the Rulebook. Such amendments are managed by each government organization and require the formal
consent of the Ministry of Justice and final approval by the Council of Ministers. A small number of
appointments to senior positions are at the discretion of ministers, although the posts must be allowed for
in the systematization, and the holders must meet the minimum educational qualifications. Staff in lower-
grade positions (drivers, messengers, etc.), are not subject to CSA control, although the posts must be
included in the approved systematization for each budget user and the numbers employed must not
exceed the staff ceilings fixed by MFT.

The Treasury makes changes to the payroll on receiving details from the employing organization, which
should include documentation of CSA approval where applicable. The Tax Authorities are informed at
the same time. The Treasury does not check the correctness of the documentation supplied unless the
consequence would be to exceed the staff ceiling or estimated provision for the organization in question.
Control in effect depends on administrative inspections under the Ministry of Justice and on external
audit. There is a complete database, and regular reconciliations are undertaken between personnel and
payroll records at least on monthly basis.

Dimension rating: B

    (ii) Timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll
Since appointments can only take effect once all the necessary notifications have been given, changes to
personnel records and the payroll are made without delay, and that retroactive adjustments are rare.

Dimension Rating: A

    (iii) Internal controls of changes to personnel records and the payroll
The controls are dependent on the systems in the employing authority, CSA, and Treasury. The
responsibility should be clear in each case, so that there is an audit trail, but the accuracy of the records
justifying overtime and other special payments may be more uncertain. The need to strengthen internal
financial controls to meet the EU requirements for Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) is well
recognized (see the European Commission’s 2012 Progress Report, para 4.2.7 (SWD (2012) 335 final)
and also PI-20 below), and much of the preparatory work has been done; but approval for implementation
of the changes has not yet been given.

Dimension rating: C

    (iv) Existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers
Payroll audits have been undertaken by both external and internal auditors. External audit includes sample
testing of salary payments, personal dossiers of employees alongside other transactions as part of its
financial and compliance audit. As all BiH institutions are subject to financial audit each year, the payroll
audits are performed regularly and include the tests that would discover any potential fictitious
employees, and supplement data that are lacking and provide an insight into the weaknesses relating to
internal controls.

PI-19: Competition, Value for Money, and Controls in Procurement
This indicator assesses whether there is a system in place to ensure economy and efficiency in public
procurement of goods and services, including investments of different kinds as well as purchases of
consumption goods. Four dimensions are considered: (i) whether the legal and regulatory framework
provides adequately for transparency and for the effective operation of competition across the whole
range of public procurement; (ii) whether there is sufficient justification for deviations from open
competition; (iii) whether there is public access to full information about procurement plans, tender
opportunities, contract awards, and the results of procurement complaints; and (iv) whether there is a
satisfactory mechanism to deal with procurement complaints.

    (i) Transparency, comprehensiveness, and competition in the legal and regulatory framework
The current Law on Public Procurement in BiH was enacted in 2004 (Official Gazette BiH no. 49/04) and
was last amended in 2010.The law regulates procurement at all level of government in BiH and requires
contracting authorities to ensure that “awarding of public contracts is done in a way that ensures
efficiency, transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination and competition.” The law is supported by a
package of “secondary legislation ”that includes “The Public Procurement Legislative Framework for
Bosnia and Herzegovina – Guide to the New Public Procurement Procedures”; “Decision on
Implementation of the Public Procurement Law BiH”; “List of Categories of Contracting Authorities
Obliged to Apply the BiH Public Procurement Law”; “Guidelines on Preparation of Model Forms and
Procurement Notice, Contract Award Notice and Cancellation Notice”; and “Instructions on Elaboration
                                                             79

of the Minutes from Tender Opening. ”At the time of enactment the law was “harmonized”58 with EU
standards, “bringing the BiH regulatory framework in line with European standards .” 59 The law still
remains to be aligned with the EU acquis.60A new draft law that more fully conforms with current EU
legislation has been prepared by the Public Procurement Agency (PPA), which supervises the operation
of the system, and after a political stalemate lasting since 2009, this new Law has been sent to
Parliamentary procedure recently and is expected to be adopted by February 2014 (this new deadline is
included in the SBA). The Law is expected to strengthen governance, enhance transparency, and bring
procurement practices in BiH in line with those in the EU.

The law and secondary legislation establish clear rules for public procurement procedures, including
setting out the thresholds and other criteria for open, restricted, and negotiated procedures, competitive
requests for quotation, and direct agreement. The law clearly sets out where exemptions are permitted—
for example, for contracts related to “state secrets” and defense.

The law and secondary legislation are published on the PPA’s website. All procurement decisions can be
appealed to an independent Procurement Review Board (PRB).Except for certain exemptions specified in
the law, all procurements above BAM 50,000 (goods and services) or BAM 80,000 (works) must be
submitted to an “open procedure”61 with “publication of a procurement notice in the JP NIO BiH official
gazette or to restricted procedure with pre-qualification.”62 For tenders above BAM2 million, any use of
the restricted procedure should be “supplemented by publication of a short summary in English on
international media. ”For contracts under BAM 6,000, direct agreement is permitted; for contracts
between BAM 6,000 and BAM 50,000 (goods and services)/BAM 80,000 (works), competitive requests
for quotation must be issued if the open procedure is not used. Contracting authorities are required to
publish their reasons for not using the open procedure; other suppliers can challenge these reasons before
the PRB, which can order the contract to be retendered.

The rating depends on how many of six benchmarks are satisfied:

        There is a clear structure of law and subsidiary regulations: Satisfied.

        The legal framework is readily accessible to the general public: Satisfied.

        The legal framework applies to all procurement undertaken with government funds, with strictly
         defined exceptions: Satisfied.

        Open competition is the default method above defined thresholds, and the circumstances in which
         less competitive procedures may be used are clearly defined: Satisfied.

        There is public access to all of the following procurement information: government procurement
         plans, bidding opportunities, contract awards, and data on resolution of procurement complaints:
         Not satisfied—the public has access to bidding opportunities and tender awards, but not to
         procurement plans or the results of procurement appeals.

        There is an independent procurement review process, which can suspend the tendering procedure
         before contracts are signed: Satisfied—although contracts are often signed before the review
         body has been able to rule on a complaint.

   Further amendments to the law are required to align the law with the latest EU regulations. The PPA advised that several
versions of a new draft public procurement law, intended to harmonize procurement regulations with EU Directives 17 and 18,
have been prepared but have not yet been endorsed by either the Council of Ministers or Parliament.

Five of the six benchmarks are satisfied.

Dimension rating: B

    (ii) Justification for the use of less competitive procurement methods
The PPA publishes all tenders and all contracts issued in the Official Gazette of BiH, which is also
published on the PPA website. The reasons for deviations from open competition are also published, but
the PPA does not review whether or not the reasons are valid according to the legislation, as that is not a
legislated obligation of the PPA.

In 2010 some 65% of all procurements were based on open competition using both open and restricted
procedures, compared with over 72% in 2009.At the same time there were increases in the proportion of
contracts let by direct agreement and by requests for competitive quotations (often referred to as
“shopping”).

Table 4.1.30 shows the value of contracts procured by the various methods. The BiH PPA did not provide
relevant information for years 2011 and 2012. The justification for this refusal was that “BiH PPA is
unaware of any decision by the Council of Ministers to adopt BiH PPA 2011 Annual Report. As such the
Report is not an official document and the Agency is not in the position to provide the relevant
information concerning the type and number procurement procedures for 2011. The report for 2012 has
been adopted by the BiH Council of Ministers.

Contracting authorities are required to specify their reasons for not using open tenders. Although these reasons
are subject to examination by the PRB in the event of a complaint, their validity is not otherwise subject to any
supervision. In practice, external audit reports regularly contain numerous criticisms of improprieties in the
operation of public procurement, and a high and rising volume of complaints is addressed to the PRB.
According to the PRB, the complaints received in 2011 related to contracts with a total value of BAM980
million (or about 40% of total procurement subject to the legislation). Moreover, the success rate for
complainants has been rising: 1,155 of the 2,133 complaints received in 2012 were found to be justified.

The rating of this indicator depends not on the volume of exceptions to the open procedure, but on
whether the exceptions were justified under with the legislation. Since there is widespread criticism by
auditors, and frequent successful complaints by tenderers, it is clear that the large number of exceptions to
open procedures is not properly justified in many cases.

       (iii) Public access to complete, reliable, and timely procurement information
The PPA has developed a comprehensive website that provides extensive information on the organization,
mandate, and activities of the BiH PPA and PRB. It includes the Law on Public Procurement in BiH and
the secondary legislation, including principles, procedures, and guidelines. It also includes details of
training programs. However, it does not contain up-to-date information about the use of different forms of
procurement (see Table 4.1.30).

The website includes data from the PPA’s two main software systems—WisPPA, which provides on-line
delivery of reports on implementation of public procurement procedures, and Go-Procure, which provides for
on-line publication of procurement notices and contract awards. The website also includes a register (database)
of all contracting authorities and suppliers in BiH. All tenders and contract awards are published on the
website.63The reasons why procurement methods other than open procedure are used are also published on the
internet, although in many cases this does not occur until after the contract has been awarded.

Score: the dimension rating depends on whether complete, reliable, and timely information is available to the
public about procurement plans, bidding opportunities, contract awards, and the results of procurement
complaints. This information is available only about bidding opportunities and contract awards.

Dimension rating: C

       (iv) Existence and operation of an independent procurement complaints system
An independent PRB is responsible for handling appeals and complaints about contracting procedures.
The Board consists of six members appointed by the BiH Parliament—three are qualified lawyers, and
three are procurement specialists with tertiary qualifications. The Board itself is not involved in
procurement transactions or contract award processes.

A nominal fee of BAM 50toBAM 100 is charged for the submission of complaints, although the level of
compliance with payment is low. It is unlikely that the existence of the fee limits access to the review
process. The PRB advised that a decision by the BiH Court of Appeals prohibits them from refusing to
consider a complaint because the fee was not paid. The Board has clearly defined procedures for the
submission and resolution of complaints.

The law requires that a decision on a complaint be made within 30 days, although, largely because of resource
constraints (discussed below), this requirement is not always met. The PRB’s decision can be appealed to the
BiH Court of Appeals. The law requires the tender process to be suspended if the PRB finds in favor of the
complainant before a contract is signed. In practice the PRB advised that contracts are often signed even
though an appeal has been lodged, resulting in a large number of outstanding appeals that have not been finally
resolved. In these cases the PRB can award substantial amounts of compensation to complainants. Many cases
are pending before the Administrative Court, which has a four-year backlog.

The Board appears to be significantly under-staffed, a situation that undermines its capacity to fulfil its
functions. Including the six Board members, the PRB has a total of 17 funded positions, of which 7are
technical advisers. Between 2006 and 2012 the Board gave decisions on nearly 10,000 complaints, and
the Board is now averaging over 2000 complaints a year. The Board’s current staffing allocation was
premised on an expected 200 complaints a year. Compounding the problem is that, according to the
chairman, four of the technical staff are on sick or other forms of leave and have not been replaced. In
addition to the backlog of complaints, the lack of resources has meant that the Board has been unable to
publish its recent rulings as required by the regulations under which it operates.

A new rulebook on the organisation and a revised “systematization” of staff positions prepared by the
PRB was submitted to the Ministry of Justice (which has responsibility for overseeing the establishment
of civil service posts) in 2011.However, the Ministry of Justice submitted only the rulebook to the
Council of Ministers for approval, and the Council has taken no action. No reason has been given for the
lack of progress with the Board’s request. Until the Board has staffing resources commensurate with its
workload, it will not be able to fulfill the full range of its functions.

The Law on Procurement does not specify a maximum term for Board members, and formal letters of
appointment of the Commissioners did not specify the term of appointment. Subsequently the Council of
Ministers made a decision to limit the terms of the Commissioners to five years, meaning that the terms of
the current Board members should have expired in mid-2010. On the proposal of the Ministry of Justice, the
Council of Ministers ruled in January 2013 that the mandates of the members had expired and the positions
should be advertised. However, the Ministry’s Legal Office has advised that the Council’s decision is not
consistent with the law, and the members of the Board have challenged the procedural validity of the
termination decision. This has created a complex legal standoff that has the potential to invalidate all the
Board’s decisions on complaints since mid-2010 and reopen them to legal challenge.

The dimension rating depends on how many of seven benchmarks are satisfied.

       The Board is made up of experienced professionals: Satisfied.

       The members have no part in the contract award process: Satisfied.

       Prohibitive fees are not demanded from complainants: Satisfied.

       The Board follows defined procedures: Satisfied.

       The Board has authority to suspend the procurement process: Satisfied, although contracting
        authorities are not required to wait until appeals have been decided before signing contracts.

       The Board aims to issue decisions within the required timescale: Partially Satisfied, it does not
        always succeed because of resource limitations.

       The Board’s decisions are binding on all parties: Satisfied, although the decisions are routinely
        appealed to the Administrative Court by contracting authorities.

All seven benchmarks are satisfied. The Complaints Review Body is registered as a separate legal entity,
comprising of three members from the pool of recognized law experts, which have a status similar to
status of independent judges. They cannot perform any other direct or indirect jobs, except ones of
academic nature. In addition to these three experts, the Body also has three experts in the area of
construction works, transport and strategic management they are selected by public tendering process
(competitive process). The legislation prescribes that any expert can be engaged by the CRB in case it is
necessary in order to resolve the complaint. As per Official Gazette BiH" no. 87/13 from 11 Nov 2013. 2
branch offices in Banja Luka and Mostar were established with 5 members each (3 law experts and 2
experts in the area of construction works, transport and strategic management).

PI-20: Effectiveness of Internal Controls for Non-salary Expenditure
This indicator assesses the effectiveness of internal controls over non-salary expenditure, considering three
dimensions: (i) the effectiveness of controls over the commitment of expenditure; (ii) the comprehensiveness,
relevance, and understanding of internal control rules and procedures; and (iii) the degree of compliance with
rules for processing and recording transactions. The controls should ensure that expenditure is incurred, and
payments made, only when fully justified in accordance with budgetary provisions, and when all applicable
regulations (including those concerning procurement) have been complied with.

     (i) Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls
Budget execution arrangements ensure that payments are not made when they would go beyond the
progressive release of funds on the relevant budget line, or would exceed the overall budgetary provision.
New legislation adopted in 2012 provides a firmer basis for effective financial management and control,
while the budget execution software enables commitments64 to be registered. It was understood that these
recently introduced arrangements are working satisfactorily; BiH Institutions had not incurred any
expenditure arrears at the time of the assessment. However, SAI for example notes that recording
liabilities from previous period without proper procedure still occurs.65

Dimension rating: B

     (ii) Comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of other internal control rules/procedures
The 2010 establishment of the Central Harmonization Unit (CHU) charged with coordinating of internal
financial control and internal audit throughout the BiH Institutions provides a basis for progress. Most
aspects of internal financial control are the responsibility of the heads of the spending units who,
according to the CHU, need further training and preparation. The necessary detailed rules and procedures
have not yet been adopted by the BiH Institutions, although much of the preparatory work has been done.
EU assistance is provided under the IPA66 to support the training and other steps needed to implement

64
   A definition of what constitutes a commitment is contained in Article 2, Item M, of the Law on Financing of BiH Institutions

strengthened internal financial control and internal audit. The CHU objective is that effective financial
management and control arrangements, including internal audit, should be fully operational throughout
the BiH Institutions, with all the necessary staff in place, by the end of 2016.

Dimension rating: C

       (iii) Degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions
All payments are made through the STA, which does not permit payments to be made beyond the limits
of budget provision. The BiH Institutions do not have any EBFs. The Treasury does not exercise any
control over the compliance of individual transactions with applicable legislation, except in the case of
contracts for capital investments, for which it examines the documentation of procurement procedures.
Overall the payments system works in an orderly manner, although further development is needed before
the payment process could be executed through the system in real time. However, SAI for example states
that there are cases when recording of some transaction by different users is done using different codes,
due to unclear rules67. Finally non-salary expenditure represented only: 2011: 27%, 2010: 34%, 2009:
31%

PI-21: Effectiveness of Internal Audit
This indicator looks at the functioning of internal audit services as distinct from the internal control
operations reviewed in PI-20. The internal audit function considered here is defined as an advisory service
to top management on the functioning of the systems for which management is responsible; internal audit is
by definition separated from any operational responsibility for the systems. Three dimensions are
considered: (i) the coverage and quality of internal audit work; (ii) the frequency and distribution of internal
audit reports; and (iii) the extent of the management’s responses to internal audit findings.

The authorities’ overall aim is to have a harmonized legal framework in place across different
government levels in BiH, as this is one of the essential elements of the EU Accession criteria (Chapter
32 of the negotiations). In 2011 the BiH CHU Coordinating Board, made up of the heads of the CHUs of
BiH Institutions and the two entities, developed harmonized proposals for new legislation (including

67
     See for example page 24 of the 2012 SAI Report on budget execution of State Institutions.
                                                             85

regulations on detailed procedures) on PIFC, covering both internal financial control and internal audit.
So far the legislative process has been completed only by the BiH Institutions68 and RS.

     (i) Coverage and quality of the internal audit function
The legal framework for internal audit is in place, and the criteria for the establishment of internal audit
units have been published. Eventually 17 internal audit units are to be set up, staffed by 45-50 internal
auditors; many of the units will cover more than one institution. At present only 12 auditors are in place,
and arrangements still have to be made for the necessary curriculum development and auditor training.

Internal audit currently functions in the Ministries of Finance, Defense, and Justice; in the Ministries of
Finance and Defense, practical assistance has been provided by the Swedish International Development
Administration. The annual report on the operation of internal audit for 2011, submitted by the CHU to
the Council of Ministers, has been published; the report for 2012 is expected to show improvements in the
operation of the Treasury function. The importance of internal audit is also recognized by the Ministry of
Defense, which received an adverse external audit report. Because— pending the recruitment and training
of the necessary staff—there is currently only limited coverage of internal audit within the BiH
Institutions, the main focus of the reports remains compliance audit rather than the performance of
systems or the achievement of intended results. SAI notes that internal audit is still not being
implemented in line with the Law on Internal Audit and Audit Standards, however, based on the number
of internal audits conducted and the content of the recommendations issued, at least 20% of staff time is
dedicated to systems reviews.

Dimension rating: C

     (ii) Frequency and distribution of reports
There is currently limited coverage, and a relatively small number of internal audit reports have been
prepared. In 2012 a total of 50 internal audits were conducted in five institutions: the Ministries of
Finance and Treasury, Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Justice and the Communications Regulatory
Agency.69 According to Law on Internal Audit, internal audit reports for audited institutions are submitted
to heads of audited institutions upon completion and to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of BiH.
Upon request such reports can be delivered to any legislative, executive or judiciary organ as well as to
BiH SAI. Consolidated annual reports prepared by the CHU are submitted to the Council of Ministers for
information, upon approval of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. It is also submitted to all legislative,
executive, or judicial body and relevant external auditor, based on their request. The Law also prescribes
that the CHU cooperated with SAI by exchanging reports, documents, and opinions. 70 Thus, while
internal audit coverage is not full yet, for the purpose of PEFA rating for this indicator, B rating is
appropriate since reports are issued regularly for most audited entities and distributed to the audited
entity, the ministry of finance and (upon the request) the SAI.

Dimension rating: B

     (iii) Extent of management response to internal audit findings
According to the CHU, there is some recognition in the Ministries of Finance and Defense of the potential
usefulness of internal audit work, but the managements of other spending units still see internal audit as a
threat, not a help. The CHU’s consolidated reports for 2011 and 2012 present an overview of internal
audit recommendations and the extent to which they are fulfilled. Overall, 67 out of 195

PI-23: Availability of Information on Resources Received by Service Delivery Units
This indicator asks whether normal administrative and accounting systems provide reliable information
about the resources received by primary schools and primary health clinics, whatever level of government
is responsible for their operation. The BiH Institutions are not responsible for the provision of health or
education services, and no subnational governments reporting to them. Therefore the governments on the
sub-national levels are not under obligation to report them in this area and they do not report to them.

PI-24: Quality and Timeliness of In-year Budget Reports
This indicator reviews three aspects of in-year budget execution reporting: (i) the scope of reports and the
extent to which comparisons are possible with budget estimates on administrative, economic, and
functional bases, with commitments covered separately from payments; (ii) the timeliness of reports; and
(iii) the quality of the information.

     (i) Scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates
In-year reports are produced according to the relevant provisions of the Law on Financing of BiH
Institutions (Article 22),71 Rulebook on Financial Reporting, and relevant instructions issued to budget
users by the MFT. The reports are produced by the MFT after each quarter is completed—that is, for the
first three, six, and nine months of the financial year—and are delivered to the Council of Ministers for
consideration and adoption within 60 days after the close of the financial quarter.

In-year reports produced by MFT include a budget execution report covering revenues and expenditures,
information on debt servicing and stock of debt, and a balance sheet.72 Data in the report are prepared in the same
format as the annual budget—that is, by economic and administrative classifications. These reports are prepared
on a modified accruals basis.73MFT and budget users also produce reports covering both commitments and cash
expenditure.

Dimension rating: A

     (ii) Timeliness of the issue of reports
Year-to-date financial reports can be produced daily by the Treasury system, to which most budget users
have direct access. The full quarterly reports are produced for delivery to the Council of Ministers within
60 days after the end of each quarter.

     (iii) Quality of information
Based on the data presented during the review, in-year reports appear to be complete and comprehensive.
However there are some doubts whether all necessary information is being entered into the system, and
there is a generally acknowledged need to improve financial management and internal controls in budget
user organizations as well as the fact that IPSAs are not yet formally adopted and there are no adequate
accounting policies on the level of the BiH Institutions which may cause that one and the same
accounting issue is being treated differently in different institutions.74 This concern was raised by the
SAI in their annual report for FY 2011, which raises concerns about the quality of financial information
collected across BiH Institutions.

PI-25: Quality and Timeliness of Annual Financial Statements
This indicator considers whether the annual government financial statements are complete, are submitted
for audit without delay, and are prepared in accordance with accounting standards consistent with
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).

     (i) Completeness of the financial statements
The annual Report on the Budget Execution of BiH Institutions and International Obligations contains
full information on BiH Institutions revenue and expenditure, and assets and liabilities, together with
detailed information on external debt financing, which includes detailed information on funds available
for debt servicing, and information on payments made, as well as comparative information on the
execution of the planned repayment budget and a balance of the external indebtness of Bosnia and
Herzegovina at the end of reporting period.

The procedure for ensuring funds for debt servicing is defined in the Law on borrowing, debt and
guarantees of BiH75,Law on indirect taxation system76,Law on payments into a single treasury account
and distribution of revenue77,and Law on financing of BiH institutions.78

Transfer of funds for debt servicing from the single treasury account of the ITA BiH to the accounts and
subaccounts obened in CBBiH is conducted besed on liabiltites repayment plans (previously reconciled
with the Entiies and District Brčko), and in accordance with timeschedule and amonts determined by
MFT.The reports are published on the MFT website.

Dimension rating: A

    (ii) Timeliness of submission of the financial statements
Ministry of Finance and Treasury have to prepare and submit the annual budget execution report to the
Parliament after it has been submitted to the Council of Minsters and BiH presodency, within 180 days
from the end of the fiscal year. The statements are submitted for audit as soon as they are completed, and
the SAI must audit the annual budget execution report within 90 days after receiving it.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Accounting standards used
The statements are prepared in accordance with the Rulebook on Accounting with Accounting Policies
and Procedures for Users of Budget of BiH Institutions and the Rulebook on Financial Reporting of the
BiH Institutions, which are available on the MFT website. These standards are consistently applied, and
are considered by the MFT to be partially in line with IPSAS, although there is a gap between the national
accounting standards and IPSAS accrual. Moreover the SAI notes in its report that the government has
not, decided to apply IPSAS, and it has accordingly qualified its opinion on the consolidated annual
financial statements.

                                                           standards are not fully compliant with IPSAS.

PI-26: Scope, Nature, and Follow-up of External Audit
This indicator looks at the work of the SAI and its contribution to satisfactory public financial
management. Three dimensions are considered: (i) the range and quality of the audit work performed; (ii)
the timeliness of the submission of audit reports to the legislature, particularly the report on the
consolidated annual financial statements; and (iii) the evidence available about audited bodies’ follow-up
of the SAI’s recommendations, and by the SAI’s follow-up in subsequent audits.

    (i) Scope/nature of audit performed
Between 2000 and 2012 the SAIs of the BiH Institutions and the two Entities have benefited from technical
assistance provided by the Swedish SAI (Riksrevisions Verket), initially in the development of financial and
compliance audit, and more recently in the development of performance audit. A Coordination Board made up
of the BiH Institutions and two Entity SAIs has adopted harmonized audit standards and audit manuals, which
                                                                 90

are consistent with the legal obligation to apply the international audit standards issued by the International
Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). Successive annual reports by OECD-SIGMA have
confirmed that the work of all three SAIs meets international professional standards.

The main focus of audit activity has been on financial audit, although some performance auditing has
been undertaken with the participation of the Swedish SAI. More work is needed to ensure that IT
techniques to support appropriate sampling of transactions and identify unusual transactions are
effectively used in the design and execution of audits. With 46 auditors, the BiH Institutions SAI is
relatively well staffed to undertake a complete audit each year of all 70 ministries and other bodies within
its remit. The total audit coverage in FY 2011 amounted 97.3%79/80. The BiH Institutions SAI considers
that there has been a substantial improvement in most auditees’ compliance with applicable rules:
whereas for 2007 there were only 11 unqualified opinions out of 57 audits, for 2011, 61 of the 72 audits
were unqualified. Nevertheless, certain problems persist—infringements of procurement and employment
legislation and the failure to restrain extravagant expenditure on office accommodation, official cars, and
so on.

Dimension rating: B (reflecting the fact that some aspects of the audit work, such as performance
audit, need further development and at times better substantiation/clearer recommendations).

     (ii) Timeliness of submission of audit reports to the legislature
The MFT submits the annual budget execution statements to the SAI by the end of June in accordance
with the main budget law, and the SAI reports to Parliament by the end of September each year. This
timetable has been observed. This was confirmed through corroborative evidence from SAI and MFT.

Dimension rating: A

     (iii) Evidence of follow-up on audit recommendations
The SAI follows up on the extent of implementation of its recommendations, and has established a
register of recommendations that is followed up by the relevant Parliamentary Committees of both
Houses. Reports on individual ministries should include their responses to audit findings and
recommendations. The SAI complains, however, that ministries often ignore its recommendations, even
when they are endorsed by Parliament. Nevertheless, the apparent improvement in the performance of
auditees, with more than 80% of 2011 opinions unqualified, suggests that there is a fair degree of follow-
up in practice.

PI-27:Legislative Scrutiny of the Annual Budget Law
This indicator assesses BiH Parliamentary Assembly review of the budgets of the BiH Institutions for the
2011, 2012, and 2013 fiscal years. Four dimensions are considered: (i) the scope of the Assembly’s work;
(ii) the extent to which the Assembly’s procedures are well established and respected; ( iii) the adequacy
of the time available for the Assembly to review the government’s proposals; and (iv) the rules governing
in-year changes in the budget without any need for approval by the Assembly.

       (i) Scope of the scrutiny by Parliament
Standard procedures have been established that provide for the Budget and Finance Committees 81 to
review the annual budget proposal and report to the full session of the Assembly. In practice there cannot
have been any real scrutiny of the 2011 budget, which was approved after the event in February 2012 on
the basis of 2011 actual expenditure, or of the 2012 budget, which was approved in May 2012. For 2013 a
more common procedure was followed, with shorter delays in submission of the budget to Parliament, but
the time constraints were such that there was little scope for scrutiny at any stage—Parliament adopted
the budget one week after it was submitted, using urgent procedures. Although the Global Fiscal
Framework and the MTEFs set the macroeconomic and fiscal policy, and the main outlines of the
eventual budget proposals are available to the Assembly, there is no provision in the Rules of Procedure
for the Assembly to discuss them and propose changes. Furthermore, there are no technical offices with
experts specialized in budget that could assist Parliament in budget analyses.

Dimension rating: D

       (ii) Extent to which the legislature's procedures are well established and respected
The budget review processes are established by the Law on Financing of the BiH Institutions. The BiH
Presidency is required to submit a proposed budget to the Parliamentary Assembly by November 1 each
year, and the Parliamentary Assembly is expected to discuss the proposed budget and adopt the annual
budget law by December 31. The degree of compliance with this timetable for the three most recent
budgets is shown in Table 4.1.39.

       (iii) Adequacy of time for the legislature to provide a response to budget proposals—both the
       detailed estimates and, where applicable, proposals on macro-fiscal aggregates earlier in the
       budget preparation cycle (time allowed in practice for all stages combined)
As already noted, neither the Global Fiscal Balance and Policy Framework nor the MTEF, which together
provide the background to the preparation of the detailed budget proposals, is submitted to the Parliamentary
Assembly for approval. MTEFs are supposed to be published on the website after adoption by the Council of
Ministers by July 15, while Global Framework is not published, although there are efforts underway to make
this document publically available

The law provides two months for the discussion of the budget proposal, which includes detailed budget
estimates.

There are neither specific Rules of Procedure nor a timetable for Parliamentary scrutiny of the annual
budget law for either the House of Representatives or House of Peoples beyond the standard Rules of
Procedure that apply to any legislative act considered by the BiH Parliamentary Assembly.82

However, as noted above, the amount of time available for consideration of the detailed budget estimates
has been in practice substantially less than the law requires. Neither the 2011 nor the 2012 budgets
allowed time for proper consideration by the Parliamentary Assembly. Furthermore, the budget is usually
adopted using urgent procedures.

       (iv) Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the legislature
Article 16 of the Law on Financing of BiH Institutions provides for budget allocations within the
approved budget to be amended without ex-ante approval by the Parliamentary Assembly. Under the law,
the MFT may restructure the expenditures within the total amount approved for a budget user in the
budget upon a written request from that budget user. Annual budget laws specify whether there are limits
to restructuring. In addition, within the overall budget, reallocation of funds is exceptionally allowed
among budget users; if transfer of authority occurs, a recommendation from MFT is required, followed by
the approval of the Council of Ministers,

PI-28:Legislative Scrutiny of External Audit Reports
The reports of the Audit Office cover the entire general government, as well as public entities that are
owned by the government or whose debts are guaranteed by it, and entities that receive government grants
and foreign-financed projects. This indicator looks at the legislature’s role in examining the Audit
Office’s reports on the management of public finance and in monitoring the implementation of
recommendations made by the Auditor General. Three dimensions are considered: (i) whether the
Parliamentary Assembly responds quickly to audit reports; (ii) whether the Assembly’s procedures
include in-depth hearings on key findings with representatives of auditees; and (iii) whether the Assembly
recommends corrective actions that are implemented by the government.

       (i) Timeliness of examination of audit reports by the legislature (for reports received within the last
       three years)
The Law on Audit of BiH Institutions (Article 16)83 specifies the dates for the submission and adoption of the
Audit Office reports on the financial statements of the BiH Institutions. Moreover, in July 2008 the Budget and
Finance Committees of the two houses of the Parliamentary Assembly adopted Instructions on Review and
Analysis of Audit Reports, developed as part of DFID-funded technical assistance. The implementation of the
new instructions started in September 2008 and has continued to date. The instructions set out a four-step
review process; each step takes two to four weeks to complete.

    (iii) Issuance of recommended actions by the legislature and implementation by the executive
The Audit Reports present the Auditor General’s recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the
government. Parliament usually adopts these reports without amendment.

The Audit Office stated that the Assembly does not generally follow up or impose any sanctions on
budget uses that fail to implement recommendations, even when the same recommendations are made
year after year. In previous years, the Assembly has attempted to sanction budget users by reducing
budget allocations for certain “non-discretionary” line item expenditures, including travel and telephones.
However, the Audit Office indicated that these sanctions have been only partially effective.

Budget users are required to report to Parliament on actions taken to implement recommendations.
Feedback suggests, however, that the extent of compliance with the recommendations is limited. The
Audit Office noted that the Assembly takes almost no steps to sanction ministers who ignore legal
obligations and audit reports.

         IV. ASSESSMENT OF PFM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, AND INSTITUTIONS

                                        FEDERATION OF BIH
             Executive Summary – Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina
For the purposes of applying the PEFA performance indicators, data and information from FY 2009 –
2011 were used in the calculations and for scoring the indicators, with more current information used for
some indicators where such information was available.

I. Integrated Assessment of PFM Performance
A. PFM Out-Turns: Credibility of the Budget
According to the PEFA methodology the performance indicators are prepared for the central government
level, which in the case of FBiH excludes spending at the level of cantons, which are responsible for the
provision of most of the main public services, including health protection, education, culture, and social
protection and local self-governance units. Aggregate expenditure out-turn to original approved budgets
for the three fiscal years covered in the Report (2009 to 2011) performed well with the divergence
between budget and out-turn being less than 5% in all three years. More significant variance in the
percentage of variance in out-turn composition (budget line by budget line) is observed: in all three years
the sum of variances was greater than 5% of the original approved budget. Total FBiH central
government revenue out-turns, including EBFs but performed well in line with the originally approved
budget.

There was no legal definition of what constitutes arrears as of end 2013 in FBiH i.e. no established legal
period after which an unpaid invoiced obligation are in arrears, and in addition no payment due date was
entered from the invoices into the treasury system until the end 2013. As of the end 2013, the payment
due data have started to be recorded in the Treasuries. Although the data on arrears are not exact, there are
indications that FBiH arrears are increasing.

B. Key Cross-Cutting Issues: Comprehensiveness and Transparency
The current budget classification requires functional reporting from all general government levels in
FBiH (in 14 main categories, as opposed to 10 main COFOG groups). However, in practice, reporting by
function (only for the budget out-turns) is based on a broad approximation, with likely errors, especially
at the lower government levels. The government maintains a Treasury system through which all
transactions are recorded, and which provides for consistent reporting by administrative and economic
classifications. The FBiH MoF consolidates data, but the data reported by lower government levels are
not always complete or of good quality.

There are significant gaps in the information included in the budget documents submitted to Parliament,
which excludes information on (i) macroeconomic outlook, (ii) financial assets, including details at least
for the beginning of the current year, (iii) the prior year’s budget out -turn is not being presented in the
same format as the budget proposals. Data for the current but not previous year are available in the budget
documents and the budget documentation does not contain projected potential effects of new policies.

Annual budget estimates, in year execution reports and year-end financial statements should cover all
extra budgetary operations of the government. The disclosure of significant pension, health and
employment could be improved. The Funds 2013 financial plans were not submitted to FBiH Parliament
until March 2013; in 2012 the Pension and Health budget proposals were submitted on time but Health
institutions budgets were not subject to the same disclosure requirements. The financial statements of
                                                     97

each Fund are audited by the SAI and separate information on out-turn is available but is not presented in
the context of the budget.

The flow of information between the central government and cantons, and in turn between the cantons
and local self-governance is weak both for revenue projections/distribution and the amounts and precise
timing of debt service payments. Delays in deciding what portion of the indirect taxation revenues FBiH
will receive hinder the reliability of revenue forecasting and hamper the budget planning process.

Public enterprises are significant however FBiH has no consolidated overview of the large PE sector, nor is
there a body within government to assess what should be expected for these enterprises in terms of financial
performance, or to ensure that they pay the correct amounts of taxes and dividends. According to data from the
FBiH tax authority a significant proportion of tax arrears are attributable to PEs.

In the FBiH the public has reasonably good access to key fiscal information however the 2011 budget
execution report was subject to delays in publication and the public lacks information on the resources
provided to key primary service delivery units.

C(i). Policy-Based Budgeting
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget of the FBiH government are set out in the Law on
Budgets in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Delays in the approval of the Global Fiscal
Balance and Policy Framework in BiH can hinder the timely preparation of FBiH macroeconomic
indicators and fiscal forecasts; and further delays are often experienced with the submission of final
budget requests from budget users. Since 2010, only the 2013 budget was enacted before the
commencement of the budget year. Clear budget instructions and guidelines are issued.

Detailed three year fiscal projections for the FBiH Government level are produced as part of the FBiH
MTEF, including forward estimates of expenditure for each budget user. Recent MTEFs include only the
expenditure of the FBiH government and discussion on revenue projections for all levels; not
comprehensive of the revenues of the cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs. There is no
evidence that the forward estimates are used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget
ceilings. Since the estimates do not roll forward, the MoF effectively restarts the budget and forward
estimates for each budget cycle. The budget and forward estimates in the MTEF are prepared by
administrative, economic, and functional classifications. However, the annual budget proposals are
presented with economic and administrative classifications; and they do not include forward year
estimates.

FBiH does not perform a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis which is linked to a specific
government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing policies and debt requirements

A Draft Development Strategy for BiH was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the
Council of Ministers of BiH and adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the
Council of Ministers or RS government. Individual ministries do prepare strategic plans; however no costed
sector strategies are formally developed for the FBiH. Strategic planning in FBiH is further complicated by
fragmented jurisdictions among the central government and cantons. There is a lack of strategic direction
from a sectoral perspective that would cut across all government levels in FBiH to ensure proper and
effective implementation.

Investment outlays are planned separately from current expenditures in FBiH, and there is no consolidated
strategic plan across the Federation to which the Public Investment Programme (PIP) can be related. Despite
these shortcomings, forward projections of the costs and benefits of individual investment projects do include
the subsequent maintenance costs of new investments. The MTEF reflects approved and funded projects
                                                     98

within the PIP and the use of multiyear estimates enables the MTEF to reflect the future recurrent costs of
completed capital investment projects.

C(ii). Predictability and Control in Budget Execution
The legislative framework for major taxes includes domestic tax laws, international treaties on avoidance
of double taxation, and the laws governing administrative procedures. While the legislative framework for
major taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, some important aspects of tax application are not
clearly and consistently reflected in the legislation and interpreted in practice. This mainly relates to the
implementation of important provisions of double taxation treaties (e.g., tax residence, withholding tax
exemptions), and to transfer pricing. Consequently, tax inspectors tend to apply a fair amount of
discretionary powers in determining tax liabilities in these areas.

Taxpayers have web access to information regarding their tax obligations, explanatory notices, and
administrative procedures, and they have electronic access to their tax records. Official binding
interpretations about tax applicability can be requested individually, and they are issued within deadlines
prescribed by the relevant legislation. The tax appeals system has been established and is functional.
However decisions are often not issued within prescribed timeframe. The areas for improvement include
transparency, capacity in the appeal bodies and improvement of timeliness.

There are penalties for noncompliance with registration and declaration obligations, but the penalties may
not always be an effective deterrent. There are annual tax audit plans as well as a continuous program of
tax audits and fraud investigations. There is no reliable data on tax arrears for the last two fiscal years.

Cash flow forecasts are closely monitored at a central level in FBiH. The FMF approves monthly
operational plans for budget users (thus “releasing” funds on the monthly basis), based on plans submitted by
MDAs and reconciling them with cash forecasts. When cash flow problems occur (as was the case
recently due to delay in receiving foreign budget support for example), there are procedures prescribed in
legislation (Law on Budgets) to deal with these. However there have been recent instances of cash flow
problems which have resulted in cash rationing and MDAs being unable to predict the cash which is
available in order to meet future commitments.

Debt management in FBiH is coordinated with the cantons through a standing commission that reports to
the FBiH MoF. Cantons are permitted to borrow domestically without the consent of FBiH MoF, as long
as the borrowings do not require a guarantee. Cantons and PEs have not undertaken any direct external
borrowing, preferring instead that the FBiH central government should borrow and on-lend to them. Debt
reporting is reasonably comprehensive with minor gaps in information from municipalities and cities.

All transactions that are part of the central government budget go through the Single Treasury Account
(STA), which holds all cash balances. However, some EBFs remain outside the STA. There is no direct
link between the central STA and those in the cantons which only provide periodic manual reports to the
FBiH MoF.

All central government borrowing, all external borrowing for on-lending to cantons and PEs and all issues
of guarantees are controlled By FMoF however the objectives for debt are not linked to medium-term
fiscal targets and there is no formal debt management strategy that would steer debt management
decisions.

The legal framework for procurement is clear and readily accessible to the public. Open competition is
the default method. The publication of tender notices and contract awards is transparent, with information
publicly available via the PPA’s website. However, there is no public access to procurement plans or to
results of recent complaints.
                                                      99

Since there is widespread criticism by auditors, and frequent complaints by tenderers are upheld by the Public
Procurement Review Board (PRB), it is clear that the exceptions to open procedures are not properly justified
in many cases. Information is limited to bidding opportunities in the form of procurement plans (though
these plans are not usually published) and contract awards. No information is available on results of
complaints in spite of legal requirements. Although the PRB has managed to issue many decisions, it
lacks sufficient human resources to fulfil all its functions quickly and efficiently.

The Civil Service Agency (CSA) maintains a complete record of all employees at the FBiH Government
level and the FBiH MoF makes changes to payroll records only when authorized by CSA. Appointments
and promotions can only take effect once all necessary procedures have been completed. This is normally
done within a month of the decision by the employing authority, thereby avoiding any need for retroactive
adjustments. Appointments and promotions are adequately controlled by the requirement to have these
actions authorized by the CSA. Internal and external audits of payroll are undertaken on a regular basis.

Commitment control over non-salary expenditure is in place but not yet completely reliable. The FBiH
SAI has identified many breaches of the rules, but few preventative measures have been taken to avoid
reoccurrence. The need to strengthen the rules and procedures is generally recognized, and necessary
regulations have been prepared, but no action has been taken to bring them into force. The rules for
processing and recording transactions in the Treasury work well and are generally complied with and the
STA works satisfactorily. However, the SAI notes control weaknesses in processing of transactions at the
level of the spending units.

In the FBiH, coverage of internal audit in the central government and cantons remains uneven. Ten units
are in operation in the central government, including units in the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture,
and there are also units in the Sarajevo and Tuzla Cantons. The legislative basis for the general
introduction of internal audit is in place, and the necessary regulations and operating instructions have
been prepared by the Coordinating Board made up of the Central Harmonization Units (CHUs) of the BiH
Institutions and the Entities, although they are not yet formally approved in FBiH.

However, in 2013, on the basis of a public tender published, two employees were hired (one economist and
one lawyer), which facilitated more intensive operations of the CHU. The status as of the end of 2013,
relating to the establishment of internal audit units, was as follows: of the 18 ministries meeting the criteria
for establishing an internal audit unit, 10 have internal audit established, and out of 30 labor positions
systematized, 15 internal auditors are working; of the 18 institutes meeting the criteria for establishing an
internal audit unit, 7 have internal audit established, and, according to the data provided to the PEFA team,
12 labor positions are systematized, and 14 internal auditors are working; in the 30 municipalities meeting
the criteria for establishing an internal audit unit, 9 have internal audit established, but out of 10 labor
positions systematized, 6 internal auditors are working; out of 10 cantons meeting the criteria for
establishing an internal audit unit, 6 have internal audit established, and out of 30 labor positions
systematized, 15 internal auditors are working. Further on, in 2013, upon a proposal of the FMF CHU. FMF
adopted and published bylaws creating additional preconditions for the development of internal audit in the
public sector in FBiH.

C(iii). Accounting, Recording and Reporting
In-year quarterly budget reports are produced by the FBiH MoF in the same format as the annual budget
(by economic and administrative classifications) and they present expenditures at both commitment and
payment stages.

The annual financial statements include full information on revenue and expenditure, and also financial
assets and liabilities; however the statements cover only central government ministries. The revenue and
expenditure of the Federation-wide Pension Fund, the Solidarity Health Fund, and the public entities for
roads, which together account for about twice the expenditure of the central government, are excluded.
                                                     100


The central government’s annual financial statements have been submitted for audit within three months
of the year end. The statements are prepared in accordance with the Directive on Budget Accounting and
the Rulebook on Budget Bookkeeping in FBiH. FBiH SAI qualifies its opinion on the consolidated
annual financial statements on the grounds that the statements do not meet the requirements of IPSAS.
The omission of the EBFs from the consolidated statements, although consistent with FBiH legislation, is
so critical that the local standards used cannot be regarded as corresponding to IPSAS.

C(iv). External Audit and Scrutiny
There is a comprehensive range of audit work conducted by the FBiH SAI which meets professional
standards (2011: over 90% of expenditure was audited). In addition to auditing the budget execution
statement of the FBiH central government, the SAI covers the consolidated budgets of each of the 10
cantons, the FBiH Pension Fund, and 22 different health and employment funds. Only a few of the 78
municipalities can be audited each year, and only those Federation-wide SOEs (including companies in
the ownership of municipalities and cities) with the largest financial turnover (railway, post office, gas).
The FBiH SAI has the mandate to audit cantonal and SOEs owned by local governments. Even at the
central FBiH level, not all budget users (ministries, agencies) are audited each year. Reports on the central
government financial statements are sent to Parliament within 3 months after the SAI receives the
statements. Despite the efforts of the SAI and the Parliament, audit recommendations are often ignored.

Both the FBiH MTEF, which includes the government’s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts, and the
annual budget proposal are formally submitted to the FBiH Parliament. Standard parliamentary
procedures provide for the relevant committees of both houses of Parliament to review the annual budget
proposal and report to the full session of Parliament. In practice there is limited scrutiny by the
committees, which have no professional staff to support their work.

Under the Law on Budgets of the FBiH, the government is required to submit a proposed budget to the
Parliamentary Assembly by November 5 each year. In practice, the budget has generally been submitted much
later than the law requires. While the established procedures should enable the Parliament to question the
government on all aspects of its proposals, in practice Parliament is inadequately equipped to do this
effectively, so that changes to budget proposals in response to Parliamentary discussions have been very small.

The SAI Audit Reports present recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the government.
Parliament usually adopts these reports without amendment. The SAI and budget users are required to
report to Parliament on actions taken to implement recommendations. The SAI publishes its
recommendations, and its assessment of the responses received. According to this analysis many
recommendations have repeatedly been ignored. Parliament does not generally follow up or impose any
sanctions on budget users that fail to implement audit recommendations.

II. Assessment of the impact of PFM weaknesses

1.   Aggregate Fiscal Discipline

While technical aspects of the budget preparation process are reasonably well organized this is
undermined by the complex context which results in frequent delays in budget adoption. Despite this the
aggregate revenues and expenditures outturns performed in line with the original approved budgets
(however it should be noted however that the PEFA methodology addresses only central government and
does not address spending at the level of cantons, which are responsibility for the provision of the main
public services). Delays in decision over the proportion of FBiH indirect taxation revenues hinder the
reliability of revenue forecasts and hamper the budget planning process. PEs are significant and there is
evidence they continue significantly to tax arrears; however there is no consolidated overview of fiscal
risk or monitoring of their financial performance.

2. Strategic Allocation of Resources

The MoF provides reasonably reliable information on the availability of funds, however there have been
some instances of unpredicted cash rationing which have resulted in MDAs being unable to predict the
cash available in order to predict future commitments. The existing budget process does not have a strong
policy or strategic focus. Individual ministries do prepare strategic plans; however no costed sector
strategies are formally developed for the FBiH. Strategic planning in FBiH is further complicated by
fragmented jurisdictions among the central government and cantons. There is a lack of strategic direction
from a sectoral perspective that would cut across all government levels in FBiH to ensure proper and
effective implementation. Investment outlays are planned separately from current expenditures and there
is no consolidated strategic plan to which the PIP can be related. Limited time available in order to
scrutinize the budget in parliament may reduce the pressure on government to allocate and execute the
budget in line with its stated policies.

 3. Efficient Service Delivery

Weaknesses in the budget process do not allow sufficient discussion on the effective use of resources. The
expenditure commitment controls over non-salary expenditure are effective and the payments system
works in an orderly manner; however audit reports confirm the need to ensure the operation of stronger
rules and procedures particularly at the level of spending units. Internal audit as a function is in its
infancy and audit coverage needs to improve as does the response of management to audit
recommendations. Open competition is the default procurement method, but in practice the non-
observance of competitive tendering processes may create the opportunity for inefficient procurement,
corruption and leakages. The work of external audit has reasonable coverage however follow up by
management is weak. The parliament does little work in the way of following up audit report
recommendations, and holding the executive to account.


III. Prospects for PFM Reforms

A new Law on Budgets was adopted in December 2013, which strengthens the overall budget preparation
process in FBiH, explains the budget calendar in greater detail, and increases the ability to enforce
spending limits on lower levels of government, EBFs, and PEs.84 The Law includes a fiscal rule stating
that the planned current budget must be balanced, and if a current deficit is executed, the government
must plan for a current surplus in the next three years.

84
  This is one of the structural benchmarks for FBiH within the SBA with the IMF (IMF December 2012, Bosnia and
Herzegovina: First Review Under the SBA and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of a Performance Criterion —Staff Report;
Press Release; and Statement by the Executive Director).
                                                     103

In addition, new amendments to the Law on Distribution of Revenues in FBiH, which are also in
parliamentary adoption procedures, envisage a decrease of the cantons’ share and an increase in the local
self-governance units’ share in personal income tax, and also simplify the revenue sharing in Canton
Sarajevo. It is also envisaged that, after the data on population census are processed (the BiH Census is
scheduled for October 2013), all of the revenue distribution formulas in this law will be revisited.

The MoF of the FBiH understands the need to adopt a Debt Management Strategy, and that reforms in
this area are planned for the future, as an integral part of the process of improving debt management,
which is implemented in cooperation with the World Bank team, as well as within the IPA project. The
preparation of the full debt sustainability analysis for the debt of FBiH is being planned as an integral part
of the process of improvement of debt management.

In February 2014 the Fiscal Council of BiH adopted a definition of an arrears based on any amount that is
not paid within a maximum of 90 days, and similar approach will be taken by the Entitles. In practice
FBiH may choose to use a shorter period of time, as per the draft legislation available.

It is planned to introduce functional classification according to COFOG, that shall require the
development of a clear and detailed methodology for allocation of expenditure by functions, Finally FBiH
plans to increase staff and overall capacity of the CHU as well as internal audit units where these are
considered necessary.
                                                             104

            Assessment of PFM Systems, Processes and Institutions – FBiH
PI-1: Aggregate Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the difference between the actual and the originally budgeted primary expenditure
for the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) for the last three fiscal years
(2009-2011). Interest payments and externally funded project expenditure are excluded because they are
outside the immediate control of the government. The closer the out-turn to the original budget, the higher
the rating.

The data analyzed85exclude the spending of cantons (which are responsible for the provision of most of
the main public services, including health protection, education, culture, and social protection) and local
self-governance units; together these account for about one-third of total general government expenditure
in FBiH. However, they include extra-budgetary funds (EBFs) attached to the central government—the
Solidarity Health Fund, which provides for advanced medical treatments throughout the Federation; the
Federation-wide Pension Fund; and the FBiH Employment Fund—and the government-owned company
responsible for the maintenance of the Federation’s main roads, Javno Preduzece Ceste FBiH. The EBFs
are financed from compulsory social contributions and from transfers from the FBiH government and the
road maintenance company are financed from a share of indirect tax revenue.The expenditure of the
central government consists mainly of wages and salaries for those engaged in administrative tasks, and
subsidies and social transfer payments to individuals.

The consolidation has been done by the review team, on the basis of information provided by FBiH
Ministry of Finance (MoF), for both budget and out-turn stages; although the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBiH) annually provides a careful consolidation of the expenditure out-turn using GFS
methodology, no consolidation has been done at the budgeting stage. Neither FBiH MoF nor CBBiH has
yet sought to consolidate general government expenditure including the cantons (and their EBFs) at the
budgeting stage, and the PEFA team could only have done this by visiting every canton to collect the
necessary information. Although the review team considers that the figures used are not significantly
misleading, it is possible that some elements of double-counting may be included in the totals for the
central government and EBFs.

PI-2: Composition of Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the extent to which the composition of the budget changes from that originally
planned by the MoF and agreed by Parliament. The PEFA Secretariat has set out a formula for calculating
the variance between the out-turn and the approved budget estimates. Each budget line is adjusted by the
overall variance between budget and out-turn as calculated in PI-1, and the differences between actual
expenditure on each budget line and the adjusted budget amounts are summed to give the overall variance.
This overall variance is then shown as a percentage of actual expenditure. The second dimension of the
indicator looks at the amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve; the larger the amount
charged to the reserve rather than reallocated to specific budget lines, the less transparent the budget. The
tables containing calculations for the FBiH government are set out in Annex 3 of this report.

     (i) Additional variance of expenditure over and above that resulting from PI-1
The formula measures the additional variance over and above the overall variance calculated in PI-1
resulting from resources being reallocated from one area to another during budget execution. A good
score is achieved if there are no significant reallocations from one functional area to another. There can be
a good score on this indicator even if there is a substantial overall difference between the budget estimates
and out-turn (cf. PI-1), provided that the proportionate changes are similar on each budget head. In
accordance with the PEFA criteria, the indicator was assessed on the basis of the largest 20 budget heads
(treating the EBFs and the road maintenance company as budget heads). The expenditure taken into
consideration is the same as that used for PI-1.

Although the FBiH government kept aggregate expenditure close to the originally budgeted amounts, there
were some significant reallocations of expenditure, with the expenditure of the EBFs also diverging from initial
expectations. Because the relative variances of the EBFs have been smaller than those of the FBiH government
narrowly defined, and the expenditure of the EBFs is about twice as large as that of central government
ministries, the percentage variances are smaller when the EBFs are included in the expenditure considered for
this indicator. The aggregate figures are shown in Table 4.2.3; the detailed calculations, with the adjustments to
all the main budget lines, are shown in Annex 3. If the rating were based on the central government only, it
would be D, since the variance exceeded 15% in two of the three years; note that most of the variance at the
federal government level, especially in 2009, was due to adjustments agreed under the SBA with the IMF
(SBA). The inclusion of the EBFs reduces the overall variance to less than 10% in each of the three years,
resulting in the rating B.

     (ii) Amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve
FBiH includes a contingency reserve in its budget. However, the reserve is capped at 3% of the revenues,
excluding financing. 86 The contingency reserve was planned for BAM 29.05 million (1.82% of planned

planned revenues) in 2011.Budget Reserve is used for urgent and unpredicted budget expenditure which
occur during budget execution phase. It needs to be noted that (due to accounting rules), while the budget
reserve is planned in the budget as a lump sum on a separate budget line (since the planned reserve is
general, there are no specific type of spending it is devoted for in the budget plan), budget execution
reports shows spending from this budget line at the appropriate budget line according to purpose of actual
expenditure (e.g. social transfers). However, the budget execution reports give overeview of the usage of
budget reserve in detail87.For example, in 2010, budget plan for reserve was 36.6. million BAM, while
budget executions shows 31.9 million BAM.

PI-3: Aggregate Revenue Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator compares actual total domestic revenue to the originally budgeted domestic revenue.
Countrywide indirect taxation administered by BiH institution is shared among the four main government
levels—BiH Institutions, FBiH, Republika Srpska (RS), and Brčko District(DB)—while all other taxation
and non-tax revenues are under the exclusive jurisdiction of each level separately.

Table 4.2.5 shows FBiH consolidated revenue and revenues by the general government sector level.
Indirect taxation is the most important revenue source, comprising 41% of total FBiH consolidated
revenues, followed by social contributions, which account for 40% of consolidated FBiH revenues. Direct
taxation revenue makes up only 7% of consolidated FBiH revenue. In terms of the FBiH government
budget, indirect taxation revenues account for83% of total revenue.

Source: Central Bank of BiH. Includes total expenses and transactions in nonfinancial assets. Excludes foreign-financed
projects, which do not go through budgets. Foreign debt servicing of FBiH is not presented here (it is represented at the State
level since foreign debt servicing for both Entities and DB goes through BiH Institutions budget; data shown in Chapter 2).


The overall system for distributing indirect taxation revenues among the four main levels in BiH is
explained in detail in Chapter 2 (and under this same indicator for BiH Institutions). In summary, once the
share of BiH Institutions is deducted from total revenues, DB receives a fixed 3.55% of the remaining
funds or BAM 124 million, at the minimum, and the rest of the funds are divided between the two Entities
on the basis of data on the final consumption location identified in tax forms. The coefficients for
distributing revenues between the Entities are variable; they are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in
final consumption and are formally adopted by the Governing Board of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA).
As of August 2013, the coefficient for the FBiH is 63.93% and that for RS is 32.52%. Periodic
reconciliation is also envisaged when changes of coefficients occur. Out of each Entity’s share, foreign
debt servicing is first deducted and the remaining funds are then shared among the general government
sector levels. Of the indirect taxation funds remaining to FBiH after foreign debt servicing is deducted,
36.2% belongs to the FBiH government, 51.48% to cantons (based on population, area, number of
students, and development level), 8.42% to local self-governance units (also based on population, area,
number of students, and development level), and 3.9% to public entities for roads.

In practice, in the past five years, there have been political problems/delays in the decision on the amount
BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation revenues, as well as disputes on the final consumption
data and consequent delays on decisions on the formula for sharing indirect taxation revenues between the
two Entities.

For direct taxes, which are under the sole jurisdiction of the Entities and DB, the structure and rates of
personal and company income tax and social contributions are set at the central level in FBiH, but the
bulk of the revenue accrues to the cantons and municipalities and to the different EBFs.

In both Entities and in DB, the revenue of EBFs includes social contributions relevant to the specific fund
and transfers from the central governments for some funds; public entities for roads receive part of the
indirect taxation revenues and road fees. A further complication in FBiH is that although there is a single
Pension Fund, each canton has its own Health Fund financed by the health contributions collected
alongside income tax on its territory; 9% of health contributions are paid to an Entity wide fund (the
Solidarity Health Fund), which provides specialized treatments and more sophisticated high-cost drugs.
Each canton also has its own Unemployment Fund.

The Macroeconomic Analysis Unit (MAU) of the ITA is responsible for preparing forecasts of indirect
taxes, taking into account macroeconomic projections prepared by the Department for Economic Planning
under the Fiscal Council. These revenue projections are used by the Fiscal Council, Ministry of Finance
and Treasury (MFT) of the BiH Institutions, the Entities’ Ministries of Finance (MoFs), and the DB
Finance Directorate during the budget preparation process. However, the amounts entered into the budget
of each government in respect of indirect tax revenue are the responsibility of that government.
                                                     108

Forecasting of revenue from direct taxes and other Entity revenues is the responsibility of the respective
MoFs; so in FBiH, the MoF is responsible for projections,

       (i) Actual domestic revenue compared to domestic revenue in the originally approved budget
Consolidated revenue data are available for the consolidated FBiH (and entire country) 88 as well as
individual levels of government. It was not possible to use these data for performing indicator calculations
because they are available for out-turns and not for plans. Because of this the ratings for this indicator are
based on the data received directly from the MoF. In FBiH it was not possible to make the assessment on
a completely consolidated presentation of revenues because the data were incomplete. Accordingly, the
rating for this indicator has been assessed for the FBiH central government alone and for the central
government plus EBFs (cumulative rather than consolidated).

Revenue budget forecasts and actual out-turns for FBiH are shown in Tables 4.2.6.

The most important elements of revenue are indirect taxes and social contributions, which predominate in
any calculations in which they are included. If all revenues are taken into consideration, the out-turn,
including the Funds, is close to budget in two of the three years.

PI-4: Stock and Monitoring of Expenditure Payment Arrears
This indicator examines whether there are significant expenditure arrears, and whether there is a system
that enables expenditure arrears to be effectively monitored.

In FBiH at the moment of this assessment there is no legal definition of what constitutes arrears; no legal
period has been established (e.g., 45 days) after which an unpaid invoiced obligation is considered to be
in arrears; and within current Treasuries no payment due date was entered from the invoices until end
2013. Under the SBA, the authorities were obliged to establish, before October 2013, a common
definition of spending arrears by the BiH Institutions and Entity governments (with any amount that is not
paid within 90 days after the due date considered to be in arrears) and, from July 2013, procedures for
budget users to enter all due dates of invoices into the Treasury. These deadlines were not met. As of end
2013, the payment due data have started to be recorded in the Treasuries at the BiH Institutions and Entity
Government level (however, the complete 2013 reports on arrears have not been ready in time to be
included in this Report), while the deadline for establishing definition of arrears is now extended to early
2014 (working version is that the period of 90 days will be used). In February 2014 the Fiscal Council of
BiH adopted a definition of an arrear reading as follows: any obligation that is recorded in the treasury
application in the AP module - liabilities to suppliers, and that has not been paid within the timelines for
accrual defined by Law, and within the deadline of 90 days at the longest from the date of accrual. On the
basis of the common definition, each of the levels of governance shall adjust their legal frameworks (for
example, FBiH has prepared Draft Law on Financial Operations which prescribes that contracted payment
deadline can be up to 60 days).

    (i) Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears
In FBiH, any consideration of arrears has to take into account not only arrears of central government
payments, but also those incurred by cantons and EBFs. On April 1, 2013, the FBiH central government
had balances of BAM 1.7 million, but outstanding obligations from 2012 amounting to BAM 50 million.
Meanwhile, according to MoF information, that the FBiH government has been borrowing temporarily
from the FBIH Roads Fund Company to meet current obligations. All FBiH government bodies also owe
undefined outstanding obligations as a result of litigation concerning public service pay and allowances;
the courts have held that collective agreements take precedence over subsequent legislation enacted to
reduce public service pay and to simplify and reduce various allowances paid in addition to salaries. In
addition to the central government arrears, furthermore, according to information provided by the FBiH
Solidarity Health Fund, the Fund is incurring an increasing amount of arrears as demands for specialist
medical services increase and payments from the FBiH government budget (i.e., over and above the 9%
of health contributions throughout FBiH that accrue to this Fund) exceed the resources available. Some
payments from this Fund have been outstanding for more than two years.
                                                            111


MoF estimated the amount currently outstanding as of end 2013 at approximately BAM 80 million, but
the situation in the cantons appears to be even worse than that at the central government level. Sarajevo
and Tuzla Cantons (the two largest in the country) have been falling behind in payments to government
employees, although these have priority over the majority of payments for goods and services. There have
also been delays in Sarajevo Canton in the payment of benefits in respect of children and other vulnerable
groups. In previous years the FBiH government issued several decrees to pay the previous year’s
obligations.89

The only data currently available are for liabilities (difference between accrual and paid, not all of which
is necessarily in arrears), which, as of 2012, the MoF reports on (see Table 4.2.9). It should be noted that
data for 2010 and 2011 are not comparable to                     Table 4.2.9. Liabilities by EBFs and
2012 data, because of data collection differences.                  the FBiH Central Government

When cantons and local self-governance units are also included, total liabilities at the end of 2012 were
BAM 1.14 billion, or about 20% of total general government expenditure in FBiH. Again, these are not
all arrears. However, even though the data on arrears are not exact, there are indications that FBiH arrears
are increasing. Given that reliable data on arrears in line with legal definition is not yet available (it is
expected that first data will be available in spring 2014 for 2013), insufficient information is available to
score this dimension or indicator.

PI-5: Classification of the Budget
The PEFA criteria look for arrangements that make it possible to compare budget and out-turn for the
same year, and also provide for consistent comparisons from one year to the next, according to
administrative, functional, and economic classifications. Ideally the 10main functions listed in the United
Nations Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) should be broken down into sub

89
  For example: Official Gazette of the FBiH, number 81/09 – payment of BAM 26,583,790.69 for disability pensions, BAM
618,362.24 for the implementation of the Law on special rights of the nominees of the war awards and BAM 6,501,093.07 for
cantonal agencies for payments to demobilized soldiers.
                                                               112


functions (e.g., different levels of education) or programs. This objective is facilitated by recording all
transactions in accordance with a chart of accounts (CoA) that captures sufficient information about each
transaction to enable reports according to each of the classifications.

Although there has been some progress, Public Finance Statistics (PFS) still remain fragmented and
incoherent across the different jurisdictions in BiH—a situation that most observers regard as a significant
impediment to proper governance. The EU has paid a special attention to the issue; it has been providing
technical assistance in this area since June 2012,90 but progress has not yet been evaluated.

With technical assistance from the IMF, in January 2011 the FBiH government adopted some minor
adjustments to its CoA to better track intergovernmental transfers. This CoA is applicable to other
government levels in FBiH. The PEFA team was informed that FBiH intends to change its accounting
standards to be better aligned with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); but this
is not expected to be achieved in the short-term, especially in terms of accrual accounting, given the
valuation problems associated with fixed assets. Also there is a plan to formally require reports to be
produced according to COFOG. Current reporting templates in FBiH91already require functional reporting
from all general government levels in FBiH (in 14 main categories, as opposed to 10 main COFOG
groups); however, in practice, reporting by function is based on a broad approximation, with likely errors,
especially at the lower government levels.

The FBiH government presents its budget showing the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each
administrative unit. The government maintains a Treasury system through which all transactions are
recorded, and which provides for consistent reporting by administrative and economic classifications. The
Treasury systems have been much improved since 2000, and the CoA is applicable to the entire
Federation. The MoF consolidates data, but the data reported by lower government levels are not always
of good quality; this partially reflects difficulties in adapting their accounting systems to meet the full
requirements of the new CoA, with reporting currently dependent on manual consolidation procedures. In
practice, the data consolidated by the MoF are essentially not used for any policy decision-making, nor
are they reported to Parliament. None of the FBiH-level budgets is presented by functional classification.

PI-7: Extent of Unreported Government Operations
Annual budget estimates, in-year execution reports, and year-end financial statements should cover all
budgetary and extra-budgetary operations of the government. This indicator evaluates the extent to which
operations under government control, including those of extra-budgetary funds, are not reported at both
estimate and out-turn stages. It also looks at the extent to which donor-funded projects are included in
fiscal reports.

     (i) The level of extra-budgetary expenditure that is not included in fiscal reports
Social contributions represent about 40% of general government revenue in FBiH. The total contribution
rate (employers’ and employees’ contributions combined) of 60% on the net wages paid to an employee
that is paid to the Pension, Health, and Employment Funds provides individuals a strong incentive to
remain in the “grey” economy and register as unemployed to maintain entitlement to health insurance.
Health and unemployment contributions are collected at both the canton level and FBiH level and paid
directly into the different Funds, while pension contributions are collected at the FBiH level. The central
government has no role in the collections process. The Pension Fund is a single Fund at the level of the
Federation, but there are separate health and employment Funds in each canton, as well as a Federation-
wide Solidarity Health Fund that receives9% of health contributions and finances difficult treatments
(e.g., heart surgery and kidney dialysis) and specialized drugs. According to information provided during
the assessment, the Solidarity Health Fund should also receive an annual subsidy from the FBiH
government, but the amounts actually paid are only about 25% of its full entitlement. As a result, the
Solidarity Health Fund has substantial expenditure arrears, with some payments outstanding for more
than two years.

The medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) prepared each year by MoF contain some aggregate
information about income accruing to the Funds, but nothing about their expenditure. Nor are they
consistently included in the documentation presented alongside the budget. However, the FBiH annual
budget is approved by both the government and the Parliamentary Assembly. Thus EBF budgets are
formally disclosed to the Parliamentary Assembly.

The Law on Budgets of FBiH covers reporting requirements concerning EBFs. It states that the
responsible line ministry should deliver the EBF budget proposal to the government for consideration by
October 15, while the Government submits it to Parliament by November 5 for Parliament’s approval 92

Even through previous Law on Budgets did not prescribe that budgets of extra-budgetary funds are to be
submitted to the Parliament, the EBFs’ 2013 financial plans were presented to FBiH Parliament in March
of 2013.93For the 2012 fiscal year, budget proposals for the Pension and Health Funds were presented to

the Assembly at the same time as the FBiH 2012 budget proposal.94 Health institution budgets are not
subject to any comparable disclosure requirements.

Total revenue and expenditure of the Funds is included in the annual consolidated statistics of general
government revenue and expenditure prepared by CBBiH for BiH as a whole and for each Entity
separately, but no information about the Funds is presented alongside the budget execution statements
prepared by the government of FBiH. The financial statements of each Fund are audited by the SAI, so
that separate information on the out-turn is available, although not presented in a budgetary context. At
the budgeting stage there is no consolidated reporting of the canton-level Funds, and only the aggregated
out-turn reporting by CBBiH.

Essentially the same arrangements apply to the companies responsible for road construction and
maintenance in FBiH. The road companies receive 3.9% of indirect tax assigned to FBiH, together with
the proceeds of annual licence fees for vehicles and fees for roadside advertisements. These revenues are
split: 60% goes to the companies responsible for road maintenance in cantons and local self-governance
units, and 40% goes to the Federation-level Javno Preduzece Ceste FBiH, which expects to receive about
BAM 63 million in 2013. Thus only incomplete information is available about some 40% of general
government expenditure as a whole across FBiH, and about a comparable proportion of expenditure
directly controlled by the central government.

Dimension rating: D

     (ii) Inclusion in fiscal reports of income/expenditure information about externally funded projects
The bulk of externally funded project expenditure is the responsibility of the cantons (and to a lesser
extent local self-governance units and state-owned entities).To the extent that projects are executed by the
FBiH central government, the amounts are not included at the budget estimates stage, but are reflected in
the out-turn financial statements.

PI-8: Transparency of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
This indicator evaluates the transparency of and accountability for the resources that were transferred
between different levels of government. It also assesses the timeliness and reliability of the information
passed to subnational governments on their allocations.

Given the specificities of the BiH fiscal sector and the approach taken by this PEFA, under this indicator
the report considers the intergovernmental relations for the four main government levels separately. Thus,
only intergovernmental relations related to FBiH are given under this indicator. However, the indirect
taxation revenue—which is administered at BiH level but shared among the four main government
levels—is covered under this same indicator for BiH Institutions.

Out of the funds remaining from indirect taxation that are available to FBiH after foreign debt servicing is
deducted, 36.2% belongs to FBiH government, 51.48% to cantons (based on population, area, number of
students, and development level), 8.42% to local self-governance units (also based on population, area,
number of students, and development level), and 3.9% to public entities for roads.

For direct taxes, the structure and rates of personal and company income tax and social contributions are
set at the central level in FBiH, but the bulk of the revenue accrues to the cantons and municipalities, and
to the EBFs.

       Personal income tax is shared among the cantons and local self-governance units, with cantons
        receiving 65.54% and local self-governance units receiving 34.46% (except for Sarajevo Canton,
        in which municipalities have a different distribution schedule with the canton and the city and get
        only 1.79% of these revenues). Corporate profit tax belongs to the cantons, except for the sectors
        of electro-distributors, postal offices, telecommunications, and games of chance, which belong to
        the FBiH government. New Amendments to the Law on Distribution of Revenues in FBiH that
        are currently in the parliamentary adoption procedures envisage decreasing the cantons’ share in
        personal income tax to 59% and also simplifying the revenue sharing in Canton Sarajevo.

       Property tax revenue, including taxes on transfer of immovable property and rights, belongs to
        local self-governance units in both Entities. The property taxation system is weak, with relatively
        low revenues in both Entities, especially in FBiH, because the enforcement system is weak and
        property registries have not clearly established property ownership.

In addition to tax revenues, the FBiH government’s other revenues include administrative, service, and
penalty fees from government institutions, as well as revenues from assets or natural resources of FBiH,
including revenues from dividends and profit-sharing from public enterprises. Cantonal governments, in
addition to the tax revenues described above, have administrative, service, and penalty fees from cantonal
government institutions and revenues from assets or natural resources owned by the cantons. Local self-
governance units in FBiH, in addition to the tax and other revenues discussed above, have municipal/city
administrative, service, and penalty fees, communal fees, water protection fees, fees for use of assets or
natural resources owned by the local government, sojourn taxes, and taxes on games of chance.

    (i) Transparency and objectivity in the horizontal allocation among sub-national governments
As has been noted, in the process of indirect taxation sharing, in the past five years there have been
political problems/delays in deciding on the amount BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation
revenues and disputes on final consumption data and consequent delays on decisions on the formula for
sharing indirect taxation revenues between the two Entities.

In FBiH, the flow of information between the central government and cantons and in turn between the
cantons and local self-governance units in the early budget planning stages is weak, both for revenue
                                                           117


projection/distribution and for information such as the amounts and precise timing of debt service
payments, which significantly affect the monthly flow of revenue to the lower levels. This hampers the
budget planning of lower levels. The situation is further complicated in Canton Sarajevo, since the
indirect taxation revenue distribution for Sarajevo municipality also goes through cantons; this problem
should be corrected in the new Amendments to the Law on Distribution of Revenues in FBiH which are
currently in parliamentary adoption procedures.

Unclear jurisdiction among the different general government sectors in FBiH and unclear procedures for
cooperation between the local self-governance units and public utility companies can also complicate
budget management. Finally, the lack of clear legal ownership of local property (e.g., roads) also
complicates the management of lower government levels and affects fiscal reporting—for example, in
some cases maintenance of property by a municipality cannot be recorded properly since the municipality
is not the owner.

Dimension rating: D

     (ii) Timeliness of reliable information to the different governments on their allocations
The budget planning process is intended to provide, by April of each year, macroeconomic projections
and revenue forecasts on which, in May each year, the Fiscal Council would base the following year’s
allocations of indirect taxation revenues—drawing on the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and
Policies in BiH. Entity governments, cantons, local self-governance units, and road companies could then
be given a credible and timely projection of the resources that would be available to them for the
following year. Thus each level of government would have the information needed to prepare its MTEF
(i.e., fiscal plan for the following three years, see PI-12) and, subsequently, for the forthcoming budget.

It has been noted that there are often delays in deciding what portion of the indirect taxation revenues
FBiH will receive. Furthermore, the flow of information between the FBiH central government and
cantons and in turn between the cantons and local self-governance units in the early budget planning
stages is not only weak, but also not timely. In practice the forecasts have not been reliable, and the
necessary decisions have not been taken at the time scheduled. For example, cantons were still trying to
settle their 2013 budgets in terms of revenue planning in late spring of 2013; and the resources they are
receiving are falling below expectations. In addition, non-tax transfers from higher to lower government
levels in FBiH (e.g., transfers for some capital projects or social sector expenditures) are usually done on
an ad hoc basis, which also hampers the predictability of budget planning/management at lower general
government levels.

Dimension rating: D

     (iii) Extent of consolidation of fiscal data for general government according to sectoral categories
In terms of consolidation of fiscal data for the whole general government sector in FBiH, each year the
CBBiH compiles information on consolidated general government revenue and expenditure by economic
classification, including cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs. This is out-turn information only
(no consolidated information is available for budget estimates), and does not include any
functional/sectoral analysis. None of the planned budgets at any level in FBiH is presented in functional
classification, but rather only showing the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each administrative
unit.

Current reporting templates in FBiH95already require functional reporting from all general government
levels in FBiH (in 14 main categories, as opposed to 10 main COFOG groups); however, in practice,

reporting by function is based on a broad approximation, with likely errors, especially at the lower
government levels).

The MoF consolidates data (including functional data), but the data reported by lower government levels
are not always of good quality; this partially reflects difficulties in adapting their accounting systems to
meet the full requirements of the new CoA, with reporting currently dependent on manual consolidation
procedures. In practice, these data consolidated by the FMoF are not used for any policy decision-making,
nor are they reported to Parliament. In other words, the consolidation of general government sectors in
FBiH is not done within FBiH budgets plans sent to Parliament (the budget which is submitted to
adoption to Parliament only includes FBiH Government), nor in the budget execution reports sent to
Parliament for adoption, although lower government levels submit their budget execution data to FBiH
Ministry of Finance (note that not each local self-governance unit submit data to FMF, but rather each
Cantonal MF sends the data which includes all local self-governance unit in that Canton). However, the
FMF does perform consolidation of the data of general government sector in FBiH, which it uses for
reporting to the IMF, and for sending data for Global Framework (at very aggregate level), but not for
FBiH MTEF preparation (since in the several recent years FBiH MTEF only includes FBiH Government
level)

PI-9: Oversight of Aggregate Fiscal Risk from Other Public Sector Entities
This indicator assesses whether the government adequately monitors and manages the fiscal risks96 arising
from public sector activities or operations outside its direct control, including (i) the activities of public
enterprises (PEs) and autonomous government agencies (AGAs) financed outside the budget; and (ii) the
activities of subnational governments.

       (i) Extent of monitoring of PEs and AGAs
According to the 2012 EU Accession Progress Report, 58% of state-owned assets identified for possible
privatization remain unsold. Little progress has been made in recent years in realizing these assets. A
wide variety of enterprises remain in the ownership of the FBiH central government, the cantons, and the
local self-governance units. The annual consolidated government accounts produced by CBBiH for 2011
show that FBiH received BAM 182 million in “Other Revenue,” the cantons BAM 207 million, and the
local self-governance units BAM227 million. Subsidies of BAM 115 million, BAM 86 million, and BAM

     Fiscal risks are defined as debt service defaulting, operational losses, expenditure payment arrears, and unfunded pension obligations.

26 million were paid by the three levels of government respectively. A significant part of these
transactions concerned PEs.

PEs should notify their parent governments at each level of their annual business plans and their financial
results, and the provision of any guarantee has to be approved by the relevant Parliament/Assembly. However,
the MTEF documents contain no information on the impact of PEs on government financing, and no
consolidated reporting appears to be done by MoFs at either FBiH or canton level. There is apparently no unit
in operation anywhere with the responsibility to assess what should be expected of PEs in terms of financial
performance, to ensure that they pay the correct amounts of tax and contributions and pay appropriate
dividends out of their profits. In 2012 the FBiH tax authorities published a list of the largest tax and
contribution debtors showing that a significant part of these arrears was attributable to PEs.

The different EBFs at both Federation and canton level need to be considered here as AGAs. Their budget
plans are notified to MoFs and formally approved by Parliaments, but there does not appear to be any
consolidated monitoring or reporting of their financial position. The Solidarity Health Fund at the
Federation level has substantial expenditure arrears (money owed to health service providers and drug
suppliers), some of which date back two years or more.

Dimension rating: D

     (ii) Extent of central government monitoring of canton and local government units’ fiscal position
The MoF consolidates data, including functional data, but the data reported by lower government levels
are not always of good quality; this partially reflects difficulties in adapting their accounting systems to
meet the full requirements of the new CoA, with reporting currently dependent on manual consolidation
procedures. In practice, the data consolidated by the MoF are not used for any policy decision-making,
nor are they reported to Parliament.

In terms of debt, new borrowing by all lower government levels in FBiH must be reported to the MoF
within eight days of its being contracted. Quarterly reports on canton and municipal/city debt are made to
MoF, with half-yearly reports to the Parliament; however, these reports are not on the MoF website.
Information about cantons’ borrowing was considered to be accurate, although records of local
government borrowing might not be complete. The budget law requires that cantons’ and local self-
governance units’ debt service costs (interest plus repayments) in future years should not exceed 10% of
their current revenues. At the same time, the total debt service of the FBiH government, cantons, and
local self-governance units may not exceed 18% of current revenues.

The MoF prepares annual reports on public debt in FBiH97and FBiH MTEFs include debt data. Data are
also shared regularly with the BiH MFT, which prepares reports on public debt in BiH as part of the
MTEFs of BiH Institutions.

PI-11: Orderliness and Participation in the Annual Budget Process
This indicator aims to assess whether budget formulation adheres to a fixed and predictable budget
calendar each year and is organized in a way that facilitates effective participation by budget users. It also
assesses whether the instructions given to budget users for the preparation of their budget submissions
reflect high-level political decisions about the allocation of available funding, and whether the budget
circular fixes spending ceilings within which budget users have to work.
                                                          121


    (i)Existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget of the FBiH government are set out in the Law on
Budgets in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The budget process begins in February each year
with the distribution of Budget Instructions No. 1, setting out the requirements, responsibilities, and
timelines for each stage of the budget cycle. However, in practice, the calendar is not always adhered to.
Delays in the approval of the Global Fiscal Balance and Policy Framework in BiH can delay the
preparation of macroeconomic indicators and fiscal forecasts at the FBiH level. There can also be some
slippage in the timetable for the preparation of the MTEF due to delays in receiving from line ministries
the Budget User Priority Review Tables (BUPRTs), which should set out their priorities for additional
expenditure and areas where reductions could most easily be accepted if resources were not available. The
FBiH also has had the additional challenge of requiring input on expenditures and revenues from cantons
to prepare consolidated data within the MTEF, and consolidated FBiH general government sector MTEF
has not been prepared in several years now. Further delays are often experienced with the submission of
final budget requests from budget users. The new Law on Budgets adopted in FBiH is vague in terms of
preparation of comprehensive MTEF for entire general government sector in FBiH by the FMF.

Table 4.2.19 sets out the budget calendar presented in the 2013 Budget Instructions No. 1 issued on
January 31, 2012, and the actual dates each task was completed during the 2013 budget process. Only
some of the deadlines were specified in previous Law on Budgets of FBiH—the law lacked clear
deadlines for budget requests and inputs from lower government levels for preparing MTEFs—while
others are just included in annual budget instructions sent to the budget users by the MoF. The new Law
on Budgets in FBiH adopted in December of 2013strengthensthe overall budget preparation process in
FBiH and explain the budget calendar in more detail than the current law. As the table shows, the
prescribed calendar was substantially complied with for the 2013 budget. However, the two previous
budgets were significantly delayed, in part because of the absence of political agreement on the Global

    (ii) Clarity/comprehensiveness in the guidance on the preparation of budget submissions (budget
    circular or equivalent)
Two sets of budget instructions are issued. Budget Instructions No. 1 sets out the detailed guidelines and
instructions for the preparation of BUPRTs, including high-priority new spending proposals and savings
options, consistent with the priorities of the FBiH government. Following the submission of the BUPRTSs,
the MoF prepares a draft MTEF that sets out, among other things, the underlying macroeconomic indicators
and fiscal outlook, budget expenditure priorities for the budget and forward estimates period, and budget
ceilings for each budget user. Once the FBiH government has approved the MTEF, the MoF issues Budget
Instructions No. 2, confirming initial budget ceilings for each budget user (in accordance with the MTEF),
together with instructions for the preparation of budget requests. Budget users are required to prepare their
detailed budget estimates in accordance with these ceilings. The MoF and budget users conduct discussions
following the distribution of Budget Instructions No. 2; however, discussions are not held systematically
and with all budget users (as is done in BiH Institutions). Some adjustments to the ceilings may be permitted
in accordance with government policy priorities and subject to the approval of final budget ceilings by the
FBiH government.

However most of the deadlines for the budget preparation submissions are not yet precisely defined in the
legislation, so that the MoF can change the dates at any point.

PI-12: Multiyear Perspective in Fiscal Planning, Expenditure Policy, and Budgeting
This indicator refers to the extent to which the FBiH government plans its fiscal framework, expenditure
policies, and budget plans over the medium-term (because of the involvement of BiH Institutions in
overall medium-term projections). Four dimensions are considered: (i) multiyear fiscal forecasts and
functional allocations; (ii) scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis; (iii) existence of multiyear
costed sector strategies, and (iv)linkages between investment allocations and forward functional
expenditure estimates.

     (i) Preparation of multiyear forecasts
Each year the countrywide Fiscal Council is charged with the responsibility to approve a Global
Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH that sets the overall macroeconomic projections and
projection of indirect taxation revenues within which the BiH Institutions’ and the Entities’ next annual
budgets should fit, with projections extending two years further ahead. Detailed multiyear fiscal
projections for the FBiH level are then produced as part of the FBiH MTEF,98 including forward estimates
of expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming budget year and two following
fiscal years).The fiscal forecasts also include estimates of the revenues of the cantons, local self-
governance units, and EBFs. While in some previous years (such as 2008-2010) the FBiH MTEF
included both revenues and expenditures of all general government levels in FBiH, recent MTEFs include
only the expenditure of the FBiH government and discussion on revenue projections for all levels. The
IMF has been extending its technical assistance to the FBiH government in order to be able to produce
consolidated fiscal reports for the FBiH and use bridging tables to produce data in line with the GFS.

Once approved by the FBiH government, the budget year estimates establish the budget users’ budget
ceilings for the forthcoming budget year. However, there is no evidence that the forward estimates are
used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings; the y do not roll forward, but
instead the MoF effectively rebases the budget and forward estimates for each budget cycle. It should be
emphasized that the impact of the process in FBiH is limited, because the provision of the main public
services is the responsibility of the cantons. In terms of the mechanism in place for coordinating fiscal
planning across the Federation as a whole, in 2008 the FBiH government adopted a decree to form a
Federal Fiscal Coordination Body99that would include the FBiH Minister of Finance, the 10 cantonal
Finance Ministers, directors of Federal EBFs, and the chairperson of the Association of Municipalities
and Cities of FBiH. However, in practice, this body rarely met and did not function properly. The newly
Law on Budgets of FBiH adopted in December 2013envisages legal establishment of a Fiscal
Coordination Body with Federal and Cantonal Ministers and the chairperson of Association of
Municipalities and Cities of FBiH as members. This new law also sets a more detailed budget calendar
deadline for central government levels, but only vaguely prescribes that the cantons and local self-
governance units should adhere to the same calendar without clear explanation of how would this be
applicable to lower levels in the operational sense and whether consolidated MTEF for entire general
government sector in FBiH will be prepared by the FMF.

The budget and forward estimates in the MTEF are prepared by administrative, economic, and functional
classifications. However, the annual budget proposals are presented with economic and administrative
classifications only; they do not include forward year estimates.

    (ii) Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis
The FBiH MoF maintains an electronic database of external and internal debt, including that of cantons and
local self-governance units. The MoF regularly reviews external and internal debt, including as part of the
regular review of the Scathe MoF Debt Management Unit also submits data to the BiH MFT Debt
Management Unit, which maintains an access database of all internal and external debt of all governments
of BiH. According to the head of the MoF Debt Management Department, FBiH total public debt (including
EBFs and state-owned enterprises’ borrowing) amounts to about 30% of GDP. The most recent IMF report
on the current SBA (Country report 12/344) puts total BiH debt at end-2012 at 43.9% of GDP, of which
28.5% is external. Thus public external debt is not particularly high by international standards, but it has
increased threefold since 2006, in large part because of budget support loans. The Entity governments’
ability to borrow externally on favourable terms is also constrained by the high level of external private
sector debt not matched by external assets, which corresponds to a further 24% of GDP. Furthermore, any
analysis of debt level in BiH (both countrywide and Entity-specific) should be approached with caution,
given the country’s large infrastructure needs; further potentially large debt segments (such as restitution)
that are currently excluded; and the post-crisis trend of significant debt increases, which included large
budget support loans (spent in part for current expenditure, which still needs structural reform).

While data on debt status are collected regularly (with some delays at the local self-governance level) and
reports on debt stock and servicing projections are provided, full debt sustainability analyses (DSAs) are
not performed, except for the regular DSAs prepared by the IMF.

The Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of BiH stipulates that Advisory Committee for Debt
(comprising of two representatives from Council of Ministers one of which is the Finance Minister, one
representative from the Central Bank of BiH, two representatives from the Entity Governments including
Finance Ministers, and Finance Directorate director from the Brčko District), which is supposed to be in
charge of preparing debt management strategy. However, in practice, this has not been implemented.

Currently, the only debt sustainability analysis is the analysis IMF prepares within their Article IV
Country Reports or periodically in some of the reports in reviews under the SBA (four such analyses were
prepared by the IMF in 2009-2013). Since the IMF debt sustainability analyses have so far been
performed without active participation of the authorities in the preparation process (other than data
provision) and that the authorities do not use this analysis in their strategic planning process (the debt
sustainability analysis is not linked to a specific government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing
policies and needs at any government level (which are large, having in mind large infrastructure needs),
the performance rating for this indicators is reduced.

However, it should be noted that the IMF has recently shared its methodology and instructions in terms of
debt sustainability analysis with the Federal Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Federal
Ministry of Finance stemming from the conclusion of recent FBiH DeMPA prepared by the World Bank,
which also found that no DSAs are undertaken, no sensitivity analyses are used, and no medium-term
debt management strategy has been developed and it recommended that the technical assistance is
provided to the Federal Ministry of Finance for the debt sustainability analysis. Thus, DSA preparation
for the FBiH by the FMF can be expected in future, as it is prescribed by the new Law on Budgets in
FBiH adopted in December 2013 that the debt sustainability analysis will have to be annexed to budget.
The IMF DSA template has also been shared with the MFT in past years. But, given that currently there
is no evidence that the authorities have prepared and used own or IMF DSA in their own strategic
planning process, the performance rating for this indicator is lowered as noted.

      (iii) Existence of costed sector strategies
A Draft Development Strategy for BiH (with separate action plans for BiH Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB)
was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the Council of Ministers of BiH and adopted by
the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the Council of Ministers or RS government. The
Fiscal Council seems to have little political appetite to endorse or even discuss such countrywide strategic
documents. No costed sector strategies are formally developed for the FBiH, but some individual ministries
do prepare strategic plans (e.g., Strategic Plan for the Development of the Health System in FBiH 2008-
2018100); however, in general these strategic plans have not been costed.

Strategic planning in FBiH is further complicated by fragmented jurisdictions among the central
government and cantons, which have most responsibilities for the provision and development of services.
The bulk of the central government budget, besides wages and salaries, consists of transfer payments and
subsidies that simply perpetuate the current situation without doing anything to encourage social and
economic development. There is not enough strategic direction from a sectoral perspective that would cut
across all government levels in FBiH to ensure proper and effective implementation.

Most cantons prepare MTEFs, but they are not consolidated into an overall development plan. However,
MTEFs do not represent truly costed sectoral strategies, as they basically just set up ceilings per budget
user, rather than focusing on costed measures for strategy implementation. The FBiH MTEF includes an
analysis of “medium-term budget priorities”—covering the forthcoming annual budget and the two
following fiscal years—but these priorities generally reflect budget users’ specific individual new
spending initiatives rather than forming part of a broader sector strategy. Budget and forward estimates
are prepared for each budget user.

Dimension rating: D

      (iv) Linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates.
The FBiH MoF prepares a three-year rolling Public Investment Programme (PIP) that also covers
cantons.101The preparation of the FBiH PIP appears to be broadly synchronized with the annual budget
preparation undertaken by the MoF Budget Sector. The MTEF also reflects approved and funded projects
within the PIP. The use of multiyear estimates enables the MTEF to reflect the future recurrent costs of
completed capital investment projects.

Data from the FBiH MTEF are uploaded to the BiH Public Investment Management Information
Database, which is maintained by the BiH MFT Sector for Coordination of International Economic
Assistance. However, while there is an element of overall public investment planning at the FBiH level,
the absence of any consolidation of canton sector strategies means that the coordination of the planning of
current and capital expenditure cannot be fully effective.

PI-13: Transparency of Taxpayer Obligations and Liabilities
This indicator examines (i) whether tax legislation and regulations are clear and comprehensive and limit
the discretion of authorities, especially in decisions on tax assessments and exemptions; (ii) whether
reliable information about tax liabilities and procedures is readily available to taxpayers; and (iii) whether
there is a fair and transparent mechanism in place to resolve differences between taxpayers and tax
collectors about the amounts owed.

       (i) Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities
The legislative framework for major taxes includes domestic tax laws, international treaties on avoidance
of double taxation, and the laws governing administrative procedures. While the legislative framework for
major taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, some important aspects of tax application are not very
clearly and consistently reflected in the legislation and interpreted in practice. This mainly relates to the
implementation of important provisions of double taxation treaties (e.g. determination of tax residence,
reduction of tax upon deductions), and to transfer pricing. Consequently, tax inspectors tend to apply a
fair amount of discretionary powers in determining tax liabilities in these areas.

Dimension rating: C

       (ii) Taxpayer access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures
Taxpayers have web access to information regarding their tax obligations, explanatory notices, and
administrative procedures (www.pufbih.ba), and they have electronic access to their tax records (referred
to as “tax cards”). There is a network of branch FBiH Tax Administration (TA) offices where taxpayers
can obtain explanations, instructions, and copies of tax records. Workshops or seminars for taxpayers are
organized if there is a change in the legislation102. Official binding interpretations about tax applicability
can be requested individually from the Tax Administration of FBiH, and they are usually issued within
the prescribed deadlines.

      (iii) Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism
The tax appeal system comprises three levels: (a) objection and appeal to the FBiH RA; (b) appeal to the
FBiH MOF; and (c) appeal to the Administrative Court of FBiH. The decision process usually lasts longer
than the timeframe specified in the rules/regulations—the backlog of cases before the court is such that
any decision is likely to take several years. Decisions are not publicly available. Appeals are reviewed by
bodies whose members rarely include experienced professionals from the private sector and civil society.
Issued decisions are binding for all parties, with no right of appeal.

PI-14: Effectiveness of Measures for Taxpayer Registration and Tax Assessment
This indicator examines how effective a tax administration is in identifying its taxpayers and establishing
their liability to pay, using three dimensions: the arrangements for the registration of taxpayers in a
database and the links between that database and other relevant government registration systems; the
effectiveness of penalties for failure to register and to declare tax liabilities; and the planning and
monitoring of tax inspection and audit. Although the low rates of personal and company income tax mean
that the yields are of less importance than the Federation’s share of indirect tax revenue, the systems for
registering employers and employees also cover the payment of social contributions, whose yield is
comparable in importance to indirect tax revenue.

      (i) Controls in the taxpayer registration system
The registration system is automated and has recently been upgraded to a new single IT system. 103
Taxpayers are required to have sales registers electronically linked to the FBiH RA system (“fiscal
registers”), enabling daily tracking of revenue.

Taxpayers are initially registered in the (cantonal) branch offices registration systems, which are not
automatically linked to the central taxpayer registration system. Uploading to the central taxpayer
registration system is done once a week; consequently, the central registration system is not up to date at
all times.


103
   IT System“nPIS.” This investment is coordinated by USAID Tax Administration Reform project.
                                                               128


Taxpayers are assigned a unique Tax Identification Number (TIN), which is used for all direct taxes. Tax
authorities and taxpayers are obliged to use TINs in all official correspondence. TINs can be assigned
only to FBiH residents and to branches of companies incorporated in RS and DB. Currently, it is not
possible to assign a TIN to a permanent establishment/branch of a company with headquarters abroad, but
with business operations in FBiH.

The central tax registration system of the FBiH RA is linked to the pension and social security fund
system and to the FBiH governmental statistics. The 2012 Report of the FBiH SAI noted that 86 percent
of automated linking was successful, whereas the unsuccessful automated controls resulted in incomplete
data on pension rights for persons who retired during 2012.A project to link to other relevant registration
systems (the national biometric database 104 or the State communication network 105 ) would require
significant investment (around 2 million BAM), and because of lack of funding it is currently on hold.106

Under the SBA, on June 12, 2013, the four tax agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the
exchange of taxpayer information, with a view to facilitating the permanent, unfettered, and automated
sharing of taxpayer records.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Effectiveness of penalties for noncompliance with registration and tax declaration

Taxpayers of direct taxes are liable to a fixed penalty of 1,000 BAM to 5,000 BAM for late registration
plus 100 BAM per each late day107 and to penalties for late submission of tax returns in the amount of up
to 150% of late tax liabilities.108 Additionally, penalties of up to 3,000 BAM are imposed on responsible
persons (company directors).109The penalties appear to be high enough, but they may not always be an
effective deterrent.110.

Dimension rating: B

      (iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit programs
Tax audit plans are produced annually.111The selection of taxpayers for audit is based on automated risk
assessment criteria, identified from tax declarations entered into the system. The system runs queries
based on indications such as history of noncompliance and size of profits and revenues. During 2012
there were 8,591 tax audits and 2,892 controls of compliance with fiscal registrations. With respect to
criminal and fraudulent activities, there were 70 reports and 230 open investigations.112

PI-15: Effectiveness in Collection of Tax Payments
This indicator assesses the performance of a tax administration in collecting the amounts assessed, paying
the revenue immediately into the Treasury account, and subsequently performing reconciliations confirming
that the correct amounts have been collected from each taxpayer (or the correct amount of tax arrears
recorded), and that these correspond in total to the amounts received by the Treasury.

      (i) Collection ratio for gross tax arrears
The total amount of tax collections related to direct taxes in the FBiH amounted to 478 million BAM in 2012,
and 471 million in 2011.113 There are no published data available related to outstanding direct tax arrears.

Tax-geared penalties (i.e., a percentage of additionally assessed tax liability) are levied when tax returns
are carelessly or deliberately incorrect, which results in unreported tax liability. Interest is assessed on late
payments of taxes.

Dimension rating: Not Rated

      (ii) Effectiveness of transfer of tax collections to the Treasury
Taxpayers make payments into commercial bank accounts. Instructions for bank payments are clearly
prescribed in the applicable legislation; direct cash payments in FBiH RA office premises are prohibited.
Transfers of revenue collections to the Treasury Account are made daily.

Dimension rating: A

      (iii) Frequency of complete accounts reconciliations among tax assessments, collections, arrears
      records, and receipts by the Treasury
Information on revenue collection is electronically submitted to the accounting system of FBiH RA by the
banks; reconciliation of collections is automated, and payments are assigned to unique TINs. However, a
significant number of revenue collections could not be reconciled to TINs because of incorrect payment
order details (during 2012 there were 5,906 unidentified payments in the amount of 2.5 million BAM).114
FBiH RA has not developed an action plan to resolve the issue of unidentified payments. Further, there is
no reconciliation of tax collections and tax arrears between the FBiH RA and MoF databases, which leads

PI-16: Predictability in the Availability of Funds for Commitment of Expenditures
This indicator assesses the extent to which the government provides reliable information on the
availability of funds to budget users to enable effective resource management. It is intended to measure
performance over the last completed fiscal year before assessment. Three dimensions are considered: (i)
the extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored; (ii) the extent to which budget users can rely
on future cash availability for some period ahead; and (iii) the frequency and transparency of in-year
changes to the budget imposed on budget users.

      (i) Extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored
The FBiH central government and cantons have been in cash flow difficulty for some years. Total external debt
service has first claim on accruing tax revenue collections, including from the ITA, and funds received under the
2009 SBA were used to pay off expenditure arrears of the FBiH central government and partially cantons.
Because of this cantons and local self-governance units may not have a reliable forecast of the monthly profile
of the receipts of their share of the ITA revenues (see also PI-4 and PI-8).

However, cash flow is forecasted and slowly monitored at central level in FBiH. The FMF, based on
annual and quarterly cash flow forecasts sends instruction to MDAs for preparation of operational plans
of expenditures and outflows. The MDAs then submit their annual operational plan each quarter, based on
which the FMF approves monthly operational plans, closely paying attention to cash flow forecast (which
are revised on a monthly basis). The MDAs can incur liabilities only up to the amount available in
approved operational plans. The procedure of cash flow forecasts is further strengthened with the
adoption of new Law on Budgets in FBiH in December of 2013, which prescribes that cash flow forecasts
which are prepared quarterly will be done/verified by Budget Liquidity Committee of the FMF (whose
members will be Assistant Ministers from the relevant FMF sectors – budget, treasury, debt…). The
procedure seems good and functioning from the operational stand point, Although there have been issues
in recent years in terms of cash flows (causing some expenditures fall into arrears), due to lower than
anticipated revenues and receipts (mostly stemming from the fact that foreign budget support receipts did
not come as planned, due to issues such as delay in adoption of important legislation or budgets by the
Parliaments), the procedures and frequency of cash flow forecasting and monitoring appear to be

appropriate and functioning according to Treasury (with appropriate and transparent adjustment
mechanism existing to deal with the cash flow problems), thus granting rating A in this dimension.

Dimension rating: A

      (ii) Reliability and horizon of periodic in-year information to budget users on ceilings for
      expenditure commitment
The cash is being released monthly to budget users based on operational plans, in line with relevant
legislation (laws on budget execution) and in accordance to cash-flow forecasts. As discussed above, the
FMF approves monthly operational plans for budget users (thus “releasing” funds on the monthly basis), based
on plans submitted by MDAs and reconciling them with cash forecasts. When cash flow problems occur (as
was the case recently due to delay in receiving foreign budget support for example), there are procedures
prescribed in legislation (Law on Budgets) to deal with cash flow problems. According to Treasury, these
procedures for these cash control procedures seem to be transparent and functioning – selected
expenditure (most notably capital expenditure) is “frozen” for 45 days at a time, in line with spending
priorities (this is prescribed by Law on Budgets, which says that in the case of unpredicted expenditure
increase or revenue/receipts reduction, Government adopts a decision on stopping execution of certain
expenditure in the period of up to 45 days, which can include stopping new commitments, suggesting
prolongation of contracted deadlines for payment or stopping allocation of funds for some expenditure).

The MDAs may commit up to the limits of their annual budget allocations as approved by the National
Assembly, provided that their payment requests remain within the progressive releases of monthly
funding by FMF through the year. However, given that there were instances of cash flow problems
recently due to lower than anticipated revenues and receipts (mostly stemming from the fact that foreign
budget support loans did not materialize when planned), notwithstanding the annual budget
appropriations by the Assembly and quarterly operational plan, cash is being released monthly to budget
users with essentially no assurance beyond that about future cash availability to meet commitments.
When there are cash deficiencies, preference is given to the payment of salaries and social
benefits(according to paymemt priorities set in legislation). Thus, rating C is given (MDAs are provided
reliable information for one or two months in advance).

Dimension rating: C

      (iii) Frequency and transparency of budget adjustments imposed on budget users
FBiH had to introduce “rebalanced” budgets in recent years to meet the conditions of the current and
previous SBAs; it should be noted that these rebalances were not always expenditure decreasing but
rather net increasing, since the government adopted insufficient original budgets that which were not
based on realistic needs according to legal obligations.117The September 2012 budget rebalances included
measures to reduce civil service pay and freeze new employment. These revised budgets had to be
approved by the Parliament, and the changes were carried out with full transparency. Any transfer of
provision from one budget user to another can take place only by agreement.

PI-17: Recording and Management of Cash Balances, Debt, and Guarantees
This indicator looks at debt management in terms of contracting, servicing and repayment, and the
provision of government guarantees, including the following dimensions:

        maintenance of a debt data system and regular reporting on main features of the debt portfolio;

        identification and consolidation of cash balances in all government bank accounts (including
         those for EBFs and government-controlled project accounts); and

        the proper recording and reporting of government-issued guarantees, and the approval of all
         guarantees by a single government entity (e.g., the ministry of finance or a debt management
         commission) against adequate and transparent criteria.

    (i) Quality of debt data recording and reporting
As has been noted, responsibility for repayment of almost all external debt rests with the entities, except
for a very small part of direct external state debt, with the payments related to the external debt are being
fulfilled over the BiH institutions. Since BiH is the ultimate guarantor for essentially the entire IFI
foreign debt (regardless of whether the Entities are using it and repaying it), all loans must be approved
by the Council of Ministers of BiH, BiH Presidency, and BiH Parliament. The same requirements apply
to external guarantees of BiH (regardless of whether the Entities are final users).

CBBiH publishes quarterly figures for total external public debt. Debt management in FBiH is
coordinated with the cantons through a standing commission that reports to MoF. Cantons are permitted
to borrow domestically without the consent of FBiH MoF, as long as they do not require a guarantee.
Cantons and PEs have not undertaken any direct external borrowing, preferring instead that the FBiH
central government should borrow and on lend to them.

The MoF must be notified of any new borrowing by cantons and municipalities/cities within eight days, and
reports of debt stock have to be filed within 15 days after the end of each quarter. A quarterly report of the
outstanding external and domestic debt of the central government and cantons is required as part of the
surveillance under the SBA, and a half-yearly report is made to Parliament, although it is not yet on the MoF
website. Until recently most debt was contracted externally on concessional terms, but in 2011 and 2012
                                                       133


there has been significant domestic borrowing at market rates; BAM89 million of debt securities were
issued in 2011 and BAM 42.1 million in 2012 (IMF Country report 12/282, Table 4.1.5c).

The BiH Institutions MFT Debt Management Sector maintains a database of both internal and external
debt at all levels of government of BiH, based on a regular exchange of information with the Entities and
DB. The MoF also has a database covering the general government sector in FBiH. However, FBiH debt
reporting tends to be delayed (in terms of local self-governance units), and thus overall reporting for
FBiH is also hampered (and cannot qualify for the highest score).

Detailed analysis of the entire public debt stock of State and Entities (both external and internal) and debt
servicing prepared by the BiH MFT is also given in the BiH Institutions MTEF (including debt stock
information and debt repayment projections)118 and in the annual reports of Debt Stock of BiH that the
MFT prepares.119 Each quarterly execution report for the budget of BiH Institutions includes detailed
information on foreign debt servicing, and the annual budget plans of BiH Institutions include detailed
projections of foreign debt servicing.

The FBiH MoF also publishes annual reports on FBiH debt,120 and a debt overview is provided as part of
the FBiH MTEF.121

Limited DSA is usually presented in the reports. However, it cannot be considered as an appropriate full
DSA during the debt forecasting exercise.

Thus, overall the recording and reporting of formally contracted debt appears satisfactory (although there
may be minor gaps in information from municipalities/cities).

Dimension rating: B

      (ii) Extent of consolidation of government’s cash balances
All transactions directly related to the central government budget pass through the FBiH single treasury
account (STA), although the EBFs, the road maintenance companies, the cantons, and the local self-
governance units remain outside this arrangement. The FBiH government has given an undertaking to the
IMF to improve its control over canton government finances, and the IMF is providing technical
assistance to extend STAs throughout the cantons, with a view to establishing direct links between the
central STA and those in the cantons. At present there is only periodic manual reporting by cantons to
MoF; online access to information about each canton’s cash position and arrears could make it possible t o
reduce gross borrowing across FBiH as a whole and keep close track of the development of arrears.

Dimension rating: C

      (iii) Systems for contracting loans and issuing guarantees
In accordance with the FBiH Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees and the FBiH Law on Budgets, MoF
controls all borrowing on behalf of the FBiH central government, as well as external borrowing for on lending
to cantons and PEs, and approves the issue of guarantees for borrowing by cantons and PEs.

Within the MoF, the Debt Management Sector is in charge of federal debt management and of monitoring
the overall federal-level public debt. The Debt Management Sector’s main functions include preparing

development projects, implementing procedures for issuance of federal guarantees, and preparing regular
analytical reports on central-level federal debt and overall public debt of the FBiH. It is also responsible
for debt service forecast and debt service payments and is involved in preparing onlending agreements
and project monitoring, as well as in monitoring and reporting on the indebtedness of cantons, cities,
municipalities, EBFs, and public companies.

The FBiH government may contract direct domestic and external borrowing within the legally binding
limits. Direct external debt borrowing requires the approval of the FBiH government and Parliament.
Domestic debt borrowing is undertaken by the MoF with the approval of the FBiH government. The
approval process for new borrowing includes the submission of information to the Debt Committee and
the FBiH Cabinet of Ministers. The issuance of loan guarantees is defined by the same legal framework as
direct borrowing.

FBiH policy is to borrow only for investment or for debt refinancing, and the law requires debt service
costs to be kept within 18% of the previous year’s consolidated current revenues. According to the
responsible deputy minister, the FBiH is reconsidering its debt management strategy with a view to firmer
control and greater transparency. For the time being the objectives for debt are not linked to medium-term
fiscal targets; there is no formal debt management strategy that would steer debt management decisions.

PI-18: Effectiveness of Payroll Controls
Payroll and related charges represent a significant percentage of current costs of the FBiH. This indicator
is intended to cover all significant government payrolls—that is, all civil servants and other government
employees, including people employed in the health and education services and EBFs; state-owned
entities (SOEs) are outside its scope. Four dimensions are considered: (i) the degree of integration
between personnel records and the payroll; (ii) the timeliness of changes to personnel and payroll records;
(iii) the operation of internal controls over changes to personnel and payroll records; and (iv) the
existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers.

    (i) Degree of integration and reconciliation between personnel records and payroll data
The FBiH Civil Service Agency (CSA) keeps a complete register of all civil servants in the central
government, cantons, and local self-governance units. However, central control of numbers and grading
at the canton level was undermined by the 2010 decision of the FBiH Constitutional Court, ruling on the
                                                     135


application of the West Herzegovina Canton that employment of civil servants was a matter for the canton
structures. Central government recruitment is carried out through competitions run by CSA for vacant
positions in accordance with the Rulebook on Organization and Systematization of Workplaces. The CSA
establishes a shortlist from which organizations make their choice of people to appoint. Organizations are
not bound to accept CSA’s merit ordering of candidates, and unsuccessful candidates may appeal.
Promotions to management positions must follow CSA procedures, although lower-level promotions are
at* the discretion of employing organizations, which then report them to CSA.

The FBiH MoF makes all salary payments to central government employees. CSA notifies MoF of
changes to be made to the payroll each month (including those for which promotion decisions are at the
discretion of the employing organizations).The MoF does not make any further check on the correctness
of the payments calculated by the employing organisations unless staff ceilings or budgetary provision are
being exceeded. Payroll calculations have recently been simplified by decisions to reduce and rationalize
the allowances formerly paid as percentages of salary, which are now paid as flat-rate additions. Since the
changes to the payroll are made only on notification by CSA, and that CSA maintains a complete record
of all employees, it is concluded that there is an adequate, although not automatic, link between personnel
and payroll records.

Dimension rating: B

    (ii) Timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll
According to the CSA all procedures, including notification to the MoF, should be completed within a
month of the decision of the employing department, so that appointments can become effective without
delay and any need for retroactive adjustments avoided. There is no evidence that these procedures are
not followed in practice (the implementation is necessary due to pension and health insurance
arrangements).

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Internal controls over changes to personnel records and the payroll
Substantive changes to personnel records and to the payroll (i.e., new appointments and promotions)
should be effectively controlled by the requirement for CSA authorization before MoF makes any
changes, thereby creating an audit trail. CSA has procedures to ensure that notifications to MoF are fully
justified and consistent with the systematization rulebooks; the MoF’s responsibility is to ensure that
changes approved by CSA are correctly entered in the payroll. These will depend on the effectiveness of
hierarchical supervision, the need for which should be more generally recognized once FBiH begins to
implement its intentions to improve financial management and control. (EU assistance is being provided
for the development in each spending unit of a rulebook and procedures on financial management and
control; see PI-20.) For the time being there is less assurance that employing organizations are effectively
controlling allowances and overtime payments before notified MoF of them.

Dimension rating: C

    (iv) Existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers
According to CSA, they and other small organizations are subject to payroll inspections every six months.
Further on, the SAI performs regular financial audit of the entire central government, and therefore all the
institutions of the central government have been subject to financial audit at least once in the last 3 years.

In the course of auditing and payment of salaries to employees in public sector institutions, the auditors
are performing tests on the basis of samples, applying all relevant standards and guidelines. The type and
                                                      136


the size of the sample of salaries depend on the level of the assessed risk and the level of preliminary
materiality. Auditors are regularly checking during the financial audit work the number of employees, the
calculation and the payment of salaries, lists and accounts to which payments are made, as well as orders
for bookkeeping entries. Auditors are using audit software to test the number of employees, the regularity
of salary calculation, test of analytical and summary records, and payment execution.

PI-19: Competition, Value for Money, and Controls in Procurement
This indicator was assessed only on the level of the BiH Institutions. Accordingly, the PI for FBiH, RS,
and DB has been rated as N/AA (not applicable).

PI-20: Effectiveness of Internal Controls over Non-salary Expenditure
This indicator assesses the effectiveness of internal controls over non-salary expenditure, considering
three dimensions: (i) the effectiveness of controls over the commitment of expenditure;
(ii) the comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of internal control rules and procedures; and
(iii) the degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions. The controls should
ensure that expenditure is incurred, and payments made, only when fully justified in accordance with
budgetary provisions, and when all applicable regulations (including those concerning procurement) have
been complied with.

    (i) Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls
The current operational procedures prevent the Treasury system from making payments that would
exceed the amounts of funds released on the relevant budget line in operational plans which are based on
forecasted cash availability. The MDAs may commit up to the limits of their annual budget allocations as
approved by the Parliament, provided that their payment requests remain within the progressive releases
of monthly funding by FMF through the year. Incurring liabilities and actual payments are limited to
                                                             137


released funds, which in turn are limited to cash availability in Treasury system. Although framework
legislation has been adopted for financial management and control and implementing rules have been
prepared, the government has not yet acted on them. The head of the FBiH Central Hamonization Unit
(CHU), who should coordinate the implementation of improved systems, has been on the job for two
years but still has no staff. In-year reports are being produced covering commitments (which are limited
to available funds) as well as payments, but the coverage of commitments is not reliably complete. SAI
notes that most of the budget users at the FBiH Government level established internal control systems (in
line with Guidelines for establishment and strengthening internal control adopted by Federal Ministry of
Finance in line with Law on Budgets in FBiH and Law on Treasury of FBiH), but that not all of the
procedures undertaken by budget users are covered and not all of the control procedures are included.
Furthermore, in most cases there was no supervision over control activities. While there are
improvements in terms of internal control establishment, not all needed activities have been implemented
yet. There were instances when not all liabilities were properly recorded and paid in full due to lack of
funds and the priority for made payments were not clear in actual realization.122 Thus, rating is C, since
expenditure commitment control procedures exist and are partially effective, but they may not
comprehensively cover all expenditures or they may occasionally be violated123.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of other internal control rules/procedures
The SAI has repeatedly identified breaches of financial controls—for example, payments of agricultural
subsidies to businesses not engaged in agriculture. Very few audit opinions have been unqualified. In the
Letter of Intent submitted in September 2012 to the IMF by the BiH Institutions and the two Entity
governments to support the request for the current SBA, the FBiH government undertook to put forward
legislation to impose penalties for commitments undertaken in excess of budget allocations.

The FBiH CHU, which is charged with coordinating the strengthening of financial management and
control throughout the government and organizing the internal audit function, made some progress in
2011 through the Coordination Board with the BiH Institutions and RS in developing common rules for
strengthening financial management and control; but as noted above, the necessary decisions to
implement them are still pending, and the CHU still needs to increasing its staffing. EU assistance is
available to support the development of rules and procedures for financial management and control in
each spending unit, and to provide training in their operation, but the process has not yet started.
Meanwhile there are some basic rules (e.g., a requirement for dual signatures) that are generally complied
with, but they are not sufficient to ensure that funds are correctly spent. The SAI has repeatedly identified
breaches of the rules—for example, in relation to the awarding of contracts.

Dimension rating: D

      (iii) Degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions
Some general rules for processing and recording transactions are generally observed as far as the Treasury
is concerned; problems exist with the substance than the form of transactions, where the responsibility
rests with the spending units. All central government transactions are channelled through the STA and are
correctly recorded, but the Treasury exercises no control over their substance. The SAI has criticized the
absence of adequate documentation at the level of the spending units to justify payments of agricultural
subsidies. As written above, SAI notes that not all of the procedures undertaken by budget users are

PI-21: Effectiveness of Internal Audit
This indicator looks at the functioning of internal audit services as distinct from the internal control
operations reviewed in PI-20. The internal audit function considered here is defined as an advisory service
to top management on the functioning of the systems for which management is responsible; internal audit
is by definition separated from any operational responsibility for the systems. Three dimensions are
considered: (i) the coverage and quality of the internal audit function; (ii) the frequency and distribution
of reports; and (iii) the extent of management’s responses to the findings.

      (i) Coverage and quality of the internal audit function
Some elements of internal audit have been operating in FBiH for some time, in cantons and local self-
governance units. Ten units are in operation in the central government, including units in the Ministries of
Finance and Agriculture, and there are also units in the Sarajevo and Tuzla Cantons. The SAI has been
urging the extension of internal auditing, but the decisions are the responsibility of the canton and local
governments concerned. In the Una-Sana canton the former internal audit unit has ceased operation,
although work is continuing in Bihac municipality. The legislative basis for the general introduction of
internal audit is in place,124 and the necessary regulations and operating instructions have been prepared by
the Coordinating Board made up of the CHUs of the BiH Institutions and the Entities, although they are not
yet formally approved in FBiH. In FBiH these arrangements are to be put into effect as part of stand-alone
legislation on financial management and control. The law has been drafted and put before the FBiH
government for consideration before it is formally submitted to the FBiH Parliament for adoption. However,
124
   The Law on Internal Audit of the Public Sector in FBiH, which was adopted in 2008:
http://www.fbihvlada.gov.ba/bosanski/zakoni/index.php
                                                           139


no progress has been made in this regard because of the political impasse that has affected the FBiH
government almost continually since the general elections in October 2010. Moreover, the FBiH CHU has
only a director and no other staff, and little progress had been made in developing internal audit at the time
of the Assessment125.

As FBiH has inherited elements of an internal audit structure that were put in place long before internal
audit became a topic of discussion as part of the BiH EU accession process, there is now some
disagreement about the future structure of internal audit. Thus the director of CHU argues that the
structure of internal audit ought to be developed according certain objective standards—for example, that
every public institution with more than 200 employees or a budget larger than BAM 10 million ought to
have an internal audit department in its formal organizational structure. This has become an issue for
some existing internal audit departments—for example those in Tuzla and Sarajevo Cantons, which are
attached to the Cabinets of the Prime Ministers, who would rather have a centralized internal audit
structure.

Due to the lack of capacity there is limited coverage of internal audit within the BiH Institutions. In
addition the main focus of the reports remains compliance audit rather than the performance of systems.
Nevertheless based on the number of internal audits conducted and the content of the recommendations
issued at least 20% of staff time is dedicated to systematic issues reviews.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Frequency and distribution of reports
The SAI sees the extension of effective internal audit throughout the central government and cantons as
an important element in securing better financial management in FBiH, including a reduction in the extent
to which regulations are ignored or flouted. Reports are produced where the units are operating, but the
MoF has no capacity to ensure that lessons learned in one place are promulgated more widely.

FBIH CHU has published one consolidated annual report so far on its website, for 2011,126 noting some
progress in developing common rules for strengthening financial management and control; however, the
necessary decisions to implement the rules are still pending, and the CHU is not sufficiently staffed. As of
2011, internal audit was established in nine institutions at the FBiH government level with a total of 11
employees. Furthermore some kind of internal audit role was established in seven cantons, although in
some cases changes of organizational characteristics are needed to align with the internal audit legislation.
In 2011, a total of 66 internal audits at the FBiH government level were performed, as well as 93 internal
audits at the canton level (there is no information about internal audits at local self-governance level).
There is currently limited coverage, and a relatively small number of internal audit reports have been
prepared. The internal audits made recommendations in the areas of allowances, travel expenses,
expenses for education, contracted services, public procurements, and vehicle expenses. According to
Law on Internal Audit,127Internal audit reports are submitted to the audited subject after the audit has been
completed. In addition ex post reviews are being undertaken no later than 6 months after the internal
audit report had been issued in order to follow up on all actions and recommendations and in order to
determine the level of completion of such actions by the audited subject. Such reports are submitted to
the audited subject however upon request such reports can be delivered to any legislative, executive or
judiciary organ as well as to FBiH SAI. Finally there are annual internal audit report which are being
consolidated by the FBiH CHU and submitted to FBiH MoF who then submits such report to the FBiH

     In 2013 two employees were hired (one economist and one lawyer), which enabled a more intensive operations of the CHU.

purpose of PEFA rating for this indicator, B rating is appropriate since reports are issued regularly for
most audited entities and distributed to the audited entity, the ministry of finance and (upon the request)
the SAI.

    (iii) Extent of management response to internal audit findings
According to the head of the CHU, many of the managers concerned act on internal audit reports, but
there needs to be a wider recognition of the importance and usefulness of internal audit. No detailed
information is available about management responses to specific findings, which are understood mainly to
be concerned with compliance failures rather than proposals for improvements in management and
control systems.

PI-22: Timeliness and Regularity of Accounts Reconciliation
This indicator examines (i) whether there are frequent and regular reconciliations between accounting
data in the Treasury’s books and bank account data, and (ii) whether advances and suspense accounts are
regularly reconciled and cleared. A further discussion with the FBiH Treasury is needed to confirm the
ratings.

PI-23:Availability of Information on Resources Received by Service Delivery Units
This indicator asks whether normal administrative and accounting systems provide reliable information
about the resources received by primary schools and primary health clinics, whatever level of government
is responsible for their operation.

In FBiH the provision of school (and university) education is the responsibility of the ten cantons, each of
which has its own Ministry of Education. These units are included in Cantonal Treasury system and they
report to Canton on regular basis, both in terms cash and in-kind resources. The administrative systems in
each canton identify each school separately in budget estimates and expenditure out-turn statements.
Schools are directly funded from canton budgets (the exception is University of Sarajevo in Sarajevo
Canton, which is outside of the Treasury system, but is reporting to Canton). Thus, routine data collection
or accounting system provide reliable information on both cash and in kind resources received by schools.

Primary healthcare is provided by the Health Funds operated by each canton, which are mainly financed
from the social contributions paid in respect of each employee (and, in principle, paid by the self-
employed). The Solidarity Health Fund under the central government provides specialized treatment and
expensive drugs but does not provide primary health services. The Health Funds commission services for
their subscribers from healthcare institutions that may themselves belong to cantons or local self-
governance units. Services may also be commissioned from voluntary or private sector organizations,
which do not generally form part of any public sector budget.

While there are systems that enable estimates to be extracted for each school separately, there are no such
systems in the health sector. Thus information is routinely available about resources received by
individual schools, but not about resources for all primary health clinics.

PI-24: Quality and Timeliness of In-year Budget Reports
This indicator reviews three aspects of in-year budget execution reporting: (i) the scope of reports and the
extent to which comparisons are possible with budget estimates on administrative, economic, and
functional bases, with commitments covered separately from payments; (ii) the timeliness of reports; and
(iii) the quality of the information.

      (i) Scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates
Formal in-year reports are produced by the MoF128in the same format as the annual budget—that is, by
economic and administrative classifications—and they present expenditures at both commitment and
payment stages.129However, if a budget revision occurs during the year, the report refers to the revision
only, rather than to the originally adopted budget. The reports do not cover the EBFs, whose expenditure
is twice that of the central government.

Dimension rating: A

      (ii) Timeliness of the issue of reports
Year-to-date financial reports are produced daily by the Treasury system, to which most budget users
have direct access; they are thus able to produce reports relating to their own operations at the time of
their choosing. The Rulebook on Financial Reporting requires that full reports be prepared quarterly;
these reports are produced within a month after the end of each quarter. Monthly reports are also prepared
for the benefit of the Minister of Finance and the IMF (the reports are not distributed to budget users).
Publication of the quarterly reports has not been consistent or reliable.

Dimension rating: A

      (iii) Quality of information
The formal reports produced by the MoF are derived directly from the Treasury system, and there should
be no doubts about the completeness and accuracy of information on cash revenue and expenditure. The
reports contain some useful commentary and analysis with respect to trends in key revenue and
expenditure categories. For example, the report covering the first nine months of 2012 notes that all of the
unpaid commitments dating back to 2011 were covered during the reporting period. However, the report
does not mention the new commitments that the government entered into during the reporting period but
was unable to pay when they were due. Thus there are some doubts whether all necessary information
about commitments is being entered into the system, and there is a generally acknowledged need to
improve financial management and control in budget user organizations.

PI-25: Quality and Timeliness of Annual Financial Statements
This indicator considers whether a government’s annual financial statements include full information
about revenue and expenditure, and financial assets and liabilities, are submitted for audit soon after the
end of each year, and are prepared in accordance with accounting standards consistent with IPSAS.

    (i) Completeness of the annual financial statements
The annual financial statements include full information on revenue and expenditure, and also about
financial assets and liabilities. The statements cover only central government ministries; the revenue and
expenditure of the Federation-wide Pension Fund, the Solidarity Health Fund, and the roads maintenance
company, which together account for about twice the expenditure of the central government narrowly
defined, are excluded, although these bodies are fully controlled by the government. Because the PEFA
criteria allow separate reporting by such bodies, notwithstanding the incompatibility of the practice with
IPSAS, the dimension rating is A.

Dimension rating: A

    (ii) Timeliness of submission of annual financial statements
The central government’s annual financial statements have been submitted for audit within three months
after the end of each year.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Accounting standards used
The statements are prepared in accordance with the Directive on Budget Accounting and the Rulebook on
Budget Bookkeeping in FBiH, which are available in electronic format and are consistently presented
from one year to the next. However, the FBiH SAI qualifies its opinion on the consolidated annual
financial statements on the grounds that they do not meet the requirements of IPSAS. Full compliance
with IPSAS would, among other things, require the preparation of a consolidated series of statements
covering EBFs as well as government ministries and so on. In the view of the PEFA team, the omission of
the EBFs from the consolidated statements, although consistent with FBiH legislation, is so important that
the standards used cannot be regarded as corresponding to IPSAS.

PI-26: Scope, Nature, and Follow-up of External Audit
This indicator looks at the work of the SAI and its contribution to satisfactory public financial
management. Three dimensions are considered: (i) the range and quality of the audit work performed; (ii)
the timeliness of the submission of audit reports to the legislature, particularly the report on the
consolidated annual financial statements; and (iii) the evidence available about audited bodies ‘follow-up
of the SAI’s recommendations, and the SAI’s follow-up in subsequent audits.

      (i) Scope/nature of audit performed
The FBiH SAI, like the SAIs of the BiH Institutions and RS, has benefited from the assistance of the
Swedish SAI. Staff have been trained, and audit work has been judged by successive SIGMA annual
reports to meet professional standards. The SAI seeks to raise questions about performance —what is
actually being achieved through public expenditure programs—in addition to its financial and compliance
audit work. The SAI pointed out that most of the expenditure under the control of the FBiH central
government takes the form of transfer payments to individuals or subsidies to businesses, none of which
contributes to economic development or the improvement of public services.

In addition to auditing the budget execution statement of the FBiH central government, the SAI covers the
consolidated budgets of each of the 10cantons, the FBiH Pension Fund, and 22 different health and
employment funds, as well as all the companies in the ownership of the FBiH, cantons, and
municipalities. It has only 64 staff to audit all these different bodies, whose annual expenditure adds up to
more than BAM 7.5 billion. Only a few of the 78 municipalities can be audited each year, and only those
Federation-wide SOEs (including companies in the ownership of municipalities and cities) with the
largest turnover (railway, post office, gas). Even at the central FBiH level, not all budget users (ministries,
agencies) are audited each year.130Only 5of the last 150 reports gave unqualified opinions. The annual
audit coverage is above 90%131 for FY 2011.

Dimension rating: B

      (ii) Timeliness of submission of audit reports to the legislature
The FBiH Budget and SAI laws require MoF and its counterparts in the cantons and the Funds to submit
their financial statements and budget execution statements for audit by the end of June, and require the
SAI to submit its reports to Parliament by the end of September. This timetable has been adhered to in
respect of the financial statements and budget execution statements of the central government, but the

budget execution statements to the SAI.

    (iii) Evidence of follow-up on audit recommendations
The SAI follows up its recommendations made to auditees in subsequent audits, and is publishing a
database of the findings it has reported to the Parliament since 2002, together with information about the
extent to which its recommendations have been acted on. It includes examples of findings and
recommendations that have been repeated year after year without any action being taken. Overall, the SAI
considers the responses by audited entities to its findings to be inadequate, as is confirmed by the
continuing high number of qualified, or even adverse, audit opinions.

scrutiny; (ii) the extent to which the Parliament’s procedures are well established and respected; (iii) the
adequacy of the time allowed to the Parliament to respond to the government’s budget proposals; and (iv)
the extent to which in-year amendments can be made to the budget by the executive without the prior
approval of the Parliament.

    (i) Scope of the scrutiny by Parliament.
Both the FBiH MTEF (for the MTEF, see PI-11), which includes the government’s macroeconomic and
fiscal forecasts, and the annual budget proposal are formally submitted to the FBiH Parliament. Standard
parliamentary procedures provide for the relevant committees of both houses of Parliament—the
Economic and Fiscal Policy Board of the House of Representatives and the Board for Economic and
Development Policy, Finance and Budget of the House of Peoples—to review the annual budget proposal
and report to the full session of Parliament. In practice there is limited scrutiny by the committees, which
have no professional staff to support their work.

       (ii) Extent to which the legislature's procedures are well established and respected
Under the Law on Budgets of the FBiH, the government is required to submit a proposed budget to the
Parliamentary Assembly for adoption by November 5 each year, while the MTEFs are adopted by the
Government by June 30 each year and submitted to Parliament “for information” at the same time. The Law
also provides for the FBiH Parliament to discuss       Table 4.2.36. Extent to which the Legislature’s

       (iii) Adequacy of time for the legislature to provide a response to budget proposals—both the
       detailed estimates and, where applicable, proposals on macro-fiscal aggregates earlier in the
       budget preparation cycle (time allowed in practice for all stages combined).
According to the Chairman of the FBiH House of Assembly Budget and Finance Committee, the
submission and approval of the MTEF is now “permanent practice. “However, he acknowledged that
neither the committees nor the Parliament undertake detailed analysis of the “technical elements” of the
MTEF or other planning documents, mainly because the Parliamentarians lack technical and expert
support, and that examination of the actual budget proposals is limited. Moreover, the time available to
the Parliament may be cut short by the government’s use of emergency procedures: for example, the 2013
budget was passed within 15 days to meet the requirements of the SBA. Thus the Parliament is not
assured of even one month to review the government’s proposals. Similarly, in-year revisions to budgets
are normally enacted within very limited periods of time.

There are no specific Rules of Procedure or a timetable for Parliamentary scrutiny of the annual budget
law for either the House of Representatives or House of Peoples beyond the standard Rules of Procedure
that apply to any legislative act considered by the FBiH Parliament. Articles 204 and 205 of the Rules of
Procedure of the House of Representatives state that procedures for consideration of a basic legislative act
also apply to budget consideration132

       (iv) Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the legislature
Article 33 of the Organic Budget Law provides for significant amendment to budget allocations within
the approved budget without ex-ante approval by the Parliamentary Assembly. The law provides that at a
budget user’s request the FBiH MoF may approve the restructuring of that budget user’s expenditures, up
to 10% of the original allocation. The same Article provides that on an exceptional basis, on a proposal by
the MoF, the government may reallocate expenditure between budget users, provided there is no overall
increase in expenditure.

PI-28: Legislative Scrutiny of External Audit Reports
The remit of the FBiH Audit Office covers the entire general government, as well as enterprises owned by
the government or whose debts are guaranteed by it, and also entities that receive government grants and
foreign-financed projects. This indicator looks at the legislature’s role in examining the Audit Office’s
reports on the management of public finance and in monitoring the implementation of recommendations
made by the SAI. Three dimensions are considered: (i) whether the Parliament completes its
consideration of audit reports within a reasonable time after receiving them; (ii) whether in-depth hearings
are held on key findings with representatives of bodies audited; and (iii) whether the Parliament
recommends corrective actions that the government implements.

       (i) Timeliness of examination of audit reports by the legislature (for reports received within the last
       three years)
The Law on Audit of the Institutions in FBiH (Article 16)133 specifies the timing for the submission of the
reports of the Audit Office of the financial statements of FBiH. The Rules of Procedure of the FBiH
Parliament Joint Committee on Audit and the accompanying Instruction for Deliberation and Analysis of
Audit Reports, which were formally adopted in November 2009, specify the timing of each step the
Parliamentary Committee responsible for audit is to take during its consideration of the audit reports. The
instructions set out a four-step review process; each step takes two to four weeks to complete.

The key outcome of the instructions is that they have helped the Parliamentary Committee responsible for
audit to focus and streamline its operations, ultimately reducing the time necessary for the Parliamentary
Committee responsible for audit to complete its deliberations (from six to eight months down to just four
months) while at the same time improving the quality of the entire process. The deliberation process
should start on July 1 and be completed by October 31.In practice, however, the timetable has yet to be
met: the process took 18 months from July 2010, and six months from July 2011, and as of April 2013
was still not completed after July 2012.The dates when the Assembly received the reports, and when it
adopted its conclusions, are set out in Table 4.2.38.

                  Source: Audit Office of the FBiH Institutions and FBiH Parliament.

    (ii) Extent of hearings on key findings undertaken by the legislature
As mentioned above, the introduction of new Rules of Procedure and relevant Instructions has allowed
the Audit Committee to conduct a more in-depth scrutiny of the audit reports than previously. The current
practice is for the committee to focus on budget users that receive negative or qualified audit opinions.
The full effect of new procedures has yet to be felt. Delayed by the 2010 general elections and their
difficult political aftermath, the new joint committee was set up and started formal work to address the
audit reports for 2009 and 2010 only in September 2011.

Officials of budget users can be requested to appear before the committee to answer questions on their
financial statements and organizational performance. Public hearings with budget users were organized in
November 2011, following a meeting with the Auditor General. The same process was followed in 2012
and completed by December 2012; however, because of the ongoing political stalemate, the conclusions
of the Audit Committee were not submitted to the Parliament for adoption. Thus a useful start has been
made in holding hearings with some auditees who have received qualified opinions on their financial
statements, but it would be too soon to conclude that hearings are consistently held with representatives of
most bodies that receive a qualified or negative opinion.

Dimension rating: B

    (iii) Issuance of recommended actions by the legislature and implementation by the executive
The Audit Reports present the SAI’s recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the government.
Parliament usually adopts these reports without amendment, according to the SAI.

The Audit Office complained that Parliament does not generally follow up or impose any sanctions on
budget users that fail to implement recommendations, even when the same recommendations are made
year after year. Most members of the Audit Committee are less senior political party members then those
holding positions in the executive, a fact that reduces the scope for any meaningful dialogue about action
to address key problems identified in the audit reports.

The Audit Office and budget users are required to report to Parliament on actions taken to implement
recommendations. The Audit Office attempts to follow up on its recommendations; it is currently
publishing the recommendations it has made in recent years and its assessment of the responses they have
received. According to the SAI, this analysis shows that many recommendations have repeatedly been
ignored.

         IV. ASSESSMENT OF PFM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, AND INSTITUTIONS

                                         REPUBLIKA SRPSKA
                          Executive Summary – Republika Srpska
For the purposes of applying the PEFA performance indicators, data and information from FY 2009 –
2011 were used in the calculations and for scoring the indicators, with more current information used for
some indicators where such information was available.

I. Integrated Assessment of PFM Performance

A. PFM Out-Turns: Credibility of the budget
For the three fiscal years covered in the Report (2009 to 2011), the aggregate expenditure out-turn
compared to original approved budgets has had low levels of deviations indicating that the RS
government does adhere well to its planned total expenditure. The composition of expenditure out-turn
has also closely followed the original approved budget, further underscoring the strong planning function
in the RS. The slightly poorer score for revenue performance resulted from significant over-performance
of revenue out-turn in two of the three years under review.

The stock of expenditure payment arrears of the RS central government increased in 2012; predominantly
as a result of unpaid agricultural subsidies, Health Fund arrears and transfers to war veterans. Data on
arrears is incomplete; no arrears to suppliers are captured and payment due dates are not entered into the
treasury system. In February of 2014, at the session of the Fiscal Council of BiH, the definition of arrears
had been adopted, as follows: Any liability that is recorded in the treasury application in the Module AP-
liabilities towards suppliers, and that had not been paid within the timeframe of accrual stipulated by Law,
and within the timeframe of 90 days from the date of accrual, at the longest. Based on a common
definition, each government levels will adjust their legislation.

B. Key Cross-Cutting Issues: Comprehensiveness and transparency

RS has developed a chart of accounts that collects all the information needed to meet IMF GFS2001
requirements and has produced a new financial reporting regulation which provides the basis for
implementing International Public Sector Reporting Standards. The budget formulation is based only on
administrative and economic classification. Current reporting templates in RS already require functional
reporting from all general government levels in line with the COFOG categorization (in 10 main
categories). However, in practice, reporting by function is based on a broad approximation, with likely
errors, especially at the lower government levels. While MoF collects sufficient information to present a
functional breakdown for both budget and out-turns; this is only presented in execution reports.

Budget documents are reasonably comprehensive although budget proposals exclude (i) disclosure of
financial assets for the beginning of the current year, (ii) prior year’s budget out -turn, and (iii) current
year budgets (revised budget or estimated out-turn).

RS still has many public enterprises (PEs) that are the responsibility of the central government or local
self-governance units. When PEs undertake investments that are part of the government’s Public
Investment Program (PIP), the RS MoF ensures that the economic and financial case is fully analysed and
the risks understood. However, projects that are sponsored by other ministries outside this framework are
not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. The provision of guarantees for PEs’ borrowing is controlled
by the RS MoF, and the PEs are required to report their annual business plans and financial results to their
sponsor ministries. The Pension, Health, Employment, and Child Protection Funds together account for
                                                             151


nearly 40 percent of revenue and expenditure of the government, however they are only reported at the
out-turn stage.

The new Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of RS, adopted in 2012, stipulates that the public debt
of Republika Srpska cannot exceed 55% of the GDP executed in that year, the total debt of Republika
Srpska cannot exceed 60% of the GDP executed in that year, that units of local self-governance may
borrow in long-term only if in the course of the period of the onset of debt the total amount that accrues
for repayment, on the basis of the proposed debt and the total of accrued, outstanding existing debt, in any
of the subsequent years, does not exceed 18% of the amount of its regular revenues executed in the
preceding fiscal year, etc. 134 The MoF must also approve borrowing for on-lending to municipal
enterprises like district heating schemes. Monthly reports are made to RS MoF, which consolidates them
with central government debt, with a purpose of preparing timely records for total RS debt. MF RS
submits quarterly reports on the balance of debt and guarantees of the local self-governance units to the
MFT.

All key fiscal information, including budget documentation, execution and audit reports as well as
contract awards are made available to the public on a timely manner.

C(i). Policy-based budgeting
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget are set out in the legislation. The budget calendar is
adhered to despite delays in agreement on the Global Framework in the Fiscal Council. Detailed
multiyear fiscal projections are produced as part of the RS MTEF, including forward estimates of
expenditure for each budget user (i.e. estimates for the forthcoming budget year and the two following
fiscal years). The fiscal forecast also includes estimates of the revenues and expenditures of local self-
governance units and EBFs using administrative, economic, and functional classification. Forward
estimates are not used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings

According to RS MoF, a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for external and domestic debt is undertaken
annually, but the analysis is not publicly available, and the extent to which this DSA goes into details and
scenario testing is not clear.

A Draft Development Strategy for BiH was prepared by the Directorate for Economic Planning of the
Council of Ministers but was never adopted by RS government. In RS some individual ministries do
prepare strategic plans, but no RS wide costed sector strategy has been developed.

The RS prepares a rolling three-year Public Investment Programme (PIP), however, public investment
planning in RS is not wholly integrated. The MoF coordinates a program covering some of the
government’s main objectives, but other investments are planned separately by sector ministries. The use
of multiyear estimates in the RS MTEF should ensure that future recurrent costs of completed capital
investment projects are reflected in the MTEF. However, the planning of public investment remains
separate from any development of sector strategies by the government, so there is no basis for the
integration of current and capital expenditure planning.

C(ii). Predictability and control in budget execution
RS legislation and procedures for all major taxes are comprehensive and clear, while there is a fair amount
of discretionary powers of the tax inspectors in areas such as interpretation of international tax treaties
and transfer pricing. Taxpayers have easy access to comprehensive, user-friendly and up-to-date
information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures for major taxes, and RS Tax Administration

(TA) supplements this with an active taxpayer education campaign. The tax appeals system is functional,
although decisions are often not issued within prescribed timeframe.

Taxpayers are registered in a complete database with some linkages to other relevant government databases.
There are penalties for noncompliance with registration and declaration obligations, but they may not
always be an effective deterrent. There are annual tax audit plans as well as a continuous program of tax
audits and fraud investigations. Taxpayers are assigned a unique Tax Identification Number (TIN), which is
used for all direct taxes.

There are no reliable data on tax arrears for the last two fiscal years. All tax revenue is collected into bank
accounts controlled by RS RA and transferred daily to RS Treasury. Complete accounts reconciliation of tax
assessments, collections, arrears, and transfers to Treasury takes place at least quarterly.

The RS government provides reliable information on the availability of funds to budget users to enable
effective resource management. The Treasury Department of the RS MoF prepares a monthly cash flow
forecast taking into account the expected expenditure profiles provided by budget users. The budget users
may commit up to the limits of their budget allocations, provided that their payment requests remain within
the progressive releases of funding by MoF through the year. There are few changes to budget allocations
and, where these take place they are conducted transparently.

RS operates as a unitary administration, with centralized debt management and reporting, and with
borrowing by local self-governance units strictly limited and controlled. Most external borrowing is
undertaken through the BiH Institutions. The servicing of relevant external debt of RS is being performed
from the revenues of RS (indirect taxation) from the subaccount of RS that is opened with the CB BiH, and
before indirect taxes are made available to RS, except for direct external debt of RS, for which the servicing
is performed from the revenues of RS (direct taxation) from the RS Single Treasury Account that is opened
with commercial banks, and in such a manner that RS is paying for its liabilities to the creditor directly.

The RS MoF must be notified of any new borrowing by municipalities/cities. Annual reports are submitted
to RS National Assembly, and a review of debt is provided within the RS MTEF. In addition, the quarterly
report on outstanding external and internal debt is also required as a part of monitoring within the
framework of IMF SBA. All borrowing of the government and units of local self-governance is under
control of the RS MF, which also controls the issuance of guarantees for the borrowing of public companies.

RS central government transactions, including those of the municipalities and cities, pass through the single
treasury account (STA), and all cash balances are centralized in it, other than those in separate accounts
associated with externally funded projects. As of January 1, 2013, local self-governance transactions have
also been brought within the STA system, while all EBFs and public enterprises remain outside it.

The RS government may contract direct domestic and external borrowing within the legally binding limits.
Direct borrowing requires the approval of the RS government and RS National Assembly. The issuance of
loan guarantees is defined by the same legal framework as direct borrowing. Thus, all loans and guarantees
must be approved by the RS government and RS National Assembly.

Government policy is based established legal limit however these are not linked to fiscal targets in the
context of medium-term fiscal planning.

The legal framework for procurement is clear and readily accessible to the public. Open competition is
the default method. The publication of tender notices and contract awards is transparent, with information
publicly available via the PPA’s website. However, there is no public access to procurement plans or to
results of recent complaints.
                                                     153


Since there is widespread criticism by auditors, and frequent complaints by tenderers are upheld by the Public
Procurement Review Board (PRB), it is clear that the exceptions to open procedures are not properly justified
in many cases. Information is limited to bidding opportunities in the form of procurement plans (though
these plans are not usually published) and contract awards. No information is available on results of
complaints in spite of legal requirements. Although the PRB has managed to issue many decisions, it
lacks sufficient human resources to fulfil all its functions quickly and efficiently.

The RS MoF Treasury operates the payroll for central government employees, but not for employees of the
Pension, Health, and Employment Funds, which are not subject to central financial controls. The current
treasury system controls prevent any execution of payments that would exceed the amounts of funds
released on the relevant budget line and related to the non-salary expenditure. The Treasury executes
changes to the payroll in response to notifications from employing organizations, which may include
approval or confirmation by the Civil Service Agency, but it does not itself make any substantive checks.
Internal and external audits of payroll are undertaken on a regular basis as part of the financial audit work.

Expenditure commitment control procedures exist and are partially effective, but they may not
comprehensively cover all expenditures and may occasionally be violated. Continuing efforts are being
made to strengthen internal control procedures throughout general government however audit reports
identify cases of non-compliance and that rules and procedures are incomplete.

Coverage of the internal audit function is limited and internal audit staff spend little time dedicated to
systems review. Management respond to some but not all internal audit recommendations.

C(iii). Accounting, recording and reporting
There are daily reconciliations between Treasury and bank records of the operation of the STA through
which all government transactions flow. EBFs were already included, and local self-governance units
have been brought within the STA as of January 1, 2013. Advances are cleared without delay, and there is
little use of suspense accounts.

Information on resources received by service delivery units are available at the Ministry of Education
about the resources received by each school and at the Ministry of Health and the Health Fund about both
revenues and expenditures of each health institution in the RS. Schools are in Treasury system and
prepare annual reports on cash and in-kind resources received.

Data on actual expenditures are prepared in the same format as the annual budget by economic and
administrative classification. In-year financial reports are produced daily by the treasury system covering
both payments and commitments.

The annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Rulebook on Accounting,
Accounting Policies and Accounting Assessments for Budget Users in RS, the Rulebook on Criteria for
Acquiring the Status of a Budget User, the Rulebook on Budget Classifications, Contents of Accounts,
and Application of the Chart of Accounts for Users of Revenues of the Budgets of the Republic,
Municipalities, Cities, and Funds, the Rulebook on Financial Reporting for Users of Budgets of the
Republic, Municipalities, Cities, and Funds, and the Rulebook for Application of International Public
Sector Accounting Standards. Both documents are available on the MoF website. These instructions
reflect the government’s decision to adopt international accounting standards. At the level of RS, since
January 1, 2013, the IPSAS 23 – Revenues not originating from exchange (taxes, contributions etc.) has
been adopted and in use, so that even the so-called public revenues are expressed on accrual basis in
financial statements for 2013.The most recent translation of IPSAS goes back to 2011.

C(iv). External scrutiny and audit
In 2012 the coverage of financial audit was around 95% of expenditure at both RS Government and local
self-governance level. A few performance audits are conducted each year, in addition to financial and
compliance audits. The budget users submit their financial statements to the SAI by the end of June in
accordance with the main budget law, and the SAI reports to RS National Assembly by the end of
September each year. This timetable has been observed. The SAI follows up on its recommendations
however has received limited support from Parliament; in 2010 it refused to endorse the annual report on the
work of RS SAI and recommendations. It has also adopted a resolution requesting the SAI to agree with
MoF on the volume, coverage, and criteria of audit work, which, if enacted would undermine the SAI’s
independence.

By law, the legislature has a maximum of 25 days to consider the government’s budget proposal. However
in practice neither the executive nor the RS National Assembly abides by this timeline. As a result, the
Assembly has had only a very few days to consider two of the last three budgets. Although the MTEF is an
integral part of the budget planning process in RS, it is not formally reviewed and adopted by the RS
National Assembly. Neither are the operations of the EBFs included in the government’s presentation of the
overall fiscal outlook.

The Law on Audit of the Public Sector of RS specifies the timing of the submission of audit reports on the
financial statements of budget users. The MoF should complete each year’s consolidated annual financial
statement by May 20 of the following year. The SAI is then required to deliver its audit report on the
consolidated annual financial statement to the National Assembly within 90 days after receiving it from the
government.

The National Assembly has a special nine-member Audit Board with the mandate to review SAI reports.
The Board is chaired by an opposition party member. The committee considers all reports and not only
those with negative or qualified opinions. Budget users that receive negative opinions are required to attend
public hearings. In addition, if it issues a negative opinion to some of the reports, the SAI has an
obligation to send a copy of the auditor’s report under the title of “Auditor General’s Report” to the Chief
Republic Prosecutor of Republika Srpska.

The Audit Reports present the SAI’s recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the government. The
National Assembly usually considers the reports and adopts conclusions on reports without any further
amendments.

II. Assessment of the impact of PFM weaknesses

This section of the Report analyses the extent to which the performance of the assessed PFM system
    appears to support the three high level objectives. These are:

       Effective controls of the budget totals and management of fiscal risks contribute to maintain
        aggregate fiscal discipline.

       Planning and executing the budget in line with government priorities contributes to
        implementation of government’s objective (strategic allocation of resources).

       Managing the use of budgeted resources contributes to efficient service delivery and value for
        money.

1. Aggregate Fiscal Discipline
The RS government budget process is well organized and with minor expenditure deviations either at an
aggregate or sectoral level. Revenue out-turn showed significant over-performance in two of the three
years under review which may indicate weaknesses in revenue forecasting. Expenditure arrears have been
increasing and the government lacks comprehensive data on arrears or a legal definition for its
calculation. While the tax legislation and procedures are comprehensive and clear there is no reliable data
on tax arrears for the last two years. Budget documents are reasonably comprehensive and made
available to the public on a timely basis.

2. Strategic Allocation of Resources
The MoF provides reliable information on the availability of funds; there are few changes to budget
allocations and, where these take place they are done transparently. The existing budget process does not
have a strong policy or strategic focus. There is no overall agreed national development strategy, and
while a detailed medium term expenditure framework exists forward estimates are not used to anchor the
preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings. The RS prepares a rolling three-year Public
Investment Programme (PIP), however, public investment planning in RS is not wholly integrated - other
investments are planned separately by sector ministries. The planning of public investment remains separate
from any development of sector strategies by the government, so there is no basis for the integration of
current and capital expenditure planning which may lead to sub-optimal decisions being made on the
allocation of resources.   Limited time available in order to scrutinize the budget in parliament may
reduce the pressure on government to allocate and execute the budget in line with its stated policies.

3. Efficient Service Delivery
Expenditure commitment control procedures exist and are partially effective, but they may not
comprehensively cover all expenditures and may occasionally be violated, and audit reports confirm the
need to ensure the operation of a stronger system of rules and procedures. Internal audit as a function is
in its infancy and audit work needs to improve as does the response of management to audit
recommendations. Non-observance of competitive tendering procedures may create the opportunity for
inefficient procurement, corruption and leakages in the system. Weak linkages between the work of the
SAI and parliament may reduce the extent the government is held to account for the efficient management
of resources.

III. Prospects for PFM Reforms

Ministry of Finance of Republika Srpska will develop a Debt Management Strategy, and that reforms in
this area are planned for the future period, as an integral part of the process of improving debt
management. The preparation of the full debt sustainability analysis for the debt of Republika Srpska is
being planned for the forthcoming period, as an integral part of the process of improvement of debt
management.

In RS, a centralized payroll system for all employees in the public sector will be set up for improved
recording, control, and planning. RS started this process by the end of calendar year 2013 and it is
planned to be fully implemented by July 2014.

In February 2014 the Fiscal Council of BiH adopted a definition of an arrear based on any amount that is
not paid within a maximum of 90 days, and similar approach will be taken by the Entitles. In practice RS
may choose to use a shorter period of time, as per the draft legislation available.

  Assessment of PFM Systems, Processes and Institutions – Republika Srpska
PI-1: Aggregate Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the difference between the actual and the originally budgeted primary expenditure
for Republika Srpska (RS) for the last three fiscal years (2009-2011). Interest payments and externally
funded project expenditure are excluded because they are outside the direct control of the government.
The closer the out-turn to the budget estimate, the higher the rating.

The expenditure analyzed includes that of the RS Pension, Health, Employment, and Child Protection
Funds financed from social contributions. The expenditure of road companies 135 is excluded from the
calculations.

RS has been relatively successful in keeping actual expenditure in line with the budget, with the
differences between out-turn and budget being 0.3%, 1.0%, and 6.6% for the three years 2009-11. The
larger difference in 2011 between budget and out-turn primarily reflects higher expenditure on health,
child protection, education, and veterans’ benefits (see Annex 4). Wage costs throughout the budget
increased because of an increase in contribution rates, part of which falls on the government as employer.

PI-2: Composition of Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the extent to which the composition of the budget changes from that originally
planned by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and agreed by Parliament. The PEFA Secretariat has set out a
formula for calculating the variance between the out-turn from the approved budget estimates. Each
budget line is adjusted by the overall deviation between budget and out-turn, and the differences between
actual expenditure on each budget line and these adjusted figures are then summed to give the overall
variance, shown as a percentage of actual expenditure. The second dimension of the indicator looks at the
amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve; the larger the amount charged to the reserve
rather than reallocated to specific budget lines, the less transparent the budget. The tables containing
calculations for RS are set out in Annex 3 of this report.

      (i) Additional variance of expenditure composition after allowing for overall variance in PI-1
The formula measures the additional variance over and above the overall variance calculated in PI-1
resulting from resources being reallocated from one area to another during budget execution. A good score
is achieved if there are no significant reallocations from one functional area to another. Thus, there can be a
good score on this indicator even if there is a substantial overall difference between the budget and out-turn
as measured under PI-1, provided that the proportionate changes are similar on each budget head.

The calculations are based on the spending of the central government of RS and, of the seven extra-
budgetary funds (EBFs)—Pension Fund, Health Fund, Employment Fund, Child Protection Fund, Road
Reconstruction and Maintenance Company, Highway Company, and Fund for Rehabilitation and
Employment of Disabled Persons—only the first four, which are financed from social contributions. The RS
MoF submitted the spending information by each unit on a consolidated basis (that is, if transfers were
planned at one level—e.g., RS government—they were excluded from the other—e.g., Pension Fund). In
accordance with the PEFA criteria, the calculation of the variances has been based on the 20 largest budget
lines, with the Funds treated as one budget line and the remaining expenditure as a single “other” line.

In the last three years the RS budget out-turn has been close to the adopted budget rebalances, but since
budget rebalances are usually adopted every year, there were changes in comparison to original budget
plans. The highest variance, in 2011, reflects pension expenditure remaining constant while other
expenditures, particularly on health and education, increased, both relatively and absolutely (see the
detailed figures in Annex 4). Since the sum of variances exceeded 5% of the total out-turn in only one of
the three years. The dimension rating is A.

      (ii) Amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve
RS includes a contingency reserve in its budgets. The contingency reserve is limited to 2.5% of total
planned revenues (less grants), according to Article 44 of the Budget System Law of RS. 136 Budget
Reserve is (according to Law on Budget Systems in RS) used for: unpredicted expenditure which are not
planned in adopted budgets, for expenditures which show higher needs than in the planned budgets, for
temporary coverage of budget liabilities in the case of lower than planned revenue inflow, and in
extraordinary cases for other purposes for which the Government adopts necessary Decrees/Decisions.
For example, in the 2011 budget execution, budget reserve in the amount of 6.8 mil BAM was spent, in
comparison to budget plan of 8.5 mil BAM. It needs to be noted that (due to accounting rules), while the
budget reserve is planned in the budget as a lump sum on a separate budget line (since the planned
resesrve is general, there are no specific type of spending it is devoted for in the budget plan), budget
execution repors shows spending from this budget line at the appropriate budget line accoring to purpose

PI-3: Aggregate Revenue Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator compares actual total domestic revenue to the budgeted domestic revenue. Countrywide
indirect taxation administered by BiH Institutions is shared among the four main government levels—BiH
Institutions, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), RS, and District Brčko (DB)—while all other
taxation and non-tax revenue are under the exclusive jurisdiction of each level separately.

Table 4.3.5 shows RS consolidated revenue and receipts by general government sector level. Indirect
taxation is the most important revenue source, comprising 41% of total RS consolidated revenues
(identical to FBiH), followed by social contributions, which account for 37% of consolidated RS
revenues. Direct taxation revenue makes up only 11% of consolidated RS revenue.

The overall system for distributing indirect taxation revenues among the four main levels in BiH is
explained in detail in Chapter 2 and under this same indicator for BiH Institutions. In summary, once the
share of BiH Institutions is deducted from total revenues, DB receives a fixed 3.55% of the remaining
funds or BAM 124 million at the minimum, and the rest of the funds are divided between the two Entities
on the basis of data on final consumption locations identified in tax forms. The coefficients for
distributing revenues between the Entities are variable; they are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in
final consumption and are formally adopted by the Governing Board of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA).
Periodic reconciliation is also envisaged when changes of coefficients occur. Out of each Entity’s share,
relevant foreign debt servicing is first deducted, and the remaining funds are then shared among the
general government sector levels. Of the indirect taxation funds remaining to RS after foreign debt
servicing is deducted, 72% belongs to the RS budget 24% to local self-governance units (based on
population, area, and number of students), and 4% to the Public Company JP Putevi RS.

In practice, in the past five years, there have been political problems/delays in the decision on the amount
BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation revenues, as well as disputes about final consumption
data and consequent delays on decisions on the formula for sharing indirect taxation revenues between the
two Entities.

For direct taxes, which are under the sole jurisdiction of each of the Entities and DB, the structure and
rates of personal and company income tax and social contributions are set at the central level in RS, and
revenues are then shared with local self-governance units and the EBFs.

In both Entities and in DB, the revenue of EBFs includes social contributions relevant to the specific fund
and transfers from the central governments for some funds; Public Company JP Putevi and Public
Company JP Autoputevi RS receive part of the indirect taxation revenues and other road fees.

The Macroeconomic Analysis Unit (MAU) of the ITA is responsible for preparing forecasts of indirect
taxes, taking into account countrywide macroeconomic projections prepared by the Department for
Economic Planning under the Fiscal Council. These revenue projections are used by the Fiscal Council,
Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) of the BiH Institutions, the Entities’ Ministries of Finance
(MoFs), and the DB Finance Directorate during the budget preparation process. However, the amounts
entered into the budget of each government in respect of indirect tax revenue are the responsibility of that
government. Forecasting of revenue from direct taxes and other Entity revenues is the responsibility of
the respective MoFs; so in RS, the MoF is responsible for projections.

    (i) Actual domestic revenue compared to domestic revenue in the originally approved budget
As noted above, the Entities and DB have their own mandate over direct taxes.RS has the authority to
legislate in the field of property taxation, taxation of personal income, corporate income tax, and social
contributions. The revenue allocation system within RS, for both the Entity level and the local self-
governance units, is regulated by the Law on Budget System of RS. The allocation in 2011 among the
central government, local self-governance units, and the Funds is shown in Table 4.3.5. Personal income
tax is shared between the central government and local self-governance units (the government receives
100% of income tax on copyrights and intellectual property, capital income, and capital gains and 75% of
personal wages and allowances and income from independent work), while corporate profit tax belongs to
the RS budget.

It was not possible to use consolidated data from the Central Bank of BiH (CBBiH) for indicator
calculations because they are available only for out-turns and not at the stage of the budget estimates.
Thus the ratings for this indicator are based on the data received directly from the MoF. Revenue budget
forecasts, and actual out-turns are shown in Table 4.3.6.

If this indicator is assessed on the basis of the divergence between budgeted and actual total consolidated
revenues, the rating is B, reflecting the fact that out-turns were never outside the 94%-112% range in any
of the three years.

PI-4: Stock and Monitoring of Payment Arrears
This indicator examines whether there are significant payment arrears, and whether there is a system that
enables the amounts of payment arrears to be monitored.

In RS at the moment of this assessment there is no legal definition of what constitutes arrears; no legal
period has been established (e.g., 45 days) after which an unpaid invoiced obligation is considered to be
in arrears; and within current Treasuries no payment due date were entered from the invoices until July 1,
2013 in RS. Under the SBA with the IMF, the authorities the BiH Institutions and Entity Government
authorities were obliged to establish, before October 2013, a common definition of spending arrears by
the BiH Institutions and Entity governments (with any amount that is not paid within 90 days after the
due date considered to be in arrears) and, from July 2013, procedures for budget users to enter all due
dates of invoices into the Treasury. These deadlines were not met. As of end 2013, the payment due data
have started to be recorded in the Treasuries at the BiH Institutions and Entity Government level
(however, the complete 2013 reports on arrears have not been ready in time to be included in this Report),
while the deadline for establishing definition of arrears was extended to early. In February 2014 the Fiscal
Council of BiH adopted a definition of an arrear reading as follows: any obligation that is recorded in the
treasury application in the AP module - liabilities to suppliers, and that has not been paid within the
timelines for accrual defined by Law, and within the deadline of 90 days at the longest from the date of
accrual. On the basis of the common definition, each of the levels of governance shall adjust their legal
frameworks.
                                                                 163


       (i) Stock of expenditure payment arrears

The stock of expenditure payment arrears of the RS central government increased in 2012:138according to
the MoF, amounts outstanding rose from BAM 62.5 million at the end of 2011 to BAM 82.5 million at
the end of 2012. The 2012 expenditure arrears consisted predominantly of unpaid agricultural subsidies
(BAM48 million) and transfers to war veterans (BAM18 million). There was no specific policy with
respect to expenditure arrears; the government took ad hoc decisions to delay payment of transfers and
subsidies. Overall, since within current Treasuries no payment due date is entered from the invoices,
current data on arrears are not all-encompassing (e.g., no arrears to suppliers are captured).

In addition, arrears in the Health Fund have been increasing each year, amounting to some BAM 200
million at the end of 2012, according to information received from the Health Fund. This reflects the fact
that revenue from health contributions has not been keeping pace with the costs of providing treatment to
insured patients. Given that reliable data on arrears in line with legal definition is not yet available (it is
expected that first data will be available in Spring 2014 for 2013), insufficient information is available to
score this dimension or indicator.

Dimension rating: Not Rated given the absence of reliable data

       (ii) Availability of data for monitoring the stock of expenditure payment arrears
RS collected some estimated data about general government arrears, including for the Pension and Health
Funds, for the SBA. However, since no official data on arrears in line with the legal definition of arrears
are not available yet (as of end 2013), the rating for this dimension is D.

PI-5: Classification of the Budget
The PEFA criteria look for arrangements that make it possible to compare budget and out-turn for the
same year, and also provide for consistent comparisons from one year to the next, according to
administrative, functional, and economic classifications. Ideally the 10 main functions of government as
defined by the United Nations Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) should be broken
down into sub functions (e.g., different levels of education) or programs. This objective is facilitated by
recording all transactions in accordance with a chart of accounts (CoA) that captures sufficient
information about each transaction to enable reports according to each of the classifications.

The RS MoF established a new department within its formal structure to supervise financial reporting and
associated issues related to accounting standards. This department has developed a new CoA that collects
all the information needed to meet GFS requirements and has produced a new financial reporting
regulation (bridging tables produced with the assistance of the CBBiH and the IMF are used to convert
CoA reporting into GFS reporting submitted to the CBBiH and the IMF).The new CoA entered into force
as of January 1, 2011.The RS MoF implemented series of training seminars for Entity and local

      Records of arrears for 2010 are not available as RS MoF claims it was not obliged to keep such records at the time.

institutions of government to smooth out the implementation of the new CoA and financial reporting
regulation. This new RS CoA would be the first in BiH to provide an initial basis for implementing
International Public Sector Reporting Standards. In terms of International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS), as of 2012, all of the 31 IPSAS that define the accrual basis for budgetary accounting
were implemented, except for IPSAS 23 (taxes and transfers). Until 2013, revenues were recorded on the
modified cash basis, while from 2013 accrual accounting is being applied. However, accrual recognition
of public revenue will be used only for income statements and balance sheets and other financial
statements in line with IPSAS standards; but for budget planning and budget execution reporting the
modified cash basis will continue to be used.

The RS government presents its budget showing the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each
administrative unit. The government maintains a Treasury system through which all transactions pass—or
are recorded, if they are made from separate bank accounts serving externally financed projects—which
provides for consistent reporting by administrative and economic classifications. The Treasury system of
RS has been much improved in the course of the period from 2004 to 2013, and since January 1, 2013, it
has included local self-governance transactions. The Minister of Finance of RS has adopted the Rulebook
on the Form and Contents of the Budget and Budget Execution Reports, which eliminated the discrepancy
between the plan and the report, and in the context of the presentation by standard budget classifications,
which includes the functional classification as obligatory, as well (the Rulebook was adopted at the end of
2013).

estimate and out-turn stages. It also looks at the extent to which donor-funded projects are included in
fiscal reports.

      (i) Level of extra-budgetary expenditure omitted from fiscal reports
Estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the Pension, Health, Employment, and Child Assistance
Funds are not presented as part of or alongside the central government budget.139The out-turns of these
funds are fully reported, though not in a format consolidated with other general government sector levels
in RS; the RSGovernment budget execution report is sent to the Parliament alone, not as a consolidated
RS general government sector budget plan or execution. Social contributions collected alongside personal
income tax currently account for about 37% of total central government revenue, including the Funds.
There are also some relatively small expenditures (on the order of 3% of the total expenditure of the
central government and Funds taken together) in the health and education sectors financed from their own
revenues, which are not included in budget estimates, although they are reported in the out-turn and pass
through the STA. About 40% of revenue and expenditure under government control is not fully reported
at both budget and out-turn stages.

Dimension rating: D

      (ii) Inclusion in fiscal reports of information about income/expenditure of externally funded
      projects
Only the cofinancing element in externally funded projects is included in budget estimates, although total
expenditure is included in out-turn statements when the projects are executed under government control.
In other words, to the extent that projects are executed by the RS central government, the amounts are not
included at the budget estimates stage, but are reflected in the out-turn financial statements.

   According to Article 34 of the Budget System Law of Republika Srpska, EBFs are only required to get the consent of the RS
government regarding their budget proposal.

PI-8: Transparency of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
This indicator evaluates the transparency of and accountability for the resources that were transferred
between different levels of government. It also assesses the timeliness and reliability of the information
passed to subnational governments on their allocations.

Given the specificities of the BiH fiscal sector and the approach taken by this PEFA, under this indicator
the report considers the intergovernmental relations for the four main government levels separately. Thus,
only intergovernmental relations related to RS are given under this indicator. However, the indirect
taxation revenue—which is administered at BiH level but shared among the four main government
levels—is covered under this same indicator for BiH Institutions.

Out of the funds remaining from indirect taxation that are available for RS after foreign debt servicing is
deducted, 72% belongs to the RS budget, 24% to local self-governance units (based on population, area,
and number of students), and 4% to Public Company JP Putevi RS.

For direct taxes, the structure and rates of personal and company income tax and social contributions are
set at the central level in RS, and revenues are then shared with local self-governance units and different
EBFs.

        Personal income tax is shared between the RS Budget and local self-governance units (the
         government receives 100% of income tax on copyrights and intellectual property, capital income
         and capital gains and 75% of personal wages and allowances and income from independent work),
         and corporate profit tax belongs to the government.

        Property tax comprises the tax on utilization of state owned wealth, the so-called tax on movable
         property that belongs fully to the Budget of the Republic, and the real estate tax, which comprises
         the tax on inheritance and gifts, while the tax on transfer of real estate and rights was phased out
         upon the effectiveness of the Law on Real Estate Tax. Real estate taxation in RS is performed at
         market value.

In addition to tax revenues, the RS government shares some other revenues with the local self-governance
level: 70% of fees from the change of agricultural land purpose; 50% of rent fees for land owned by the
government; 70% of concession fees for mineral raw materials; revenues from special water fees (with
different shares for different types; for most 70% is shared with local self-governance units); and 30% of
the revenue from confiscated assets. Other revenues of the RS government include administrative taxes
and service and penalty fees from RS government institutions. Local self-governance units in RS have, in
                                                     167


addition to tax revenues, municipal/city administrative, service, and penalty fees and revenues from assets
or natural resources owned by the local self-governance level. In both Entities and in DB the revenue of
EBFs includes social contributions relevant to the specific fund and transfers from the central government
for some funds; and for the public entities for roads, part of indirect taxation revenues and other road fees.

    (i) Transparency and objectivity in the horizontal allocation among subnational governments
As has been noted, concerning indirect taxation sharing, in the past five years there have been political
problems/delays in deciding on the amount BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation revenues
and disputes about final consumption data and consequent delays on decisions on formula for indirect
taxation revenues between the two Entities.

In RS, the flow of information between the RS central government and local self-governance units in the
early budget planning stages is better than in FBiH (both for revenue projection/distribution and for
information such as the amounts and precise timing of debt service payments that significantly affect the
monthly flow of revenue to the lower levels), thus enabling lower levels’ budget planning, facilitated by a
department dedicated to local self-governance units and EBFs within the Budget Sector in the RS MoF.
Furthermore, budget planning byte lower levels of the RS general government sector is managed quite
well in terms of data/information-sharing about needed parameters for budget planning, since RS usually
adopts its medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) on time, regardless of whether the Global
Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH is adopted. The MTEF establishes total revenue
projections, on which each level of the RS general government sector in RS can base their own revenue
projections using shares established in legislation.

Formulas for transfers to sub-national levels (discussed above) are clear and transparent, set in legislation.
In terms of indirect taxation, 24% of RS revenues (after foreign debt servicing is deducted) goes to local
self-governance units (based on population, area, and number of students), and 4% to public entities for
roads. In terms of direct taxes, local self-governance units get 25% of revenue from personal wages and
allowances and income from independent work, while real estate tax revenue(including taxes on the
transfer of immovable property and rights) belongs to local self-governance units.

Dimension rating: B

    (ii) Timeliness of reliable information to the different governments on their allocations
The budget planning process is intended to provide, by April each year, macroeconomic projections and
revenue forecasts on which, in May each year, the Fiscal Council would base the following year’s
allocations of indirect taxation revenues—drawing on the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and
Policies in BiH. Entity governments, cantons, local self-governance units, and road companies could then
be given a credible and timely projection of the resources that would be available to them for the
following year. Thus each level of government would have the information needed to prepare its MTEF
(i.e., fiscal plan for the following three years, see PI-12) and, subsequently, for the forthcoming budget.

Law on Budget System of RS prescribes that upon adoption of RS MTEF by the RS Government,
Ministry of Finance ddistributes MTEF to municipalities, cities and extra-budgetary funds every year on
July 1st. Next, municipalities and cities submit draft budgets to Ministry of Finance (RS MoF can provide
recommendations to municipalities and cities for development of their budget proposals) by November
5th. By December 15th, cities and municipalities adopt their budgets and deliver them to Ministry of
Finance; extra-budgetary funds adopt their annual financial plans.

It has been noted that there are often delays in deciding what portion of the indirect taxation revenues RS
will receive, that the flow of information between the RS central government and local self-governance
units in the early budget planning stages is relatively good, and that the RS usually adopts its MTEF on
                                                           168


time, regardless of whether the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH is adopted.
Thus, the initial revenue sharing assumptions are usually available on time for all general government
sector units in RS (by July 1st), even though late decisions on the share that will go to the of BiH
Institutions can also affect the revenue-sharing assumptions later in budget planning process.

Dimension rating: B

        (iii) Extent of consolidation of fiscal data for general government according to sectoral categories
In terms of consolidation of fiscal data for the whole general government sector in RS, each year the CBBiH
compiles information on consolidated general government revenue and expenditure by economic
classification, including local self-governance units and all EBFs. This is out-turn information only (no
consolidated information is available for budget estimates), and does not include any functional/sectoral
analysis. None of the planned budgets at any level in RS is presented in functional classification; rather, they
show only the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each administrative unit.

Current reporting templates in RS140 already require functional reporting from all general government
levels in line with the COFOG categorization (in 10 main categories); however, in practice, reporting by
function is based on a broad approximation, with likely errors, especially at the lower government levels.
The RS MoF consolidates data (including functional data) and uses them to prepare MTEFs. Budget plans
and execution reports of lower government levels are not consolidated with the RS government reports
that are sent to Parliament. In other words, the consolidation of general government sectors in RS is not
done within RS budgets plans sent to Parliament (the budget which is submitted to adoption to Parliament
only includes RS Government), nor in the budget execution reports sent to Parliament for adoption,
although lower government levels submit their budgets, as well as their budget execution data to RS
Ministry of Finance. However, the MF RS does perform consolidation of the data ofgeneral government
sector in RS, which it uses for reporting to the IMF, for MTEF preparation (albeit at aggregate level) and
for sending data for Global Framework (at even more aggregate level).

PI-9: Oversight of Aggregate Fiscal Risk from Other Public Sector Entities
This indicator assesses whether the government adequately monitors and manages the fiscal risks 141
arising from public sector activities or operations outside its direct control, including (i) the activities of
public enterprises (PEs) and autonomous government agencies (AGAs) financed outside the budget; and
(ii) the activities of subnational governments.

      (i) Extent of monitoring of PEs and AGAs
RS still has many PEs that are the responsibility of the central government or local self-governance units.
When PEs undertake investments that are part of the government’s Public Investment Program (PIP), the
MoF Investment Management Department ensures that the economic and financial case is fully analyzed
and the risks understood. However, projects that are sponsored by other ministries outside this framework
are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. The provision of guarantees for PEs’ borrowing is
controlled by the MoF Debt Management Section, and the PEs concerned are required to report their
annual business plans and financial results to their relevant line ministries; but there is no mechanism in
place to put together an overall view of the fiscal risks they might present to the government.

The Pension, Health, Employment, and Child Protection Funds and the roads maintenance company have
to be considered as AGAs. The Pension Fund’s payment obligations are met if necessary by additional
funding from the budget, while the Road Fund finances its work from its share of indirect tax revenue.
However, the Health Fund’s payment arrears are increasing each year: its short-term liabilities increased
from BAM 87 million at the end of 2011 to BAM 175 million at the end of 2012, partly balanced by a
reduction in liabilities on long-term loans from BAM 234 million at the end of 2011 to BAM 203 million
at the end of 2012. However, its financial position seems to be fully known to the government, even
though the operations of EBFs and road companies are not integrated into one STA with the government.

The rating for this dimension reflects an absence of any consolidated overview of the fiscal risks
presented by PEs.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Extent of central government monitoring of lower-tier governments’ fiscal position
A new 2012 law covering public debt (debt of the central government, local self-governance units, and
social insurance Funds) requires that the debt of the RS general government sector be kept below 55% of
GDP (and below 60%of GDP when PEs, RS Investment-Development Bank, and other public institutions
are included). There is a separate limit on guarantees of 15% of GDP. At the end of 2012 public debt, at
BAM 3770 million, was about 42% of GDP, while guarantees represented a further 2.7%.

Units of local self-governance may borrow in long-term only if in the course of the period of the onset of
debt the total amount that accrues for repayment, on the basis of the proposed debt and the total of
accrued, outstanding existing debt, in any of the subsequent years, does not exceed 18% of the amount of
its regular revenues executed in the preceding fiscal year. RS MoF has to approve any borrowing and
issuance of guarantees of units of local self-governance (regardless of whether it concerns the borrowing
of the unit of local self-governance itself, or its borrowing on behalf of the companies that are in its
ownership). Units of local self-governance submit to the RS MoF monthly and quarterly data on their
debt, and for the purpose of updated keeping of records on total debt of RS. The RS MoF reports to the
MFT BiH on the quarterly basis on the stock of debt and guarantees of units of local self-governance.

PI-11: Orderliness and Participation in the Annual Budget Process
This indicator aims to assess whether budget formulation adheres to a fixed and predictable budget
calendar each year and is organized in a way that facilitates effective participation by budget users. It also
assesses whether the instructions given to budget users for the preparation of their budget submissions
reflect high-level political decisions about the allocation of available funding, and whether the budget
circular fixes spending ceilings within which budget users have to work. Finally, it looks at whether the
budget is approved before the beginning of each fiscal year.

    (i) Existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget are set out in the Law on Budget System of RS.
The budget process for the preparation of the budget of RS government begins in January or February
each year with the distribution of Budget Instructions No. 1, which includes a detailed budget calendar
setting out the requirements, responsibilities, and timelines for each stage of the budget process. In
practice, the budget calendar is fully adhered to despite delays in agreement on the Global Framework in
the Fiscal Council

Table 4.3.17 sets out the budget calendar presented in the 2013 Budget Instructions No. 1 issued on
February 15, 2012, and the actual dates each task was completed during the 2013 budget process. It
should be noted that the deadlines in Table 4.3.17 reflect current actual deadlines in the Law on Budget
Systems of RS, adopted in December 2012. This law was not in force during the 2013 budget preparation,
and in the previous law there were no detailed deadlines for budget procedures, so the deadlines in Table
4.3.17 were based on the overall calendar set by the RS MoF in the instructions to the budget users.

    (ii) Clarity/comprehensiveness in the guidance on the preparation of budget submissions (budget
    circular or equivalent)
Two sets of budget instructions are issued. Budget Instructions No. 1 sets out the detailed guidelines and
instructions for the preparation of Budget User Priority Review Tables, including high-priority new
spending proposals and savings options, consistent with the priorities of the Council of Ministers.
Following the RS government’s approval of the three-year MTEF, the MoF issues Budget Instructions
No. 2, setting out initial budget ceilings for each budget user (in accordance with the MTEF), together
with instructions for the preparation of budget requests.
Budget users are required to prepare their detailed            Table 4.3.18. Date of Enactment of Budget

PI-12: Multiyear Perspective in Fiscal Planning, Expenditure Policy and Budgeting
This indicator refers to the extent to which the governments of BiH plan their fiscal framework,
expenditure policies, and budget plans over the medium term. Four dimensions are considered: (i)
multiyear fiscal forecasts and functional allocations; (ii) scope and frequency of debt sustainability
analysis (DSA); (iii) existence of multiyear costed sector strategies, and (iv) linkages between investment
allocations and forward functional expenditure estimates.
                                                          173


      (i) Preparation of multiyear forecasts
Each year the countrywide Fiscal Council is charged with the responsibility to approve a Global
Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in BiH that sets the overall macroeconomic projections and
projection of indirect taxation revenues within which the BiH Institutions’ and the Entities’ next annual
budgets should fit, with projections extending two further years ahead. Detailed multiyear fiscal
projections for RS are then produced as part of the RS MTEF, 143 including forward estimates of
expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming budget year and the two following
fiscal years).The fiscal forecasts also include estimates of the revenues and expenditures of the local self-
governance units and EBFs.

Once approved by the RS government, the budget year estimates establish the budget users’ budget
ceilings for the forthcoming budget year. However, there is no evidence that the forward estimates are
used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings; thus they do not roll forward, but
instead the MoF effectively rebases the budget and forward estimates for each budget cycle.

The budget and forward estimates in the MTEF are prepared by administrative, economic, and functional
classifications. However, the annual budget proposals are presented only with economic and
administrative classifications, and do not include forward year estimates (while budget requests also
require program budget programs, that information is not included in the annual budget proposal).

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis
The RS MoF maintains an electronic database of external and internal debt, including that of local self-
governance units.RS regularly reviews external and internal debt, including as part of the regular review of
the SBA. The RS MoF Debt Management Sector also submits data to the BiH MFT Debt Management Unit,
which maintains an access database of all internal and external debt of all governments of BiH. According
to RS MoF, DSA for external and domestic debt is undertaken annually, but the analysis is not publicly
available, and the extent to which this DSA goes into details and scenario testing is not clear.

In compliance with the information on debt as of the date of December 31, 2012, the total debt of RS
amounted to BAM 4,669 million, which represents 54.39% of GDP, while the public debt of RS
amounted to BAM 3,770 million, representing 44% of RS GDP for 2012.

The most recent IMF report on the current SBA (Country report 12/344) puts total BiH debt at end-2012 at
43.9% of GDP, of which 28.5% is external. Public external debt is thus not particularly high by international
standards, but it has increased threefold since 2006, in large part because of budget support loans. The Entity
governments’ ability to borrow externally on favorable terms is also constrained by the high level of external
private sector debt not matched by external assets, which corresponds to a further 24% of GDP. Furthermore,
any analysis of debt level in BiH (both countrywide and Entity-specific) should be approached with caution,
given the country’s large infrastructure needs; further potentially large debt segments (such as restitution) that
are currently excluded; and the post-crisis trend of significant debt increases, which included large budget
support loans (spent in part for current expenditure, which still needs structural reform).

While data on debt status are collected regularly and reports on debt stock and servicing projections are
provided, there is no evidence that full, detailed DSAs are performed and publicly available, except for
the regular DSAs prepared by the IMF.

The Law on Borrowing Debt, and Guarantees of BiH stipulates that Advisory Committee for Debt
(comprising of two representatives from State Council of Ministers one of which is the Finance Minister,
one representative from the Central Bank of BiH, two representatives from the Entity Governments
including Finance Ministers, and Finance Directorate director from the Brčko District), which is supposed
to be in charge of preparing state debt management strategy. However, in practice, this has not been
implemented.

Currently, the only debt sustainability analysis is the analysis IMF prepares within their Article IV
Country Reports or periodically in some of the reports in reviews under the SBA (four such analyses were
prepared by the IMF in 2009-2013). Since the IMF debt sustainability analyses have so far been
performed without active participation of the authorities in the preparation process (other than data
provision) and that the authorities do not use this analysis in their strategic planning process (the debt
sustainability analysis is not linked to a specific government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing
policies and needs at any government level (which are large, having in mind large infrastructure needs),
the performance rating for this indicators is reduced.

However, it should be noted that the IMF has recently shared its methodology and instructions in terms of
debt sustainability analysis with the Federal Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Federal
Ministry of Finance stemming from the conclusion of recent FBiH DeMPA prepared by the World Bank,
which also found that no DSAs are undertaken, no sensitivity analyses are used, and no medium-term
debt management strategy has been developed and it recommended that the technical assistance is
provided to the Federal Ministry of Finance for the debt sustainability analysis. Thus, DSA preparation
for the FBiH by the FMF can be expected in future, as it is prescribed by the new Law on Budgets in
FBiH adopted in December 2013 that the debt sustainability analysis will have to be annexed to budget.
The IMF DSA template has also been shared with the MFT in past years. But, given that currently there
is no evidence that the authorities have prepared and used own or IMF DSA in their own strategic
planning process, the rating for this dimension is D.

Dimension rating: D

      (iii) Existence of costed sector strategies
A Draft Development Strategy for BiH was prepared by the Directorate for Economic Planning of the
Council of Ministers and adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the
Council of Ministers or RS government. The Fiscal Council seems to have little political appetite to
endorse such countrywide strategic documents.

In RS some individual ministries do prepare strategic plans. There are currently sector strategies for five
sectors—for example, the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in RS144—
which sometimes include preliminary cost implications, but there is no comprehensive systematic costing
of all strategies. There is no evidence that properly costed strategies represent up to 25% of primary
expenditure.

No costed sector strategies are formally developed for RS as a whole. MTEFs include planned
expenditure levels, but they do not represent truly costed sectoral strategies, as they basically just set up
ceilings per budget user, rather than focusing on costed measures for strategy implementation. The RS
MTEF includes an analysis of “medium-term budget priorities”—covering the forthcoming annual budget
and two following fiscal years—but these priorities generally reflect budget users’ specific individual new

spending initiatives rather than forming part of a broader sector strategy. However, budget and forward
estimates are prepared for each budget user. The Economic Policy Statement that is submitted with the
annual budget proposal also includes the major revenue and expenditure policy announcements.

Dimension rating: D

    (iv) Linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates.
All four governments prepare a rolling three-year PIP. In addition, the BiH MFT Sector for Coordination
of International Economic Assistance prepares a consolidated country PIP. All PIP proposals and funded
investment projects are captured by the Public Investment Management Information System – PIMIS.
PIMIS is the information management system for the management of public development investments
which facilitates all entity and state level budget users online access to planning and monitoring of all
projects/programmes that are defined by the Strategic Framework and mid-term and annual plans and
contribute to the realization of development objectives, and it is maintained by the Sector for
Coordination of International Economic Assistance. The PIP also maintains a donor-mapping database
covering all donor-funded projects in BiH. The PIP information management system is designed to match
public investment proposals with the National Development Plan, once it has been adopted.

The RS MTEF reflects approved and funded projects within the PIP. However, public investment
planning in RS is not wholly integrated: the MoF coordinates a program covering some of the
government’s main objectives, but other investments are planned separately by sectoral ministries. The
use of multiyear estimates in the RS MTEF should ensure that future recurrent costs of completed capital
investment projects are reflected in the MTEF. However, the planning of public investment remains
separate from any development of sector strategies by the Entity government, so there is no basis for the
integration of current and capital expenditure planning.

PI-13: Transparency of Taxpayer Obligations and Liabilities
This indicator examines (i) whether tax legislation and regulations are clear and comprehensive and limit
the discretion of authorities, especially in decisions on tax assessments and exemptions; (ii) whether
taxpayers have easy access to information about tax liabilities and procedures; and (iii) whether there is a
satisfactory tax appeals mechanism.

      (i) Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities
The legislative framework for major taxes includes domestic tax laws, international treaties on avoidance
of double taxation, and the laws governing administrative procedures. While the legislative framework for
major taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, some important aspects of tax application are not very
clearly and consistently reflected in the legislation and interpreted in practice. This mainly relates to the
implementation of important provisions of double taxation treaties (e.g. the determination of tax
residence, reduction of tax upon deduction), and to transfer pricing. Consequently, tax inspectors tend to
apply a fair amount of discretionary powers in determining tax liabilities in these areas.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Taxpayer access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures
Taxpayers have web access to information regarding tax obligations, explanatory notices, and administrative
procedures (www.poreskaupravars.org). There is a network of regional branch offices where taxpayers can obtain
explanations, instructions, and copies of tax records in a short time. During 2012 the taxpayers had access to
information through meetings in person (704 meetings), e-mail enquiries (966), workshops and seminars (6), and
media announcements (25).145An information desk/telephone hotline is available in the central tax office, and
taxpayers’ questions are generally answered in due time and with due professional care. Official interpretations
about tax applicability can be requested at the MoF, and they are generally issued within prescribed deadlines.

Dimension rating: A

      (iii) Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism
The tax appeal system comprises three levels: (a) objection and appeal to the minutes of the tax auditor in
the RS RA office; and an objection may also be lodged concerning real-estate tax; (b) appeal to RS MoF;
and(c) appeal to the District Court, Department for Administrative Disputes. The decision process usually
lasts longer than the timeframe specified in the rules/regulations—the backlog of cases before the court is
such that any decision is likely to take several years. Decisions are not publicly available. Appeals are
reviewed by bodies whose members rarely include experienced professionals from the private sector and
civil society. Issued decisions are binding for all parties, with no discrimination in respect of rights to
appeal.

PI-14: Effectiveness of Measures for Taxpayer Registration and Tax Assessment
This indicator looks at how effective a tax administration is in identifying taxpayers and establishing the
amounts they are liable to pay, using three dimensions: the links between the database of direct taxpayers
and other government databases, including the indirect tax and business licensing databases; the
effectiveness of penalties in inducing taxpayers to register for tax and make the correct declarations about
the amounts of their liabilities; and the planning and monitoring of tax audit programs.

      (i) Controls in the taxpayer registration system
Taxpayers are registered in the central registration system, and the registration process is automated.
Taxpayers are required to have their sales registers electronically linked to the RS RA system (“fiscal
registers”), which enables daily tracking of revenue. Also, there is a complete registration system for real
property (fiscal register) for accurate assessment of taxes on real estate.

Taxpayers are assigned a unique Tax Identification Number (TIN), which is used for all direct taxes. Tax
authorities and taxpayers are obliged to use TINs in all official correspondence. A TIN can also be
assigned to a permanent operating unit of a non-resident or a branch of a company with headquarters
abroad.

The RS central tax registration system is linked to the pension and social security fund system and to the
RS commercial court registry. Under the SBA, on June 12, 2013, the four tax agencies assigned the
Memorandum of Understanding on the exchange of taxpayer information, with a view to facilitating the
permanent, unfettered, and automated sharing of taxpayer records.

Dimension rating: B

      (ii) Effectiveness of penalties for noncompliance with registration and tax declaration

Companies (taxpayers of corporate income tax) are liable to a fixed penalty of 1,000 BAM to 3,000 BAM
for late registration146, as well as for late submission of tax returns. Individual taxpayers (taxpayers of
personal income tax) are liable to a fixed penalty of 500 BAM to 1,500 BAM for late registration, and to a
fixed penalty of 500 BAM to 1,500 BAM for late submission of tax returns.147The penalties appear to be
high enough, but they may not always be an effective deterrent.

      (iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit programs
Tax audit plans (for corporate income tax) are produced monthly and annually. 148 The selection of
taxpayers for audit is based on automated risk assessment criteria, identified from tax declarations entered
into the system. The system runs queries based on indications such as history of noncompliance and size
of profits and revenues. During 2012 there were 4,226 corporate income tax audits and 7,624 controls of
compliance with fiscal registrations.149 Tax audits and fraud investigations are generally reported and
followed up in accordance with the prescribed tax administration procedures.

PI-15: Effectiveness in Collection of Tax Payments
This indicator assesses the performance of a tax administration in actually collecting amounts assessed,
including its degree of success in controlling the build-up of arrears, paying revenue collected
immediately into the Treasury, and thereafter carrying out reconciliations between the accounts of
individual taxpayers and the overall amounts paid to the Treasury.

      (i) Collection ratio for gross tax arrears
Total tax collections related to direct taxes were 419 million BAM150in both2012 and 2011.151 There are
no available data on tax arrears related to direct taxes for 2011 and 2012respectively.

Tax-geared penalties (i.e., a percentage of additionally assessed tax liability) are levied when tax returns
are carelessly or deliberately incorrect, which results in less reported tax liability. Interest is assessed on
late payments of tax.

PI-16: Predictability in the Availability of Funds for Commitment of Expenditures
This indicator assesses the extent to which the government provides reliable information on the
availability of funds to budget users to enable effective resource management. It is intended to measure
performance over the last completed fiscal year before assessment. Three dimensions are considered: (i)
the extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored; (ii) the extent to which budget users can rely
on future cash ability for some period ahead; and (iii) the frequency and transparency of adjustments to
budget allocations imposed on budget users.

    (i) Extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored
The Treasury Department of the RS MoF prepares a monthly cash flow plan taking into account the
expected expenditure profiles provided by budget users. Until the end of 2012 RS government cash flows
had been managed so as to avoid any expenditure arrears. An exception is the Health Fund, whose arrears
have been increasing steadily since 2009; the Treasury has been fully informed about this.

Experience in RS has been that budget users may commit up to the limits of their budget allocations as
approved by the National Assembly, provided that their payment requests remain within the progressive
payments of funding by MoF through the year.

The cash is being paid monthly to budget users based on operational plans, in line with relevant
legislation (Law on Budget System), based on financial plans.

Dimension rating: A
      (iii) Frequency and transparency of adjustments to budget allocations imposed on budget users
A “rebalanced” budget was enacted in 2012 to meet IMF conditions under the SBA, cutting expenditure on
both pay and goods and services. The changes had to be approved by the National Assembly, and were
therefore carried out with full transparency. The transfer of provision from one budget user to another within
the approved aggregate budget can take place only by agreement of the government,152 but the approval of the
Assembly is only required for overall increases or imposed general reductions.

PI-17: Recording and Management of Cash Balances, Debt, and Guarantees
This indicator looks at debt management in terms of contracting, servicing and repayment, and the
provision of government guarantees, including the following dimensions:

          maintenance of a debt data system and regular reporting on main features of the debt portfolio;
          identification and consolidation of cash balances in all government bank accounts (including
           those for EBFs and government-controlled project accounts); and
          the proper recording and reporting of government-issued guarantees, and the approval of all
           guarantees by a single government entity (e.g., the ministry of finance or a debt management
           commission) against adequate and transparent criteria.

      (i) Quality of debt data recording and reporting
As has been noted, the responsibility for the servicing of virtually all external debt of the country is on the
entities, apart from a very small part of the direct external state debt, although payments related to the
servicing of external debt are executed through BiH Institutions. Since BiH is ultimate guarantor for
essentially the entire IFI foreign debt (regardless of whether the Entities are using it and repaying it), all

loans must be approved by the Council of Ministers of BiH, BiH Presidency, and BiH Parliament. The
same requirements apply to external guarantees of BiH (regardless of whether the Entities are final users).

CBBiH publishes quarterly figures for total external public debt.

RS has a centralized management of debt and reporting on debt, with borrowing that is constrained by
Law and controlled. RSNA has to approve each borrowing and issuance of guarantees of Republika
Srpska. The RS MoF regularly collects monthly and quarterly data on debt and guarantees, for the
purpose of keeping updated records on debt, guarantees, and indirect debt of Republika Srpska, debt and
guarantees of units of local self-governance, and the debt of social security funds, it prepares projections
of debt servicing, performs debt sensitivity analysis, monitors the legislated limits for borrowing, and
prepares reports on the stock of total debt of Republic of Srpska, including a detailed analysis of the
structure, the stock, and the servicing of the aforementioned debt, on which it reports to the RSNA on
annual basis. The RS MoF has to issue consent to each borrowing of units of local self-governance
(regardless of whether it concerns the borrowing of the unit of local self-governance itself or its
borrowing on behalf of a company that is in its ownership), as well as issuance of guarantees of units of
local self-governance.

The RS MoF must be notified of any new borrowing by municipalities/cities. A quarterly report of the
outstanding external and domestic debt is required as part of the surveillance under the SBA. Annual
reports are made to Parliament, but are not on the MoF website.

Quarterly reports are made in the context of IMF surveillance under the SBA. The MFT Debt Management
Sector at the BiH Institutions level maintains a database of both internal and external debt at all levels of
government of BiH, based on a regular exchange of information with the Entities and DB. The RS MoF also
has a database covering the general government sector in RS. There do not seem to be delays in debt
reporting from lower levels of the general government sector in RS.A detailed analysis of the entire public
external and internal debt stock and debt servicing of the State and the Entities, prepared by the MFT of BiH,
is also given in the BiH Institutions MTEF (including debt stock information and debt repayment
projections)153 and in annual reports of the Debt Stock of BiH that the MFT prepares.154 Each quarterly
execution report for the budget of BiH Institutions includes detailed information on foreign debt servicing,
and the annual budget plans of BiH Institutions include detailed projections of foreign debt servicing.

The RS MoF prepares information on the stock of total RS debt, accompanied by the detailed analysis of
the structure, the stock, and the servicing of aforementioned debt, for the purpose of reporting to the
RSNA, and the review of debt is also provided within the Consolidated Report on Budget Execution, as
well as in the RS Budget Framework Document for the mid-term.155

Limited debt sustainability analysis is usually presented in the reports. However, the preparation of the
full debt sustainability analysis for RS is being planned for the forthcoming period, as an integral part of
the process of improvement of debt management, which is being implemented in cooperation with the
World Bank team, as well as within the IPA projects.

      (iii) Systems for contracting loans and issuing guarantees
All the borrowing of Republika Srpska and of units of local self-governance, as well as the issuance of
guarantees of RS and units of local self-governance is under control of the RS MoF – Section for Debt
Management and Section for Budget and Finance.

The Section for Debt Management in the RS MoF is in charge of debt management in RS, as well as for
the monitoring and reporting on the overall debt of RS. The basic functions of the Section are the
following: participating in the drafting of laws and bylaws that regulate the area of internal and external
borrowing and guarantees, participating in the preparation of projects and in negotiations, preparation of
decisions on borrowing, monitoring of realization of international aid; cooperation with project
implementation units, credit beneficiaries, competent line ministries, domestic and international
institutions, collecting and systematizing cumulative data on contracted and realized international credits
and grants, preparation and drafting of the budget and the three-years based budget framework paper in
the part that concerns debt, performance of tasks relating to the issuance of guarantees and issuance of
securities of RS, implementation of the procedure of issue and sale of securities, keeping records on
borrowing, debt, guarantees, preparing reports and official information on borrowing, guarantees of RS,
the management of the debt portfolio, taking into account the sources, the maturity, the currency and
interest rate structure, as well as the monitoring and suggesting options for indebtedness in compliance
with legislated limits.

RS may also contract direct internal and external borrowing, within the binding limits prescribed by the
Law. Any borrowing of Republika Srpska demands an approval of the RS Government and the RSNA.
The issuance of guarantees is defined in the same legal framework as the borrowing.

Government policy156 is based on the recently installed legal limit to keep total public debt below 55% of
GDP.157However, this policy has not yet been linked to fiscal targets in the context of medium-term fiscal
planning, as is required for the highest rating on this dimension.

PI-18: Effectiveness of Payroll Controls
Payroll and related charges represent a significant percentage of current costs of the RS budget. This
indicator is intended to cover all significant government payrolls —that is, all civil servants and other
government employees, including people employed in the health and education services and EBFs. Four
dimensions are considered: (i) the degree of integration between personnel records and the payroll; (ii) the
timeliness of changes to personnel and payroll records; (iii) the operation of internal controls over
changes to personnel records and the payroll; and (iv) the existence of payroll audits to identify control
weaknesses and/or ghost workers.

    (i) Degree of integration and reconciliation between personnel records and payroll data
The Civil Service Agency (CSA) is responsible for producing shortlists for all appointments in central
governments, including vacancies for promotion, but the final choice rests with the organizations
concerned. The RS MoF Treasury performs the payment of wages for central government employees, but
not for employees of the Pension, Health, and Employment Funds, which are not subject to central
financial controls. The treasury performs centralized payment of wages upon the order of the budget
organizations keeping the payrolls of employees. In the course of the year 2013, the realization of the
project for the centralized calculation of wages had started, and its completion and commissioning is
expected from January 1, 2015. Overall, substantial improvement is needed.

Dimension rating: D

    (ii) Timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll
CSA stated that the procedures for appointments and promotions (including notifications to the tax
authorities) are normally completed within a month, thereby largely removing any need for retroactive
pay adjustments. No detailed information was available about the number of retroactive adjustments to
monthly salary payments.

Dimension rating: B

    (iii) Internal controls of changes to personnel records and the payroll
Although the responsibilities of employing authorities, CSA, and the Treasury are clear, so that
substantive changes to the payroll should provide an audit trail, it does not appear that the individual
amounts employing authorities provide each month for their staff, including payment of the different
allowances in addition to salaries, are adequately controlled.

Dimension rating: C

    (iv) Existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers
The SAI performs regular financial audit of the entire central government, and therefore all the
institutions of the central government have been subject to financial audit at least once in the last 3.

In the course of auditing the calculation and payment of salaries for employees in public sector
institutions the auditors perform tests on the basis of samples, applying all relevant ISA standards and
ISSAI guidelines (1000-1700). The type and the size of the sample of wages depends on the level of
assessed risk and the level of preliminary materiality. The auditors check the following, at the minimum:
the number of employees (on the basis of personnel records and records of truancy, comparing it all with
the number of employees for whom the calculation of wages has been performed and payrolls),
calculation and payments of wages (summaries for all months, calculation for at least 4 months, if
necessary more; individual calculations by groups of employees, and for certain months for all
employees), lists and accounts into which payments are being made, as well as orders for bookkeeping
entries. Auditors use checklists and software for the requirements of testing whether the salaries have
been paid correctly, and for the tests of analytical and summary records for payments executed,

PI-19: Competition, Value for Money, and Controls in Procurement
This indicator was assessed only on the level of the BiH Institutions. Accordingly, the PI for FBiH, RS,
and DB has been rated as N/A (not applicable).



PI-20: Effectiveness of Internal Controls over Non-salary Expenditure
This indicator assesses the effectiveness of internal controls over non-salary expenditure, considering
three dimensions: (i) the effectiveness of controls over the commitment of expenditure; (ii) the
comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of internal control rules and procedures; and (iii) the
degree of compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions. The controls should ensure
that expenditure is incurred, and payments made, only when fully justified in accordance with budgetary
provisions, and when all applicable regulations (including those concerning procurement) have been
complied with.
                                                            185


      (i) Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls
The current arrangements prevent the Treasury system from making payments that would exceed the
amounts of funds released on the relevant budget line.RS has enacted new legislation that provides
statutory backing for efforts to strengthen financial management and control and internal audit throughout
the Entity. The financial management information system allows for the registration of expenditure
commitments at the time they are made. The requirement for spending units to comply with this applies
for all budget users within the budget of Government of RS (Law on Budget System prescribes that
liabilities cannot be above budget plan or available resources). However, the Audit Reports note that there
are cases when liabilities are higher than available. Thus, rating is C, since expenditure commitment
control procedures exist and are partially effective, but they may not comprehensively cover all
expenditures or they may occasionally be violated.158

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of other internal control rules/procedures
In recent years the RS Central Harmonization Unit (CHU) has coordinated continuing efforts to improve
discipline in financial management and control in the spending units. New legislation and procedures
have been introduced, and training has been given to the responsible officials in the spending units. The
CHU, which is responsible for coordinating financial management and control, and for developing
internal audit throughout the government and local self-governance units, produces an annual progress
report. The SAI stated that in its view the performance of spending units has improved, however it is
noted that implementation of actual activities is still not full and that rules and procedures are not
complete. 159

Dimension rating: D

      (iii) Degree of compliance with rules for the processing and recording of transactions
All government transactions pass through the STA, and since January 1, 2013, this has now been
extended to local self-governance units. Continuing efforts are being made to strengthen internal control
procedures throughout general government, coordinated by the CHU, and drawing on EU assistance
under the IPA program. However, SAI states that there are cases of incompliance (identified by budget
inspections) and that rules and procedures are not complete.160

PI-21: Effectiveness of Internal Audit
This indicator looks at the functioning of internal audit services as distinct from the internal control
operations reviewed in PI-20. The internal audit function considered here is defined as an advisory service
to top management on the functioning of the systems for which management is responsible; internal audit
is by definition separated from any operational responsibility for the systems. Three dimensions are
considered: (i) the coverage and quality of the internal audit function; (ii) the frequency and distribution
of reports; and (iii) the extent of management responses to internal audit findings.

      (i) Coverage and quality of the internal audit function
Although more auditors still need to be recruited and trained, RS has made a start on the introduction of
internal audit, and reports are being produced in the majority of ministries and local self-governance
units. The principal legislation, regulations, and operating instructions are all in place, and they provide
for work to be done in accordance with international professional standards. Training is being given to
internal audit staff. The managers of units for internal audit prepare, and the managers of organizations
receive strategic and annual plans, as well as annual reports on activities of internal audit. The manager of
RS CHU prepares the annual consolidated report of internal audit, and, pending the consent of the
Minister of Finance, submits it to the Republika Srpska Government.161However, the RS CHU does not
approve the work plans of the internal audit units, nor does it automatically receive all their reports. In
2011 RSCHU published a consolidated report on internal financial control (including internal
audit),162which noted that the function of internal audit had been established in 18 institutions of the
public sector with 27 internal auditors in total. The report did not discuss particular internal audits
conducted during 2011. However, it did state that the RSCHU regards the internal audit function as not
yet fully operational until the standards it has prescribed are fully met. SAI Report for 2012 notes that
only two internal audits were performed in 2012 for RS Government level – for MoF and for Ministry of
Economic Relations and Regional Cooperation. Two internal audit reports were made available for this
review, one for the city of Bijeljina and one for the MoF, both covering 2012. It is clear from these
reports that the internal audit function remains exclusively focused on compliance. Attention now needs
to be paid to systems efficiency and value for money. SAI notes that internal audit is still not being
implemented since the staff is only now being trained to conduct such audits and there is no evidence that
at least 20% of staff time is dedicated to systems reviews, thus rating D is assigned.

Dimension rating: D

      (ii) Frequency and distribution of reports
Reports are issued in accordance with internal audit units’ work plans, and summaries are reported to the
CHU in annual reports. It will also give more information about the recommendations made and the
responses to them. Auditor time on each audit is being monitored with a view to increasing productivity
and efficiency. The coverage remains very limited, and the capacity of the CHU needs to be strengthened

so that lessons learned can be exploited throughout the government. According to Law on Internal Audit
in RS,163 internal audit reports for audited institutions are submitted to heads of audited institutions upon
completion of each individual audit, and the annual report is also submitted to the RS SAI. Upon request
of the RS SAI such reports can be delivered to any legislative, executive or judiciary organ as well.
Consolidated annual reports prepared by the CHU are submitted to the RS Government, upon approval of
the Minister of Finance of RS. It is also submitted to all legislative, executive, or judicial body and
relevant external auditor, based on their request. Thus, while internal audit coverage is very limited, for
the purpose of PEFA rating for this indicator, B rating is appropriate since reports are issued regularly for
most audited entities and distributed to the audited entity, the ministry of finance and the SAI.

Dimension rating: B

      (iii) Extent of management response to internal audit findings
According to the CHU, managers make some response to most reports, although the scope and quality of
the responses has so far been limited. SAI notes that in response to an internal audit of loans and
receivables done in 2012 by the CHU of Ministry of Finance in 2012, only a portion of recommendations
have been addressed.

on a daily basis, and further advances are not paid to contractors until the previous advances have been
cleared. Furthermore, the recording of more detailed information relating to each transaction as a result of
improvements to the CoA should have reduced any possible need to keep transactions in suspense
accounts.

PI-23: Availability of Information on Resources Received by Service Delivery Units
This indicator asks whether normal administrative and accounting systems provide reliable information
about the resources received by primary schools and primary health clinics, whatever level of government
is responsible for their operation.

In RS the provision of school education is the responsibility of the central government, which determines
what resources should be allocated to each school in terms of staff and provision for goods and services,
including utilities and maintenance. Schools may secure additional resources through charges for the use of
their facilities and through donations, which are reported in out-turn statements. However, healthcare is
provided through the Health Fund, which commissions services for its subscribers (the government pays
contributions on behalf of the unemployed) from health institutions that may belong to local self-governance
units, voluntary organizations, or the private sector, and that are operated separately from the Health Fund.
Nevertheless, information about the spending of health clinics is collected annually by the Health Fund and
made available to the Ministry of Health.164 Since schools and hospitals are in Treasury system and prepare
annual reports on cash and in-kind resources received, information is routinely available about resources
received by individual schools as well as primary health clinics and the rating is A.

   RS Health Fund provided the research team with a table containing data on expenditures and revenues of each health
institution in the RS for years 2005 through 2011.

PI-24: Quality and Timeliness of In-year Budget Reports
This indicator reviews three aspects of in-year budget execution reporting: (i) the scope of reports and the
extent to which comparisons are possible with budget estimates on an administrative, economic, and
functional basis, with commitments covered separately from payments; (ii) the timeliness of reports; and
(iii) the quality of the information.

      (i)Scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates
Data on actual expenditures are prepared in the same format as the annual budget —that is, by economic
and administrative classification. The reports cover both payments and commitments.165

Dimension rating: A

      (ii) Timeliness of the issue of reports
Year-to-date financial reports are produced daily by the Treasury system. According to Article 26 of the
Rulebook on Financial Reporting, ministries are required to deliver quarterly budget execution reports to
the MoF 25 days after the end of each quarter.166

PI-25: Quality and Timeliness of Annual Financial Statements
This indicator examines (i) whether a government produces annual financial statements containing full
information about revenue and expenditure, and financial assets and liabilities;(ii) whether the statements
are submitted for audit within a short period after the end of each year; and (iii) whether they are prepared
in accordance with accounting standards broadly in line with International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS).

    (i) Completeness of the financial statements

The annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with Article 41 of the Law on the Budget
System of RS and contain full information on revenue and expenditure, and financial assets and liabilities.
The detailed instructions reflect the government’s decision to adopt IPSAS

Dimension rating: A

    (ii) Timeliness of submission of annual financial statements
All financial statements of budget users are submitted to the Ministry of Finance of Republika Srpska
within the deadlines stipulated by Law, and consolidated financial statements are, in addition to that, also
submitted to the Agency for Intermediary, Information Technology, and Financial Services, with
headquarters in Banja Luka. In addition, the deadlines for preparation and presentation of individual and
consolidated financial statements are stipulated in budgetary regulations that are in effect in RS (The Law
on the Budget System of RA and the relevant bylaws), as well as the Law on Accounting and Audit of
Republika Srpska. Annual financial statements are submitted by the end of February of the current year
for the preceding year, and consolidated statements are submitted by the end of April at the latest of the
current year for the preceding year.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Accounting standards used
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Rulebook on Accounting, Accounting
Policies and Accounting Assessments for Budget Users in RS, the Rulebook on Criteria for Acquiring the
Status of a Budget User, the Rulebook on Budget Classifications, Contents of Accounts, and Application
of the Chart of Accounts for Users of Revenues of the Budgets of the Republic, Municipalities, Cities,
and Funds, and the Rulebook on the Application of International Accounting Standards for the Public
Sector. All the documents are available on the MoF website. These instructions reflect the government’s
decision to adopt international accounting standards. However, the financial statements for the public
sector are compiled on a modified accruals basis in RS. Therefore, not all aspects of cash-based or
accruals IPSAS are adopted and applied in practice. In addition, the latest available translation of IPSAS
into the local language dates from2011.

As of 2012, all of the 31 IPSAS standards that define accrual basis for budgetary accounting were
implemented, except for IPSAS 23 (taxes and transfers). Until 2013, revenues were recorded on a
modified cash basis, while from 2013, accrual accounting is supposed to be enforced in terms of revenue
recognition as well. However, accrual recognition of public revenue will be used only for income

planning and budget execution reporting, the modified cash basis will continue to be used.

PI-26: Scope, Nature, and Follow-up of External Audit
This indicator looks at the work of the SAI and its contribution to satisfactory public financial
management. Three dimensions are considered: (i) the range and quality of the audit work performed; (ii)
the timeliness of the submission of audit reports to the legislature, particularly the report on the
consolidated annual financial statements; and (iii) the evidence available about audited bodies’ follow-up
of the SAI’s recommendations, and the SAI’s follow-up in subsequent audits.

      (i) Scope/nature of audit performed
Like the SAIs of the BiH Institutions and FBiH, the RS SAI has over several years benefitted from the
assistance of the Swedish SAI, including most recently support in the execution of performance audits.
Staff have been well trained, and work is performed in accordance with INTOSAI standards. The SAI
uses a financial audit manual developed by the Coordination Board made up of the BiH and two Entity
SAIs, which implements those standards. A few performance audit reports are produced each year in
addition to reports on financial and compliance audit. The audit remit extends to central government; the
Pension, Health, Employment, and Child Protection Funds; SOEs; and 70 local self-governance units.
There are 57 staff to cover a total annual expenditure of around BAM 4 billion. Because of the
considerable number of bodies to be audited, annual coverage is limited, and some smaller municipalities
are audited only occasionally. However, the SAI determines its detailed coverage each year according to
its judgment of the risks, based on previous experience, size of turnover, and time elapsed since the last
detailed audit. When there are known problems of expenditure arrears—as in the case of the Health Fund.
However, the audit of the Health Insurance Fund is performed regularly, each year, regardless of the
degree of problems noticed in its operations.

According to RS SAI, in 2012 the coverage of financial audit was around 95% of expenditure at both RS
Government and local self-governance level. As at least 75% of central government entities’ expenditure
is audited annually, at least covering revenue and expenditure, and since a wide range of financial audits
are performed and generally adheres to auditing standards, focusing on significant and systemic issues,
the rating is B.

      (ii) Timeliness of submission of audit reports to the legislature
The budget users submit their financial statements to the SAI by the end of June in accordance with the
main budget law, and the SAI reports to RS National Assembly by the end of September each year. This
timetable has been observed.

Dimension rating: A

      (iii) Evidence of follow-up on audit recommendations
The SAI seeks to follow up its own recommendations, and also seeks Parliamentary support. However,
the RS National Assembly has given only muted support to the work of the SAI, and in 2010, against the
advice of its Audit Board (the committee responsible for reviewing audit reports), it refused to endorse
the report and recommendations. Moreover it has adopted a resolution requesting the SAI to agree with
MoF on the volume, coverage, and criteria of audit work, which threatens to undermine the SAI’s
independence. The SAI informed the review team that there has been a reduction in the number of
qualified audit opinions; however support for the work of the SAI in legislature could be improved.

Also the audited budget users have 15 days upon receipt of the draft SAI auditor’s report, to object
findings and provide additional evidence if necessary. The SAI is obliged to take these formal objections
into consideration and modify its report if the justifications are reasonable. The details on the audits
conducted as well as on the number of objections received by the SAI, are published in SAI’s annual
report.168

PI-27: Legislative Scrutiny of the Annual Budget Law
This indicator is concerned with whether the RS NA undertakes a comprehensive and timely review of
the annual budget proposed by the executive government. It takes into account the review of the budgets
for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fiscal years. Four dimensions are considered: (i) the scope of the
Assembly’s scrutiny; (ii) whether the Assembly’s procedures in considering the budget are well
established and respected; (iii) whether the Assembly has sufficient time for its review of budget

proposals; and (iv) the extent of possible in-year changes to the budget without prior approval by the
Assembly.

      (i) Scope of the scrutiny by Parliament
Although the MTEF is an integral part of the budget planning process in RS, it is not formally reviewed
and adopted by the RS National Assembly. Only the annual budget is considered and adopted by the RS
National Assembly.

The RS government submits the RS Economic Policy paper with updated macroeconomic and fiscal
forecasts as well as the government’s specific policy announcements along with the annual budget
proposal. However, the operations of the EBFs are not included in the government’s presentation of the
overall fiscal outlook.

The Annual RS Budget and the Law on RS Budget Execution is reviewed by the majority of committees
of the RS National Assembly, before they are submitted to parliamentary procedure for adoption.
Representatives of RS Government and RS MoF are required to attend the discussions in aforementioned
boards, as well as to discussions at the session of the RS NA in the course of adoption of aforementioned
documents.169

      (iv) Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the legislature
The Law on Budget Systems of RS allows for amendments to budget allocations within the approved
budget without prior approval by the RSNA. The extent of allowable reallocations is set in each year’s
budget execution law. The 2012 Budget Execution Law allows the RS government to reallocate resources
on the basis of the MoF’s recommendation within the total amount approved for each particular budget user.
Reallocation between budget users within the overall approved total also requires the approval of the
government: according to Article 13 of the 2012 Budget Execution Law, each budget user’s total adopted
budget can be reduced by a maximum of 5% to carry out such reallocations.170

       (i) Timeliness of examination of audit reports by the legislature (for reports received within the last
       three years
The Law on Audit of the Public Sector of RS (Article 21)171 specifies the deadlines for the submission of
audit reports on the financial statements of budget users. In accordance with the Law on Budget System
of RS (Article 58), the MoF should complete each year’s consolidated annual financial statement by May
20 of the following year. The SAI is then required to deliver its audit report on the consolidated annual
financial statement to the RS NA within 90 days after receiving it from the government. The dates of
submission and adoption of the last three audit reports are set out in Table 4.3.36.

Assembly completes its work within three                           Table 4.3.36. Schedule of Audit Report Dates to

RS NA usually considers the reports and adopts conclusions on reports without any further amendments.

The Audit Board does not issue recommendations to impose sanctions on budget users for noncompliance
with the recommendations of the RS SAI. The RS NA did not participate with the BiH Institutions and
FBiH Parliamentary Assemblies in the UK DFID’s technical assistance program to improve their capacity
to make effective use of audit reports in pressing for improvements in public financial management.

         IV. ASSESSMENT OF PFM SYSTEMS, PROCESSES, AND INSTITUTIONS

                                            DISTRICT BRČKO
                             Executive Summary – Brčko District
For the purposes of applying the PEFA performance indicators, data and information from FY 2009 –
2011 were used in the calculations and for scoring the indicators, with more current information used for
some indicators where such information was available.

I. Integrated Assessment of PFM Performance

A. PFM Out-Turns: Credibility of the Budget
Aggregate expenditure out-turns for the three fiscal years used in this Report (2009 to 2011) in Brčko
District (DB) demonstrate a consistent underspending relative to planned spending targets, resulting from
delays in execution of capital projects. The composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original
approved budget also shows significant variances from the original approved budget.

Indirect taxation is the most important revenue source, comprising 64% of total DB consolidated revenues,
and its collection is outside the control of the DB administration, and subject to delays. Nevertheless total
revenue outturn performs reasonably in line with the approved budget; except in FY09 which showed 12.8
percent underperformance.

In common with the other three governments, DB also has not established a common definition of
spending arrears nor the invoice due dates currently being entered in the accounting system. However
according to data collected from the Directorate of Finance, DB does not have any accumulated arrears.

B. Key Cross-Cutting Issues: Comprehensiveness and Transparency
The DB government presents its budget showing the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each
administrative unit as well as a breakdown into 14 functions, based on which the 10 main COFOG
functions can be extracted. The government maintains a Treasury system through which all transactions
pass and provides for consistent comparisons between budgeted and actual out-turns on administrative,
functional, and economic classifications.

The DB budget documentation is reasonably comprehensive when compared to the norms presented in
the PEFA methodology. However the documentation omits: (i) macroeconomic assumptions; (ii) detailed
information on debt; (iii) details on financial assets. In addition the current year’s budget is not presented in
the same format as the budget proposals.

DB maintains its own Health Insurance Fund, Employment Fund, and Public Entity JP Putevi Brčko
outside the budget; however, these funds detailed revenues and expenditures are presented to the
Assembly alongside the budget. Out-turn statements are also published. There are no other significant
government expenditures that are part of the budget.

DB has hitherto undertaken only one investment project: The District if Brčko Water Supply Project,
which had been financed in part from external sources, by a loan amounting to € 4,96 million fro m Bank
Austria Creditanstalt AG, and in part from domestic sources, by a loan of the Hypo Alpe-Adria- Bank
a.d., Banja Luka amounting to BAM 6.87 million. In principle, and based on these examples, all
investment projects are shown in the budget with their sources of financing however their execution is
subject to delays in the procurement process and the approval of the annual budget by the Assembly.
                                                    198



In DB the public has access to a broad range of fiscal information including: (i) budget proposals, (ii)
year-end financial statements, (iii) external audit reports, (iv) contract awards, and (v) information about
the resources available to schools. Currently the public does not have access to in-year budget execution
reports.

C(i).Policy-Based Budgeting
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget are set out in the Law on Budgets of the DB. In
practice budget approval has been delayed since 2010; for a variety of reasons including elections and
failure to reach agreement on budget ceilings. The ultimate constraint is that the budget must be adopted
by March 31, when the legal authority for temporary financing at the same rate as the previous year
expires.

Multiyear fiscal forecasts are produced as part of the process leading to the preparation of the DB MTEF,
including forward estimates of expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming
budget year and two following fiscal years). However, forward estimates are not used to anchor the
preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings.

The DB Directorate of Finance maintains an electronic database of external and internal debt and
exchanges information with the MFT of BiH Institutions. External and internal debt is regularly reviewed,
including as part of the regular review of the IMF SBA. DB also submits data to the BiH MFT Debt
Management Unit, which maintains an access database of all internal and external debt of all BiH
governments. The stock of debt of Brčko District as ofthe date of December 31, 2013, inclusive of
interest, amounts to BAM 46.5 million, of which BAM 33.9 million concerns internal debt, while BAM
12.6 million concerns external debt. While data on debt status are collected regularly and reports on debt
stock and servicing projections are provided, DSAs are not performed, except for the regular DSAs
prepared by the IMF.

A Draft Development Strategy for BiH (with specific action plans separately for BiH Institutions, FBiH,
RS, and DB) was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the Council of Ministers of BiH
and was adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the Council of Ministers or
RS government. DB has a Development Strategy for 2008-2017, but the strategy lacks cost information.
While there are sector strategies they lack cost information. The DB MTEF includes an analysis of
“medium-term budget priorities”, but these priorities generally reflect budget users’ specific individual
new spending initiatives rather than forming part of a broader sector strategy. Budget and forward
estimates are, however prepared for each budget user.

C(ii). Predictability and Control in Budget Execution
Legislation and procedures for all major taxes are comprehensive and clear, and the discretionary powers
of the tax inspectors are fairly limited. Taxpayers have access to some information on tax liabilities, but
the availability of the information is limited. The DB Tax Administration (TA) maintains a website
containing only copies of relevant laws. Taxpayers usually obtain information upon request (through
meetings, e-mails, or telephone calls). Education campaigns or workshops for taxpayers are rarely
organized. The DB TA issues individual tax certificates confirming tax liabilities, but the confirmed
amounts are not always accurate.

The tax appeal system comprises three levels: (a) objection and appeal to the DB RA; (b) appeal to the
independent Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and (c) appeal to the Administrative Court of DB. The
decision process usually lasts longer than the timeframe specified in the rules/regulations. Decisions are
                                                     199


not publicly available. The tax appeals system is set up and functional; however, decisions are often not
issued within the prescribed timeframe.

Tax audit plans are produced annually by the chief inspectors of DB RA and submitted to the head of the
Tax Audit Department. The selection of taxpayers for audit is based on clearly defined risk assessment
criteria, identified from tax declarations entered into the system. The system runs queries based on
indications such as history of noncompliance and size of profits and revenues.

The total amount of tax collections in DB in 2011 was 16.8 million BAM. The average debt collection
ratio in 2011 was above 90% for major taxes. However, because of omissions related to incorrect manual
entry into the system by DB RA officials, the assessed amount personal income tax (from employment)
was under-recorded by 7.5 million BAM. The total amount of tax collections for 2012 was 22.6 million
BAM. The average debt collection ratio was above 80%. The personal income tax (from employment)
assessment was also under-recorded in 2012, but it improved significantly in relation to 2011: tax
assessments amounted to 5.8 million BAM, and tax collections amounted to 8.4 million BAM—an
underassessment of 30%.

Noncompliance with payment obligations is subject to penalties. Tax-related penalties (i.e., percentage of
additionally assessed tax liability) are levied for matters such as tax returns that are carelessly or
deliberately incorrect, which results in unreported tax liability. Interest is assessed on late payments. DB
RA does not issue reminders for late tax payments, which has hampered the collection of tax arrears.

Taxpayers remit payments into commercial bank accounts. Instructions for bank payments are clearly
prescribed in the applicable legislation; direct cash payments in DB RA offices are prohibited. Transfers
of revenue collections to the Treasury Account are made daily. However there is an absence of complete
reconciliation of tax assessments, collections, and arrears.

Full details are published about the small amounts of debt owed by DB. Apart from the Health Insurance
and Employment Funds, cash balances are all consolidated in the STA. Borrowing on any terms is tightly
controlled by the Directorate of Finance. However, there are no links between borrowing and fiscal
targets.

Personnel records are the responsibility of the Human Resources Management Authority (HRMA), which
functions separately outside the Directorate of Finance. Payroll is under the control of a special section in
Directorate of Finance. Databases for payroll and for personnel records are not directly linked and are not
mutually consistent in term of data nor updated and reconciled on a monthly basis. Delays of up to three
months can occur. Payroll data is updated when the data is submitted to Tax Administration. There are
cases of retroactive adjustments. No audits specifically focused on the payroll have been undertaken in
recent years.

The legal framework for procurement is clear and readily accessible to the public. Open competition is
the default method. The publication of tender notices and contract awards is transparent, with information
publicly available via the PPA’s website. However, there is no public access to procurement plans or to
results of recent complaints.

Since there is widespread criticism by auditors, and frequent complaints by tenderers are upheld by the Public
Procurement Review Board (PRB), it is clear that the exceptions to open procedures are not properly justified
in many cases. Information is limited to bidding opportunities in the form of procurement plans (though
these plans are not usually published) and contract awards. No information is available on results of
complaints in spite of legal requirements. Although the PRB has managed to issue many decisions, it
lacks sufficient human resources to fulfil all its functions quickly and efficiently.
                                                   200


DB considers that the current control arrangements effectively prevent payments from being made
beyond the budgetary provision for them. However, some processes are missing and detailed procedural
rules and processes are not well defined. Internal control rules are increasing being implemented although
further improvements in financial management and control are still needed in spending units.

DB has not yet taken any action to provide or implement internal audit.

C(iii). Accounting, Recording and Reporting
There are daily reconciliations between Treasury and bank records of transactions of the STA. However,
the EBF’s accounts are not covered by the STA. The Treasury ensures that advances are cleared without
delay, with only few suspense accounts existing.

In DB, schools fall directly under the authority of government. In DB government systems identify the
resources allocated to each school at both the budget (planning) and out-turn stages. The payments by
which schools may earn funds through fees or charges raised for the use of school facilities and through
donations, which are accounted for in out-turn statements, are paid into the BD Single Treasury Account.
Accounting system provides reliable information on both cash and in kind resources received by schools.
Financial resources for health services are provided through the Health Insurance Fund, which is financed
mainly through contributions Health Insurance Fund revenues and expenditures are reported to the
Assembly alongside the budget, but not the expenditures of individual clinics, or health facilities. While
information is routinely available regarding resources received by individual schools, this is not the case
for resources received by health care facilities.

Quarterly data on actual expenditures are prepared in the same format as the annual budget —that is, by
economic and administrative classifications. The reports are prepared on a cash but not a commitments
basis. The quarterly budget reports are submitted to the District Assembly within four weeks after the end
of the quarter. The reports are produced in spreadsheets rather than being generated directly from the
Treasury system, however the SAI does not report any major problems with the accuracy of the data
presented in the reports.

The consolidated annual financial statements include full information on revenue and expenditure, and
financial assets and liabilities. The lengthy delays in the District Assembly’s adoption of each year’s
budget have resulted in some delays in the Directorate of Finance’s submission of the financial statements
for audit.

The accounting standards applied are defined by the 2008 Decision on Establishing Accounting Policies
for Budget Users and Treasury of DB. DB aims to comply with IPSAS, but this does not necessarily
mean that IPSAS are being consistently applied, bearing in mind that accounting and reporting are mainly
done on a modified accruals basis. The latest available translation of IPSAS is from 2011, so recent
revisions of the standards are not being applied.

C(iv). External Audit and Scrutiny
DB has its own SAI (Office for Audit of Public Administration of District Brčko). It conducts a range of
financial, compliance audits and has also undertaken 4 performance audits and has full audit coverage of
all government operations, including those of the Health Insurance Fund and local public utilities. Central
government entities representing at least 75% of total expenditures are audited annually.

The SAI submits its audit reports to the Assembly each year in June, within three months after receiving
the budget execution statements from the Directorate of Finance, in compliance with the law on SAI of
DB. The SAI began its work only on March 1, 2007, and the recommendations it has made so far have
                                                    201


been relatively limited in scope. The Office, in its reports on financial audit performed, includes a special
chapter under the title of “Review of findings and implementation of recommendations from the
preceding audit”, which lists the recommendations from the preceding year which the client had not
implemented, i.e. which the client had implemented only partially. In addition to that, following the
publication of the report on performance audit, the Office checks on the degree of implementation of the
recommendations provided, on the annual level, by requesting information in writing from the client.
Besides the aforementioned, the Office, in its reports on operations from 2012 and on, on which it
informs the Assembly of Brčko District of BiH and the public, separately discusses the chapter on
“Realization of recommendations provided”.

The Directorate of Finance submits the draft budget to the DB government within the timetable
established by the law (October 1). The budget should be approved by the Assembly by December 1. In
practice budget negotiations in government take several weeks, and the eventual draft proposals are then
submitted for public consultation—which in recent years has taken place in January and February of the
budget year. Only thereafter are the formal proposals submitted to the Assembly. Less than a month may
remain between the time of the formal submission of the government’s proposals to the Assembly and the
end-March deadline beyond which temporary financing at the level of the previous year’s budget ends.
Formal scrutiny of the proposals by the Assembly appears to be rather limited, although Assembly
members are fully engaged in the preliminary consultations and the public hearings on the
administration’s draft proposals.

DB SAI is required to deliver to the DB Assembly, DB government, and Office of the Public Prosecutor
(i) the audit report on the government’s annual financial statements (actually it also delivers an audit
report for each budget user), and (ii) the public report on the audits conducted by DB SAI. It normally
takes up to eight months for the Assembly to complete its work on the SAI reports. The DB Assembly has
not conducted budget user hearings; this practice has yet to be introduced in DB. The audit reports
present the DB SAI’s recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the government. These
recommendations are usually adopted by the DB Assembly without amendment.

Budget users do not address the recommendations of the DB SAI, or do so only in a superficial manner.
Unlike in other levels of government in BiH, there is no specialized parliamentary committee that is
designated to deal with audit reports.

II. Assessment of the impact of PFM weaknesses

This section of the Report analyses the extent to which the performance of the assessed PFM system
appears to support the three high level objectives. These are:
       Effective controls of the budget totals and management of fiscal risks contribute to maintain
        aggregate fiscal discipline.

       Planning and executing the budget in line with government priorities contributes to
        implementation of government’s objective (strategic allocation of resources).

       Managing the use of budgeted resources contributes to efficient service delivery and value for
        money.
1. Aggregate Fiscal Discipline
Delays in agreeing budget ceiling and in establishing the amount of input taxes due to DB have resulted in
delays in approval the budget and restrictions in the time to scrutinize the budget in the Assembly. The
budget expenditure outcomes significantly under –perform the approved budget and significant deviations
of the composition of the budget suggest also suggest concerns with the quality of the budget planning
process. Revenue outturn showed significant over-performance in two of the three years under review
which may indicate further weaknesses in revenue forecasting (in the case of input taxes is outside DBs
control). Expenditure arrears have been increasing and the government lacks comprehensive data on
arrears or a legal definition for its calculation. While the tax legislation and procedures are
comprehensive and clear there is no reliable reconciliation of tax assessments, collections and arrears.
Budget documents are reasonably comprehensive and made available to the public on a timely basis.
2. Strategic Allocation of Resources
The MoF provides reliable information on the availability of funds; there are few changes to budget
allocations and, where these take place they are done transparently. The existing budget process does not
have a strong policy or strategic focus. While there is an agreed development strategy and medium term
expenditure framework sector strategies lack detailed costing information; priorities tend to reflect
specific budget user initiatives rather than being seen as part of a broader sectoral strategy. The limited
time available in order to scrutinize the budget in parliament may reduce the pressure on government to
allocate and execute the budget in line with its stated policies.
3. Efficient Service Delivery
Expenditure commitment control procedures exist and are partially effective, but they may not
comprehensively cover all expenditures and may occasionally be violated. The lack of a public sector
internal audit function is a missing piece of DBs system of checks and balances. Non-observance of
competitive tendering procedures may create the opportunity for inefficient procurement, corruption and
leakages in the system. Weak linkages between the work of the SAI and parliament may reduce the
extent the government is held to account for the efficient management of resources.

III. Prospects for PFM Reforms
DB sees an opportunity to increase budget discipline through revision of existing Law on Budget of
Brčko District. The main task will be to prepare guidelines for the new law on budget which will bring in
the budget discipline and responsibility, enable institutionalization of budget inspections and sanctions for
non-compliance. Strategic planning will be improved in future and program budgeting is to be
introduced. Training is planned to support these reforms. A Public Investments Programme (PIP) is also
proposed for the future.

    Assessment of PFM Systems, Processes and Institutions - District Brčko
PI-1: Aggregate Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the difference between the actual and the originally budgeted primary expenditure
for District Brčko (DB) for the last three fiscal years (2009-2011). The expenditure taken into
consideration is the aggregate budget, from which debt service payments (interest and principal) and
externally funded project expenditure are excluded because they are outside the direct control of the
government. The expenditure of the government-controlled Health and Employment Funds is also
included. DB does not have its own pension fund: DB residents choose between the pension funds of the
two Entities, Republika Srpska (RS) and Federation of BiH (FBiH). Because of this, extra-budgetary
funds (EBFs) are of less importance relative to budget expenditure in DB than they are in RS and FBiH.

DB has generally budgeted cautiously to avoid any risk of exceeding its available revenue (see PI-3 for
DB), and has persistently underspent its budget. The Director of Finance stated that the main reason for
the underspending was delay in the
execution of capital projects, which      Table 4.4.1. Percentage Difference between Out-turn and Budget
had been insufficiently prepared.                                          Expenditure out-

PI-2: Composition of Expenditure Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator assesses the extent to which the composition of the budget changes from that originally
planned by the Directorate of Finance (DoF) and agreed by the District Assembly. The PEFA Secretariat
has set out a formula for calculating the variance of the out-turn from the approved budget. Each of the 20
largest lines in the original budget is adjusted by the percentage difference between the aggregate budget
and out-turn as calculated for PI-1, and the differences between the actual expenditure on each line and
these adjusted figures are then summed to measure the overall variance for the first dimension of this
indicator as a percentage of the aggregate out-turn. The second dimension of the indicator looks at the
amount of expenditure charged to the contingency reserve; the larger the amount charged to the reserve
rather than reallocated to specific budget lines, the less transparent the budget. The tables containing
calculations for the DB government are set out in Annex 4 of this report.

    (i) Additional variance in expenditure composition, after taking into account the overall variance
    as in PI-1
The formula measures the additional variance over and above the overall variance calculated in PI-1 resulting
from resources being reallocated from one area to another during budget execution. A good score is achieved if
there are no significant reallocations from one functional area to another. Thus, there can be a good score on
this indicator even if there is a substantial overall difference between the budget and out-turn as measured
under PI-1, provided that the proportionate changes are similar on each budget head. The total variances are
shown as percentages of the aggregate
expenditure out-turn in Table 4.4.3. The          Table 4.4.3. Percentage Variance in Out-turn Composition

PI-3: Aggregate Revenue Out-turn Compared to Original Approved Budget
This indicator compares actual total domestic revenue to the budgeted domestic revenue. Country-wide
indirect taxation administered by BiH Institutions is shared among the four main government levels (BiH
Institutions, FBiH, RS, and DB), while all other taxation and non-tax revenues are under the exclusive
jurisdiction of each level separately.

DB consolidated revenue and receipts for the consolidated general government sector level (central
government and EBFs), as reported by the Central Bank of BiH (CBBiH), are shown in Table 4.4.5. Indirect
taxation is the most important revenue source, comprising 64% of total DB consolidated revenues—a
significantly higher share than in the Entities, partly because DB total expenditure does not include a
pension fund. The second most important revenue source is social contributions, which account for 17% of
consolidated DB revenues. Direct taxation revenue makes up only 7% of consolidated DB revenue.

The overall system for distributing indirect taxation revenues among the four main levels in BiH is
explained in detail in Chapter 2 and under this same indicator for BiH Institutions. In summary, once the
share of BiH Institutions is deducted from total revenues, DB receives a fixed 3.55% of the remaining
funds, and the rest of the funds are divided between the two Entities on the basis of data on final
consumption locations identified in tax forms. The coefficients for distributing revenues between the
Entities are variable; they are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the final consumption and are
formally adopted by the Governing Board of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA). Periodical reconciliation is
also envisaged when changes of coefficients occur. Out of each Entity’s share, foreign debt servicing is
first deducted, and the remaining funds are then shared among the general government sector levels.

For DB the coefficient (3.55%) is fixed in accordance with the Law on Payments into the Single Account
and Allocation of Revenues, which was adopted in 2007 following a decision by the Office of the High
Representative. In practice, in the past five years, there have been political problems/delays in the
decision on the amount BiH Institutions will get from the indirect taxation revenues, as well as disputes
about final consumption data and consequent delays on decisions on the formula for sharing indirect
taxation revenues between the two Entities. Delays in the decision on the amount BiH Institutions will get
from the indirect taxation revenues can affect DB, since DB’s 3.55% share comes from the revenues
available after the State’s share is deducted.

For direct taxes, which are under the sole jurisdiction of the each of the Entities and DB, the structure and
rates of personal and company income tax and social contributions are set at the central level in DB, and
revenues are then shared with local self-governance units and the two EBFs (Health and Employment).

In both Entities and in DB, the revenue of EBFs includes social contributions relevant to the specific fund
and transfers from the central government for some funds; road public entities receive part of the indirect
taxation revenues, as well as other road fees.

The Macroeconomic Analysis Unit (MAU) of the ITA is responsible for preparing forecasts of indirect
taxes, taking into account countrywide macroeconomic projections prepared by the Department for
Economic Planning under the Fiscal Council. These revenue projections are used by the Fiscal Council,
Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) of the BiH Institutions, the Entities’ Ministries of Finance
(MoFs), and the Finance Directorate of DB during the budget preparation process. However, the amounts
entered into the budget of each government in respect of indirect tax revenue are the responsibility of that

 government. Forecasting of revenue from direct taxes and other Entity/DB revenues is the responsibility
 of the respective MoFs—so in DB, the DoF is responsible for projections.

      (i) Actual domestic revenue compared to domestic revenue in the originally approved budget
 As noted above, the Entities and DB have their own mandate over direct taxes. The DB has the authority
 to legislate in the field of property taxation, taxation of personal income, corporate income tax, and social
 contributions for health and employment funds.

 It was not possible to use consolidated data from the CBBiH for performing indicator calculations
 because it is available only for out-turns and not for plans. Therefore, the ratings for this indicator are
 based on the data from the DB DoF.

 Table 4.4.6 shows revenue, budget forecasts, and actual out-turns. The table excludes the revenues of the
 DB Health and Employment Funds. Because DB residents pay their pension contributions into either of
 the two Entity funds they choose, Fund contributions are excluded from the analysis.

 PI-4: Stock and Monitoring of Expenditure Payment Arrears
 This indicator examines whether there are significant expenditure arrears, and whether there is a system
 that enables expenditure arrears to be effectively monitored. In DB at the moment of this assessment there
 is no legal definition of what constitutes arrears; no legal period has been established (e.g., 45 days) after
 which an unpaid invoiced obligation is considered to be in arrears; and within current Treasuries no
 payment due date is entered from the invoices until end 2013. Under the SBA, the BiH Institutions and
 Entity government authorities were obliged to establish, before October 2013, a common definition of
 arrears (with any amount that is not paid within 90 days after the due date considered to be in arrears)
                                                         208


and, from July 2013, procedures for budget users to enter all due dates of invoices into the Treasury.
These deadlines were not met. As of end 2013, the payment due data have started to be recorded in the
Treasuries at the BiH Institutions and Entity Government level (however, the complete 2013 reports on
arrears have not been ready in time to be included in this Report), while the deadline for establishing
definition of arrears was extended to early 2014. In February 2014 the Fiscal Council of BiH adopted a
definition of an arrear which is described as any obligation that is recorded in the treasury application in
the AP module - liabilities to suppliers, and that has not been paid within the timelines for accrual defined
by Law, and within the deadline of 90 days at the longest from the date of accrual. On the basis of the
common definition, each of the levels of governance shall adjust their legal frameworks. It is probable
that the District of Brcko shall also do so.

    (i) Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears
DB does not have any arrears, according to the information received from the DoF. Note that while
indirect taxation revenues finance the bulk of DB expenditures, the fact that DB receives a fixed share of
indirect taxation revenues does not guarantee that arrears cannot be accumulated: DB also has its own
additional revenues and, in addition, total indirect taxation revenue (on which DB’s share is applied) can
still fluctuate throughout year. However, expenditure policies in DB exhibit high-level discipline that
prevents the accumulation of arrears. But, given that reliable data on arrears in line with legal definition is
not yet available, insufficient information is available to score this dimension or indicator.

Dimension rating: NR

    (ii) Availability of data for monitoring the stock of payment arrears
While there is no evidence that the DB budget incurred any arrears, since no official data on arrears in
line with the legal definition of arrears are not available yet (as of end 2013), the rating for this dimension
is D.

PI-5: Classification of the Budget
The PEFA criteria look for arrangements that make it possible to compare budget and out-turn for the
same year, and also provide for consistent comparisons from one year to the next, according to
administrative, functional, and economic classifications. Ideally the 10 main functions of government as
defined in the United Nations Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) should be broken
down into sub functions (e.g., different levels of education) or programs. This objective is facilitated by
recording all transactions in accordance with a chart of accounts (CoA) that captures sufficient
information about each transaction to enable reports according to each of the classifications.

Although there has been some progress, Public Finance Statistics still remain fragmented and incoherent
across the different jurisdictions in BiH, a situation that most observers regard as a significant impediment
                                                              209


to proper governance. The EU has paid special attention to the issue; it has been providing technical
assistance in this area since June 2012,173 but progress has not yet been evaluated.

The DB government presents its budget showing the economic breakdown of the expenditure of each
administrative unit as well as a functional breakdown following in total 14 function (same as in FBiH),
based on which the 10 main COFOG functions can be extracted. The government maintains a Treasury
system through which all transactions pass—or are recorded, if they are payments made from separate
bank accounts established for externally funded projects—which provides for consistent reporting by
administrative and economic classifications. The Treasury systems have been much improved since 2000,
and the CoAs are broadly similar across all four governments. However, since the CoAs are not
harmonized across the four governments, no consolidation is possible on a functional basis for the
country as a whole.

Nevertheless, DB provides for consistent comparisons between budget and out-turn on administrative,
functional, and economic classifications.

PI-7: Extent of Unreported Government Operations
Annual budget estimates, in-year execution reports, and year-end financial statements should cover all
budgetary and extra-budgetary operations of the government. This indicator evaluates the extent to which
operations under government control, including those of so-called extra-budgetary funds, are not reported
at both estimate and out-turn stages. It also looks at the extent to which donor-funded projects are
included in fiscal reports.

    (i) Level of extra-budgetary expenditure omitted from fiscal reports
DB maintains its own Health Insurance Fund, Employment Fund and Public Company JP Putevi Brčko
outside the budget. Similarly, from 1 July 2013 primary and secondary health protection as well as part
of public health is outside of the budget. However, full details of their revenue and expenditure are
presented to the Assembly alongside the budget. Out-turn statements are published. It does not appear that
there are significant other expenditures under the control of the government that are not part of the
budget.

    (ii) Inclusion in fiscal reports of information about income/expenditure of externally funded
    projects
DB has hitherto undertaken only one investment project: The District if Brčko Water Supply Project,
which had been financed in part from external sources, by a loan amounting to € 4,96 million from Bank
Austria Creditanstalt AG, and in part from domestic sources, by a loan of the Hypo Alpe-Adria- Bank
a.d., Banja Luka amounting to BAM 6.87 million. In principle all investment projects are shown in the
budget with their sources of financing, although execution has generally been seriously delayed by poor
preparation, delays in the procurement process, and the Assembly’s practice of approving the annual
budget only on March 31 each year.

PI-8: Transparency of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
This indicator evaluates the transparency of and accountability for the resources transferred between
different levels of government. Three dimensions are considered: (i) the transparency and objectivity of
the allocation of resources; (ii) the timeliness of reliable information to the government(s) concerned
about their allocations; and (iii) the extent of consolidation of fiscal data for the general government
according to sectoral categories.

Given the specificities of the BiH fiscal sector and the approach taken by this PEFA, under this indicator
the report considers intergovernmental relations for the four main government levels separately. Thus,
only intergovernmental relations related to DB are given under this indicator. However, the indirect
taxation revenue—which is administered at BiH level but shared among the four main government
levels—is covered under this same indicator for BiH Institutions.

As has been noted, DB receives a fixed share of 3.55% of revenues from indirect taxation after the State
share is deducted. For direct taxes, the structure and rates of personal and company income tax and social
contributions for the Health and Employment Funds are set at the central level in DB, and revenues are
then shared with local self-governance units and the EBFs.

    (i) Transparency and objectivity in the horizontal allocation among subnational governments

Dimension rating: Not Applicable, the DB does not have local self-governance level

    (ii) Timeliness of reliable information to the different governments on their allocations
Within DB, which does not have subordinate local self-governance levels but only EBFs, there are no
other issues in terms of the timeliness of reliable information on allocation.

Dimension rating: Not Applicable, the DB does not have local self-governance level

    (iii) Extent of consolidation of fiscal data for general government according to sectoral categories
DB has no subordinate local self-governance units and only two EBFs. The DoF collects data about the
functional classification of all its expenditure. For DB, therefore, consolidated information exists about
general government expenditure according to sectoral categories within the normal timeframe for the
production of budget execution statements.
                                                                     212


Functional classification of expenditures is included in DB’s MTEFs and in annual budgets. In practice,
reporting by function is likely based on a broad approximation. Budget plans and execution reports of
EBFs are reported to Parliament, consolidated with DB government reports.

PI-9: Oversight of Aggregate Fiscal Risk from Other Public Sector Entities
This indicator assess whether the government adequately monitors and manages the fiscal risks174 arising
from public sector activities or operations outside its direct control, including (i) the activities of public
enterprises (PEs) and autonomous government agencies (AGAs) financed outside the budget, and (ii) the
activities of subnational governments.

        (i) Extent of central government monitoring of AGAs and PEs
DB has three PEs that are not effectively supervised by the DoF, however it receives full information
about their business plans and results. The Health insurance fund, Employment fund, and Public
Company JP Putevi Brčko submit their financial plans and reports on an annual basis, but also they are
introducing a practice to submit quarterly reports as to the DoF. PEs report to Parliament of Brčko
District BiH and submit their annual financial statements to Finance Directorate. However, no
consolidated fiscal risk reports are produced.

PI-11: Orderliness and Participation in the Annual Budget Process
This indicator aims to assess whether budget formulation adheres to a fixed and predictable budget
calendar each year and is organised in a way that facilitates effective participation by budget users. Three
dimensions are considered: (i) whether a fixed calendar is complied with; (ii) whether budget users are
given clear expenditure ceilings approved by the government within which to prepare their submissions;
and (iii) whether the budget is approved by the District Assembly before the beginning of each year.

        (i) Existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar
The key dates for the preparation of the annual budget are set out in the Law on Budgets of the DB. The
budget process begins in January or February each year when the DoF distributes Budget Instructions No.
1, which includes a detailed budget calendar setting out the requirements, responsibilities, and timelines
for each stage of the budget process.

The budget calendar was generally not adhered to during the preparation of the 2013 budget, for several
reasons. First, because of delay in the adoption of the 2012 budget, the DoF issued the instructions about
a month later than foreseen by the calendar. Further slippage was caused by the fact that the DB
government could not reach an agreement on initial budget ceilings. Additional delays followed the
elections in fall 2012. As a result, the budget for 2013 was not adopted until March 28, 2013. However
the delays are not unique to this budget year; rather, they have been a prominent feature of the budget
preparation process since 2010. These delays also reflect the DB government’s practice of submitting its
draft budget to a process of public consultation before submitting the final proposals to the Assembly.

Table 4.4.17 sets out the budget calendar presented in the 2013 Budget Instructions No. 1 issued on
February 29, 2012, and the actual dates each task was completed during the 2013 budget process. As long
as the process depends on the DoF, deviations from the calendar are relatively minor, but delays may
occur at the point when final political decisions have to be taken by the government, and during the
process of discussion in the District Assembly. The ultimate constraint is that the budget must be adopted
by March 31, when the legal authority for temporary financing at the same rate as the previous year
expires.

    (ii) Clarity/comprehensiveness in the guidance on the preparation of budget submissions (budget
    circular or equivalent)
Two sets of budget instructions are issued. Budget Instructions No. 1 sets out the detailed guidelines and
instructions for the preparation of Budget User Priority Review Tables (BUPRTs) including high-priority
new spending proposals and savings options, consistent with the priorities of the DB government. Following
the submission of the BUPRTSs, the DoF prepares the draft MTEF, which sets out, among other things, the
underlying macroeconomic indicators and fiscal outlook, budget expenditure priorities for the budget and
forward estimates period, and budget ceilings for each budget user.

Following the government’s approval of the three-year MTEF, the DoF issues Budget Instructions No. 2,
setting out initial budget ceilings for each budget user (in accordance with the MTEF) together with
instructions for the preparation of budget requests. Budget users are required to prepare their detailed
budget estimates in accordance with these ceilings. The DoF and budget users conduct discussions
following the distribution of the Budget Instructions No. 2.Some adjustments to the ceilings may be
permitted in accordance with government policy priorities and subject to the approval of final budget
ceilings by the DB government.

framework, expenditure policies, and budget plans over the medium term. Four dimensions are
considered: (i) multiyear fiscal forecasts and functional allocations; (ii) scope and frequency of debt
sustainability analysis (DSA); (iii) existence of multiyear costed sector strategies; and (iv) linkages
between investment allocations and forward functional expenditure estimates.
                                                   216


    (i) Preparation of multiyear forecasts
Multiyear fiscal forecasts are produced as part of the process leading to the preparation of the DB MTEF,
including forward estimates of expenditure for each budget user (i.e., estimates for the forthcoming
budget year and two following fiscal years). However, there is no evidence that the forward estimates are
used to anchor the preparation of the following year’s budget ceilings—that is, they do not roll forward;
instead, the DoF effectively rebases the budget and forward estimates for each budget cycle.

The budget and forward estimates in the MTEF are prepared by administrative, functional, and economic
classifications in accordance with the CoA. The annual budget proposal does not include forward year
estimates.

Dimension rating: C

    (ii) Scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis
The stock of debt of Brčko District as ofthe date of December 31, 2013, inclusive of interest, amounts to
BAM 46.5 million, of which BAM 33.9 million concerns internal debt, while BAM 12.6 million concerns
external debt.

The DB DoF maintains an electronic database of external and internal debt and exchanges information
with the MFT of BiH Institutions. External and internal debt is regularly reviewed, including as part of
the regular review of the SBA.DB also submits data to the BiH MFT Debt Management Unit, which
maintains an access database of all internal and external debt of all BiH governments.

While data on debt status are collected regularly and reports on debt stock and servicing projections are
provided, DSAs are not performed, except for the regular DSAs prepared by the IMF.

The Law on Borrowing, Debt and Guarantees of BiH stipulates that Advisory Committee for Debt
(comprising of two representatives from State Council of Ministers one of which is the Finance Minister,
one representative from the Central Bank of BiH, two representatives from the Entity Governments
including Finance Ministers, and Finance Directorate director from the Brčko District), which is supposed
to be in charge of preparing debt management strategy. However, in practice, this has not been
implemented.

Currently, the only debt sustainability analysis is the analysis IMF prepares within their Article IV
Country Reports or periodically in some of the reports in reviews under the SBA (four such analyses were
prepared by the IMF in 2009-2013). Since the IMF debt sustainability analyses have so far been
performed without active participation of the authorities in the preparation process (other than data
provision) and that the authorities do not use this analysis in their strategic planning process (the debt
sustainability analysis is not linked to a specific government debt strategy in terms of future borrowing
policies and needs at any government level (which are large, having in mind large infrastructure needs),
the performance rating for this indicators is reduced.

However, it should be noted that the IMF has recently shared its methodology and instructions in terms of
debt sustainability analysis with the Federal Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Federal
Ministry of Finance stemming from the conclusion of recent FBiH DeMPA prepared by the World Bank,
which also found that no DSAs are undertaken, no sensitivity analyses are used, and no medium-term
debt management strategy has been developed and it recommended that the technical assistance is
provided to the Federal Ministry of Finance for the debt sustainability analysis. Thus, DSA preparation
for the FBiH by the FMF can be expected in future, as it is prescribed by the new Law on Budgets in
FBiH adopted in December 2013 that the debt sustainability analysis will have to be annexed to budget.
The IMF DSA template has also been shared with the MFT in past years. Brčko District Directorate of
                                                             217


Finance is not familiar with the IMF methodology, and it does not prepare its own DSA – according to
the Directorate of Finance, there has been no need for such analysis given small amount of debt and
simple debt portfolio structure in DB, however, there are plans to increase capacities in this area. As with
other Government levels in BiH, DB does not prepare debt strategies. Thus, given that the authorities
have prepared and used own or IMF DSA in their own strategic planning process, the performance rating
for this indicator is lowered as noted.

Dimension rating: D

      (iii) Existence of costed sector strategies
A Draft Development Strategy for BiH (with specific action plans separately for BiH Institutions, FBiH,
RS, and DB) was prepared by the Directorate of Economic Planning of the Council of Ministers of BiH
and adopted by the FBiH and DB governments, but was never adopted by the Council of Ministers or RS
government.

DB has a Development Strategy for 2008-2017,175but it is not costed. No costed sector strategies are
formally developed for DB.

MTEFs do not represent truly costed sectoral strategies, as they basically just set up ceilings per budget
user, rather than focusing on costed measures for strategy implementation. The DB MTEF includes an
analysis of “medium-term budget priorities” (i.e., covering the forthcoming annual budget and two
following fiscal years), but these priorities generally reflect budget users’ specific individual new
spending initiatives rather than forming part of a broader sector strategy. Budget and forward estimates
are, however, prepared for each budget user.

Dimension rating: D

      (iv) Linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates.
Although there are no fully developed sector strategies, the DB administration recognizes the need to
consider the future operating costs of any new investments and seeks to take account of them, although
actual investment choices made during the final stages of budget discussions and in the District Assembly
are determined mainly by political factors.

PI-13: Transparency of Taxpayer Obligations and Liabilities
This indicator examines whether (i) tax legislation and regulations are clear and comprehensive and limit
discretion by authorities, especially in decisions on tax assessments and exemptions; (ii) taxpayers have
ready access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures; and (iii) there is a functioning
tax appeals mechanism.

      (i) Clarity and comprehensiveness of tax liabilities
The legislative framework for major taxes includes domestic tax laws, international treaties on avoidance
of double taxation, and the laws governing administrative procedures. While the legislative framework for
major taxes is generally clear and comprehensive, some important aspects of tax application are not very
clearly and consistently reflected in the legislation and interpreted in practice. This mainly relates to
implementation of important provisions of double taxation treaties (e.g. determination of tax residence,
reduction of taxes upon deduction), and to transfer pricing. Consequently, tax inspectors tend to apply a
fair amount of discretionary powers in determining tax liabilities in these areas.

Dimension rating: C

      (ii) Taxpayer access to information on tax liabilities and administrative procedures
The DB Tax Administration (TA) runs a website containing only copies of relevant laws. Taxpayers
usually obtain information upon request (through meetings, e-mails, or informal telephone calls).
Education campaigns or workshops for taxpayers are rarely organized. DB RA issues individual tax
certificates confirming tax liabilities, but the confirmed amounts are not always accurate.176

Dimension rating: C

      (iii) Existence and functioning of a tax appeals mechanism
The tax appeal system comprises the following levels: (a) objection on the report of inspection control;
(b) appeal on the decision forwarded to Appeals Commission; and (c) initiation of administrative
procedure with DB Basic Court; and (d) appeal to the Appellation Court of DB. The decision process
usually lasts within timeframe defined in legislation while court decisions usually take longer. Decisions
are not publicly available. Appeals are reviewed by bodies whose members rarely include experienced
professionals from the private sector and civil society. Issued decisions are binding for all parties, with no
discrimination in respect of rights to appeal. Consequently, the issues that need to be addressed are
transparency (i.e., making decisions publicly available), improving time efficiency, and improving the
technical understanding of the taxation principles (i.e., including in the review process professionals from
the private and NGO sectors).

PI 14: Effectiveness of Measures for Taxpayer Registration and Tax Assessment
This indicator looks at how effective a tax administration is in identifying taxpayers and inducing them to
pay the correct amounts on the due dates, using three dimensions: (i) whether all taxpayers are registered
in a single database, with links to business licensing and other relevant government databases; (ii)
whether the penalties provided under the law are enough to secure taxpayer compliance; and (iii) whether
the choice of taxpayers for audit/inspection is based on an assessment of the risks of non-payment each
represents.

      (i) Controls in the taxpayer registration system
Taxpayers are registered in a single database, and the registration process is automated. Taxpayers are
assigned a unique Tax Identification Number (TIN), which is used for all direct taxes. Tax authorities and
taxpayers are obliged to use TINs in all official correspondence.

The central tax registration system is linked to the pension and social security fund system.Under the
SBA, on June 12, 2013, the four tax agencies are assigned the Memorandum of Understanding on the
exchange of taxpayer information, with a view to facilitating the permanent, unfettered, and automated
sharing of taxpayer records.

Dimension rating: B

      (ii) Effectiveness of penalties for noncompliance with registration and tax declaration
Companies (taxpayers of corporate income tax) are liable to a fixed penalty of 1,000 BAM to 5,000
BAM177 for late registration, and a fixed penalty for late submission of tax returns in the amount of up to
150% of the late tax.178 Penalties between 200 BAM and 2,000 BAM are also imposed on responsible
persons (company directors).179 Individual taxpayers (taxpayers of personal income tax) are liable to a
fixed penalty of 200 BAM to 2,000 BAM for late registration, and to a fixed penalty of 200 BAM to
2,000 BAM for late submission of tax returns.180The penalties appear to be high enough, but they may not
always be an effective deterrent.

      (iii) Planning and monitoring of tax audit programs
Tax audit plans are prepared annually and monthly181by the chief inspectors of DB RA and submitted to the
head of Sector for External Control and head of the Tax Administration for reconciliation purposes. The
selection of taxpayers for audit is based on clearly defined risk assessment criteria, identified from tax
declarations entered into the system. The system runs queries based on indications such as history of
noncompliance and size of profits and revenues. However, the DBSAI’s Report for 2011 found that the
annual tax audit plans did not adhere to the prescribed risk assessment criteria: the plans were incomplete
(missing the names of taxpayers and TINs); risk assessment criteria were not clearly documented; and the
approval process did not follow the procedures.182

PI-15: Effectiveness in Collection of Tax Payments
This indicator assesses the performance of a tax administration in collecting the amounts assessed,
maintaining control over the total of arrears, ensuring that revenues reach the Treasury quickly, and
undertaking regular reconciliations between the detailed records of each taxpayer and the overall amounts
paid into the Treasury.

      (i) Collection ratio for gross tax arrears
The total amount of tax collections 183 in DB in 2011 was 16.8 million BAM. The average debt collection
ratio in 2011 was above 90% for major taxes. However, because of omissions related to incorrect manual
entry into the system by DB RA officials, the assessed amount personal income tax (from employment)
was underrecorded by 7.5 million BAM (or 93% of the total), which compromised the reliability of data
on tax in arrears.184The main reason for the difference in planning and realisation of the revenue (based on
employment) in FY 2011 was due to a change in laws and regulations as well as due to disconnect
between human and technical capacities in terms of the volume of work, meaning that it was impossible
to enter all tax returns in due time. The problem was the most visible in FY 2011, however it was
mitigated by various technical solutions in the subsequent years.



181
     Tax audits are directed to taxpayers that are companies, and full audit generally includes corporate and personal income tax.
182
    2012 Audit Report, issued by the Brčko Distrikt Supreme Auditor does not provide a confirmation that the DB RA followed up
on these findings.
183
    For major taxes: corporate income tax, personal income tax, property taxes.
184
     These findings were presented in the Report of the DB Supreme Auditor for 2011.
                                                                 221


The total amount of tax collections for 2012 was 22.6 million BAM. The average debt collection ratio
was above 80%. The personal income tax (from employment) assessment was also underrecorded in
2012, but it improved significantly in relation to 2011: tax assessments amounted to 5.8 million BAM,
and tax collections amounted to 8.4 million BAM—an underassessment of 30%.185

Noncompliance with payment obligations is subject to penalties. Tax-geared penalties (i.e., percentage of
additionally assessed tax liability) are levied for matters such as tax returns that are carelessly or
deliberately incorrect, which results in unreported tax liability. Interest is assessed on late payments. The
2012 DB SAI Report noted that DB RA does not issue reminders for late tax payments, which has slowed
down the collection of tax in arrears.

Dimension rating: B

      (ii) Effectiveness of transfer of tax collections to the Treasury
Taxpayers make payments into commercial bank accounts. Instructions for bank payments are clearly
prescribed in the applicable legislation; direct cash payments in DB RA offices are prohibited. Transfers
of revenue collections to the Treasury Account are made daily.

Dimension rating: A

      (iii) Frequency of complete accounts reconciliations among tax assessments, collections, arrears
      records, and receipts by the Treasury
Information on revenue collection is electronically submitted to the accounting system of DB RA by the
banks; reconciliation of collections is automated, and payments are assigned to taxpayers’ TINs.
However, receipts (tax collection) and tax assessment (recorded tax debt) in 2011 did not reconcile
because of manual recording of tax declarations. 186 The incorrect processing of tax collections also
resulted in incorrect reconciliation of payments to corresponding taxpayers’ TINs. Tax assessments for
FY12 related to corporate income tax were not recorded in the system in the prescribed timeframe. Also,
the fact that the tax collections exceeded tax assessments implies that there is no efficient reconciliation
between the two. Tax arrears cannot be allocated to the correct FYs, since they are recorded cumulatively
and not reconciled to the corresponding periods.187 Information on tax collections is compiled and sent
monthly to the MAU.

    These findings were presented in the Report of the DB Supreme Auditor for 2011: due to omissions related to incorrect manual entry
into the system by DB RA officials, the amount of personal income tax (salary tax) collections was under-recorded by 7.5 million KM
(or 93% of the total tax collections), which compromised reconciliation between tax in arrear and tax collections.

PI-16: Predictability in the Availability of Funds for Commitment of Expenditures
This indicator assesses the extent to which the government provides reliable information on the
availability of funds to budget users to enable effective resource management. It is intended to measure
performance over the last completed fiscal year before assessment

    (i) Extent to which cash flows are forecast and monitored
In DB, regular quarterly cash flow projections are developed, and they are also updated on the quarterly
level. Usual significant discrepancies of actual data compared with the planned happen in the course of
the fourth quarter.

Dimension rating: B

    (ii) Reliability and horizon of periodic in-year information to budget users on ceilings for
    expenditure commitment
In DB budget users can be confident of the availability of cash to meet future commitments, provided that
the commitments remain within annual budget allocations, and the payment requests remain within the
cumulative monthly releases of funds by the DoF.They can enter the liabilities for the next quarter in line
with quarterly operational plans, but they can plan and commit funds six months in advance in line with
the adopted budget.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Frequency and transparency of adjustments to budget allocations imposed on budget users
There has been no occasion in DB to impose in-year expenditure reductions. If there were, this action
would need the approval of the Assembly under the Law on Budgets of DB, and would need to follow
transparent procedures according to the legislation.

PI-17: Recording and Management of Cash Balances, Debt, and Guarantees
This criterion looks at debt management in terms of contracting, servicing and repayment, and the
provision of government guarantees, including the following dimensions:

      maintenance of a debt data system and regular reporting on the main features of the debt portfolio;

      identification and consolidation of cash balances in all government bank accounts (including those
       for EBFs and government-controlled project accounts); and

      the proper recording and reporting of government-issued guarantees, and the approval of all
       guarantees by a single government entity (e.g., the ministry of finance or a debt management
       commission) against adequate and transparent criteria.

    (i) Quality of debt data recording and reporting
As has been noted, the BiH Institutions are responsible for servicing almost all the country’s public
external debt. Since BiH is the ultimate guarantor for essentially the entire IFI foreign debt (regardless of
whether the Entities are using it and repaying it), all loans must be approved by the Council of Ministers
of BiH, BiH Presidency, and BiH Parliament. The same requirement applies to external guarantees of BiH
(regardless of whether the Entities are final users).

CBBiH publishes quarterly figures for total external public debt.

Apart from the repayment of its share of the blocked foreign currency savings accounts, which should be
complete by 2016, DB also has the following outstanding liabilities under credits as of the date of
December 31, 2013, specifically: two credits that DB had inherited from former political arrangements
that had existed within the territory of DB before its establishment (the Credit for the rehabilitation of the
water supply system and the Credit for rehabilitation of the public housing fund of the Municipality of
Brčko), in addition to the Credit for the renewal of the housing fund for refugees and di splaced persons
approved by CEB-Council of Europe Development Bank (five tranches), as well as two credits whose
intention had been to finance the Water Supply Project for Brčko District of BiH – Water Factory (credit
approved by Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG and the credit from Hypo Alpe-Adria- Bank a.d., Banja
Luka).The debt data is complete and reconciled at the level of District Brčko.

Dimension rating: A

    (ii) Extent of consolidation of government cash balances
All government cash balances are consolidated in the single treasury account (STA), with the exception of
those of the Health and Employment Funds, whose operations account for about 15% of general
government expenditure.

Dimension rating: B

    (iii) Systems for contracting loans and issuing guarantees
 As has already been noted, there is very little experience in DB of contracting loans, and none of issuing
 guarantees. All such transactions are firmly under the control of the DoF. There is so far no question of
 any need to manage borrowing within a prescribed policy framework. However, like other BiH
 governments, DB has a debt ceiling policy. This policy is regulated partly by its Budget Law and partly
                                                           224


 by the Annual Budget Execution Law. Article 34 of the Budget Law188 stipulates that short-term debt
 obligations cannot exceed 5% of the previous fiscal year’s revenues.

 Direct external debt borrowing and internal debt would require approval of the DB government and
 Parliament.

 For the time being the objectives for debt are not linked to medium-term fiscal targets—that is, there is
 no formal debt management strategy that would steer debt management decisions.

PI-18: Effectiveness of Payroll Controls
Payroll and related charges represent about 35% of current costs of general government in BiH. This
indicator is intended to cover all significant government payrolls —that is, all civil servants and other
government employees, as well as people employed in the health, education, and police services. Four
dimensions are considered: (i) the degree of integration between personnel records and payroll data; (ii)
the timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll; (iii) the internal controls over changes to
personnel records and the payroll; and (iv)the existence of payroll audits to identify control weaknesses
and/or ghost workers.

       (i) Degree of integration and reconciliation between personnel records and payroll data
Personnel records are the responsibility of the Human Resources Management Authority (HRMA), which
functions separately outside the DoF. Payroll is under the control of a special section in DoF. Health Fund
employees are not covered by the DoF payroll. The DoF payroll section considers that HRMA records are
deficient, that its performance evaluation procedures are ineffective, and that it has allowed wide
variations in pay for equivalent work, despite the provisions of the 2005 Wage Law. Databases for payroll
and for personnel records are not directly linked and are not mutually consistent in term of data nor
updated and reconciled on a monthly basis.

Dimension rating: D
       (ii) Timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll
Personnel records and payroll data is not updated on a monthly basis, so delays up to three months may
occur. Payroll data is updated when the data is submitted to Tax Administration. There are cases of
retroactive adjustments.

Dimension rating: B
    (iii) Internal controls of changes to personnel records and the payroll
The control section of the DoF Treasury tests the justification for individual salary payments, a procedure
not followed in other parts of BiH (see PI-20). It thus partially compensates for the perceived weaknesses
of HRMA and employing authorities. However, existing controls do not guarantee that mistakes are
avoided, mostly due to possible mistakes in personnel records.

PI-19: Competition, Value for Money, and Controls in Procurement
This indicator was assessed only on the level of the BiH Institutions. Accordingly, the PI for FBiH, RS,
and DB has been rated as N/A (not applicable).

PI-20: Effectiveness of Internal Controls over Non-salary Expenditure
This indicator examines the effectiveness of internal controls over non-salary expenditure, considering
three dimensions: (i) the effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls; (ii) the comprehensiveness,
relevance, and understanding of other internal control rules and procedures; and (iii) the degree of
compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions. In the absence of BiH-wide legislation
on Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC), DB has installed its own system of financial management
and control, which is part of its overall public administration reform program.
                                                    226


The DoF recognized the need to take action to compensate for spending unit's weaknesses in financial
management and control, and therefore established an ex ante control over commitments and
identification of responsibilities, payment and in-coming accounting data which affect accuracy,
completeness and reality of financial reports, which control functions since early 2008. Since then, in
order to establish more efficient internal control system, a number of new internal control procedures
have been introduced in DoF prescribing tighter controls over transaction processing and recording.
These financial controls are enforced by DoF and they are implemented through control of core
supporting documentation submitted by budget beneficiaries to the Directorate for payment and entering
into accounting records. This control system is implemented through the Budget Control Unit of the
Treasury.

    (i) Effectiveness of expenditure commitment controls
    For all contracts over BAM 15,000 DB regulations require contracting authorities to ask for official
    opinion of DB Attorney Office, in order to establish whether contract provisions comply with DB
    legislation. The contract cannot be signed without this approval.

    All the approved contracts are recorded in their financial amounts at DoF for the purpose of
    expenditure control, budget planning and management. It would be possible to implement contract
    which amount exceed currently available resources, if budget beneficiary assesses and accepts the
    risk that gap would be covered by subsequent budget adjustments.

Payments against the contract would be made only if there is a certified delivery note, and confirmation
that all aspects of the contract have been complied with.

Dimension Rating: A

    (ii) Comprehensiveness, relevance, and understanding of other internal control rules/procedures
DB considers that the current control arrangements effectively prevent payments from being made
beyond the budgetary provision for them. However, they note that sharing of responsibilities/authorities
for controls is not fully developed, with some processes missing detailed procedural rules and some
process not being clearly defined. Internal control rules are increasing being implemented. The continuing
need for vigilance on the part of DoF indicates that improvements in financial management and control
are still needed at the level of the spending units. The DoF expects new legislation on financial
management and control, including provision for the establishment of internal audit, to be enacted by
mid-2013, providing the basis for a new effort to improve financial control in the spending units.

Dimension rating: D

    (iii) Degree of compliance with rules for the processing and recording of transactions
In addition to defined regulated internal control rules, they are also internal documents which give further
instructions in terms internal control rules for the major areas which are not defined or are not defined in
detail in regulation. Internal control rule are increasingly used in practices and strengthened. External
audit remarks note the areas which are not covered with control procedures or are not clearly regulated in
terms of official rules.

PI-21: Effectiveness of Internal Audit
DB has not yet taken any action to provide for and implement internal audit, preferring to wait until the
whole structure of PIFC required to meet the conditions for EU membership has been clarified. For the
time being DB is relying on a more extensive ex ante control of commitments and payments than is in
place in the other governments (see PI-20).

Thus, DB is not a part of the Coordination Board of Central Harmonization Units (CHUs) and does not
have an established internal audit department. Guidelines for internal audit legislation in D are being
developed. The legislation is expected to be adopted by end-2013 and one CHU for DB established.

Since nothing has yet been done to install internal audit, the score for each dimension, and the overall
rating, is D.

PI-23: Availability of Information on Resources Received by Service Delivery Units
This indicator asks whether normal administrative and accounting systems provide reliable information
about resources received by primary schools and primary health clinics, whatever the level of government
that is responsible for operating them.

In DB schools fall directly under the government, whose systems identify the resources allocated to each
of them at both budget and out-turn stages. Schools may receive additional amounts through charges for
the use of their facilities and through donations, which are accounted for in out-turn statements.
Accounting system provides reliable information on both cash and in kind resources received by schools.
Health services are provided through the Health Fund, which is financed mainly through contributions
and operates at arm’s length from the government. Some health facilities belong to the government, and
their employees are treated as public servants, but their expenditure is not treated as part of the budget.
(Transfers from the budget to such institutions are included in the budget, but they account separately for
their revenue and expenditure.) Health Fund revenue and expenditure are reported to the Assembly
alongside the budget, but not the expenditure of individual clinics, etc. Information is routinely available
about resources received by individual schools, but not about resources for healthcare facilities.

PI-24: Quality and Timeliness of In-year Budget Reports
This indicator reviews three aspects of in-year budget execution reporting: (i) the scope of reports and the
extent to which comparisons are possible with budget estimates on an administrative, economic, and
functional basis, with commitments covered separately from payments: (ii) the timeliness of reports; and
(iii) the quality of the information.

    (i) Scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget estimates
Quarterly data on actual expenditures are prepared in the same format as the annual budget —that is, by
economic and administrative classifications. The reports are submitted to the District Assembly.
However, commitments are not covered.

    (ii) Timeliness of the issue of reports
According to Article 45 of the Law on Budget, the DoF is obliged to deliver quarterly reports to the DB
government within 60 days after the end of the quarter. In practice these reports are completed and
delivered within four weeks after the end of the quarter.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Quality of information
The reports are produced on Excel spreadsheets rather than directly from the Treasury system. DB’s
intention is to develop a Budgetary Management Information System that is accessible to spending units
as well as the Treasury, and will, among other things, greatly facilitate the production of such reports. A
new draft law on accounting standards, prepared two years ago, was meant to introduce some aspects of
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) but was not adopted by the DB Assembly. At
the moment DB uses the same CoA as FBiH. The Auditor General does not report any major problems
with the accuracy of the data presented in the reports.

PI-25: Quality and Timeliness of Annual Financial Statements
This indicator examines (i) whether a government’s annual financial statements include full information
about revenue and expenditure, and financial assets and liabilities; (ii) whether the statements are
submitted for audit within a short time after the end of each year; and (iii) whether IPSAS are applied.

    (i) Completeness of the annual financial statements
The consolidated financial statements include full information on revenue and expenditure, and financial
assets and liabilities, as verified by the DB SAI (accessible on the SAI website).

Dimension rating: A

    (ii) Timeliness of submission of annual financial statements
The lengthy delays in the District Assembly’s adoption of each year’s budget have resulted in some
delays in the DoF’s submission of the financial statements for audit. There have also been some delays in
the submission of some of the necessary information to the DoF.

    (iii) Accounting standards used
The accounting standards applied are defined by the 2008 Decision on Establishing Accounting Policies
for Budget Users and Treasury of DB (available on the DoF website). DB aims to comply with IPSAS,
and the SAI has not criticized its financial statements on this aspect. However, this does not necessarily
mean that all IPSAS are being consistently applied, especially bearing in mind that accounting and
reporting are mainly done on a modified accruals basis and that the CoA is based on FBiH’s. In addition,
the latest available translation of IPSAS is from 2011, so recent revisions of the standards are not being
applied by any of the four governments.

PI-26: Scope, Nature, and Follow-up of External Audit
This indicator reviews the work done by the external audit institution. DB has its own dedicated audit
institution, which is independent of the other public audit institutions in BiH. Like the other three BiH
SAIs, DB’s SAI is not anchored in the Constitution and does not have full independence from the DoF in
setting its budget. Three dimensions are considered for this indicator: (i) the scope and nature of the audit
performed, including its adherence to international standards; (ii) the timeliness of the submission of its
reports to the District Assembly; and (iii) the evidence of follow-up of audit recommendations.

    (i) Scope/nature of audit performed
DB has its own separate audit institution (Office for Audit of Financial Operations of Institutions of
District Brčko of Bosnia and Herzegovina), which operates under legislation closely resembling that
covering the BiH Institutions’ and the Entities’ SAIs. It seeks to comply with INTOSAI standards in
carrying out its work. The DB SAI has been operating only since March 1, 2007. In addition to financial
audit, and compliance auditing, the SAI has also already performed performance audits, specifically: a) of
efficiency in the resolution of property and legal relations in the process of expropriation, b) of efficiency
of the Brčko District of BiH Government in the resolution of citizens’ appeals concerning the operations
of public administration, c) of obstacles to more effective management of public property in Brčko
District of BiH, and d) of company registration in DB. It has 13 staff, which should be sufficient to ensure
full coverage of all government operations, including those of the Health Fund and local public
utilities.Central government entities representing at least 75% of total expenditures are audited annually.
In 2011 the DB Assembly commissioned a consultancy firm to review the SAI’s operations.

    (ii) Timeliness of submission of audit reports to the legislature
The SAI submits its audit reports to the DB Assembly each year in June, within three months after
receiving the budget execution statements from the DoF, in compliance with the law on SAI of DB. Audit
reports are submitted to legislature within 3 months of end of period covered and in the case of financial
statements from their receipt by the auditor.

Dimension rating: A

    (iii) Evidence of follow-up on audit recommendations
The SAI began its work on March 1, 2008, and the recommendations it has made so far have been
relatively limited in scope. The review team was given to understand that the SAI reports do not contain
much material about the follow-up of earlier recommendations. The office, in its reports on financial audit
performed, includes a special chapter under the title of “Review of findings and implementation of
recommendations from the preceding audit”, which lists the recommendations from the preceding year
which the client had not implemented, i.e. which the client had implemented only partially. In addition to
that, following the publication of the report on performance audit, the Office checks on the degree of
implementation of the recommendations provided, on the annual level, by requesting information in
writing from the client. Besides the aforementioned, the Office, in its reports on operations from 2012 and
on, on which it informs the Assembly of Brčko District of BiH and the public, separately discusses the
chapter on “Realization of recommendations provided”.

All budget users respond officially to draft audit reports and after final audit reports are submitted by the
SAI, institutions prepare Action Plans for implementation of the audit recommendations, which are sent
to SAI, Government, and Parliament. Before each audit, SAI received reports on implementation of the
Action Plans from previous audits by each institution.

PI-27: Legislative Scrutiny of the Annual Budget Law
This indicator is concerned with whether the DB Legislative Assembly undertakes a comprehensive and
timely review of the annual budget proposed by the executive government. It takes into account the
review of the budgets for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 fiscal years. Four dimensions are considered: (i) the
scope of the District Assembly’s scrutiny; (ii) the extent to which the Assembly’s procedures are
established and respected; (iii) the adequacy of the time available to the Assembly; and (iv) the rules for
in-year amendment of the budget without the DB Assembly’s prior approval.
                                                   232


    (i) Scope of the scrutiny by Parliament
Both the DB MTEF (see PI-11 and 12), which includes the DB government’s macroeconomic and fiscal
forecasts, and the Annual Budget proposal are formally submitted to the DB Assembly.

The DoF submits the draft budget to the DB government within the timescale set down in the law, in time
for it to be submitted to the DB Assembly on October 1, in accordance with the law. The budget should
be approved by the DB Assembly by December 1. However, once the initial proposals reach the
government, the legally required timescale is disregarded. Political negotiation within the government
may take several weeks, and the eventual draft proposals are then submitted for public consultation —
which in recent years has taken place in January and February of the budget year. Only thereafter are the
formal proposals submitted to the Assembly. Less than a month may then be left between the time of the
formal submission of the government’s proposals to the Assembly and the end-March deadline beyond
which temporary financing at the level of the previous year’s budget cannot be continued. Formal scrutiny
of the proposals by the Assembly appears to be rather limited, although Assembly members may be fully
engaged in both the preliminary political consultations and the public hearings on the administration’s
draft proposals. These arrangements do not fit into any of the situations contemplated by the PEFA
criteria, but according to information received the final budget proposals are not subject to much
systematic scrutiny when they eventually reach the Assembly.

    (iii) Adequacy of time for the legislature to provide a response to budget proposals—both the
    detailed estimates and, where applicable, proposals on macro-fiscal aggregates earlier in the
    budget preparation cycle (time allowed in practice for all stages combined).
DB has little concern about the macroeconomic background to the budget, since its guaranteed share of
indirect tax revenue and practice of cautious budgeting mean that attention needs to be focused only on
the actual expenditure proposals. Members of the Assembly have plenty of time to comment on the draft
proposals before they are formally submitted by the administration, although collective consideration by
the Assembly appears relatively limited.

    (iv) Rules for in-year amendments to the budget without ex-ante approval by the legislature
The law provides for significant amendment to budget allocations within the approved budget without
prior approval by the Parliamentary Assembly. The law provides that, at a budget user’s request, the DB
DoF may decide to restructure the expenditures within the total amount approved for a particular budget
user, if the change does not exceed 10% of the total approved expenditure for that budget user.

The government may reallocate funds between budget users within a given aggregate budget upon
proposal by the DoF.

PI-28: Legislative Scrutiny of External Audit Reports
The report of the Audit Office covers the entire general government, PEs that are owned by the
government or whose debts are guaranteed by it, and entities that receive government grants and foreign-
financed projects. This indicator looks at the legislature’s role in examining the Audit Office’s reports on
the management of public finance and in monitoring the implementation of recommendations made by
the SAI. Three dimensions are considered: (i) the timeliness of the examination of audit reports by the
Assembly; (ii) the extent of hearings on key findings undertaken by the Assembly; and (iii) the issuancee
of recommendations by the Assembly and their implementation by the executive.

audit report for each budget user), and the public report on the audits conducted by DB SAI. It normally
takes up to eight months for the Assembly to complete its work on the reports. The dates of submission of
the reports and of the adoption of its reports by the Assembly are set out in Table 4.4.35.

           (iii) Issuance of recommended actions by the legislature and implementation by the executive
The audit reports present the SAI’s recommendations on actions to be undertaken by the government.
These recommendations are usually adopted by the DB Assembly without amendment.

The Law on Audit of Public Administration and Institutions of DB enables the Assembly to impose sanctions
on budget users only if budget users either fail to provide requested information to the DB SAI or deliberately
provide wrong information (see Article 49 and 50 of the law).189 There are no regulations that would permit
the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with the recommendations of the Audit Office. The general

assessment by the DoF is that budget users do not address the recommendations of the DB SAI or do so only
in a superficial manner. The DB Assembly has not been of help in this regard. Unlike in other levels of
government in BiH, there is no specialized parliamentary committee that is designated to deal with audit
reports.

IV. Assessment of PFM Systems, Processes, and Institutions

                                                  DONOR PRACTICES
In terms of the external debt (including budget support loans) and guarantees, they are contracted through
the BiH Institutions for all government levels in BiH.However, each government level has external
donations which do not necessarily have to be contracted/authorized through the BiH Institutions for all
government levels (although Ministry of Finance and Treasury does keep some data on grants which go to
lower government levels, but only for few donors such as the World Bank and KfW and mostly in the
cases where country-wide coordination/project implementation units are established). Furthermore, only a
small portion of all donations go through government budgets (in comparison to estimate of total external
donations which is estimated roughly by the Central Bank within Balance of Payments based on the data
on official development assistance to BiH published by the OECD-DAC and some collected directly from
the donors present, as well as in comparison to estimate of foreign financing by the Sector for
Coordination of International Economic Aid of the BiH Institutions Ministry of Finance and Treasury,
external donations which go through the budgets represent a very small portion of total external
donations). All donations are included in the Public Investment Programme (PIP), even those that do not
pass through the budget. In addition, among the four central government levels, only BiH Institutions
budget includes some small donations in budget plans (only for those donations which can be planned
with certainty), while Entity Government budgets essentially do not include any donations. However,
budget execution reports at all levels do include review of actually executed donationswhich go through
budgets. Thus, only a very small portion of total external donations seems to go through government
budgets, out of which in turn very small portion (or nothing at all at the Entity level) is planned in
government budgets due in part to lack of predictability. Overall, external donations, as opposed to
external budget support loans, are notan important source of revenue for central governments in BiH, with
only small portions going through the budgets. Even in the cases of external donations which goes
through the budgets, they are either not planned at all in budget plans (at the Entity level) or only a small
portion is planned in budget plan (BiH Institutions), implying poor predictability of inflows of
externaldonations. Given that most of the donor funding refers to external debt (budget support loans)
and given than only small external donations are planned in the budgets (especially in the Entity budgets),
the PEFA indicators measuring Donor Performance (D1-D3) in this Report is applied and measured only
at the level of BiH Institutions. The flow of external debt information (among other dimensions of
                                                            236


financial/budgetary reporting) on debt financing is not fluid across the governments of BiH and is
captured by reporting on BiH Institutions within the SBA with the IMF, and it is also planned that the
entities shall improve their reporting on projects.

On its 94th session, held on May 9, 2014, the BiH Council of Ministers adopted the Information on the
Public Investments Information Management System (PIMIS) and adopted the conclusion in connection
with that all budgets users of the Institutions of BiH shall be under obligation to perform the planning and
delegating of projects on line through the electronic form for identification, registration, and monitoring
of projects / programme in the PIMIS system.

D-1: Predictability of Direct Budget Support
This indicator examines the functioning of the arrangements made by development partners to notify the
recipient government of the amounts of direct budget support it could expect to receive each year, so that
it can build them into its budget planning. It asks further whether payments are actually made in
accordance with a previously notified quarterly path.

      (i) Annual deviation of actual budget support from forecast provided at least six weeks prior to
      budget submission to the legislature
The direct budget support loans for general purposes to BiH in 2009-2013 were provided by the World
Bank, European Commission, and the IMF. Although initial estimate of disbursement schedule exists in
all cases and these funds have been included in government budget plans, actual disbursement timings of
all of these budget support loans depend on fulfilment of policy conditions/criteria by the governments,

The direct budget support loans provided to BiH during 2009-2013 from the World Bank was in
accordance with an agreement made in 2010. SDR 42.2million (about €51million) was paid in 2010, and
a further €31.3million in 2012.There was no previous agreement about the timing of payments (just
estimates), which depended on BiH’s meeting the conditions for the disbursements. Given that the policy
conditions were not met on time, disbursements were not made in line with initial estimates.

The EU agreed in 2012 to provide a macro-financial assistance loan of €100million (also a budget support
loan), which is expected to be disbursed in tranches in 2013, subject to BiH meeting the conditions. There
has been no previous notification of the timing of direct budget support payments -given that the policy
conditions were not met on time, disbursements were not made in line with initial estimates.

Finally, BiH has had two SBA with the IMF (SBAs) since 2009, providing largest budget support loans in
BiH190. The first was approved on July 8, 2009, in the amount of SDR 1,014.6 million. That SBA closed
on July 7, 2012, having disbursed a total of SDR 338.20 million. The current SBA was approved on
September 26, 2012, in the amount of SDR 338.2 million (about US$508.6 million). As of December 10,
2013, 211.38 million SDR 191 had been disbursed. All of the receipts of the SBAs went to Entity
governments. The SBAs also included estimate of disbursement timings, but given that in some instances
the policy conditions were not met on time, there have been instances of delays of disbursements in
comparison to initial estimates.

Given that budget support loans do not have official forecast of disbursements since they are tied to
policy condition fulfilment by the governments, while budget donations are essentially not included in
government budgets at all, ratings is D


190
     The first SBA with IMF was signed on 2 August 2002 in an amount of 67.60 million SDR and the total amount had been
disbursed. The first SBA expired on 29 February 2004.

    (ii) In-year timeliness of donor disbursements

determined schedule.

D-2: Financial Information Provided by Donors for Budgeting and Reporting on Project and
Program Aid
This indicator examines whether development partners provide estimates of disbursements of project and
program aid in time for them to be taken into account in the recipient government’s budget preparation,
and whether they subsequently make quarterly reports of actual disbursements.

    (i) Completeness and timeliness of budget estimates by donors for project and program support
To the extent possible, the Sector for Coordination of International Economic Aid of the BiH Institutions
Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MFT) keeps track of all external grant and loan financing provided to
each of the four governments, and prepares a consolidated report. The latest Donor Mapping Report,
produced in the second half of 2012, covers total allocations up to the end of July 2012. In 2011 grants
totalled €171.3million and loans totalled €370.1 million. For 2012 grants totalled €176.3million and loans
totalled €267.4million. The EU is the largest provider of grants, at about €50million a year in 2011-2012,
followed by USAID, UNDP, Germany, and Sweden, each providing €20-25million. The largest lenders in
2011 were EIB (€215.5million), EBRD (€93.6million), and World Bank (€56.1million). The EU provided
the following table showing its programmed and actual disbursements 2009-2012.

With the exception of EU projects (which are managed centrally by the European Union Delegation), the
execution of externally financed projects and programs is under the control of the four BiH governments, to
the extent that the donor funds go through the government budgets and that the donors or financiers
communicate that information to the governments. World Bank assistance is programmed in accordance with
a Country Partnership Strategy (the current strategy covers the period 2012-15, and envisages new
commitments of about $350million, while $200m would be drawn under previous loan agreements), but
actual drawings depend on the rate of project execution. The FBiH and RS governments generally include in
budget estimates only the cofinancing element required for externally financed projects, while BiH
                                                         238


Institutions and DB also include already committed donor grants, to the extent the donors or financiers
communicate that information to them.

The BiH Institutions MFT is working to integrate external funding into a Public Investment Program
covering all four governments, which could then be brought fully within budget estimates.

Dimension rating: Not Applicable

       (ii) Frequency and coverage of reporting by donors on actual donor flows for project support
Since the relevant flow of information under the actual current arrangements for project execution (other
than EU IPA projects, which are under EU direct control) is from the BiH authorities, who are managing
project execution, to the donors from whom funding is drawn, this dimension is also considered to be Not
Applicable.

D-3: Proportion of Aid Managed by the Use of National Procedures
This indicator looks at the extent to which aid is integrated into the country’s normal arrangements for
budget preparation and execution, in accordance with the Paris and Accra Declarations, which envisage
that donors will progressively increase their reliance on national systems for the execution of the projects
they finance. Amounts received as direct budget support by definition use national procedures for
procurement, banking/payment, accounting, internal controls reporting, and audit.

Externally financed projects are thus using some elements of national procedures at present only for
staffing, which on the PEFA conventions implies that the usage of national procedures is only 25%. Since
direct budget support for the three years 2010-2012 at about €80million amounts to only about 5% of total
external funding (€1.66 billion) during this period 192 , the overall average use of national procedures
remains well below the 50% threshold required for a C rating.

                                            V. REFORM PROCESS
A. Recent and Ongoing Reform Measures
Through a joint Public Administration Reform Coordination Office project, all four main levels of
government (BiH Institutions, two Entities, and DB) are in the final phases of introducing a Budget
Management Information System that should simplify the budget planning process (including the
performance-budgeting/program format) and provide data sharing between the budget planning and
treasury (separately at each of the four levels; no overall consolidation will be facilitated).

BiH Institutions. The Law on Financing of the Institutions of BiH was amended in April 2013 to ensure
that external debt service obligations can continue to be made in the absence of an approved government
budget193 (an existing structural benchmark). However, issues may remain in regard to the temporary
financing of the BiH Institutions, which the law implies could theoretically last forever.194

Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina. A new Law on Budgets was adopted in December 2013, which
strengthens the overall budget preparation process in FBiH, explains the budget calendar in greater detail,
and increases the ability to enforce spending limits on lower levels of government, EBFs, and public
companies.195 The Law includes a fiscal rule stating that the planned current budget must be balanced,
and if a current deficit is executed, the government must plan for a current surplus in the next three years.

In addition, new amendments to the Law on Distribution of Revenues in FBiH, which are also in
parliamentary adoption procedures, envisage a decrease of the cantons’ share and an increase in the local
self-governance units’ share in personal income tax, and also simplify the revenue sharing in Canton
Sarajevo. It is also envisaged that, after the data on population census are processed (the BiH Census is
scheduled for October 2013), all of the revenue distribution formulas in this law will be revisited.

Republika Srpska. In RS, a centralized payroll system for all employees in the public sector will be set up
for improved recording, control, and planning. RS plans to start this process by the end of calendar year
2013 and fully implement it by July 2014.196

All levels. Other improvements (envisaged within the SBA with the IMF) include (a) signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding by the four tax administrations on the exchange of taxpayer information
(with a view to facilitating the permanent, unfettered, and automated sharing of taxpayer records); (b) the
planned submission of a new law on public procurement to the BiH Parliament to strengthen governance,
enhance transparency, and bring procurement practices in BiH in line with those in the EU); (c) continued
expansion of treasury systems in both Entities to cover all cantons, local self-governance units, and EBFs,
and (d) establishment of a common definition of spending arrears by the BiH Institutions and Entity
governments and a requirement that all due dates of invoices be entered into the treasury system and data
on arrears according to legal definition start being produced.

An EC-financed project, Capacity Building for the Compilation of Accounting Data within the Scope of
General Government and Public Finance Statistics, has been initiated to establish a methodology,
responsibilities, and deadlines for fiscal data consolidation and reporting for the whole general
government sector of BiH. Some initial training for lower government levels in FBiH is envisaged.

Management in Bosnia and Herzegovina, aims to improve the quality of fiscal policy and the link
between the policymaking and budget planning processes, and to strengthen the public internal financial
control system.

B. Expected Changes in Tax Legislation in Bosnia and Herzegovina

1. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Indirect taxes
The penalty interest for late payment of indirect taxes will decrease from the current 0.06% per day to
0.04% per day.

The ITA is implementing the project Further Harmonization of Indirect Taxes in BiH with the EU
Legislation, a twinning project executed in coordination with the Ministries of Finance of Austria and
Slovenia. The changes in legislation are likely to be implemented in the next two years. Regarding VAT
legislation, harmonization with OECD guidelines is expected in the areas of tax refunds, place of supply
of services, electronic and Internet services, and others. Harmonization with the EU legislation will be
implemented in the areas of excise duties, transfer of goods, intellectual property rights, internal
procedures and audits, risk analyses, human resources, and development of the IT system.

2. Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
The draft version of the Amendment of the Corporate Income Tax Law of FBiH indicates that several
changes will be made to the legislation in FY 2014.

    Corporation tax incentives. Currently, there are two main incentives: the export-related incentive
     (a full exemption for companies whose gross export sales exceed 30% of total sales), and the
     investment in production incentive (for companies that are investing a minimum of BAM 20 million
     over five consecutive years in production). With the legislation changes, the export-related tax
     exemption will become proportional to net export sales, and the investment in production incentive
     will be abolished.

    Transfer pricing documentation. The new legislation will introduce more comprehensive and
     detailed instructions regarding documentation of transactions with related parties. The instructions
     will be in line with OECD guidelines. FBiH branches of RS and DB companies will now be liable
     for corporate income tax attributed to their profits earned in the FBiH (currently, their profit is
     exempted from the FBiH taxation). Legislation will be introduced to shorten the period of carry
     forward of tax losses from the current five years to three years.

In addition, there are ongoing discussions changing the tax rate applicable to personal taxation. The
current flat tax rate of 10% may be replaced with incremental progressive rates. Exemption from taxation
of income from dividends and capital gains from the disposal of shareholdings is expected to be
abolished.
