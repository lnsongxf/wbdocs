Hard choices

July 2014
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for Indonesia.
          The report is compiled by the Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management Global Practice team,
          under the guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri, Practice Manager, Ndiame Diop, Lead Economist,
          and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. Led by Alex Sienaert, Country Economist, and with
          responsibility for Part A, editing and production, the core project team comprises Arsianti,
          Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Yus Medina, Elitza Mileva (Part A
          lead), Michele Savini Zangrandi and Violeta Vulovic, with additional editing by Peter Milne.
          Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto. Dissemination is organized by Farhana
          Asnap, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Desy Mutialim and Nugroho Sunjoyo, under the
          guidance of Dini Sari Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Alex Sienaert (Section B.1, ICP 2011),
          Magda Adriani, Mubariq Ahmad, Iwan Gunawan and Paul van Howagen (Section B.2, forest fires
          and El Niño), Vivi Alatas, Edgar Janz and Matthew Grant Wai-Poi (Section C, inequality). Key

                           has been ample in 2014 to date, as portfolio capital inflows into Indonesia (and other
                           emerging economies) have benefited from prolonged accommodative monetary conditions
                           in advanced economies and a recovery in global risk appetite, lifting offshore investor
                           holdings of domestic government bonds to a record high.

                           financing inflows, if global risk appetite reverses. Additional downside pressure on growth
                           could come from an intensifying credit contraction, if this results in further weakness in
                           property prices, which in turn reduces real construction activity.

                          critical if Indonesia is to achieve its development priorities. Progress in this area will be

 A. Economic and fiscal update




                  1. Global financial market conditions have improved but commodity price
                     softness remains
Emerging markets are      After a weaker-than-expected start to 2014, the global economy is forecast to pick up speed
to benefit from a pick-   more or less in line with earlier expectations. Most of the acceleration will come from high-
up in global demand       income countries, in particular the U.S. and the Euro Area, supporting demand for

prices remain soft        revenues in commodity exporters like Indonesia, whose fiscal position will also be adversely
                          impacted from recent rises in oil prices.

Despite a first-quarter   According to the World Bank’s June projections1, global economic activity is expected to

economy growth, as        weather-related first-quarter weakness, the U.S. economy is gaining momentum and the
well as import demand,    Euro Area is strengthening as well. As a result, high-income country import demand growth
is firming…               is expected to more than double in 2014 to 4.2 percent from 1.9 percent in 2013, and rise
                          further to 4.8 percent in 2015. The average GDP growth rate of Indonesia’s 13 major
                          trading partners, weighted by export share, is forecasted at 4.0 percent in 2014 and 3.9
                          percent in 2015. Thus, the outlook for Indonesia’s exports – which are somewhat less
                          focused on high income countries than some regional peers – remains unchanged for 2014
                          and is slightly down for 2015 compared with the March 2014 IEQ.

… but, at the same        Although overall global demand has been improving, its positive impact on Indonesia’s
time, commodity           exports has been offset by the continued decline in many global commodity prices, with the
prices, in particular     exception of crude oil. In the second quarter of 2014, among Indonesia’s main export
metals, are falling       commodities, the prices of coal, natural gas, rubber, copper and gold decreased considerably

                                for almost 45 percent of global metal demand. At the same time, global oil prices rose
                                between March and June 2014, with the Indonesian crude price up by almost USD 2. As a

                     2. Indonesia’s recent growth moderation has been led by weak net exports
The cyclical                    Real GDP growth in Indonesia moderated to 5.2 percent yoy and 4.3 percent qoq saar in the
moderation in growth            first quarter of 2014 (Figure 4). This slowdown was in line with the path of macroeconomic
has continued in 2014           adjustment projected in the March 2014 IEQ. However, in contrast to 2013 Q4, when
Q1, as expected                 economic activity received a significant boost from net exports, in 2014 Q1 domestic
                                demand remained robust while the net trade contribution to growth was slightly negative.
                                Looking forward, lower-than-earlier-expected government consumption, on account of the
                                revised Budget, slower credit growth and weaker commodity-related income growth are
                                likely to constrain growth in the second half of 2014.

Private consumption             Domestic demand growth increased to 5.3 percent yoy in Q1 2014, from 5.1 percent in Q4
spending, likely partly         2013, and contributed 4.5 percentage points to overall GDP growth (Figure 5). Private
boosted by election-            consumption grew by 5.6 percent yoy and 5.8 percent qoq saar. The pick-up in growth from
related spending,               5.3 percent yoy in Q4 2013 was caused by higher non-food consumption, which was likely
supported growth in             driven in part by temporary, election-related spending. Government spending in Q1 2014
2014 Q1…                        grew by 3.6 percent yoy, down from 6.4 percent in Q4. Gross fixed capital formation
                                continued to grow at a relatively moderate pace of 5.1 percent yoy, up from the 4.4 percent

                               robust, contributing 4.7 percentage points to year-on-year fixed investment growth.
                               Spending on foreign transportation equipment continued to decline in year-on-year terms
                               for a fifth consecutive quarter, while spending on foreign machinery and equipment
                               registered positive growth for the first time in four quarters.

… while net exports            In contrast to Q4 2013 when net exports were the main driver of growth, in Q1 2014 the
contributed negatively         contribution of net exports to year-on-year growth was -0.1 percentage points (Figure 5).
to growth in the same          The growth rate of real exports of goods and services dropped markedly in the first quarter
period                         of 2014, with a contraction of 0.8 percent yoy compared with growth of 7.4 percent yoy Q4
                               2013. Based on trade volume data, the decline in real exports in Q1 was due to lower coal
                               exports as well as a virtual halt in the exports of ores, slags and ashes, consistent with the
                               reported impact of the January partial ban on unprocessed mineral exports. At the same
                               time, import volumes decreased by 0.7 percent yoy after declining by 0.6 percent in Q4.

In line with the weaker        From the production perspective, the mining sector contributed the most to the slowdown
mineral exports, the           in year-on-year real GDP growth in Q1 2014 (Figure 6). The contribution to year-on-year
mining sector proved a         growth of the other sectors of the economy remained broadly stable in Q1 2014. The weak
drag on growth                 performance of mining and quarrying was expected, as the partial ban on unprocessed
                               mineral exports took effect in mid-January 2014. The decline in mining output, together with
                               the continuous weakness in commodity prices, has had markedly different impacts across
                               Indonesian provinces, with the ones relatively more dependent on mining seeing the largest
                               slowdown in provincial GDP growth (see Box 1).

High-frequency                 A number of monthly economic activity indicators, such as the Bank Indonesia (BI)
indicators continue to         consumer confidence survey, the HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Indonesia, as
provide mixed signals          well as motorcycle and cement sales, point to a slight improvement in economic conditions
                               in Q2 2014 (Figure 7). However, car sales declined significantly in April and May, likely on
                               account of their higher sensitivity to the general economic slowdown as well as the Rupiah
                               depreciation, compared with motorcycle sales for example. Overall, the high-frequency data
                               do not provide a clear indication of the level of domestic demand in the second quarter of
                               the year.

The World Bank’s 2014          In the base case, the World Bank projects real GDP growth for Indonesia of 5.2 percent in
growth outlook for             2014 and 5.6 percent in 2015. From a regional perspective, Indonesia’s expected 2014
Indonesia is revised           performance is above the average of 4.7 percent for East Asia excluding China and
down slightly to 5.2           Indonesia projected by the World Bank, while the 2015 figure is equal to the regional
percent, with growth           average (Global Economic Prospects, June 2014). The latest 2014 GDP growth projection
projected to pick up to        includes a downward revision of 0.1 percentage points from the March 2014 IEQ forecast.
5.6 percent in 2015            The changes to the short-term outlook reflect the worse-than-expected 2014 Q1 trade data,
                               which will reduce the projected contribution of net exports to growth over the year. In
                               addition, the lower GDP forecast accounts for slower government consumption growth
                               which reflects the IDR 43 trillion of spending cuts contained in the revised Budget (see
                               Section 6). Following the likely pre-election increase in spending, private consumption
                               growth is expected to moderate somewhat. Relatively tighter credit conditions and slower
                               commodity-related income growth are the key factors behind the projected slight slowdown
                               in consumption expenditure in the second half of 2014. The fixed investment forecast of 4.7
                               percent growth has been revised to reflect Q1 2014 data, with downside risks to the outlook
                               increasing given the recent trends in credit growth (see Section 5).

Both headline and core           In the second quarter of 2014, price pressures remained contained, with headline inflation
inflation stabilized in          gradually declining to 6.7 percent yoy in June and core inflation stabilizing at around 4.8
Q2 2014                          percent in May and June (using the new 2012-base CPI series from BPS) (Figure 8).
                                 Relatively tight credit conditions in recent months (see Section 5) have possibly offset some
                                 of the impact on inflation of the significant Rupiah depreciation of the second half of 2013
                                 and pick up in private consumption growth in Q1 2014. The year-on-year inflation rate will
                                 decline considerably in July as the subsidized fuel price increase of 22 June 2013 drops out
                                 of the base, but upside risks to the outlook remain.

Food inflation has also          Food price inflation has remained below 7.5 percent since March 2014 (according to the
remained low, with rice          2012-base series), well below the highs observed last year. The prices of several key foods,
prices declining owing           such as rice and chilies, have declined, reflecting relatively favorable weather affecting
to a good harvest                positively both production and distribution. Declining domestic rice prices have narrowed
                                 the gap between domestic and international prices (Figure 9). However, there are upside
                                 risks to rice prices in the near term, for example, associated with possible El Niño weather
                                 conditions later this year (see Section B.1).

The baseline outlook             Looking ahead, strong base effects will drive headline inflation down in the second half of
for inflation is                 2014, as the one-off rise in price levels due to the June 2013 subsidized fuel price increase
moderate, although               drops out of year-on-year comparisons. The World Bank projects an average annual inflation
there are upside risks           rate of 5.8 percent in 2014, dropping to 4.9 percent in 2015. These forecasts account for a
                                 small increase in the CPI caused by the electricity tariff adjustment introduced by the
                                 Government this year, as well as some expected upward pressure on food prices caused by
                                 El Niño. However, the possibility of further administered price reforms remains an upside
                                 risk to inflation, given the considerable fiscal strains (see Section 6). Another risk is the scale
                                 of this year’s effect of El Niño on food prices, and the Government’s response, in particular
                                 to a rice supply shock.2

process have emerged             the current account adjustment process is facing a number of challenges. As expected, the
                                 partial raw mineral export ban, introduced in January, caused a significant decline in overall
                                 export volumes. This, together with the ongoing moderation in global commodity prices, has
                                 resulted in weak exports being a continued drag on the overall current account so far this
                                 year. At the same time, as mentioned above, the strong recovery in capital flows to emerging
                                 markets led to a surge in portfolio flows and a decline in external financing pressures for
                                 Indonesia over the first half of 2014. However, the medium term picture outlined in
                                 previous IEQs remains; international borrowing costs are expected to increase, highlighting
                                 the need to support continued external adjustment and high quality financing inflows in
                                 order to limit Indonesia’s vulnerabilities to future episodes of global market volatility.

The current account              The current account deficit came in at 2.1 percent of GDP in both Q4 2013 and Q1 2014,
deficit remained                 totaling USD 4.2 billion in Q1 (Figure 10). Beyond the stable headline number, however,

Monthly data indicates      Monthly customs trade data indicated a marked deterioration in the trade balance in April
a likely deterioration in   2014, when imports outweighed exports by close to USD 2 billion. The deterioration came
the goods trade             about with an approximately equal increase in non-fuel raw material imports and decrease in
balance in Q2, with         non-oil and gas exports (in particular coal and vegetable oils). While May 2014 customs trade
income payments also        data show a small positive balance of USD 69.9 million, the second Q2-to-date customs
likely to push the          trade balance remains in negative territory. A potential additional strain on the Q2 current
current account deficit     account is posed by the fact that the second quarter of the year tends to see a rise in outflows
wider                       on the income account associated with dividend payments. As a result of these factors, the
                            current account deficit in the second quarter is expected to widen significantly from the
                            levels seen in the previous two quarters, with Bank Indonesia recently signaling its
                            expectation of a current account deficit on the order of 4 percent of GDP.3

Direct investment           The capital and financial account balance remained well in surplus in Q1 2014, with a net
recovered somewhat in       inflow of USD 7.8 billion against USD 8.8 billion in Q4 2013. However, the composition of
the first quarter while     inflows changed substantially from Q4 2013, when portfolio and other investment inflows
portfolio investment        offset unusually weak net direct investment (due largely to an outbound transaction). In the
surged to a decade-         first quarter of 2014, net direct investment recovered somewhat, to USD 3.0 billion, and
high…                       portfolio investment recorded a decade-high net inflow of USD 9.0 billion. At the same
                            time, the volatile “other investments” sub-account balance turned negative, with net
                            outflows of USD 4.1 billion, due primarily to a shift offshore of private deposits (USD 2.4
                            billion) and loan repayments by the Government (USD 1.4 billion).

...on the back of             The decade-high portfolio inflows recorded in Q1 2014 were fuelled by renewed investor
renewed appetite for          appetite for emerging market assets (as discussed above), including Indonesian bonds and
EME equities and              equities. Net government debt liabilities inflows were significant and totaled USD 5.6 billion,
bonds                         above the recent peaks seen in quarterly inflows in 2010 and 2011. USD 2.4 billion flowed
                              into foreign currency bonds and USD 3.2 billion into domestic currency government bonds.
                              Net private equity liabilities were also significant at USD 2.1 billion – the most since Q1
                              2013. Net offshore purchases of Rupiah-denominated government bonds, SBIs and equities
                              remained strong into the second quarter of 2014 as well, albeit tapering off in June.

Annual gross external         Issues of current account financing should be read in the context of overall gross financing
financing needs are           needs. Total external debt-to-GDP remains moderate, at 32.4 percent of GDP in Q1 2014
above USD 80 billion          (as measured by BI), but external debt levels and amortizations grew strongly, particularly for
                              the private sector, from 2011-2013 (Figure 16). Consequently, gross external financing needs
                              have risen over recent years both to finance the current account deficit and to meet external
                              debt amortizations. Indeed, of the estimated total gross external financing needs in 2013 of
                              USD 83 billion (based on BI data), the current account deficit generated only 35 percent,
                              while private and public sector debt amortization generated 50 percent and 15 percent
                              respectively. Short-term external funding pressures could therefore emerge not only as a
                              result of current account financing becoming more challenging (whether because of a
                              renewed widening in the current account or reduced foreign investment inflows), but also if
                              there were to be a marked rise in private external debt rollover costs, or a decrease in the
                              availability of external financing more broadly.

Box 1: Recent challenges in Indonesia’s commodity export sector
 Commodities are a major constituent of Indonesia’s exports, with crude oil, crude palm oil (CPO), rubber, gas, coal and other
 minerals accounting for more than half of Indonesia’s exports by value in 2013. The raw commodity sector also accounted directly
 for around one-fifth of real GDP growth between 2002 and 2012. Furthermore, estimates based on the 2008 Input-Output table
 indicate that, through a multiplier effect, a unit increase in the output of the raw commodity sector is associated with a 1.5 unit
 increase in total output. The multiplier is even larger for the processed commodities sector, where a one unit increase is associated
 with a 2.1 unit increase in total output.
 Indonesia’s commodity exports are facing significant headwinds, with declining global commodity prices and the regulations issued
 in January 2014 imposing a ban on certain raw mineral exports and export taxes on all unprocessed mineral exports. Overall, the
 share of (raw) commodities in the value of total exports has declined from 60 percent in 2011 to 53.3 percent in 2013, and further
 down to 50 percent in the first quarter of this year. As discussed above, the observed impact of the unprocessed mineral export ban
 has been negative from a trade perspective.1 Copper concentrate exports have effectively ceased since February 2014, as Freeport
 and Newmont, responsible for 97 percent of Indonesia’s copper concentrate exports, halted exports. Similarly, trade data shows
 that the exports of raw nickel, bauxite, lead and zinc, the other major minerals affected by the policy, declined by a factor of five.
 As a result, the share of ores, slags and ashes (the statistical definition most closely accounting for raw minerals which is available
 on a timely basis) dropped from 2.9 percent of total exports in Q1 2013 to 0.7 percent a year later.

Apart from the direct effect on export revenues, the unprocessed mineral export ban and lower global commodity prices are likely to
have additional macro-economic and social consequences. For instance, according to monthly BPS trade data, the demand for
imported trucks, excavators and cranes, which are used in the mining sector, declined by 60 percent between Q1 2012 and Q1 2014,
resulting in lower imports of capital goods. In addition, the unprocessed mineral export ban has contributed to higher regulatory
uncertainty in the sector, with potential legal challenges and reports of ongoing negotiations on some of the key regulations, especially
those surrounding the export tax. The increased uncertainty may in turn reduce future investment in the commodity sector.
Finally, the decline in employment, incomes and new investment stemming from the slowdown in commodity exports, and
production, is expected to affect some provinces of Indonesia disproportionately more than others. The regions subject to the
greatest risk are those where commodity sectors make up a large share of output and where the main commodities have seen the
largest price decline. According to Bank Indonesia estimates of Q1 2014 provincial GDP (Regional Economic Report (Laporan
Nusantara), May 2014), Aceh, East Kalimantan, Kepri, Papua, Riau, and West Papua have seen year-on-year GDP growth rates
significantly below the national average (Figure 18).

                  5.   Indonesian asset prices strengthen but credit conditions tighten
Indonesian financial       Partly as a consequence of larger foreign capital inflows, financial asset prices in Indonesia
asset prices have          have generally risen since the beginning of this year, recovering most of the losses incurred
picked up, while credit    in the second half of 2013. However, most of the improvement in 2014 so far occurred in
has continued to           the first quarter. At the same time, bank liquidity in domestic currency remains relatively
tighten                    tight, contributing to the ongoing decrease in credit growth. The credit growth slowdown
                           and lower property prices have become a downside risk to the economic outlook. At the
                           same time, lower growth expectations may feed through into a further weakening of credit
                           demand.

The Rupiah weakened        The Rupiah weakened by 2.7 percent against the US Dollar from the end of March to July
against the US dollar in   15, 2014, reversing some of the first-quarter gain of 6.8 percent. The recent depreciation
the second quarter of      reflects the above-mentioned pressures on the current account balance in the second
2014, after                quarter, and occurred despite strong capital inflows. Liquidity in the onshore currency
strengthening in the       market has increased with average onshore spot market volumes of USD 1 billion per day
first three months of      this year, versus less than USD 0.8 billion in the first half of 2013. Compared with mid-May
the year                   2013, before the capital reversal episode which followed the Federal Reserve’s
                           announcement of the possibility of reduced asset purchases, the Rupiah was 20.1 percent
                           weaker against the US dollar on July 15, 2014. However, in real effective (trade-weighted)
                           terms, there has been a more moderate depreciation of 10 percent through May 2014.

Equity and bond prices Despite a decline in June, Indonesian local equity and bond prices have risen this year, with
have risen this year   offshore investors becoming significant net buyers of both equities and government bonds,
                       as discussed in Section 4. As of July 14, 2014, local equities were up 5.3 percent since the
                       end of March and up 16 percent year to date, reversing most of the loss incurred in 2013.
                       Since the start of January, offshore investors have purchased IDR 41.4 trillion (or close to
                       USD 3.6 billion) of local equities and IDR 87.9 trillion (or slightly more than USD 7.6
                       billion) of Indonesian local currency government bonds. The 10-year government bond yield
                       decreased modestly, by 39 basis points in the first quarter of 2014 but increased by 6 basis
                       points between end-March and mid-July. At 8.3 percent on July 15, 2014, it is still much
                       higher than its level in mid-May last year (5.6 percent), following the subsequent abrupt rise
                       in domestic yields.

Credit growth                    Credit growth has weakened and slow growth in loan approvals indicates that this trend will
continues to                     likely persist. Credit growth declined to 18.6 percent yoy in April 2014, from 21.4 percent in
decelerate…                      December 2013 (Figure 19). In the same period, ex post real credit growth, adjusted by
                                 realized CPI inflation, dropped by 1.8 percentage points to 10.5 percent yoy. Credit growth
                                 adjusted for the effect of changes in the exchange rate decreased from 17.3 percent yoy in
                                 December to 15.8 percent yoy in April, with dollar lending only growing by 4.9 percent yoy
                                 in March after a recent high of 10.4 percent yoy last November. New loan approvals in May
                                 declined by 12.1 percent yoy (3mma), after decreasing by 1.2 percent in March, and
                                 compared with 17.9 percent yoy growth (3mma) in May last year.

…constrained mainly              Tighter funding conditions due to weaker deposit growth appears to be the main factor
by credit supply                 behind the slowdown in bank credit. Deposit growth has decelerated faster than loan growth
conditions…                      since 2012 (Figure 19). This is despite a rise in the average deposit interest rate from around
                                 5.6 percent in June last year to more than 8 percent in March 2014. The loan to deposit ratio
                                 (LDR) of the banking system was 90.8 in April, only slightly below the BI upper threshold
                                 for individual banks of 92 percent, above which banks’ minimum reserve requirements are
                                 increased. As highlighted in the March 2014 IEQ, the LDRs of smaller banks are higher than
                                 those of larger banks, pointing to market segmentation in access to third party funding.

…with mixed signs                While credit supply has clearly become more constrained, the recent evidence on credit
regarding credit                 demand conditions is mixed. Since May 2013, banks have been unable or unwilling to pass
demand                           the increase in the cost of funding to borrowers, as shown by the decrease in lending
                                 spreads, amid rising deposit rates (Figure 20). This may indicate either weaker credit demand
                                 at higher lending rates, or banks’ being cautious to extend credit at higher rates so as not to
                                 trigger rising non-performing loans.

Property prices                  Residential property price growth rate has fallen further to 7.9 percent yoy in March 2014
continue to weaken               compared with 11.5 percent last December, according to the 14-city BI index. Lower loan-
amid signs of slower             to-value ratios for second (or more) homes, introduced in March 2013, and tighter market
property-related bank            liquidity continue to drive the decline in property demand, particularly for middle-end
credit                           residential homes. Industrial and office rental and selling price growth also both declined
                                 from around 30 percent yoy in December 2013 to 15 percent, in March 2014 (4-city BI
                                 index). Apartment selling and rental price growth are also down. One reason for the drop in
                                 property price growth is the decline in bank property financing. Overall property loans grew
                                 at 23 percent yoy in April, down from 27 percent yoy at the end of 2013. Several banks have
                                 reportedly limited their property sector credit. As discussed above, a weakening outlook for
                                 property prices represents a downside risk to the near-term growth outlook to the extent
                                 that it feeds through into softening construction investment in particular.

The corporate sector,          Beyond credit conditions and property sector developments, the Indonesian corporate
especially                     sector is currently facing four major hurdles: rising electricity and labor costs, tightening
manufacturing firms, is        market liquidity and the weaker Rupiah. The last factor is perhaps the most material for
also adjusting to the          corporate margins and profitability. The corporate profitability of manufacturing companies,
sizeable depreciation          such as producers of textiles and shoes, for which most inputs are imported, are particularly
of the Rupiah over the         impacted by the weaker Rupiah. The currency depreciation has also adversely affected
past year…                     consumer goods companies such as food and beverage producers. The real depreciation of
                               the Rupiah and improved high-income country demand do, however, present upside
                               possibilities for the export earnings of Indonesian manufacturing companies (as discussed in
                               Section 4 above).

                    6. The fiscal sector continues to be under pressure
Parliament approved a          Responding to macroeconomic changes, subdued revenue growth, and rising energy subsidy
revised Budget for             costs, the Government proposed a substantially revised 2014 Budget. The deficit under the
2014, with the deficit         revised Budget approved by Parliament on June 18 is 2.4 percent of GDP. Significant
increased in response          budget cuts of IDR 43 trillion for line ministries were approved (down from IDR 100
to continued fiscal            trillion under the Government’s original proposal) along with the postponement to 2015 of
pressures…                     the payment of rising energy subsidy arrears of around IDR 50 trillion. The additional net
                               financing need from the approved higher deficit of IDR 66 trillion in 2014 is expected to be
                               financed mostly by the issuance of Government bonds. Without policy measures and
                               including energy subsidy arrears, the Government had projected that the fiscal deficit could
                               reach approximately 4.7 percent of GDP.4

…caused in part by             The revised 2014 Budget lowers expected revenues relative to the original Budget by IDR
weaker revenue                 31.8 trillion (or 1.9 percent). This is mostly due to a reduction in non-oil and gas tax
collection performance         revenues of IDR 24.3 trillion (4.8 percent less than in the original budget) and a lowering of
                               expected value-added tax (VAT) by IDR 17.4 trillion (a downward revision of 3.5 percent).
                               Despite significantly lower oil production of 818,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with
                               the original Budget (870,000 bpd), revised projected oil and gas tax and non-tax revenues are
                               higher than in the original Budget, mostly due to the depreciation of the Rupiah. The revised
                               2014 Budget does not assume any significant revenue policy changes in 2014 and focuses
                               mostly on tax administration improvements to secure the 2014 tax revenue target, for
                               example through e-invoice VAT and income tax filing. Expected weak revenue performance
                               continues the trend of recent years (Box 2).

Box 2: Weak revenue performance has had a marked negative impact on the fiscal balance in recent years
While much of the recent concern regarding fiscal trends has been on the expenditure side, weakening revenue performance is also a major
source of fiscal pressure. The growth of both nominal expenditures and revenues has slowed sharply since mid-2012 (Figure 21).
Decomposing the change in the central government fiscal balance in recent years, in 2011 and 2012, most of the rise in the deficit-to-GDP
originated from increasing expenditures, mainly through subsidies. But in 2013, weaker revenues-to-GDP accounted for most of the increase
in the fiscal deficit, declining by 0.9 percentage points of GDP versus a 0.6 percentage point of GDP fall in expenditures (Figure 22).

Total nominal revenue growth has fallen significantly over the last three years, from 21.6 percent growth yoy in 2011, to 10.5 percent yoy in
2012, and 6.8 percent yoy in 2013. Nominal GDP growth has also fallen over this period, but not by as much: nominal GDP was up 15.1
percent in 2011, 10.9 percent in 2012, and 10.4 percent in 2013. As a result revenue-to-GDP has dropped down from 16.3 percent and 16.2
percent in 2011 and 2012 to 15.3 percent in 2013, the lowest level since 1998/1999. A summary measure of the performance of revenues is
“buoyancy”. This measures the responsiveness of total revenues to aggregate income growth, defined as the ratio of the percentage change in
nominal revenues to the percentage change in nominal GDP. Total revenue buoyancy was 1.4 in 2011, declining to 0.9 and 0.5 in 2012 and
2013, respectively.

A major driver of weaker revenues has been oil and gas revenues (both tax and non-tax) (Figure 23). Income tax growth from oil and gas has
slowed sharply, growing 6.3 percent yoy in 2013, down from 14.2 percent and 24.2 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Non-tax oil and
gas revenues, meanwhile, contracted outright in 2013, by 1.1 percent, having previously grown by 6.4 percent yoy (2012) and 26.7 percent yoy
(2011). Revenues from the sector have been impacted by a steady downward trend in oil production during the last two decades as well as
bouts of price volatility (e.g. in 2008/9), but tax and non-tax revenue collection in recent years has been mostly impacted by lower production
of both oil and gas, rather than prices which have been generally favorable in Rupiah terms (Figure 24).
The softening of overall revenue growth has extended beyond oil and gas revenues. Non-oil and gas income tax growth was sharply weaker
in 2012 (up 6.6 percent yoy) and 2013 (up 8.5 percent) compared with 2011 (up 20.1 percent), though the relative performance as measured
by the tax buoyancy of non-oil and gas income tax revenues remained stable in 2012 and 2013 (at 0.6). Along with the general decline in
nominal GDP growth, the significant fall in non-energy commodity prices since 2011, impacting corporate profitability and incomes, has
been one driver of the falling revenue growth from this source.

                            the growth of the tax base. VAT
                            receipts decelerated quite markedly (up 7.8 percent yoy in Jan-May 2014), likely impacted by
                            import compression (see Section 4).

Substantially higher        On the expenditure side, revised expenditures are up only by IDR 34 trillion (or 2 percent
energy subsidy costs        more than in the initial Budget). However, this masks substantial line ministry budget cuts to
also contributed to the     offset higher energy subsidy costs which continue to put considerable pressure on the fiscal
higher fiscal deficit in    sector. Despite the average 33 percent increase in subsidized fuel prices in June 2013, energy
the approved revised        subsidy costs have continued to increase, driven in particular by the weaker Rupiah since
2014 Budget…                mid-2013, which has again widened the gap between regulated and market prices (Figure 26).
                            According to the revised 2014 Budget, in the absence of fuel subsidy reform, energy subsidy
                            spending will increase by IDR 68 trillion relative to the original Budget, reaching IDR 350
                            trillion (or 3.5 percent of GDP). Fuel subsidy spending is revised up by IDR 36 trillion to
                            IDR 246 trillion, while the electricity subsidy increases by IDR 32 trillion to IDR 104 trillion
                            (despite significant tariff increases, discussed below). However, these are still well below the
                            Government’s Budget revision proposals as, under the approved Budget, the payment for
                            accumulated energy subsidy arrears of IDR 50 trillion is carried forward to 2015 (Figure 27).
                            In addition, the approved Budget assumes a slightly stronger exchange rate (IDR 11,600 per
                            USD versus 11,700 proposed by Government).

…and the extent to          The approved revised Budget lowers subsidized fuel volume to 46 million kiloliters versus 48
which the subsidized        million kiloliters initially proposed by the Government. This assumption appears optimistic,
fuel quota binds will       as this is below actual subsidized fuel consumption in 2013, of 46.4 million kiloliters. For
affect the fiscal outturn   2014, the Government intends to focus on quantitative restriction measures (controlling the
                            volume of fuel consumption) such as stricter enforcement of the ban on subsidized fuel use
                            for government, state and mining, non-passenger sea transportation vehicles and the
                            conversion program from fuel to gas. Past experience suggests that these measures face
                            implementation challenges and have limited effectiveness.5 In contrast to previous years,
                            however, the revised 2014 Budget includes a revision to Article 14, which narrows the
                            Government’s flexibility in managing energy subsidy spending. In the initial Budget Law, the
                            Government was allowed, subject to Parliament’s approval, to adjust energy subsidy
                            spending according to realization and changes in macroeconomic projections and energy
                            subsidy parameters. In the revised Budget Law, the reference to energy subsidy parameters
                            was removed and the macroeconomic assumptions on which changes in energy subsidy
                            spending are allowed are explicitly limited to two indicators: the oil price (ICP) and exchange
                            rate. This means that the Government no longer has the flexibility to adjust energy subsidy

                              pressure to control the volume of consumption, this change may make the quota more
                              binding than has previously been the case. If it were to bind, this would shave approximately

Progress on electricity       Following tariff adjustment for large industrial and business groups in May, the Government
tariff adjustment             introduced further tariff adjustment for six additional customer groups as part of the 2014
continues                     Budget revision, effective on July 1, 2014. The adjustments will be phased in over July,
                              September, and November, and, together with the increases announced in May, result in a
                              significant rise in electricity tariffs for most large user categories (Table 4). Through this
                              additional tariff adjustment, the Government projects a saving of IDR 8.5 trillion for the
                              state budget in 2014, but electricity subsidy spending remains significant, as discussed above,
                              at a projected IDR 103.8 trillion in 2014 under the revised Budget, up 45.5 percent from the
                              original Budget (APBN), and up 3.8 percent from realized spending in 2013 (Figure 28), due
                              to higher input costs.6 Full-year subsidy cost savings can be illustrated by hypothetically
                              applying the tariff adjustments announced in both May and July to the full-year (2014),
                              which suggests annual savings relative to a no-change scenario on the order of IDR 37.2
                              trillion. However, with automatic price adjustment mechanisms having been introduced for
                              only some users as part of the new regulations in May (but not July), these savings remain
                              vulnerable to renewed upward pressure on electricity supply costs, notably from any further
                              Rupiah depreciation or higher international energy costs. The impacts of the tariff increases
                              on costs, firms’ responses, and prices, will vary according to firm and industry structures but
                              given the sizable quantum of the increases over the year these merit further examination.

                           as 4.0 percent of GDP. The World Bank expects revenue collection in 2014 to continue
                           moderating and has revised down its revenue projection by 2.6 percent, due mainly to lower
                           expected tax revenues, through lower oil and gas production, a slowdown in VAT collection
                           (due to expected moderation of private consumption and imports) and reduction of the

                                  of the revised full-year issuance target. Securities financing thus remains on track for 2014,

                      7. The pace of poverty reduction has slowed
The Government’s                  The official poverty rate, as measured by the national statistics agency (Badan Pusat Statistik,
poverty target for 2014           BPS) for March 2014 was 11.3 percent, representing a marginal 0.1 percentage point decline
is likely to be missed,           from 11.4 percent in March 2013. This continues the slowing trend in poverty reduction
due to a slowing rate of          over the last five years, where annual poverty reduction has been below 1 percentage point
poverty reduction                 each year, with only modest poverty reduction recorded especially for the last three years.
                                  The near-zero decline in 2014 is the smallest in over a decade, with the exception of the
                                  nearly 2 percentage point increase in 2006 due mainly to food price shocks (Figure 31). With
                                  poverty currently at 11.3 percent, the Government’s 2014 target of 8-10 percent under the
                                  current medium-term development plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah, RPJM, 2009-
                                  14) is unlikely to be met when the September 2014 poverty rate is announced (expected in
                                  January 2015).

Contributing factors              There are a number of reasons for slowing poverty reduction.9 One important factor is that
are that the remaining            as poverty approaches 10 percent, the remaining poor are further and further below the
poor are increasingly             poverty line, meaning that higher consumption growth at the bottom of the income
hard to reach, and that           distribution is required to maintain previous rates of poverty reduction. Moreover, not only
economic growth                   is economic growth slowing, but the poor and vulnerable have participated less in this
continues to be                   growth than wealthier Indonesians, contributing to the widening in inequality discussed in
unequally shared…                 Section C.

…amid signs from the              Another factor that may be weighing on poverty reduction is slowing employment growth.
most recent labor data            New labor market data released by BPS in May 2014 shows that total employment stood at
of slowing employment             112.8 million in August 2013, down by 0.2 percent from the year previously (Figure 32). The
creation                          drop is attributable to stagnant formal employment growth in 2012-2013, following strong
                                  growth from 2010-2012. Consequently, the unemployment rate edged higher to 6.2 percent
                                  in August 2013, up from 6.1 percent in 2012, while the share of the working age population
                                  in employment fell by a full percentage point, to 62.7 percent.

International risks to      The World Bank’s baseline scenario for Indonesia’s outlook is one of a slight moderation

                            stands to lose from rising oil prices as higher oil prices would add to the fiscal deficit
                            through the dominant direct impact on higher fuel subsidy spending. Finally, as a major
                            commodity exporter, Indonesia continues to be sensitive to developments in China, that is
                            the country’s ongoing process of economic rebalancing while aiming to minimize financial

                            population growth is also slowing. All of these factors represent significant risks to

                 1. El Niño, forest fires and haze: the imperatives for concrete action
Forest and land fires,        Indonesia has experienced annual large-scale forest and land fires since 1982,11 together with
while not new to              significant environmental damage and economic impacts. In fact, forest fires are not a new

occurring with                that the occurrence of forest fires, albeit on a smaller scale, and the notion of an annual fire-
increasing frequency          prone dry season between May and November, existed at least as far back as the Dutch
and on a larger scale         colonial period. But while fires may be nothing new, the occurrence of very large-scale fires
                              with annual regularity is a more recent trend. This section provides a brief overview of this
                              complex issue, drawing on the major fires in Riau province (east Sumatra) in early 2014 as a
                              case study, particularly in light of the heightened near-term forest fire risks due to possible
                              El Niño conditions later this year.

                         a.   Underlying causes of recurring forest and land fires

The causes of forest          Several studies have documented the underlying causes of forest fires in Indonesia. For
fires in Indonesia are        example, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) conducted a study into the
well understood…              underlying causes and impacts of fires across Southeast Asia, including examining traditional
                              land development practices in both the highlands and lowlands of Sumatra. The study
                              identified several underlying causes, including land preparation for agriculture, illegal logging,
                              insecure land tenure of the community, and land speculation.12

… and include                 Peat fires are also a major trigger for new forest fires, in addition to having their own
degraded peatland             economic, social and environmental effects (see Box 3). On the island of Sumatra, most peat
                              is found along the eastern coast, where six large remaining forest areas can be identified.

 Box 3: Peat, peatland and peat fires
 Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. Peat forms when plant material, usually in wetland areas, is
 inhibited from decaying fully where flooding obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition.
 Peat is characterized by its wet environment. Drought will, however, increase evaporation and lower the groundwater table and soil
 moisture content. Consequently, drought increases the vulnerability of peatland to fire risks, exacerbated if the soils are drained.
 Drainage of peatland can enhance agricultural productivity and improve the accessibility of the terrain. However, drainage enhances
 soil exposure to oxygen, which consequently oxidizes, resulting in accelerated subsidence of peat soils. Draining peatland also
 increases its vulnerability to fire, as it reduces the moisture content and stimulates oxygen supply.
 Peat has a high carbon content and once ignited it smolders and can even burn underground, provided there is a source of oxygen.
 Peat fires can burn almost indefinitely or at least until the fuel is exhausted or the oxygen supply is interrupted. These smoldering
 fires can burn undetected for very long periods (months, years, and even centuries) propagating through the underground peat layer.
 Peat fires are emerging as a global threat with significant economic, social, and ecological impacts, not only because of the haze they
 create, but also because of major resulting CO2 emissions. Over 100 peat fires in Kalimantan and East Sumatra have continued to
 burn since 1997. Each year, the peat fires in Kalimantan and East Sumatra ignite new forest fires above the ground. Water
 management in developed peatland is essential not only to find a balance between drainage levels and cultivation practices but also
 to reduce fire risks, and to protect peat soils for future generations.

                           has proven to be difficult in the face of strong economic incentives. Within one to two
                           months, occupied areas typically become small plantations claimed by small-holding settlers
                           who live in enclaves inside the forest area. As time progresses, most of these small-holdings
                           change hands and become owned by medium-size companies. In the case of independent
                           small-holdings, it is estimated that a hectare of oil palm plantation that costs less than IDR 2
                           million in investment may change ownership after 4 to 5 years (after the first fruit is proven)
                           for a value in the range of IDR 30-35 million. High expected financial gains, coupled with
                           weak law enforcement capacity, have thus become the main cause of forest and land fires. It
                           is also important to recognize, however, that another driver behind forest and land fires is
                           conflict over land. Albeit on a far smaller scale, these are cases where fire is used as weapon
                           in disputes or as a way to seize disputed land.15

 Box 4: El Niño and ENSO
 El Niño is a natural phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean caused by a prolonged increase in the sea’s surface
 temperature. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the trade winds usually blow from east to west, gathering warm water as they go and
 depositing it in the west in the form of typhoons and thunderstorms. This process creates a temperature imbalance with cold
 water in the east and warm water in the west (around Indonesia). As a consequence, warm water flows to the South American
 coast and trade winds start to weaken and sometimes reverse direction completely. This phenomenon is also often referred to as
 the ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation). El Niño occurs when the surface water temperature in the central and eastern parts
 of the ocean rises and the temperature in the western part falls, causing a decrease in evaporation and a reduced moisture supply
 from the east, with consequently less cloud formation and less rain.
 Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2 to 7 years, and lasts 9 months to 2 years. Primary effects of El Niño are
 alterations in weather patterns, such as changes in temperature, rainfall, storm tracks and currents. For example, during El Niño
 the temperatures will generally be higher, and from June to August eastern Indonesia will often suffer droughts as the rain zone
 moves eastwards to the islands along the equator in the Pacific Ocean. The effects on rainfall of El Niño are strongest in the
 period from September to November when almost all of Indonesia is drier than usual. In December-February, East Indonesia
 stays drier.

                               the 1994 ENSO forest fires triggered an ASEAN regional response with the establishment
                               of a special committee and a legally binding trans-boundary haze pollution agreement. The
                               1997 ENSO forest fires have thus far been the most significant in terms of size and impact.

February-March 2014       occurred predominantly in lowland coastal areas and at the margins of peat-swamp forest
burned more than          (Figure 34). Around 24 percent of the burned area was swampy bushes (logged-over forest),
176,000 ha.               while around 22 percent was on secondary swamp forest. Overlaying this with a land-system
                          map reveals that 143,000 ha. of the burned areas fall in land classified as peatland. Further
                          overlays with forest utilization license maps reveal that 1,300 ha. of the burned areas were in
                          natural forest designated for utilization, and 68,500 ha. in areas designated as industrial
                          forest, and another 30,000 ha. in areas with palm oil plantation licenses. This analysis is
                          consistent with previously documented patterns of fires where these start from lowland
                          forest and plantation margins where plantation expansion may be ongoing.

The total damage and      According to World Bank estimates, the total damage and loss from the February-March
losses caused by the      2014 Riau fires is estimated at USD 935 million, or 2.8 percent of Riau province GDP (as
forest fires in Riau in   projected by the regional government). Total damage is estimated to be USD 73 million (7.8
February-March 2014       percent of the total damage and loss), and total losses are estimated at USD 862 million (92.2
alone is estimated at     percent of the total). Damage is a proxy for the amount of financing needed for
USD 935 million           reconstruction and rehabilitation, while the losses represent the reduction in economic
                          activities and income that arise in the following months or years as a result of the disaster
                          (Table 6). Over 73 percent of all damage and losses are of a private nature, primarily
                          occurring in forest concession areas and palm oil crops owned by private firms.18

Forestry and              Forestry and agricultural crops suffered most during the fire with damage and losses
agricultural crops        estimated at USD 301 million and USD 260 million, respectively. This impact was associated
suffered most, followed   with the burning of 34,300 ha. of forestry land and 25,400 ha. of agricultural land, with palm
by manufacturing and      oil plantation and dry-land agriculture comprising 75 percent and 25 percent of total
then the trade sector     agricultural land, respectively. The direct damage to forestry was relatively limited, as
                          calculated from replanting costs. However, the losses were significant based on the number
                          of destroyed trees and their sales value. Manufacturing losses were also significant, at USD
                          219 million. The loss of industrial forest in Riau results in a major loss for the surrounding
                          sawn-timber, plywood, and pulp and paper manufacturers. Some manufacturers have limited
                          if any alternative sources for their main raw materials, in this case timber. The trade sector is
                          estimated to have suffered losses of 10 percent of total provincial trade sector annual output,

                          18The assessment was conducted in early April 2014 using the methodology designed by the UN
                           Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to determine the value of lost
                           assets, and assess the impact on each sector.

Overall, the Riau fires        The Riau fires are estimated to have caused a decline in provincial GDP growth for several
are estimated to have          years. For 2014, the regional government of Riau had expected to post regional GDP
caused a material              growth of 3.0 percent, with 6.0 percent growth of non-oil-and-gas GDP and a 0.7 percent
decline in provincial          contraction of oil-related GDP. However, based on the impact assessment summarized
GDP growth                     above, Riau’s 2014 regional GDP growth may be lowered by 0.4 to 0.6 percentage points, to
                               approximately 2.5 percent yoy, all else equal. Non-oil sectors (which account for 63 percent
                               of provincial GDP) were impacted the most, with their losses projected to reduce non-oil
                               GDP growth from 6.0 to 4.9 percent. With Riau one of Indonesia’s “big five” regions in
                               terms of regional GDP, along with DKI Jakarta, East Java, West Java, and Central Java, such
                               impacts are also of national economic interest.

However, the assessed          Due to limited time and resources, the assessment did not include the education sector (e.g.
losses do not cover            disruption to schooling). It also only partially captured the health effects of the disaster,
important impacts,             focusing on public spending on medicine and health equipment, but not the longer-term
such as longer-term            human health consequences of exposure to the smoke haze arising from the fires. Studies on
health and                     the health impacts of forest fires, related to the increase of fine particulate matter levels,
environmental costs…           have demonstrated that in the long run health-related economic impacts appear to be
                               substantial, second only to timber losses.19 In addition, due to forests having multiple
                               functions it is difficult to state the true economic value of all goods and services provided
                               from forest resources. Notably, for example, the economic impact of the environmental
                               losses in this assessment only includes the value of the loss of biodiversity related income,
                               and does not capture the release of emissions from the fires.

…and recurrent fires           Comprehensive forest fire impact assessment should also consider the major, longer-term

Indonesia and to the           export earnings. Many industry players have become more proactive in implementing
country’s reputation in        sustainable production including adopting a no-deforestation and no-burning policy in land
international markets          preparation for their plantations. However, while plantation owners undertake preventive

                             measures to protect their productive crops, the pattern of fires also remains consistent with
                             the pattern of plantation expansion, typically using the local community to carry out burning
                             for land preparation (as discussed above). This practice of using local communities as a
                             proxy makes it difficult to establish that companies certified as applying sustainable
                             production are not involved in driving the land burning, a situation which may jeopardize

                       d. The imperative for more, concrete action

Forest fires are a           Economic impact assessments, such as that for Riau above, show clearly that the potential
major, costly risk with      costs of forest fires are large. Though less easily quantified, they also bring long-term risks to
significant economic,        business and Indonesia’s international reputation. Other, major long-term risks, though not
social and                   the focus of the brief discussion of this section, include the threat to climate change goals,
environmental                environmental sustainability, and (through economic, social and environmental impacts),
impacts…                     poverty reduction. The risks and costs of large-scale, regular forest fires, therefore, are
                             significant, and consequently should be considered as part of Indonesia’s wider disaster risk
                             prevention and mitigation strategy.

…and are largely             When it comes to natural disasters, Indonesia tops the list of the world’s most vulnerable
preventable, unlike          countries to multiple hazards, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods,
many other disasters         droughts and landslides. Annual disaster-related national fiscal spending, mainly for post-
that continue to occur       disaster reconstruction to rebuild damaged public assets and provide financial assistance to
in Indonesia                 disaster-affected populations, reaches an average of USD 500 million per year.21 Most of this
                             spending is used to respond to natural disasters that cannot be prevented. But, unlike
                             earthquake and volcano occurrences, the number of land and forest fires in Indonesia can be
                             significantly reduced. In the Riau fires of early 2014, the Government had to spend USD 13
                             million on fire-fighting during the two months immediately after the fires got out of control.
                             The communities involved in land clearing by burning typically receive about USD 5 per
                             person per day, similar to the rate for typical post-disaster cash-for-work programs. Using
                             this level of payment as an example, when planned properly through a community
                             empowerment approach—which has worked well in disaster prevention, response and
                             recovery in other areas in Indonesia—the USD 13 million spending for two months could
                             have been used to employ more than 30,000 community members for three months to
                             undertake fire prevention and land preparation, all without the use of fires for land clearing.

season will likely           administrations can be a time when policy-making slows down, it is imperative that the
coincide with the early      outgoing and incoming administrations work closely together to ensure that massive fires are
weeks of the new             prevented. For example, systematic steps to determine the start of the fire season using
administration               parameters such as a drought index, the occurrence of hot spots (with higher thresholds),
                             and a decrease in the air quality index, need to be defined. The Government at both the
                             national and subnational levels could trigger a stand-by emergency status much earlier using
                             well-established practices in disaster management under Law No. 24/2007 on Disaster
                             Management that have been applied by the National Agency for Disaster Management
                             (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana, BNPB). Triggering stand-by emergency status early
                             would enable the Government to mobilize stand-by (on-call) funds quickly from the state
                             budget without the need for specific parliamentary approval, enabling preventive measures
                             through intensified law enforcement, and the involvement of local communities. Progress on
                             such measures over the next few months can help to ensure that fires and haze do not
                             impose major environmental and economic losses, and burden the fresh start of the new
                             administration.

                 2. New purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates of Indonesia’s economy
Comparing the size of    How large is Indonesia’s economy relative to that of other countries? To make such
economies and average    comparisons, it is necessary to convert values into common units. One option is to use
expenditures at market   market exchange rates: for example, to compare the size of Indonesia’s economy to that of
exchange rates can be    the US, Indonesia’s GDP in Rupiah can be converted into US Dollars using the market
misleading…              exchange rate (about 12,000 IDR per USD, at the time of writing). However, the market
                         exchange rate may not be a good measure of the relative purchasing power of one dollar in
                         the US versus that of one dollar, converted into Rupiahs, in Indonesia, because it does not
                         adjust for different price levels. If goods and services, particularly non-traded ones, are
                         generally cheaper in Indonesia than in the US, then using market exchange rates would
                         under-estimate the value of goods and services produced by Indonesia, and hence under-
                         estimate of the size of its economy. The International Comparison Program (ICP), an
                         international initiative hosted by the World Bank, tackles this problem of accurately
                         comparing the value of the goods and services produced by different economies. In June
                         2014, the full results were released from the latest round of estimates, launched in 2011
                         (“ICP 2011” or the 2011 Round). This section examines these results for Indonesia.

…relative to using       What is needed is a measure that adjusts for differences in price levels between different
comparisons based on     countries. Purchasing power parity (PPP) estimates, i.e. the ratio of the prices in national
purchasing power         currencies of the same good or service in different economies, can be used to provide cross-
parities (“PPP”)…        country estimates of GDP or expenditure using a common price level.22 For example, if it
                         turned out that, given prevailing prices in Indonesia, the volume of goods and services that
                         could be purchased with one dollar in the US in 2011 could be purchased with only IDR
                         3,607 in Indonesia (not IDR 8,770, the market exchange rate value of one US Dollar in
                         2011), then the estimated goods and services produced by the Indonesian economy, adjusted
                         for differences in purchasing power, would be almost three times larger than when using the
                         market exchange rate. There are theoretical reasons to expect PPP conversion rates to be an
                         important determinant of market currency exchange rates, especially over longer periods, but
                         at any one time there is little reason to expect them to capture PPP, making international
                         economic comparisons on a market exchange rate basis potentially misleading.

...as comprehensively    ICP 2011 provides new estimates of PPP conversion factors across most of the world’s
estimated by ICP 2011    economies. This is the first comprehensive update since the 2005 Round, and involved
                         major improvements in methodology, as well as the addition of new countries to the study
                         (199 countries were included in 2011, compared with 146 in 2005). The methodological
                         differences between the ICP 2005 and 2011 estimates, and shifts in economies over time,
                         make it very difficult to compare the data across years. Rather, the 2011 ICP results should
                         be seen as the new best estimate of the differences in purchasing power across economies.

                    a.   The results for Indonesia: a “Top 10” economy
The global context:      The results of ICP 2011 for Indonesia (summarized in Table 7) should be placed in the
developing economies     global context.23 Developing countries’ share of the global economy is much bigger than
account for a greater    previously estimated. Middle income economies’ share of global GDP is 48 percent when
share of the world       using PPPs and 32 percent when using exchange rates. Six of the world’s twelve largest
economy                  economies were in the middle income category (based on the World Bank’s definition).
                         When combined, the twelve largest economies account for two-thirds of the world
                         economy, and 59 percent of the world population. Roughly twenty-eight percent of the
                         world’s population lives in economies with GDP per capita expenditures above the
                         PPP$ 13,460 world average and 72 percent are below that average. The median yearly per
                         capita expenditures for the world is PPP$ 10,057.

On a PPP basis                     The ICP 2011 estimate of Indonesia’s PPP exchange rate to the US Dollar in 2011 was
Indonesia’s economy is             3,607, resulting in an estimated PPP-based GDP of PPP$ 2.06 trillion. On this basis,
estimated to be the 10th           Indonesia was the tenth largest economy in the world (Figure 35), and the largest developing
largest in the world–              country economy behind only the “BRICs” (Brazil, Russia India and China). Indonesia
the largest developing             accounted for 2.3 percent of total global expenditure (versus 3.6 percent of the global
economy after the                  population). By contrast, using market exchange rates, Indonesia was the nineteenth largest
BRICs…                             economy in the world in 2011, accounting for only 1.2 percent of total global expenditure.
                                   The difference is driven by cheaper prices in Indonesia, with the index of prices used for the
                                   computation standing at only 53 percent of the global price index.

…and consumption                   On average, Indonesians are relatively better off, when compared with average consumption
per person is 13 percent           in the US, for example, than would appear based on commonly-used, market exchange-rate
that of the US, versus             based comparisons. At market exchange rates, consumption expenditure per capita in
under 6 percent when               Indonesia in 2011 was just 5.5 percent of that in the US, but this rises to 12.9 percent on a
comparing using                    PPP basis. However, even adjusting for relative prices, per capita consumption in Indonesia
market exchange rates              remains comparatively low (Figure 36), ranking 127th on a PPP basis out of 187 countries for
                                   which data are available (and 126th at market exchange rates).

The results are               The ICP 2011 results have some important limitations, which this section briefly reviews.
statistical estimates         First, the PPP adjustment factors are statistical estimates. They represent the best effort to
only, subject to              pinpoint the true figure, within an error band. The resultant adjustments are then applied to
uncertainty…                  data, such as domestic currency-denominated output and population, that are also estimates
                              subject to measurement errors. Given this imprecision, as well as the dynamic nature of
                              economies, it is best to focus on the qualitative implications of the estimates (e.g. adjusting
                              for relative price levels shows that Indonesia’s economy is very much bigger than the

                              the intervening years. For such comparisons across time, the best estimate is the official
                              statistical (BPS) estimate of real GDP growth, which shows that Indonesia’s economy
                              expanded by a total of 41 percent in real terms from 2005-2011.

                           decisively avoid falling into a “middle income trap” (as discussed in the World Bank’s recent

                           described in this note. However, the new ICP 2011 PPPs cannot be automatically mapped
                           into new poverty estimates, because they do not necessarily capture the prices faced by the
                           poor (price adjustments to make international poverty rate comparisons should specifically
                           reflect the relative costs of poor households’ consumption baskets across countries). The
                           PPPs based on the 2005 ICP Round will thus continue to be used for the World Bank’s

                           influencing economic structure and may be reflective of deeper policy issues. As Indonesia’s
                           economy continues grow and develop, it is reasonable to expect prices generally to converge
                           with higher world prices. This, in turn, would feed into trend real currency appreciation (by
                           reducing foreign currencies’ purchasing power in Indonesia). Thus, it will be important to
                           consider the broader implications of these new estimates for expectations of future price
                           growth and the impact on the exchange rate.

                  1. Inequality and opportunity in Indonesia
                      a.    Overview: rising inequality matters to the people of Indonesia
Inequality was a major      Inequality was a key issue in the run-up to the recent Indonesian presidential election. Major
media issue in the lead     national and international media outlets reported on rising inequality in Indonesia. Both
up to the Indonesian        presidential candidates made public statements about their concerns about this trend and
presidential election       stated their strategies to combat it during the first televised presidential debate on economic
                            development and national welfare.

The majority of survey      A survey conducted by Lembaga Survei Indonesia in 2014 found that, while most
respondents think that      respondents are prepared to tolerate some degree of inequality, the majority feels that
Indonesia has become        Indonesia is significantly more unequal than it should be and that the country has become
too unequal                 more unequal in recent years.25 Those surveyed had a strong preference for greater equality
                            of incomes and were willing to accept slower overall economic growth to achieve it. The
                            survey found that people greatly underestimate how much of total national income goes to
                            the rich.

since 2000               because the data used to measure it do not adequately represent rich households. Even so,

undermining current        jobs created in Indonesia since 2001, and indeed most current jobs, are in low productivity
growth and poverty         sectors, resulting in low real labor incomes, particularly for the poor and the vulnerable. In
reduction                  addition, these workers have restricted access to formal worker protection. Limited access to
                           good job opportunities also undermines current economic growth, since Indonesia is not
                           maximizing the productive potential of its current labor force, exactly at the time when the
                           demographic dividend is peaking. As they struggle to move upwards, many households are
                           vulnerable to shocks and unexpected events and, without coping mechanisms, are at risk of
                           falling back into poverty.

Unequal opportunities      According to World Bank estimates, one-third of inequality is due to circumstances that are
during childhood also      beyond the control of individuals, such as their birth place and the education of their
compromise future          parents—that is, due to inequality of opportunities. Many of these differences originate
growth and poverty         during childhood, for example, if children grow up without proper housing, water and
reduction                  sanitation, or quality health and education services. Failing to realize the full potential of all
                           Indonesian children today compromises future economic growth, as well as further poverty
                           reduction.

Inequality is not a   Other countries have achieved economic growth without significantly increasing their
necessary part of the inequality levels. Historically, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all saw strong growth over a
development process… number of decades with low inequality. Indonesia, on the other hand, experienced the
                      largest increase in inequality in the region between the 1990s and the 2000s, after China.
                      During the same period, countries like Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines have all
                      enjoyed periods of strong growth with stable or declining inequality.

                      b. Inequality in Indonesia is high and the gap between rich and poor is widening
Inequality in Indonesia    Inequality in Indonesia as measured by the Gini coefficient (see Box 5) changed little
has been steadily          between 1980 and 1996. It fluctuated between 32 and 34 points, rising only to 36 in 1996
increasing since 2000      (Figure 37).27 This changed in the wake of the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis. Urban and
                           wealthier Indonesians were not only the hardest hit by the crisis but also the slowest to
                           recover. Consequently, inequality fell from 36 percentage points in 1996 to 30 by 1999.
                           Following the recovery from the crisis, Indonesia experienced a period of strong economic
                           growth, driven in part by a commodity boom and strong domestic consumption. During
                           this period the Gini coefficient climbed from 30 percentage points in 2000 to 42 by 2013.
                           Comparing consumption levels across households, in 2002 the average consumption per
                           person of the richest 10 percent of households was 6.6 times that of the poorest 10 percent;
                           by 2013, this had risen to 10.3 times. As a consequence, the richest 10 percent now account
                           for nearly a third of all household consumption in Indonesia, and the richest 20 percent for
                           nearly half (Table 8). The poorest 40 percent, on the other hand, account for only a fifth of
                           consumption and their share has been declining over time.

Box 5: The challenge of measuring inequality and comparing across countries
The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of inequality. It lies between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (complete
inequality), with a typical range of 0.3 to 0.5. Often this is expressed in percentage points between 0 and 100. Gini coefficients are
conventionally calculated from either income or consumption distributions. For more information on the Gini coefficient and Theil
measures (used for some of the following analysis), see Haughton and Khandker, 2009, “Handbook on Poverty and Inequality” and
the March 2011 IEQ.

Comparing the Gini coefficients or any inequality measure across countries is very difficult. First, different countries use different
welfare measures. Some, such as Malaysia and many Latin American countries, use household income, while others, such as
Indonesia and most of Asia, use household consumption. Since richer households do not spend all of their income, but instead save
a portion, income Gini coefficients are usually higher than consumption Gini coefficients in any given country. The average
difference is 7.5 points; in Indonesia it is around 6 points (based on the average difference between the income and consumption
Gini coefficients from 1984 to 1993, the last time income data were available), suggesting the current consumption Gini coefficients
of 41 could represent an income Gini coefficients of around 47. Consequently, Indonesian inequality often seems lower than that of
other countries which use income Gini coefficients, when it is actually comparable, or perhaps even higher.
 Even when countries use the same welfare measure, they often define and measure it differently. For example, Indonesia includes
 imputed housing expenditures for homeowners, one-off durable good purchases, and own-production food consumption. Vietnam
 does the same but uses annual durable depreciation instead, while India omits imputed rents and own-production consumption
 altogether. Moreover, the way in which consumption is asked about in a household survey also affects the result. Consequently,
 comparing inequality over time within the same country is more useful than comparing levels across countries.



Most people accurately              Over 90 percent of respondents from the above-mentioned Inequality Perceptions Survey said
perceive that inequality            that Indonesia was ‘unequal’, 40 percent of whom thought that it was ‘very unequal’. These

inequality are higher               almost four times what they thought was received by the bottom 20 percent (7 percent of
than they imagine…                  national income). While the poor do in fact have about the same share of consumption as
                                    the survey respondents believed, the richest 20 percent of Indonesians in national surveys
                                    consume almost 48 percent of the total. This is 10 percentage points more than suggested by
                                    those surveyed.

level likely understates            Accurately measuring inequality requires collecting data from a representative sample of all
the true level                      households, from the poorest to the richest. In Indonesia, however, it appears that the
                                    richest households are under-reporting consumption or missing from the data altogether.
                                    According to the National Socio-economic Survey (Susenas), which is used to estimate
                                    inequality, only 5 million people (or 2 percent of the population) consumed more than IDR
                                    2 million per month during 2012, and only 1.3 million (0.5 percent) more than IDR 4 million

                      inequality. Households whose head has better education have higher consumption, and this
                      gap with poorly educated households has also been increasing over time (Figure 41).

Three quarters of all           About 19 million net new jobs have been created in Indonesia since 2002. Of these 5.1
new jobs since 2001             million have gone to junior secondary graduates, 11.7 million to senior secondary graduates,
have required senior            and 6.1 million to tertiary graduates. Jobs held by those with primary education or less have
secondary education or          actually fallen by 3.8 million in net terms. By 2013, workers with primary education, once a
higher                          majority, became a minority (Figure 42). Declining demand for less educated workers puts
                                downward pressure on their wages relative to those of more educated workers.

                          d. Unequal opportunities during childhood also contribute to higher inequality
Adult inequality often          Some inequality is due to circumstances that are beyond the control of an individual, such as
stems from unequal              gender, ethnicity, birthplace or family background. This type of inequality prevents
opportunities during            individuals from achieving their potential, which is unfair to them and lowers Indonesia’s
childhood; one-third of         overall human capital, reducing growth and productivity. Equality of opportunity, therefore,

                              circumstances are measured for adults due to data limitations, but are strongly related to the
                              opportunities the adults faced as children—namely, where they were born and what
                              educational opportunities they had. The forthcoming World Bank inequality report will
                              more accurately quantify the degree of adult outcomes due to childhood inequality of
                              opportunities.

Differences in the lives      Significant inequality of opportunities can be seen by comparing a child born in Jakarta to
of children with              non-poor parents who have at least high school education with a child born in a rural area of
different background          Papua or Maluku to a poor family with little education. The former has only a 6 percent
in Indonesia can be           chance of lacking proper sanitation, compared with 98 percent for the latter child (Figure
very stark                    43). These differences extend across all other indicators of opportunity, such as access to
                              clean water, having non-dirt floors in the house, primary school enrolment, birth by skilled
                              attendant and immunization coverage. This is true not only when comparing Jakarta and
                              Papua. Generally, children from poor households in rural areas consistently lag behind
                              children from rich households in urban areas on almost every indicator (Figure 44).

multiple dimensions    percent of all urban children who lack access on at least one of these dimensions, 20 percent
                       lack access on two (Figure 45, where this is represented by areas within two overlapping
                       circles) and only around 3 percent lack access on all three (the area within three overlapping
                       circles). In contrast, 58 percent of children in rural areas lack access on at least one
                       dimension, but furthermore, a third of them lack access on two dimensions and another
                       third lack access on all three dimensions. The situation is even worse in some areas, for
                       example in Papua, where almost all children who lack clean drinking water, proper sanitation
                       or electricity, are deprived on at least two of these dimensions, and the vast majority on all
                       three.

                                   Adults whose parents had little education have been increasingly likely to achieve a higher
                                   level of schooling themselves. For example, nearly 60 percent of people born between 1952
                                   and 1961 into a household where the parents had no education, also received no education
                                   themselves. For those born during 1962-71, this rate dropped to 45 percent, and to just 21
                                   percent for those born 1972-81 (Figure 49). However, measures of access and opportunity,
                                   especially in health and education, do not reflect the quality of services received. Children in
                                   poorer or more remote areas not only participate less in these services, but when they do,
                                   the quality is often lower.

Households face a                  Indonesian households have faced a number of negative economic shocks and natural
number of risks at the             disasters in the last 15 years. The country was the worst affected by the Asian financial crisis
individual, household,             in 1997-98. During the 2008-09 global financial crisis, it saw growth slow but it fared better
local and national                 than most. Indonesians have also faced periods of high food prices, such as in 2005-06, 2008
levels                             and 2010. Major recent natural disasters include the 2004 tsunami which devastated Aceh,
                                   earthquakes in a number of locations, and the 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi. These
                                   economic shocks and disasters highlight the substantial risks that households face on an
                                   ongoing basis. Risks specific to particular individuals or households are just as important.
                                   These include loss of employment, illness and accidents, death of a spouse, or divorce. For
                                   many households, such a shock is sufficient to push them back into poverty.

Many households lack               When households experience a shock, they need to find a way to respond. However, many
the access to proper               households lack access to some of the better coping mechanisms that richer households can
coping mechanisms                  use. For example, buying health insurance to cover medical costs during a serious illness or
that richer ones have              accident means a household is not faced with large financial costs when the event occurs.
                                   Those households without insurance face the choice of not treating the individual, using
                                   what little savings they have, selling their assets (which their livelihood often depends upon),
                                   or reducing spending in a way that negatively affects future generations, such as on
                                   education. They can also borrow from friends and family, but in Indonesia this can be
                                   inadequate to deal with severe shocks (Box 6), especially if the shock is being experienced
                                   simultaneously by many people in the community, as in the case of a natural disaster.

                               more over a sustained period and to climb the distribution remains limited. This applies not
                               just to the poor but to the majority of Indonesians.

Risk can also lead             Not only can shocks prevent those who find productive livelihoods from rising, but fear of
households to make             risk—and a lack of mechanisms to effectively deal with it—can mean that people avoid risky
safe but low-income            but potentially rewarding activities in the first place. This is emphasized in the World Bank’s
choices                        2014 World Development Report Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development.32 It
                               observes that “realizing that a negative shock can push them into destitution, bankruptcy, or
                               crisis, poor people may stick with technologies and livelihoods that appear relatively safe but
                               are also stagnant,” pointing out that not only does this prevent people in the bottom half of
                               the distribution from rising upwards, it also adversely affects national development through
                               underinvestment in productive work.

Box 6: Main findings from new research on risk and risk management in Indonesia
Drawing primarily on original qualitative evidence from four rural and peri-urban sites, a forthcoming World Bank study explores in-
depth the risks faced and risk management practices adopted at the household and community level in Indonesia. Three interrelated
research questions are studied: which risks and shocks do households and communities face most frequently and severely? Who or
what do households rely upon to address these risks and shocks? Which specific household or community-level factors lead to
greater exposure to risks and/or use of specific risk management methods?

Five key messages emerge from this work. First, the rural poor and near-poor face a wide variety of risks and shocks. Among these,
economic and health shocks are the most important. In addition, the study examines a less commonly discussed risk, which arises
from the high cost of participating in customary lifecycle rituals. Second, despite the expansion of formal social assistance, informal
coping mechanisms, such as borrowing from friends and family, are by far the most common way in which households and
communities manage the risks and shocks they face. Third, informal resources shared between households or within communities
are often inadequate to manage the most devastating individual and households shocks, or shocks that affect entire communities at
once, such as natural disasters. Informal resources are also inadequate when households confront multiple shocks at the same time
or in quick succession. Fourth, social assistance, especially in the form of programs that address health and environmental shocks,
plays an important role– but coverage and benefit levels remain insufficient. Fifth, building adequate systems that provide
protections against risks and shocks is a central concern of policymakers – these findings suggest that there are important uncovered
risks in the lifecycle that may be better addressed by formal assistance.

                             expected future middle class-driven consumption growth. This may also reduce economic
                             growth through a number of other channels, such as low investments in human capital and
                             decreased entrepreneurial activity. Also, inequality of opportunities can impact on the ability
                             of children today to realize their full potential, affecting growth in the future. Some
                             inequality is needed for growth, as differential rewards provide the incentives for hard work
                             and innovation. In Indonesia, preliminary findings suggest that higher levels of inequality at
                             the district level are related to higher growth, but after a certain point, higher inequality may
                             hurt growth.33

…and slower growth           Poverty generally falls with economic growth, but the speed of poverty reduction depends
can further hamper           on how equally growth is shared. If the pattern of growth benefits the rich more than the
poverty reduction            poor, the pace of poverty reduction slows. Estimates suggest that Indonesia’s strong growth
efforts                      over the last decade could have been sufficient to eradicate poverty. The average growth
                             effect—assuming all households receive the average growth equally—would have reduced
                             poverty from 17.4 percent in 2003 to 0 percent by 2010.34 This would have almost
                             eliminated poverty in Indonesia if all households received average growth equally.35
                             However, the unequal distribution of this growth meant that poverty fell only 5.4 percentage
                             points instead, to 12.0 percent. The degree of inequality, therefore, affects the extent to
                             which Indonesia can realize its poverty reduction targets.

Inequality also              When inequality increases, the differences between household standards of living becomes
contributes to conflict      more noticeable. This may lead to jealousy and conflict. New research on the effects of
and social tensions          inequality in Indonesia shows that as districts become more unequal they are more likely to
                             experience conflict. On average, a district with a Gini coefficient of 30 experiences around
                             30 percent more violent incidents than one with a Gini coefficient of 20. For a district with a
                             Gini coefficient of 40, violence increases by 60 percent.36 More conflict is detrimental
                             socially and politically, but can also create another channel by which economic growth and
                             poverty reduction are slowed down.

                             34 Based on World Bank research that decomposed historical poverty reduction into contributions

                               from average household consumption growth (the effect if all households received the average
                               growth equally) and from the distribution of that growth (the effect if there was no growth and only
                               the observed change in inequality). Applying this to Indonesia provides both growth and distribution
                               effects, but also a large (negative) residual. However, the most conservative case for the growth effect
                               can be determined by adding all of this residual to distribution, leaving the minimum growth effect on
                               poverty reduction, which is presented here.
                             35 In reality, poverty would have been low but non-zero, as some non-poor would fall into poverty

                       g. There is wide demand for action and a number of key policy messages are emerging

Surveys suggest that       When asked to choose between two distributions of income—one less equal and one more

slower overall             percent of total national income. Their ideal distribution is not perfectly equal: it still has
economic growth to         those at the top with more than twice as much income as those at the bottom. When given
achieve it                 the choice, survey respondents said that they would prefer slower growth and falling
                           inequality to faster growth and widening inequality. Respondents also had specific ideas on
                           how to reduce inequality. Some 42 percent said providing work opportunities is the most
                           important way to tackle inequality, while 24 percent favored social protection strategies.
                           Other respondents chose education as the best response (18 percent) or overcoming
                           corruption (18 percent).

Knowing how to             The World Bank’s ongoing research project on inequality, on which this section draws, aims
respond requires a         to provide a better understanding of the causes of inequality in Indonesia. With such
better understanding of    diagnostics, Indonesia’s new government and policymakers will be in a better position to

                           the main drivers of inequality in Indonesia.

… and learning from        International experience suggests that rising inequality is neither a necessary outcome of
other countries that       development, nor is it a common trend across the region over the past decade. Thailand,
have reduced               Vietnam and the Philippines have all enjoyed broadly similar levels of growth as Indonesia
inequality while           over a similar period, while seeing stable or falling inequality. Furthermore, the Latin
continuing to grow         America region—the most unequal in the world—has seen declines in inequality since the
                           late 1990s. Different countries in this region have achieved this in different ways, but there
                           are common lessons and a range of possible policy options.38

Government spending        The structure of fiscal policy can be an important determinant of inequality trends within an
and taxation policies      economy. Some forms of expenditure may primarily benefit the rich, such as fuel subsidies,
have an important role     while others may benefit all Indonesians. Examples of the latter include investments in
to play in addressing      primary health care and education, and in infrastructure to better connect villages to cities,
concerns over the          outlying regions to the center, and Indonesia to international markets. The structure of
distribution of income     taxation also matters. For example, governments can ask all citizens to pay their fair share.
                           Broadening the tax base to cover more people not only increases the range of growth-
                           promoting and inequality-reducing policies the government can adopt, but it can also lead to
                           a fairer income distribution.

productive             fill them. This, in turn, requires investments to close Indonesia’s long-standing infrastructure
livelihoods…           and skills gaps. It also means an open economic environment that promotes the continued
                       rise of Indonesia up the value ladder, including labor regulations that benefit both workers
                       and businesses, a positive investment climate, efficient and transparent rules and regulations
                       for business, and a bureaucracy free from corruption and inefficiency. As set out in the
                       Development Policy Review, the implementation of such a productivity-driven growth
                       strategy is required to unleash the potential of the economy, to boost growth and share

…and are protected     Many Indonesians work hard at school, stay healthy, and get good jobs. But they still face
from shocks            many risks in life, and shocks can take away their hard-won gains. The Government can help
                       protect households from such shocks, whether to health, employment, or the cost of living.

                       protect themselves, while extending insurance to those who cannot afford it. Getting the
                       new social security programs right will be essential. Second, it is necessary to expand and
                       improve the current social safety net to effectively provide all the poor and vulnerable with
                       the support they need to cope with the many serious risks they face in life. Third,
                       continuously enhancing the management of disaster risks and further building resilience is
