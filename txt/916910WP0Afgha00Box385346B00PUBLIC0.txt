                                         Executive Summary

Political events have overshadowed economic developments in Afghanistan in recent months. The
protracted election process has compounded uncertainty building since 2013 from the political and security
transition. An agreement on a national unity government signed on September 21 and the September 29
swearing in of the President and Chief Executive Officer provide Afghanistan with a way forward. The new
government will need to quickly establish itself as a cohesive and effective unit in order to address the
considerable development challenges with which Afghanistan is faced.

Economic growth, down sharply in 2013 from uncertainty over the political and security transition, is
slowing further in 2014. Afghanistan experienced a sharp slowdown in economic growth to 3.7 percent
(estimated) in 2013 from 9.4 percent per year during 2003-12. Uncertainty over the political and security
transition led to a slump in investor and consumer confidence and a sharp reduction of new investment
commitments in the non-agriculture sectors. Agricultural production was robust in 2013 but did not exceed the
record levels of 2012. Several indicators point to a further slowdown of economic growth to about 1.5 percent
in 2014. New investments in the non-agriculture sectors, specifically services and construction, appear to have
been cut further in light of the protracted political uncertainty while agricultural production is expected to be
down slightly from the record levels of 2012-13.

Afghanistan faces a deteriorating fiscal crisis, with declining revenues leading to an unfinanced fiscal
gap in 2014. Domestic revenues have continued to weaken in 2014. Based on current trends, the authorities
anticipate revenues of Afs 105 billion ($1.82 billion) or 8.7 percent of GDP for fiscal 2014. This would be Afs
28.8 billion ($500 million) short of the target set out in the approved 2014 budget. It would also represent a
further decline from revenues of 9.7 percent of GDP in 2013, itself down from a peak of 11.6 percent in 2011.
While the deteriorating economic slowdown is part of the explanation, increasing weaknesses in tax and
customs compliance are a large part of the problem. In this context, despite austerity measures, the authorities
have run down their cash balances and incurred arrears on O&M and discretionary development spending
during the first eight months of 2014. Even with austerity measures, the unfinanced fiscal gap is estimated at
about $500 million for 2014. While part of this could be financed from cash balances, it is estimated that at
least $300 million in additional financing will be needed for 2014 to cover civilian salaries, pensions, and
critical operating and development spending. If revenues do not reach the anticipated Afs 105 billion for the
year or if projected donor grants linked to reform progress do not materialize in full, the financing gap and
additional financing needed would be larger.

The new government of Afghanistan faces the dual challenge of restoring confidence in its economic
prospects and addressing formidable medium term development challenges. In addition to stalled growth
and the fiscal crisis, Afghanistan faces formidable medium term development challenges. These include aid
dependence, job creation for 400,000 new entrants into the labor force each year, high and persistent poverty,
low levels of human development, and high levels of corruption. Furthermore, fragility and conflict remain
pervasive and undermine economic prospects as well as social cohesion and stability. Addressing these
challenges will require reforms in three areas: (i) restoring fiscal stability; (ii) restoring confidence and creating
private-sector jobs; and (iii) strengthening social cohesion and service delivery. Above all, high level
commitment to tackle corruption and strengthen governance across the board will be critical to delivering on
the success of reforms in these priority areas.

                                           1. Recent Economic Developments

Protracted political uncertainty in 2014 has compounded the sharp slowdown in economic
growth that began in 2013

1.      Economic growth fell sharply in 2013 as uncertainty over the political and security
transition led to a considerable slowdown in the nonagricultural sectors. Real (non-opium) GDP
growth is estimated to have fallen sharply from 14.4 percent in 2012 to 3.7 percent in 20131. With
uncertainty leading to a slump in investor and consumer confidence, growth weakened significantly
across the board in the non-agricultural sectors, including manufacturing, construction and services.
Growth in the services sector, which accounts for about half of GDP, fell from 16 percent in 2012 to 5.3
percent in 2013, driven by a sharp slowdown in wholesale and retail trade and government services.
Transport and communications, which accounts for half of the services sector, also experienced weaker
growth, but fared somewhat better from the continued repatriation of international forces and increased
number of broadband subscribers. Evidence on roads and building constructed suggests that the
construction sector also experienced slower growth in 2013. Meanwhile, manufacturing growth declined
from 7.3 percent in 2012 to 2 percent in 2013, driven in large part by the food and beverages sector.

2.      Agriculture production was robust in 2013 but did not exceed the record levels of 2012.
Total agriculture value added in 2013 was about flat (declining very slightly by 0.2 percent) from the
record levels of 2012. Given favorable weather conditions, the cereals sector (which accounts for 43

  The estimated economic growth of 3.7 percent for 2013 is for the calendar year and for the non-opium economy. It
is thus different from the growth rate reported by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for the 1392 solar year. The
2013 estimated growth also incorporates a number of additional adjustments based on supplementary indicators of
economic activity.

                                                                      2

percent of agriculture value added) grew by 2.3 percent in 2013, reaching the highest level achieved over
the past decade. The fruits sector also grew by 2.3 percent, but livestock and other products declined by
1.7 percent and 4.5 percent respectively. Agriculture accounts for about a quarter of GDP and also has
strong links to the rest of the economy, so that the robust agricultural output in 2013 would normally have
buoyed overall GDP growth. However, with total agriculture production flat from the bumper level of
2012, it was not sufficient to counterbalance the overall slowdown in GDP growth in 2013 (Figure 2).

3.       The protracted political uncertainty has taken a further toll on Afghanistan’s economy in
2014. A number of available short term indicators on new firm registrations, imports, and fiscal and
monetary trends indicate that the economic slowdown deepened during the first half (H1) of 2014.
Private investment across all nonagricultural sectors appears to have dropped considerably in the first half
of 2014 due to the increased uncertainty. Initial reports on the agriculture sector point toward another rich
harvest in 2014, although overall agricultural production is expected to decline modestly. Economic
growth could decline further to 1.5 percent in 2014.

4.        New investment activity dropped further across the board in the first half of 2014. The
number of new firm registrations had already fallen in 2013 to its lowest level in five years, with a
reduction in both local and foreign new fixed investments (Figure 3). This downtrend worsened during
the first half of 2014, when only half as many new firms were registered compared to the same period of
the previous year (Figure 4). The further decline in new firm registrations occurred across all
nonagricultural sectors, with construction and services particularly hard hit (Figure 4). Although no high-
frequency data are available on firm inventories and gross fixed capital formation, new firm registrations
should be a relatively good proxy for business confidence and investment activity in the private sector.
Decisions to establish new fixed investments in Afghanistan or to expand existing investments,
horizontally (expanding existing products) or vertically (investing in the supply chain), are highly
sensitive to confidence in market conditions and the political environment. The number of new firm
registrations would particularly reflect new fixed investments and vertical investments in the economy.

Though this is a not a perfect proxy for level of economic activity, it can fairly reflect the level of
confidence of both local and foreign investors.

5.       Both opium production and area under poppy cultivation increased considerably in 2013 –
and is expected to remain at a high level in 2014. According to UNODC data, opium production
increased by almost 50 percent to 5,500 tons in 2013, while the total area under poppy cultivation
expanded by 36 percent to 209,000 hectares (Figure 5). Opium production in 2013 appears to have
recovered from the decline in 2012 triggered by adverse weather and disease. While the total value of
opium production at farm-
gate prices remained at about               Figure 5: Opium production and area under poppy

irrigation);         (ii) fewer
livelihood opportunities or the expectation thereof; and (iii) the rollback of international forces and
associated counternarcotic efforts from the provinces. Although opium’s importance in GDP has been
declining over time (down from 13 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.1 percent in 2013 at farm-gate prices), it
is likely an important source of livelihood for a segment of the rural population.

6.      Poverty is high and persistent in Afghanistan. According to the 2011-12 household survey,
the poverty rate was 36 percent, meaning that about 9 million individuals (3 of every 8 Afghans) had
consumption levels below the national poverty line. The national poverty rate remained substantially
unchanged between 2007-08 and 2011-12. A number of factors could have contributed to this measured
trend. First, the volatility of agriculture would affect measured trends, with the two years preceding the
2011-12 survey both featuring negative agriculture growth. Second, Afghanistan faces a daunting
demographic challenge, with around 400,000 new entrants into the labor force each year and
underemployment pervasive. Third, the high dependency ratio and low female labor force participation
both serve as a drag on improving Afghanistan’s poverty profile.

Consumer Price Inflation moderated in the first six months of 2014, driven by lower non-food
price inflation, but food prices increased faster

7.      Consumer price inflation softened in recent months, mainly as a result declining prices for
non-food items. Headline inflation declined to 5.6 percent in June 2014 down from 7.3 percent in
December 2013. Core inflation – which excludes cereals and fuel - declined even further from 6.9
percent in December 2013 to 3.5 percent in June 2014 (Figure 6). Inflation has remained below 10
percent in the past two years, with 12-month period-average inflation stabilizing at around 6.4 percent in
June 2014 down from 12.8 percent in 2011. This downtrend over the last three years has been
predominantly due to lower inflation for non-food items.

8.      Rental prices have fallen from a slump in the real estate market, while transport and fuel
prices have increased strongly. The economic downturn has impacted the real estate market in
Afghanistan. While asset prices for real estate are not available, the slump is reflected in prices for
housing and electricity which have been softening since mid-2013, with the year-on-year change reaching
a record low of -9.1 percent in June 2014. On the other hand, prices for fuel and transport have increased
strongly since January 2014, with the y-o-y increase reaching 20.1 percent in June 2014. With housing
having a larger weight than transport in the CPI basket, overall non-food price inflation dropped from 4.8
percent in December 2013 to 1.4 percent in June 2014 (Figure 7).

9.       Food price inflation remained high at around 10 percent in June 2014. In spite of a bumper
crop this year, prices for cereals increased by 11.4 percent (y-o-y) in June 2014. Afghanistan still relies
on large imports of wheat and other cereals and even though global prices for wheat moderated, higher
prices for fuel added to transportations costs. This was also reflected in prices of other food items which
generally experienced a more moderate increase, except for prices of vegetables which increased 24.3
percent.

Afghanistan faces a deteriorating fiscal crisis, with declining revenues leading to an unfinanced
fiscal gap

10.      Revenue collection has continued to weaken in 2014. After a decade of strong revenue growth,
domestic revenue collection declined to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2013 ($2 billion in nominal terms), down
from 10.3 percent in 2012 and 11.6 percent in 2011 (Figure 8). Current trends point toward a further
decline in 2014. During the first 8

Afs 105 billion would require revenue
collection to pick up to Afs 10.7 billion per month during the last four months of the year from Afs 7.6
billion per month during the first eight months.

11.      The decline in revenue collection is a result of the economic slowdown as well as weak
enforcement in both tax and customs administration. While the economic slowdown is part of the
explanation, weaknesses in tax and customs enforcement are a large part of the problem, particularly
given that the decline in collections began in 2012 when economic growth was very strong. Increased
uncertainty surrounding the political
and security transition has likely                        Figure 9: Revenues, first 8 months

An analysis of the data suggests that part of the decline in customs revenues can be attributed to lower
imports of fuel, vehicles, and other high-tariff items.

12.      In light of the revenue shortfall, the authorities have run down their cash balances to pay
for higher mandated security and social benefit spending during the first eight months of 2014.
Afghanistan’s discretionary resources (revenues and civilian discretionary donor grants) go toward three
categories of spending: security expenditures not financed by security grants, civilian recurrent
expenditures (salaries, O&M, and
social benefits), and discretionary                        Figure 10: Discretionary Spending

disabled pensions mandated by the new Martyrs and Disabled Law and due to higher one-time payments
to families of security personnel killed in conflict. On the other hand, discretionary development
expenditures actually declined by $34 million. Furthermore, civilian O&M expenditures (which are
chronically at inadequate levels in Afghanistan) declined by $30 million.

13.      The authorities have committed to continuing with significant austerity measures through
the rest of 2014. Afghanistan’s 2014 budget had included significant increases in security expenditures,
social benefits, and discretionary development projects. However, in light of the sluggish revenue
performance, the Ministry of Finance has put in place a number of measures to curtail spending from
budgeted levels. These measures include reducing overtime payments to civil servants, curtailing new
discretionary development projects, and restricting salary increases, bonuses, and additional benefits. In
August, the Ministry of Finance presented an austerity scenario for 2014 where social benefits would be
restrained to about 50 percent of budgeted levels and discretionary development spending would be
restrained to 38 percent of budgeted levels (no more than the 2013 level of discretionary development
spending). However, the contribution to security would be maintained at 100 percent of budgeted levels.
In order to address serious inadequacies in the budgeted level of civilian O&M, the austerity scenario
included a 15 percent increase in civilian O&M spending from 2013.

 Since a large part of the development budget is tied to specific donor financed projects, the Ministry of Finance’s
expenditure management is limited to the use of its discretionary resources which finance recurrent and
discretionary development spending.

14.      Even with austerity measures, Afghanistan will need additional financing to cover civilian
salaries, pensions, and critical operating and development spending. In addition to running down
cash balances to finance the $362 million gap through the first eight months of 2014, the authorities have
incurred arrears of about $130 million on O&M and discretionary development spending. Without
additional financing, the authorities will also have trouble making civilian salary payments during the
remainder of 2014, which could adversely affect social stability. The austerity scenario presented by the
authorities includes a financing gap of about $500 million for 2014. While part of this could be financed
from cash balances, it is estimated that at least $300 million in additional financing will be needed for
2014 to cover civilian salaries, pensions, and critical operating and development spending. If revenues do
not reach the anticipated Afs 105 billion for the year or if projected civilian grants linked to reform
progress do not materialize in full, the financing gap and additional financing needed would be larger.

15.      In order to restore fiscal stability, it is critical that additional financing be accompanied by
credible reforms to improve revenues. Without credible reforms to improve revenue mobilization and
growth prospects, the underlying problems will remain unaddressed and the fiscal crisis would likely
recur in 2015. In particular, reforms are needed to strengthen both tax and customs enforcement and to
broaden the tax base. Specific measures could include expediting implementation of the new Value
Added Tax, reversing the reduction of the VAT rate from 10 percent to 5 percent, expediting
implementation of key measures under the Customs Action Plan, and conducting effective risk-based tax
audits to improve compliance. While these measures are critical to improve revenue mobilization in 2015
and beyond, they are unlikely to solve the problem or close the unfinanced gap in 2014.

The exchange rate remains stable, with aid flows financing the large trade deficit

16.     Official exports have remained unchanged in the first half of 2014 while official imports
have declined sharply possibly due to poorer recording. Official exports were recorded at around
$270 million in the first six months in 2014, almost the same level as in the first half of 2013. As shown
in Figure 11, dry fruits, carpets and medicinal plants were the largest export items of Afghanistan in the

first two quarters of the year. Import data provided by the customs authority indicate a sharp decline in
official imports in the first half of 2014 by 30 percent over the first half of 2014. However, a significant
amount of trade remains unregistered in the country, suggesting that part of the decline in official imports
could have been because of poorer recording.

slightly from $4.4 billion in December 2013 to $4.3 billion in June 2014. These indicators suggest that
banking sector confidence has not recovered from the Kabul Bank crisis. The Central Bank reports that
regulatory indicators of the overall banking sector such as profitability and regulatory capital ratios are
generally satisfactory, although a number of banks continue to exhibit weaknesses. The banking sector
posted a profit of $23 million for the first half of 2014 (compared to $4 million in the first half of 2013),
although two banks posted a loss of $7.8 million. It will be important to closely monitor weaknesses in
the banking sector.

               2. Economic Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
22.       Economic growth is projected to pick up modestly from 1.5 percent in 2014 to 4 percent in
2015, contingent on reduced uncertainty and reforms to restore confidence. The growth projections
remain highly fluid. With the economy stalled in 2014, the timing and strength of any growth pickup
depends on a reduction of the political and security uncertainty and improvement in the pace of reforms.
The cohesion and effectiveness of the national unity government remains untested and parliamentary
elections are scheduled for 2015. The political and security uncertainty is thus expected to persist through
the first half of 2015 and serve as a drag on private investment and growth in the non-agricultural sectors.
At the same time, generating significant growth from the agriculture sector in 2015 will require
exceptional weather, given that agricultural production has already been strong during 2014. In this
context, accelerating reforms to restore private sector confidence will need to take a lead in driving a
resumption of growth in 2015. Furthermore, public development expenditures on essential infrastructure
and service delivery will need to play an important role in propping up economic activity through the
period of uncertainty. Restoring fiscal stability without sharp cuts in development expenditures will be
critical. Under these assumptions, economic growth is projected to pick up to 4 percent in 2015.

23.     In the medium term, post-transition growth is projected at about 5 percent per year during
2016-18. This is less than the average growth of 9.4 percent per year during 2003-12 that was fueled by
the surge in international aid and security spending. The post-transition growth outlook is contingent
upon a relatively stable political and security environment, with agriculture, services, and extractive
industries likely to be among the significant sectors driving growth. Agriculture accounts for about a
quarter of GDP and is also linked closely to other parts of the economy, such as food and beverages
(which account for almost all of manufacturing), and parts of transport and retail. Afghanistan has the
potential to build on this foundation by reviving its historical position as an important exporter of fruits,
nuts, vegetables, and other higher value-added products. This will require investments in irrigation and
extension services to improve capacity, as well as efforts to build and improve downstream agro-
processing activities. On the other hand, the extractive industries sector currently accounts for a very
small share of GDP, but has significant potential in light of Afghanistan’s deposits of copper, iron ore,
and hydrocarbons. Unlocking this potential will require progress on the legislative framework as well as
securing financing for the necessary infrastructure.

24.     The medium term growth outlook is subject to serious risks which will need to be carefully
managed. The fragile political and security environment has been a considerable constraint to private
investment and growth. Continued violence, economic crime and systemic corruption also have often
undermined progress in Afghanistan’s governance and state-building agenda. Much will depend,
therefore, on Afghanistan’s success in achieving peace, stability and reconciliation. Without this, the
growth prospects discussed above are unlikely to materialize.

25.      In light of the deteriorating fiscal crisis, restoring fiscal stability will require immediate
measures to improve revenue performance coupled with additional resources to cover the
unfinanced gap. Afghanistan needs to put together a plan to restore medium term fiscal stability. In
light of the fiscal crisis, the authorities are still working on the 2015 budget and the revised medium term
macroeconomic framework. A centerpiece of the plan needs to be immediate reforms to improve revenue
performance. This will require (i) reducing leakages and strengthening tax and customs enforcement; and
(ii) expediting implementation of the new value-added tax (VAT) with a 10 percent rate instead of a 5
percent rate. The natural resources sector also has the potential to contribute to revenues in the medium
term, but the timeline for this has become more uncertain in light of weak progress in recent years.
Tentative staff projections (predicated on strong reforms) call for an increase in revenues from 8.7 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 9.6 percent in 2015 and 12.8 percent by 2018 (or about one percentage point of GDP
per year). While this is an ambitious target, it will still leave Afghanistan with an unfinanced fiscal gap of
about 2 percent of GDP during 2014-18 (in excess of the 20 percent of GDP gap already financed by
existing commitments during this period). If additional resources are not identified to cover this
unfinanced fiscal gap, Afghanistan will have trouble paying for civilian salaries and critical operating and
development spending. A more aggressive expenditure austerity path would compromise development
prospects and social outcomes as Afghanistan struggles to restore stability.

26.    Budget expenditures are projected to rise, with mandatory increases in security spending,
so that more aggressive austerity would squeeze essential development spending. Total budget

                                                          13
Afghanistan Economic Update                                                         October 2014

expenditures are projected to rise from 27.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 30.5 percent in 2016. This
increase is largely a result of more security and development spending moving on budget from previously
being undertaken directly by donors. Afghanistan has considerable public expenditure needs in the areas
of security, service delivery, building essential infrastructure, and operations and maintenance (O&M).
For example, delivering on goals to improve education outcomes will require hiring increasing numbers
of teachers. Prioritizing these expenditure needs within the limited resource envelope will be critical to
maintaining a pro-development stance. With social benefits for martyrs and disabled increasing
significantly in 2014, the authorities will need to limit any further increases going forward. Although
more detailed analysis of public expenditures in needed, there appears to be limited space to adjust
expenditures without adversely affecting growth prospects and social outcomes. In light of mandatory
increases in security spending, a more aggressive expenditure consolidation path would directly squeeze
essential civilian operating and development spending. The resulting financing needs of the budget are,
therefore, likely to remain substantial for the foreseeable future. Moreover, channeling a greater share of
development assistance through on-budget expenditures is expected to enhance the medium term
economic impact.

27.      Donors have committed to considerable assistance for Afghanistan contingent on
satisfactory reform progress, although additional resources and an acceleration of reforms will be
needed in light of recent developments. The July 2012 donor meeting in Tokyo pledged $16 billion in
development aid for Afghanistan over 2012-16. These funds, contingent on satisfactory reform progress
under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF), would allow the authorities to progress
towards development and infrastructure targets. Together with earlier pledges on the security side, this
means annual aid of about $8 billion—roughly equally divided between civil and security aid. However,
recent developments indicate that as Afghanistan and the international community work to reaffirm their
partnership, attention will be needed to both accelerate reforms and identify additional resources.
Domestic revenue is an important indicator in the TMAF, so that any additional resources will require a
clear turnaround in revenue performance by broadening the tax base, strengthening enforcement, fostering
private sector development, and developing the mining sector. Even with these measures, additional
resources will be needed to cover the unfinanced gap for 2014-18. Furthermore, additional resources may
also be needed for security as the current spending projections are based on a drawdown in ANSF
personnel size from 352,000 to 228,000 between 2015 and 2017, while security experts indicate that this
drawdown is no longer likely to take place within that timeframe.

            3. Structural Policies for Immediate and Medium Term
28.      The new government of Afghanistan faces the dual challenge of restoring confidence in its
economic prospects and addressing formidable medium term development challenges. Growth has
stalled and a deteriorating fiscal crisis has emerged. Afghanistan also faces formidable medium term
development challenges in the areas of aid dependence, job creation for 400,000 new entrants into the
labor force each year, high and persistent poverty, low levels of human development and female labor
force participation, and high levels of corruption. Furthermore, fragility and conflict remain pervasive
and undermine economic prospects as well as social cohesion and stability. Addressing these challenges
will require reforms from the new government of Afghanistan in three areas: (i) restoring fiscal stability;
(ii) restoring confidence and creating private-sector jobs; and (iii) strengthening social cohesion and

                                                    14
Afghanistan Economic Update                                                         October 2014

service delivery. Above all, high level commitment to tackle corruption and strengthen governance
across the board will be critical to delivering on the success of reforms in these priority areas.

29.      Restoring fiscal stability will require improving revenue mobilization, securing grant
assistance, and prioritizing government spending. The centerpiece of restoring fiscal stability is to
improve revenue performance. This will require immediate and credible measures to reduce leakages and
strengthen customs and tax compliance, expediting implementation of the new VAT law with a 10
percent rate, and progress on the legislative and regulatory framework for the extractive industries sector.
Afghanistan will continue to require substantial grant assistance for the foreseeable future. The projected
total financing gap (for both on-budget and off-budget spending) while declining from more than 40
percent of GDP in 2012, will remain above 20 percent of GDP through 2025. In order to ensure a pro-
development stance of spending within a constrained resource envelope, it will also be important to
prioritize expenditures through the development of a realistic and well-specified multi-year medium term
expenditure framework.

30.      Afghanistan will need to restore investor confidence and create private sector jobs.
Restoring investor confidence will require addressing key weaknesses in the financial sector, investment
climate, and land tenure system. If confidence can be restored, growth is expected to be driven by
agriculture, the services sector, and over a longer term, extractive industries. As aid volumes are scaled
down as a share of GDP, growth will need to be led increasingly by the private sector. The target is to
support growth of 5-6 percent per year. This is less than the average growth of 9.4 percent per year
during 2003-12 that was driven by investment in reconstruction, expansion of services fueled by aid, and
occasional surges in agricultural production. Given its demographic realities, Afghanistan will need to
aspire to create jobs for 400,000 new entrants into the workforce each year and reduce chronic
underemployment. This is remarkably ambitious in an environment of fragility and volatility, so that a
realistic target would be to hold the line on poverty during 2015-18.

31.      Agriculture is highly relevant to poverty reduction and job creation. Agriculture accounts
for a quarter of GDP and is also closely linked to other parts of the economy, including manufacturing
(food and beverages) and services (transport and retail). Agriculture is also highly relevant to poverty
mitigation and job creation, with more than 50 percent of the labor force tied to the sector. Driving
agricultural expansion will require focusing on those subsectors with the greatest potential: irrigated
wheat, livestock, and horticulture. Key policy and investment priorities include rehabilitating irrigation
infrastructure and improved on-farm water management, supporting adoption of higher yielding varieties,
and improving extension services.

32.     The mining sector has significant potential for growth with modest employment impact,
although the impact of the sector can be enhanced through the resource corridor approach.
Although extractive industries currently account for a very small share of GDP, they have significant
potential in light of Afghanistan’s deposits of copper, iron ore, and hydrocarbons. Unlocking the
potential of extractives will require progress on the legislative and regulatory framework as well as
securing financing for the necessary infrastructure. Furthermore, a strong sector vision based on the
Resource Corridor initiative can promote economic linkages by aligning actions and investments in four
areas: physical infrastructure, livelihoods, environmental and social impact, and governance.

33.      Afghanistan will need to strengthen social cohesion and stability through improved and
targeted service delivery. Service delivery plays a dual role in Afghanistan: promoting social cohesion
and trust in public institutions, while laying the foundation for job creation and growth. With levels of
education, health, and infrastructure access among the lowest in the world, Afghanistan will need to
continue expanding service delivery across the board. In spite of significant improvements in school
enrollment rates over the past decade, only one out of four Afghans aged 16 or above is able to read and
write or has completed some formal level of schooling. It is therefore paramount that investments in
education at all levels remain a priority in Afghanistan’s development strategy. At the same time, special
attention will be needed in priority areas to enhance the impact on social cohesion and job creation within
constrained resources.

34.     Afghanistan will need to tap the potential of regional integration to meet its energy and
water needs and to explore opportunities for labor migration. Energy and water will be critical for
agriculture, mining, and urban development, with needs expected to far outstrip capacity. Addressing
both energy and water needs will require prioritizing regional cooperation. Afghanistan will need to
engage proactively to establish its role as a transit route linking energy-rich Central Asian countries with
energy hungry South Asian countries. With four out of its five river basins part of international
waterways, Afghanistan will need to engage actively with downstream riparian countries to secure
necessary water resources. Finally, with domestic job creation expected to fall short of the growing labor
force, Afghanistan should explore opportunities for labor migration to Gulf countries.

35.      Addressing challenges in the efficiency of service delivery will be critical in meeting the
objective of expanding access in a fiscally constrained environment. With unclear roles of provincial
officials, service delivery takes place in a complex governance environment with multiple stakeholders
and informal relationships. O&M arrangements are inadequate, with no overall asset registry and weak
funding, budget arrangements, and capacity for O&M provision. Corruption levels remain a serious
concern and have the potential to undermine improvements in public financial management. The capacity
of core civil service is inadequate and reliance on parallel civil service is high. Finally, the institutional
structures for both transport and irrigation investments are characterized by overlapping responsibilities
and poor coordination. Efficiency improvements will thus need to come from clarifying the subnational
national governance framework (including removing overlapping institutional mandates), improving
O&M systems, further strengthening public financial management, and improving the core civil service.

         Annex 1: World Bank Group Assistance to Afghanistan
IDA and the ARTF:

1. The International Development Association (IDA) and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
   (ARTF) are the main sources of World Bank financing of country priorities in Afghanistan. The
   ARTF is nearly five-fold larger than IDA and has been managed by the Bank since its creation in
   2002; it is a key vehicle for providing Government with predictable and transparent on-budget
   financing. The ARTF also plays a critical role as a forum for policy dialogue between Government
   and donors. A 2012 external review of the ARTF concluded that the ARTF is “ fit for purpose” and
   stands as a best-practice trust fund.

2. The World Bank is respected by Government and donors for its analytical and research products
   through economic sector work and technical assistance. In an environment where policy advice and
   assistance is essential, work in this area provides support for Government and donor decision making.
   It is expected that the World Bank will continue to play a leading role in terms of policy advice to
   Government through targeted, often cross-sectoral, analytic work. The Bank’s work on Transition
   Economics and Resource Corridors, together with its poverty analysis, has been instrumental in
   informing decisions of the Government and the donor community in this challenging transition
   period.

3. Since 2002, IDA has committed a total of $2.77 billion in grants (83 percent) and credits (17 percent)
   in Afghanistan. Thirty-six development and emergency-reconstruction projects and four budget-
   support operations have been committed as of end-February 2014. In addition, the ARTF has
   generated $7.26 billion from 33 donors, and committed $3.17 billion for the government’s recurrent
   costs and $3.64 billion for government investments programs. At end-August 2014 the active IDA
   portfolio was worth $835.98 million and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth $2.33
   billion.

4. ARTF and IDA projects are managed with the same attention.             All projects are eligible for
   processing under the Bank’s Special Considerations for fragile states and emergencies (incorporated
   into OP 10.00). In practice this has proved most useful to improve flexibility post-approval as all
   projects are processed under regular review procedures in order to ensure quality at entry. All Bank
   (IDA and ARTF) funds are channeled through the government’s budget and project accounting and
   reporting occurs at the central level.

5. In fiscal year 2014, the World Bank Board approved two new IDA-financed projects and additional
   financing for an existing project totaling $106.7 million, plus the CASA-1000 regional project. The
   new projects included $50 million for the Development Policy Grant and $50 million for Access to
   Finance; the Financial Sector Rapid Response project received $6.7 million in additional financing.
   A regional project – CASA-1000 – was approved in March 2014 by the World Bank Group’s Board
   of Executive Directors for total grant and credit financing of $526.5 million. Of the total project
   financing for CASA-1000, Afghanistan receives $316.5 million in the form of an IDA grant. The
   FY14 IDA commitments fully utilized IDA-16.

6. In addition, in fiscal 2014 the ARTF approved $219 million in recurrent cost financing (of which
   $110.90 million was for recurrent cost baseline financing, $65.20 million for the Incentive Program,
   $30 million for TMAF payment and O&M $12.90 million) and $580 million for Investment Window
   financing, including the Second Education Quality Improvement Program ($125 million), the Third
   Emergency National Solidarity Project ($200 million), the CASA Community Support Project ($40
   million), the Non-formal Approach to Training, Education and Jobs in Afghanistan ($15
   million),Kabul Municipal Development Project ($110 million), and Kabul Urban Transport
   Efficiency Improvement Project ($90.50 million).

IFC and MIGA operations in Afghanistan:

7. IFC is following an integrated advisory and investment strategy focused on improving the investment
   climate, building capacity, and supporting selective investments in sectors with high development
   impact and job creation possibilities. IFC’s investment commitment in Afghanistan has more than
   doubled since FY08 - from around $58 million to about $135 million to date. Currently, IFC’s
   portfolio includes two investments in the telecommunication sector (MTN - a joint project with
   MIGA-$65 million and Roshan-$65 million), one investment in the hotel sector (TPS-$3 million),
   and two operations in financial markets (First Microfinance Bank-$2 million equity, Afghanistan
   International Bank - trade facility). These investments have had a strong impact (in terms of access to
   finance and outreach), particularly in the microfinance and telecommunication sectors. Through the
   project with the First Microfinance Bank (FMFB)--the first licensed private sector microfinance bank
   in Afghanistan, IFC was able to reach over 64,000 borrowers (more than 25 % of the current market
   penetration) – more than 16 % of whom were women. Similarly, IFC has had significant impact in the
   telecommunication sector by improving mobile phone access and services to the poor through the
   investment in Mobile Telephone Networks (MTN) and in Roshan Telecom. Going forward, IFC is
   looking to expand its investment program in Afghanistan in the areas of infrastructure, finance,
   manufacturing, agribusiness and services.

8. IFC has an active Advisory Services program with seven active mandates in the following areas: (i)
   Access to Finance (Secured Lending, Leasing Support); (ii) Investment Climate (Trade License
   Reform, Construction Permit Reform) ; (iii) SME Capacity Development (Business Edge SME
   Training); and (iv) Strengthening Horticulture; and (v) Public Private Partnerships (DABS Kandahar).

9. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group has $84.2 million
   of gross exposure in Afghanistan, supporting telecoms and agri-business projects. MIGA recently
   launched the “Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility” that will provide a first loss cover in
   fragile and conflict states, including Afghanistan. This will allow MIGA to greatly expand its work in
   these countries, while still meeting prudential limits. MIGA is currently supporting three projects in

* All indicators for 2013 (1392) and onwards are calculated/estimated for the calendar year (Jan-Dec). Fiscal year 2012 (1391)
covered 9 months, but the fiscal data has been prorated to 12 months, with all other 2012 data for the solar year. All data for
years prior to 1391 span April-March and are thus for the solar year.
