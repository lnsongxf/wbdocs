Abstract:

In 2010, Greece, under the pressure of an increasing public debt, was forced to
resort to the Troika, which is the designation of the triumvirate comprising the
European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).

The Troika agreed to provide Greece with financial help, on special terms recorded in
a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Greek Government and the
Troika.

One of the most important reforms recorded in the MoU is the Pension Reform since
the Greek Social Security System had long showed signs of unsustainability and
insolvency.

The reforms implemented had a great positive impact on pension expenditure,
which was drastically reduced when projected until 2060. The projected reduction,
taking into account all reforms from 2009 to 2015, exceeds 14 percent of GDP.

These fiscal changes are expected to take place under extreme demographic
pressure, with both the total population and the working population projected to
decline by a good 20 percent and 36 percent respectively, while at the same time
pensioners are projected to increase by as much as 30 percent.

Replacement rates were drastically reduced by 40 percent for high earners according
to the OECD, while the average contribution period is projected to increase by at
least seven years until 2060, reaching almost 38 years in total.

Along with fiscal and demographic effects, one has to also take into account the
vicious circle of recession created in the Greek economy. Such was the latter, that
one third of contributions were lost in the respective era bringing the amount of
contributions to 12 billion euros yearly as opposed to 18 billion euros before the
crisis, while at the same time pension expenditure exceeds 24 billion euros yearly.
The recession also caused further impoverishment of old-age people followed by the
rest of the population. And this became one of the main reasons that the reforms
could not be fully implemented for fear of further impoverishment of pensioners and
social exclusion in general, as well as political cost that is always a key factor.

This paper aims to further analyze and present the impact of the reforms on the
Greek pension system and the people who rely on it through an actuarial – statistical
analysis and point out the changes in the main factors mentioned above and how
they correlate.

I.       INTRODUCTION
     In 2008, the Hellenic Actuarial Authority (HAA) provided the Economic Policy
     Committee subgroup, the Ageing Working Group (AWG), with projections for the
     public pension expenditure for years 2007 through 2060.

     Under these projections, a staggering 24 percent of GDP would have to be set aside
     for public pension expenditure in 2060.

     In 2010, Greece, under the pressure of an increasing public debt, was forced to
     resort to the Troika, which is the designation of the triumvirate comprising the
     European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International
     Monetary Fund (IMF).

     The Troika agreed to provide Greece with financial help, on special terms recorded in
     a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Greek Government and the
     Troika.

     One of the most important reforms recorded in the MoU is of course the Pension
     Reform since the Greek Social Security System had long showed signs of
     unsustainability and insolvency.

     Then, in 2012, the Greek Government and the Troika, after assessing the fiscal
     impact of the reforms already implemented, and those which weren’t, reached the
     conclusion that a new interim plan had to be devised.

     That plan was the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS), which brought new reforms,
     new reductions, and an updated fiscal target calendar up to 2015.

     Following the plan, on March 9 and April 11, 2012 (based on the legislation they are
     governed by, Greek of other), the debt restructuring deal via the Private Sector
     Involvement (PSI) forced great losses on the assets of the social security funds
     because of a legal connection between them and the Bank of Greece.

     The former are obliged to keep a minimum of 77 percent of their assets in Greek
     Treasury bonds in the Bank of Greece and have therefore lost a huge part of their
     nominal value because of the PSI.

     Stunningly, this was forced by an emergency law passed in 1950 by the King of
     Greece, Paul I, and still valid at the beginning of this crisis.

     It goes without saying, however, that because the credit standing of Greece had
     been reduced greatly, without the PSI there might have been a total collapse of the
     economy and therefore the funds’ assets might have totally evaporated.



                                              1
      In October 2012, the MTFS was extended in order to cover the period up to year
      2016 and the MOU between the Greek Government and the Troika was updated.
      Finally, the program was extended to 2018 in May 2014.

II.         THE SYSTEM LAYOUT
      In Greece, there are three pillars to the pension system. The second pillar accounts
      for Occupational Schemes (IORPS) and the third for Private Insurance. Neither of the
      two is very popular though, thus the first pillar on Social Security accounts for more
      than 99 percent of the whole system.

      The latter operated as a Defined Benefit Pay-as-You-Go System until recently (DB
      PAYG) and provided three types of benefits: a main pension, a secondary (auxiliary)
      pension, and lump sum amounts and provident grants (EKAS). The secondary
      (auxiliary) pension has now been turned into a Balanced Notional Defined
      Contribution System (see below under More Reforms).

      The system used to work on 14-time-a-year deposits. People would be paid 14 times
      a year, contributions would be made accordingly, and pensions were also paid 14
      times a year.

      More specifically, the Greek pension system comprises a main pension provision that
      includes seven social insurance schemes. The latter cover, on a mandatory basis,
      salaried employees and self-employed persons grouped into certain
      professions/occupations. Then, there is an auxiliary pension provision that includes a
      number of social insurance schemes, each of which corresponds to a main social
      security scheme and runs in parallel with it. Finally, there is a social solidarity grant
      provision (EKAS), a means-tested scheme that covers residents of Greece, who get
      no or low income.

      The funds as merged in early 2015 are shown in the table below:

As regards expenditure, since 1994, the public pension expenditure as a percentage
of GDP followed a steadily increasing trend, as can be seen below. This, along with
the ageing factor and political inertia as regards reforming the system, were the
main reasons, which brought Greece in the fiscal situation of today.

    i.    Main Pension Provision
The most important laws, which were applied to the social security system before
the latest reform, were 1902/1990, 2084/1992, 3029/2002, and 3655/2008. Each
one of them gradually reduced the number of main and auxiliary schemes by
merging them. They also unified pension formula and retirement ages (equalized for
male and female) for all insured who were employed after 1992.

The new social security system, introduced by laws 3863/2010 and 3865/2010,
constitutes the most significant reform in recent years. This reform introduces a
new, transparent system to strengthen the link between contributions and benefits
and aims at reducing the projected increase in public pension expenditure between
2009 and 2060 to below 2.5 percent of GDP through the gradual increase in
retirement age and the application of a uniform pension calculation method among
all pension schemes (with minor exceptions in terms of population). At the same
time, this reform leads to a significant and substantial correction in the financial
course of the social security system over the next 50 years. The new measures apply
to the public sector and all primary insurance schemes except OGA (farmers).

Following this reform, other reactive reforms were introduced as the fiscal gap
would not tighten in the years after 2010. These were introduced by Laws
4024/2011, 4051/2012, 4052/2012, 4336/2015 and are analyzed in the respective
sections.

                                           3
The main pension schemes are funded mainly by contributions, social resources, and
other income sources.

    ii.   Auxiliary Pension Provision
The auxiliary pension provision began forming in the 1930s, based on the legislation
of the main pension provision, which had already come into effect. The employees of
many different professions and companies founded several auxiliary schemes in
order to amend the income they would be entitled to in the future as well as their
pension status. There spawned, therefore, a long list of auxiliary schemes, in which
discrete groups of employees would contribute, like electricians, bakers, people
working in banks.

As mentioned above, the auxiliary pension provision works in parallel to the main
pension provision and is mandatory for most people. The former is financed
separately from the main pension from both the employer and employee, while in
some cases there is also social funding coming from a source adjacent to the
respective employment of the insured in each scheme.

Therefore, the auxiliary and main pension provisions are distinct in the sense of
different funding. At the same time, though, they are closely bound together since
receiving a primary pension in the respective scheme serves as a prerequisite of
receiving the auxiliary pension as well.

The auxiliary pension provision in Greece serves as an extra income of great
importance, especially for those receiving main pensions in the minimum rates, and
has helped support many pensioners by amending their financial status and
subsistence levels.

Nevertheless, the defragmentation of the auxiliary pension provision bore the need
of drastically reducing the number of auxiliary pension schemes so that they could
be better organized, managed, and financially monitored. Initially, in 1992, Law 2084
unified the pension formula for all people first insured after January 1, 1993 since
each scheme had its own provisions until then. Then, the ever-anticipated reduction
came in action through Law 3655/2008, which merged and incorporated many of
these schemes into newfound ones according to the type of professions of their
insured population (Table 1).

Merging and incorporating helped the organization of the auxiliary pension provision
but have not yet resulted in homogeneous IT systems because of the volume of data
that was scattered and the different ways these were recorded through different
software.



                                         4
       The final and most important intervention came with Law 4052/2012, which initiated
       a merging process of the main bulk of the auxiliary funds into one large Balanced
       Notional Defined Contribution System (to be analyzed below).

III.       THE GREEK REALITY AMONGST ITS EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS
       As mentioned above, Greece has had its pension expenditure increased and in turn,
       a fiscal gap was created. Comparing to other countries within the EU, it becomes
       evident that the pension system in Greece is by far the one that creates a heavy
       burden on public finances.

       Source: EC 2015a

       Looking into contribution rates into the public pension system, Greece has a
       relatively high percentage compared to its European counterparts, reaching 26
       percent for both employer and employee and for both the main and auxiliary
       pensions (EC 2015a).

Greece is also one of the European champions in life expectancy, and this in turn
creates a very intense fiscal challenge on public finances, which are driven mainly by
the demographic dependency (Eurostat).

This goes hand in hand with an increasing population proportion for people aged 65
or above. Greece appears in the third place among the 28 member states. Towards
2050, Greece will have a lot of centennials in its population and its demographic

In the recent edition of the sustainability report 2015 prepared by the European
Commission, one can look at the values for the S0 indicator for the European
member states. The S0 is a composite indicator aimed at identifying fiscal risks in the
short-term. Greece, like Cyprus, is excluded from the graph, since they are already
monitored, with higher frequency, in the context of specific program reviews (Cyprus
has left the program in the first term of 2016). Results are reported for all EU
countries that are currently not under macroeconomic adjustment programs. It is
more than evident from the absence of Greece in this graph and the respective
report that its pension system sustainability has not been achieved and is hard to be
in the near future.

      Further analysis of important indicators is provided in the next chapters of this
      paper, aiming to analyze the position Greece has established in the European Union
      after its extensive pension reforms. They can be found in the respective chapters and
      aim to analyze not only the changes the reforms have brought about for Greece as a
      member state, but also the relative position it holds in the EU before and after the
      reforms.

IV.      THE 2010 REFORM
      In 2010, under the MoU, the social security map changed drastically in Greece.

      A new logic was introduced for the main pension. It was divided into two parts—a
      basic part, which is means-tested and serves as a safety net and is paid 12 times per
      year, and a proportional part, which is calculated as the product of the accrual rate
      by the past credits by the pensionable salary.

      Accrual rates, formerly varying between 2 and 3 percent, now vary from 0.8 to 1.5
      percent, thus reducing the over-generosity of the system.

      The statutory retirement age, formerly maxed by 65 but effectively not more than
      62, is now legislated to 65 for both men and women. It is also linked to the increase
      in life expectancy at age 65 from the year 2021, using the decade exactly before that
      as a reference period.

      The indexation of benefits, formerly decided yearly by the Minister of Economy, is
      now legislated and cannot exceed the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

      The full contributory period became 40 years in contrast to 35 years before the
      reform.

      Pensionable earnings used to be calculated on the five or 10 last years of a person’s
      career—most of the times being the ones with the highest wages, thus increasing
      the amount of pension. The new law requires that pensionable earnings are
      calculated on the whole career average. Thus, there is a motive for everyone to
      declare that they are working, which makes the black market reduced, and to
      declare the real wages they are paid so that their final pension amount is sufficient
      to cater for their retirement needs.

      The public sector also changes and civil servants hired after 2010 will be insured in
      the same fund as the private sector employees.

      All disability pensions are re-examined case by case by a special committee since a
      lot of false cases had been discovered.




                                               8
 The most important clause in the law, however, is the one that stipulates that
 between 2009 (provisional public pension expenditure over GDP is 13.5 percent) and
 2060 the increase in Greek public pension expenditure must remain under 2.5
 percent of GDP. If long-term projections (to be run by the HAA every two years)
 show otherwise, relevant parameters of the pension system will be changed to bring
 the increase of expenditure below the targeted threshold. This clause makes the
 system a self-correcting one and makes it easier for future policymakers to avoid
 long legal procedures in order to legislate towards the sustainability of the system.

V.   MORE REFORMS
 In December 2011 a long-awaited revision of the list of heavy and hazardous
 occupations was made. Aiming at reducing substantially the coverage to no more
 than 10 percent of the employees, the new list includes almost 30 percent less
 workers. This was a long-awaited reform for as technology moved on, some jobs like
 confectioners, janitors, and hairdressers did not belong to this category any more. Its
 effect has mainly to do with the legislation and thresholds, on which the respective
 workers retire (more working days needed for pension, higher statutory retirement
 age).

 Then, in March 2012, a vast reform of the auxiliary pensions was legislated. Many of
 the larger auxiliary pension funds of employees are merged into one (ETEA) and the
 old Defined Benefit system is turned into a balanced Notional Defined Contribution
 system, precluding any kind of fund transfer from the national budget. Also, more
 pension funds can be added in the future upon their contributors’ request. The
 remaining auxiliary funds became ipso jure private law bodies (the Greek acronym is
 NPID) of mandatory insurance, hence a type of occupational funds with mandatory
 contributions as regards the Greek legislation. There are only four funds that did not
 merge into the new mega-fund as of the first trimester of 2013.

 Under the updated MTFS in November 2012, an extension of two years was
 legislated on the statutory retirement age, so the latter became 67 years of age in
 most cases. The statutory retirement age was linked to life expectancy in 2010 and
 becomes effective in 2021. Life expectancy is expected to increase within the next 10
 years in Greece, however, during crises literature states that life expectancy drops so
 we might not have witnessed an immediate increase in the statutory retirement age,
 unless reformed in 2012.

 The cap of contributions of a large portion of employees was also changed with the
 above legislation, more specifically for the people first insured before January 1,
 1993. These people, having more than 10 years in the market, earn relatively higher
 amounts than younger people; and thus, this change aims to a significant
 contribution increase. Needless to say, the market always adapts to such legislation

                                           9
      so it is expected that new agreements will arise so that people avoid the extra cost
      to any extent that they can.

VI.      THE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM OF 2012-2014
      As early on as 2008, efforts had been made to merge the plethora of Greek social
      security funds (133 at that time) into only 13. The funds were indeed merged but in
      reality, most of them operated independently, even though they were under a new
      name. There were many reasons for this. Some of them represented a great
      difficulty in merging databases and accounting systems, which had been purchased
      and operated differently by the respective funds. Also, internal clashes between
      high-ranking officers and further bureaucratic and legal problems made it impossible
      for the systems to be actually merged. Even in early 2013, some of the merged funds
      still operated with fiscally independent sub-funds.

      As this was realized in mid-2012, and under the intense pressure of the Troika for
      clarity in the number and amount of paid pensions, the Minister of Labor decided to
      resolve this problem by using the Social Security Number (SSN – the Greek acronym
      is AMKA), which has been existing for almost a decade by then but never actually
      taken advantage of. The Minister of Labor asked that all pensioners be issued a SSN
      and the computerized systems of all funds have incorporated this number before
      pensions are being paid. This process took a few months and leveled off in June
      2013, when an order was given to temporarily withhold all pension payments for
      those people who failed to have their SSN issued and reported to the paying pension
      fund.

      The system that spawned from and supported this procedure was named Ilios—the
      Greek word for sun—and intends to shed lights on the Greece’s social security
      system. It led to the first ever full pension statistics report for the Greek public
      pension system. This report includes gross average income from pensions, an
      analysis of pension by category, pension amount by 500 euro brackets, an analysis by
      geographical distribution and by nationality. The report is thereafter prepared on a
      monthly basis by the Hellenic E-governance in Social Insurance Agency and can be
      found at its website.

      Another important problem to be tackled was the one of the real estate owned by
      the social security funds. These vary from offices and hotels to hospitals and
      apartments, from camps to parking spaces, and so on. Having collected all real estate
      in one dynamic database, where the current values as well as the renting price are
      systematically updated, it is much easier for these to be managed. In July 2013, the
      current value of all real estate assets of the social security funds reached almost 1.5
      billion euros. It is to be noted that the current value is different in most cases than
      the market value, with the latter being lower in many cases because of the crisis. The

                                                10
list of real estate assets will also be used in order to sell or rent a number of the
latter. The above information along with many others can be found in the report
analyzing the new database named Estia, after the Greek word for home.

The Minister of Labor announced in early November 2013 that further cross-checks
were imminent, since the estimated contribution evasion for 2013 only amounted to
one billion euros. The money earned from contribution evasion would be used—
according to the announcement—to avoid further possible reductions demanded by
the Troika, so that the fiscal gap of 2013-14 in the pension system could be filled.

In this direction, in September 2013, a plan was devised in order to curtail
contribution evasion. A system called Ergani, which includes all available data for
employees, has been used to cross-check and provide information for employers and
employees who avoid paying contributions. The deadline of September 15, 2013 was
set for employers to declare all staff before new, very strict fines (10.550 euro fine
for every employee found not insured, immediately effective) would be issued to
offenders. This action bore fruit and also proved that there are still a lot of uninsured
employees in the market. The diagram below proves exactly that.

Graph 6. Balance of New Employments/Layoffs for the First Fortnight of September
2013




Immediately before the implementation of the new measures, new employments
minus the number of people laid off have increased acutely. This illustrates that
employers show some willingness to abide by the rules in fear of paying a large
amount of money for contribution evasion.

The business plan used for the cross-checks and fine imposition has been named
Artemis, under the Greek Goddess for hunting. From September 15, 2013 until the
end of June 2014, 17.281 businesses had been checked and fines worth nearly 25
million euros were imposed. In the next four months, this figure rose to almost 60
million euros.

A center for the collection of all due contributions was introduced in 2014 (ΚΕΑΟ).
This includes all contributions due from the past and those owed from then on. The

                                           11
center will be directly linked to the taxation system, and all due amounts will then be
sought and collected via the revenue services. This link will be finalized in 2017. In
November 2014, the total amounts due were categorized as in Table 3.

As it becomes obvious, the amount of money that could go into the social security
system through due contributions is very large, almost worth half the pension
amount granted in a year. However, as it is common in many countries, the
collection of due contributions is a rather difficult and complex task. This is the
reason why at the same period of time, only 270.623.729 euros in debt had been
collected.

Maybe the most effective tool brought into action was the IT system named Atlas.
Via Atlas, the social security course of each employee within the country has been
computerized and released to the employees in two phases—in June 2014 for a
smaller portion and at the end of 2015 for all other employees nationwide. Thus,
within 2015, a digital “social security CV” will be available for each and every
employee in the country and accessible online within seconds. This will make the
issuance and granting of pensions by the Single Centre of Pensions immediate, even
for the most complex cases of successive insurance.

Another important step in the managerial direction is the adoption of a very large
project funded through European programs, which will lead to the codification of a
total 5.436 laws, decrees, ministerial decisions and other legal texts so that time for
people to access and understand them is significantly reduced.

In other administrative actions, in July 2014, the reduction of contributions for both
employers and employees was decided, so that a combined 3.9 percent of wages


                                           12
       returns to them. This measure was decided so that employees are alleviated of a
       small amount of money that does not go to either pension or health and employers
       have larger incentives to hire people because of lower costs. The effect of this
       measure has been proved to be negative, as collected contributions were not as
       many, and at the same time employers did not see the green light to hire people
       with the sheer incentive of a contribution reduction.

       Finally, at the very end of 2014, a new system was introduced with the aim to shed
       light on enterprises that are consistent with their obligations to the social security
       system. According to the Minister, this will help by putting pressure on the ones that
       do not provide for their employees and thus separate the prosperous enterprises
       from the ones that fail to pay their dues.

       New administrative changes had been planned for fall 2014 based on a report
       produced by the Centre of Planning and Economic Research (KEPE). The main idea
       behind them were to further reduce the number of funds from 13 to only three, thus
       cutting the administrative costs, along with other changes which were not
       implemented following the negotiations with the Troika and the election
       announcement in December 2014. One of the direly needed reforms from the ones
       proposed according to the writer would be the unification of the SSN and VAT
       numbers, as this would help break new ground in cross-checks between social
       security contributions and tax evasion.

VII.      REDUCTIONS
       The cash-flow shortness in the Greek Economy soon led to a need for pension
       reductions, which began in 2010 and are permanent, except for the age-related
       ones.

       At the same time, people who had retired very early comparing to the statutory
       retirement age and who had their pensions calculated on the generous accrual rates
       ranging from 2 percent to 3 percent were called in to return parts of their pension.
       These amounts of money were redirected to the Intergenerational Solidarity Capital,
       founded in 2007, or the respective funds’ budgets.

       Main pensions were reduced as much as 20 percent for the normal retirees and as
       much as 40 percent for the very early ones in each of the reduction rounds, of which
       there are now 12—not all applicable to everyone. Auxiliary pensions were reduced
       accordingly. In order to retain the social character of the pension system, however,
       reductions were not implemented on very low incomers or ones with disability or
       disabled family members.

       The consequent reductions caused large pension amounts to become scarce and
       shifted them towards the average. For example, in the most populated fund—that of

                                                13
private sector employees—looking into December 2012 pension amounts (which do
not include all of the rounds of reductions as the last round was implemented later
in 2013) as opposed to the ones before the reductions, one can see the pattern
mentioned before. In the following graph, pension amounts of less than 500 euros
have been omitted so that the point is clearly made.

To go on, under the updated MTFS in November 2012, lump-sum amounts were
reduced for the first time with percentages ranging from 2 percent to 83 percent and
a further reduction of 35 percent possible with a ministerial decree. The reason for
this was that people had been getting their lump sums for decades now based on
certain formulas, without the fund always receiving the actuarial equivalent since
this was a defined benefit system. Thus, as was the case in both the main and
auxiliary pension, the previous generation received very large amounts, which were
backed by the demographic and fiscal situation of that time, and left the current
retirees and the next generation with nothing but deficits.

Furthermore, the criteria for the Pensioners’ Social Solidarity Benefit (EKAS) have
been made stricter. As a result, about 5 percent of the beneficiaries lost their right to
this benefit in June 2013. This was the result not only of the stricter provisions,
however, but also of the newly adopted computerized system that recalculated all
the pensions per person in June 2013. The latter made it possible to cross-check the
total amounts declared by pensioners throughout all the social security funds and
types of pension.

In another aspect of reductions, people of the previous generation are called in to
return some of their pension amounts either because they retired earlier than they
should have or because their pension is actuarially over-generous. This is done to

                                                  14
        promote intergenerational fairness but there is question about whether
        retrospective reductions to people already retired are legal in a defined benefit
        system. Looking into this question is beyond the scope of this paper and has been
        analyzed further in another publication of the author.

        Further on, indexation was frozen for five years (2010-2014) and the tax allowance
        (personal exemption) was reduced by a quarter, from 12.000 euros in 2011 to 9.000
        euros in 2012 for normal pensioners. For income acquired from pensions in 2013 and
        2014, total abolishment of tax allowance was applied for all employees, freelancers,
        and pensioners. A small bonus based on proven purchase of goods of a given
        amount is provided.

        Following the horizontal cuts in social security, came the actual implementation era
        for most of the laws which included a transitional period. Hence, even though new
        cuts were not imposed, there were still some nonetheless. In July 2014, the
        newfound BNDC auxiliary fund ETEA, reduced pensions by 5.2 percent based on the
        calculation of the sustainability factor.

        An interesting fact about the newfound legislation and its appeal to people is that
        when somebody visits the Daily Gazette website, they will find that the issues of
        reductions are in fact the ones with the most hits since September 2012. The
        pension reform of 2010 still remains in the top ten after almost four years.

VIII.      THE RESULTS OF THE REFORM IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY
        With the implementation of the reforms of 2010 and on, the short-term public
        pension expenditure was curtailed in absolute numbers and remained under the
        targeted thresholds set by the MTFS until the end of 2012, while it slightly exceeded
        the targets set later, under the MTFS 2012-2016. This also happened in the new
        MTFS. Below, one can see the expenditure predicted before the MTFSs, the target
        amounts set by all MTFSs and the ones realized.

Because of the debt restructuring deal there has been an 8.3 billion euro loss in
nominal value of the bonds. As regards their market value, this will fluctuate and
only at the time of selling will we be able to exactly calculate the loss anticipated.
However, in this time of cash flow shortness it is very probable many of these funds
have to liquidate part of their assets in order to provide for pensioners, hence
causing an actual, sizeable loss. Unfortunately, this has been a drawback in the
otherwise positive outcome of the Greek debt restructuring, and will probably pose
a threat later on in the system.

Sadly, exactly the same thing happened to individuals who have trusted the Greek
treasury bonds for their savings. Many measures have been proposed to balance this
loss, like tax reductions. However, none of these have been legislated yet. The only
light at the end of the tunnel is the fact that, if and when the Greek economy
rebounds, the Greek treasury bonds will gain back a lot of their nominal value.

In the long-term, 1 the fiscal impact of the 2010 reform seems to be alleviating the
budget from a great deal of public pension expenditure. The Hellenic Actuarial
Authority presented actuarial valuations for the Greek public pension expenditure
for the years 2007 to 2060 in 2008 and for the years 2010 to 2060 in 2011. These
were included in the 2009 and 2012 Ageing Reports respectively. Results for the
upcoming 2015 Ageing Report have also been provided. In the first case, as can be
seen below, the increase in public pension expenditure would have been 12.4%
percent of GDP, leading as mentioned before to 24 percent of GDP for public
pensions in 2060. In the second valuation, however, the projected increase amounts

2015. For the Greek projections the ILO cohort model has been used (see Appendix 1).

                                              17
to only 1 percent of GDP. Ultimately, results for the base year 2013 show an inverse
trend for the public pension expenditure, which is reduced by 1.9 percent when
projecting to 2060.

          2015 (2013-2060)                             -1.9

This result also puts Greece in a slightly better position than the average of the EU
states and the states of the Euro area, as can be seen for the last projection round.
The same result is anticipated for the current projection round.

Regarding the gross average replacement rate for Greece, this used to be at a
constant level of just under 100 percent across all earnings levels before the reform
(Graph 7). A replacement rate of 100 percent implies that the first pension of the
retired was almost as much as their last wage. This meant that the importance of the
last years of contributing was unequally important to the rest of the years in one’s
career.

After the 2010 reform, lower replacement rates apply for all people, however,
special provisions to protect lower earners from old age poverty in years to come
have been incorporated (Graph 11).

Looking at the above graph, it becomes evident that the reform offers lower earners
relatively better protection in terms of replacement rates and consequently pension
benefits. The gross replacement rate is about 75 percent for the lowest earners and
45 percent for the highest earners at the 90th percentile. This is translated to
considerably lower returns for those in the top quarter of the earnings distribution,
the highest earners.

In general, successive pension reforms led to the acknowledgment that employees
entering the work force today will receive lower future pension entitlements than
previous generations. In Greece, according to latest legislation, statutory retirement
age is linked to the evolution of life expectancy from 2021 and onwards. The
additional years that an employee will work will increase one’s pension entitlement
but will never reach the level it would have been before reforms had taken place.

On a different definition of the gross average replacement rate 2 used by the Ageing
Working Group, the reform reduced the former by as much as 20 percent, reducing
the over-generosity of the system. Since the whole working career is taken into
consideration under the new legislation, the replacement rates become smaller in



2 The gross average replacement rate at retirement as used in the AWG projections is the ratio of the
first pension of those who retire in a given year over the average wage at retirement. The (economy-
wide) average wage of old people at their retirement usually differs from the overall economy-wide
average wage, unless a flat wage profile over the entire working career is assumed in the projection
exercise.

      the first decades and then the phenomenon levels off as the whole career average
      becomes the norm in calculating the pension.

      The reform also pushed the average contributory period upwards for both the main
      and auxiliary pension schemes.

      Starting from almost 30 and 26 years respectively in 2010 as the auxiliary pension
      system is not yet fully mature; the contributory period is driven to 38 years for both
      in 2060. This is also the result for the total pension for base year 2013.

IX.         DEMOGRAPHY
      The overall size of the population of the European Union as projected in the
      EUROPOP2013 (demographic projections carried out by Eurostat in 2013) is going to
      be slightly larger by 2060 but much older than it is now. The EU population is
      projected to increase from 507 million in 2013 to 523 million in 2060. This increase
      takes into consideration the projected inward migration flows to the EU. For Greece,
      among almost half of the EU countries, a decrease in the total population has been
      projected. For the rest of the countries an increase in the total population has been

                                                          21
projected with the special case of Luxembourg which is projected to more than
double its population until 2060.

More specifically, the Greek population is projected to decline by an intense 22.5
percent by 2060. This alone puts a serious demographic pressure on the country’s
pension system. Combined with a very small increase in fertility rates, the increasing
life expectancy and increased participation rates for older age groups only, the
pressure increases and poses a risk as regards the old-age dependency ratio (people
aged over 65/ people aged 15-64).

     By that time (2050), the 2010 reform effect has kicked in and so the dependency
     ratio effect is alleviated. More information on how the dependency ratio and other
     factors affect the projections is given in Appendix 2.

X.      THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE REFORMS
     Even before the 2010 reform, with relatively high pension expenditure, one out of
     five old people were poor in Greece, according to the OECD.

     At the same time Eurostat figures show an upward trend as regards at-risk-of-
     poverty rates for pensioners for the years 2010-11 and an inverse trend for the years
     2013-14.

     Table 7. At-Risk-of-Poverty Rates for Pensioners 2007-2013, GR, EU15/19, EU27 (also
     EU28 for Year 2013, 2014)

                                 At-risk-of-poverty rate for pensioners (SILC) (% Total)
                          2007    2008      2009     2010     2011      2012     2013      2014
 EU (27 /28 countries)    16,6     16,2     15,5     13,9       14      13,2     12,6      12,7
 EU (15/ 19 countries)    17,4     16,5     15,5     14,2      14,5     13,4     12,7      11,9
 Greece                   21,5     20,3     18,4      19       19,9     14,3     12,4      11,5


     The increase and preservation of large figures from 2010 through 2011 are
     attributed to legislation passed for old-age grants. More specifically, the special
     grant given to pensioners whose yearly income does not exceed 4.320 euros (EKAS –
     for single people, starting January 2013), has been reduced greatly from the year
     2010 and the prerequisites for receiving it have been tightened (see above
     Reductions). All other age-related means-tested grants have been incorporated into
     EKAS.

     One would intuitively expect the figures for 2012 and 2013 to remain the same since
     the situation for pensioners in the Greek society has not bettered. We see, however,
     that the percentages have fallen by a good 5 percent for 2012 and another 2 percent
     for 2013. Looking closely at the calculation of this index, however, one understands
     that the pensioners in Greece are not less poor than they used to be in the last two
     years. They actually live under the same conditions, among poorer people. This
     becomes evident when looking at the median equivalized income of people aged 60
     or over versus less than 60 years old—two numbers used in the calculations.




                                               23

 ARP Threshold                                               6591     5708      5023
 ARP rate for pensioners                                     19.9      14.3      12.4
 Median equivalized income people 60 years old or over      9640      9656      8600
 Median equivalized income people less than 60 years old   11436      9400      8100


The median equivalized income for people less than 60 years old is reduced by a far
greater percentage than that of the one for people 60 years old or more. According
to current legislation and the fact that the income deprivation has levelled off in
2014, one would expect the figure for 2014 to rise again.

Now, there is the question of whether the low-income pensioners will be able to get
by on their pensions and the EKAS, since in absolute numbers their income keeps
becoming less and less. Even though means-tested criteria have been applied before
the reductions, their efficiency is questionable when looking at the above figures and
statistics.

Another aspect of the pension reductions, which were combined with wage
reductions, is that they led to a decrease in contributions, causing cash flow
problems in the short term as we are talking about a PAYG system.

More importantly, in 2011, there was a reduction in funds transferred from the
general government to the social security funds which amounted to 3.85 billion
euros, amounting to 15.4 percent off, in comparison to 2010. There was, however, a
loss of 2.57 billion euros in contributions due to the heavy recession and
unemployment. This means that what is gained from pension reductions is almost
lost in contributions since people lose their jobs by thousands and therefore do not
contribute to the system. Therefore, unless a way to overcome unemployment is
found and implemented, a vicious circle of pension reductions because of low
contribution accrual is created and perpetuated. Further extensive losses were
witnessed for the following years in contribution collection, with the trend stabilizing
in 2014 as compared to 2013. The reduction in contribution collection unfortunately
created a repetitive trend circle and the option to further reduce pensions has been
seriously taken into consideration.

XI.       FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN 2015
       In early 2015, the Greek people elected the first left-wing government in recent
       history. Unlike its political predecessors, the new government promised to reform
       the system in an opposite direction, providing more for pensioners and inverting
       some of the pension reductions. Early on after the election, it became evident that
       the fiscal situation of the country did not allow for such corrections; however, the
       passed legislation that would otherwise reduce income for future pensioners had
       been kept idle for more than a year, allowing for reductions of a smaller extent in
       the pensioners first retiring in that era, while at the same time creating a new fiscal
       gap. The Troika, now referred to as Institutions based on a request from the Greek
       Government, were in constant delegations with the latter, awaiting and pricing new
       proposals to further reduce pension expenditure as promised in the MOU—the
       Second Economic Adjustment Program for Greece called for a 0.8 billion reduction in
       pension expenditure in 2015. None of these proposals had actually born fruit in early
       2016 and the delegations were still in effect. Possible measures to be taken included
       further mergers of pension funds, lower replacement rates in the contributory part
       of the main pension, and higher penalties for early retirement.

XII.      THE 2016 PENSION REFORM
       After a long delegation period and with the fear of Greece defaulting once more in
       just a few years’ time, an agreement was reached between the Greek government
       and the institutions. The new legislation is largely based on the 2010 pension reform
       with minor alterations as regards the main scope and architecture and some greater
       ones as regards peripherals.



                                                  25
The main pension remains based on two parts—a basic part, which is means-tested
and pays 12 times per year; and a proportional part, which is calculated as the
product of the accrual rate by the past credits by the pensionable salary. The basic
pension is now named national pension and amounts to 384 versus 360 in the old
system. It is provided according to years of service with a lower cap.

The accrual rates changed and so did the calculation of the pension. Formerly
varying between 0.8 to 1.5 percent progressively, they are now changed into step-
wise rates varying from 0.77 to 2 percent. The legislator claims that this causes an
increase in pension amounts for lower incomes.

The statutory retirement age remains 67, as was formed in 2012. It is also linked to
the increase in life expectancy at age 65 from the year 2021, using the decade
exactly before that as a reference period.

The indexation of benefits remains the same, still keeping the CPI as a ceiling. The
same stands for the full contributory period which had changed to 40 years since the
2010 reform and pensionable earnings, which are again calculated on the whole
career average.

The most important clause in the law, the one that curtails the increase in public
pension expenditure over GDP for the projections up to 2060 can also be found in
the 2016 legislation. Hence, starting from 2017, the increase in Greece’s public
pension expenditure must remain under 2.5 percent of GDP when projected up to
2060. Long-term projections to be run by the HAA every three years will measure the
projected increase and based on the result, the pension system will be changed in
order to meet the demand.

The most influential changes brought about in 2016 are the ones that equalize the
self-employed and scientists to white-collar workers as regards contributions. Hence,
the former are now obliged to pay contributions at a set percentage of their income
(20 percent) instead of paying on presumptive earnings. This clause has raised the
most reactions thus far, as it will cause a moderate to great increase in contributions
paid by the respective groups.

Under the notion of unifying contribution collection and pension calculation, which
was introduced in 2010, the time has now come to create a new hyper-fund that
comprises the funds of the private sector employees (including public electricity
company employees), media employees, lawyers-engineers-notaries and doctors,
the self-employed (small businesses and professional drivers), agricultural workers,
shipmen, utility employees, bank sector employees, and civil servants (including
Firefighters-Policemen-Air Force-Army-Navy).



                                          26
        The unification method is also adopted on the frontier of auxiliary pension and lump
        sums. The Balanced Notional Defined Contribution Fund, which was established in
        2012, is unified with the lump-sum funds, and now they both work under the
        Notional Defined Contribution system. This also means, however, that the system
        stops being balanced. More specifically, the sustainability factor is now removed. To
        counteract the increasing deficit that the removal of the sustainability factor has
        created in the auxiliary pension system, an increase in contributions has been
        introduced, which is phased out during the next six years. This aims to avoid further
        reduction of pensions, even though partial reductions will not be altogether avoided.

        Other practical and legislative details are tackled in the 2016 reform. One of the
        most groundbreaking clauses in the legislation as regards couple justice is one which
        equalizes parties of civil partnerships to married couples. This way, the former can
        enjoy the advantages and privileges of social security and welfare the same way
        married couples can. This is new to the Greek society and points towards the
        direction of acceptance for same gender couples as well, which had been greatly
        opposed so far.

        All in all, the 2016 reform is a step in the right direction, regardless of the fact that it
        took too long to decide upon especially since it is actually an elaborate face-lift of
        the 2010 reform. The legislation in its essence, however, leaves an open window for
        further reforms not far too long into the future, since in 2018 the main pension
        amounts are legislated to be reduced based on system performance. Unfortunately,
        this is the same method of shifting the real problem and letting the next parliament
        address it fully.

XIII.      CONCLUDING REMARKS
        Greece has gone a long way towards laying the foundations for more sustainable
        pensions—not only limiting the superfluousness, but also sacrificing at the same
        time a part of the essential.

        Making these changes quickly in order to avoid bankruptcy was, without question,
        an important and necessary action. However, since real people lie behind the
        numbers, it is vital that adequacy is also guaranteed, so that the people reaching the
        third age are able to manage with integrity and pride. As it is, of course, each
        individual’s responsibility to cater for an adequate pension by contributing to the
        system continuously throughout their life and investing on the side on other pension
        products. The main driver for reform in 2012 and before was the output of the
        Ageing Working Group in sustainability. Since the last projection round, emphasis
        has been given on adequacy in order to avoid creating impoverished nations through
        the intense pension cuts.


                                                    27
The reforms have not finished, nor is it possible to reform a system so quickly, when
nothing has actually been changed for decades. The fiscal situation of the Greek
government accelerated the reforms, but as things are falling into place, it is time to
trace back the steps and deal with the problem universally. The administrative
changes have been colossal and the way the social security system is now organized
is light years ahead of what it was just a few years ago. A full system record has been
materialized, using minimal assets and drawing a complete picture of the former.
Based on these analytical data, the actuarial valuations provided by the HAA are now
more detailed and involve less uncertainty and a reduced margin of error.

It is now time for the government to distinguish between welfare and pension, to
educate people on the demographic developments and the utmost importance
these play on their pension income when they retire in a few decades. Moreover, DC
systems should be taken into consideration by the Greek people when allocating
money for third age income as they are by many other Europeans. This does not
mean that the existing safety nets should be abolished. It does mean, however, that
incentives should be given in order for people to invest a part of their third-age
income into a different kind of system. This also increases risk spreading and allows
people to organize their lives in a much better way.

The actions to be undertaken by the government need time and trust—a key
element absent in the Greek political scene at this point. Respecting pensioners in
actions rather than words, eliminating former inequities, and providing reparation
for some of the injustices of the last four years are good starting points, although
there is still a lot to be done so that we finally sail clear of the iceberg.

With a view to the next pension reform that is most probably not going to be later
than 2018, this is a good opportunity for the interested stakeholders to come
together and discuss a realistic, long-term solution that may last and make a real
difference in public spending as well as a decent third-age income.

APPENDIX 1
Description of the Pension Projection Model and Country-Specific Calculations

The actuarial projections for the main and auxiliary pension provision are run using
the International Labor Office (ILO) cohort model. The present version of the ILO
pension model has been parametrized to support actuarial reviews or studies of
statutory social security pension funds. It thus helps to provide the quantitative basis
for making policy decisions on social security pension funds. The model estimates
future cost on the basis of the cohort decomposition method and various statuses of
a person and associated values (average wage, average pensions) are provided year
by year. To the extent possible, a distribution is considered for income level. For
each generation, the transition of a status of a person (active person, inactive
person, pensioners) is mapped onto the next year’s status by using actuarially
assumed transition probabilities (mortality rate, retirement rate, invalidity rate) and
applying the eligibility conditions and pension formula. This cycle is iterated until the
end of the projection period. By summarizing age-specific results, global future costs
are obtained. For the basics of the calculation, one can be referred to the ILO
Pension Model.

On the initial country-specific general population mortality, fertility, labor force
participation rates, employment rates and migration assumptions in line with
EUROPOP2013 data are applied. Existing and new pensioners are projected
according to the mortality rates, retirement rates, invalidity rates, family statistics,
and legal provisions of each pension scheme.

The wage growth is obtained by the product of inflation and labor productivity.
Negative growth is not applied. Salary valorization is adjusted by the inflation and
labor productivity.

On main pensions benefit indexation, this is fully linked to a uniform adjustment
index which cannot exceed CPI. In particular, the index is equal to the minimum of
CPI and the sum of 50% CPI and 50% GDP growth [min (50% GDP growth +50% CPI,
CPI)]. No nominal increase in pensions up to 2015 applied, according to legislation.
Prudent indexation percentages are applied thereon.

The formula for auxiliary pensions benefit indexation according to legal provision is
γ t = min([1 + g t −2 − r ]SFt − 1, inflation t -1 ) ,
where

g: notional rate of return

Age thresholds

According to legislation the age thresholds will be re-determined according to the
change in life expectancy of the country's population with the age of 65 years as
point of reference. That will come into effect as of January 1, 2021 and upon its first
implementation the change within the 2010 - 2020 period shall be taken into
account.

In the projections, age thresholds are increased by the integral part of the estimated
increase in life expectancy. Age thresholds are increased by one additional year on
2021, 2030, 2042, and 2051.

The main driving forces behind the projection results when using a standard
arithmetic decomposition of a ratio of pension expenditures to GDP are the
dependency, coverage, benefit ratio, employment rate, and labor intensity.

Abstract

In 2010, Greece, under the pressure of an increasing public debt, was forced to resort to the
Troika, which is the designation of the triumvirate comprising the European Commission (EC),
the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Troika agreed to provide Greece with financial help, on special terms recorded in a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Greek Government and the Troika.
One of the most important reforms recorded in the MoU is the Pension Reform since the Greek
Social Security System had long showed signs of unsustainability and insolvency.
The reforms implemented had a great positive impact on pension expenditure, which was
drastically reduced when projected until 2060. The projected reduction, taking into account all
reforms from 2009 to 2015, exceeds 14 percent of GDP.
These fiscal changes are expected to take place under extreme demographic pressure, with both
the total population and the working population projected to decline by a good 20 percent and
36 percent respectively, while at the same time pensioners are projected to increase by as much
as 30 percent.
Replacement rates were drastically reduced by 40 percent for high earners according to the
OECD, while the average contribution period is projected to increase by at least seven years until
2060, reaching almost 38 years in total.
Along with fiscal and demographic effects, one has to also take into account the vicious circle
of recession created in the Greek economy. Such was the latter, that one third of contributions
were lost in the respective era bringing the amount of contributions to 12 billion euros yearly
as opposed to 18 billion euros before the crisis, while at the same time pension expenditure
exceeds 24 billion euros yearly.
The recession also caused further impoverishment of old-age people followed by the rest of
the population. And this became one of the main reasons that the reforms could not be fully
implemented for fear of further impoverishment of pensioners and social exclusion in general, as
well as political cost that is always a key factor.
This paper aims to further analyze and present the impact of the reforms on the Greek pension
system and the people who rely on it through an actuarial—statistical analysis and point out
the changes in the main factors mentioned above and how they correlate.
