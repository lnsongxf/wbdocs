Is a ‘Factory Southern Africa’ Feasible?
Harnessing Flying Geese to the South African Gateway

ABSTRACT
The countries comprising the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are currently not very integrated
into global value chains (GVCs), potentially missing out on important development opportunities.
Accordingly, we explore high level options for promoting their integration. Given East Asia’s spectacular
success with integrating into GVCs, we first assess the probability that SACU can copy their flying geese
pattern. That was initiated by Japanese multinational corporations (MNCs) investing in successive East
Asian countries thereby becoming the lead geese, to be joined subsequently by MNCs from other
countries. We argue that the conditions for pursuing a flying geese approach are difficult to replicate in
SACU. Therefore, we proffer and explore the proposition that South Africa could serve as the gateway
for harnessing MNC geese flying from third countries into the SACU region, in time propelling regional
development through knowledge and investment spillovers, and serving as a conduit into GVCs.
However, there may be substantial obstacles to deepening this integration potential. Other African
gateways are emerging as alternatives to South Africa. And some SACU governments would prefer to
build regional value chains (RVCs) rather than prioritise GVC integration. We argue that RVCs are
complements to GVCs. SACU countries, excluding South Africa, may not attract many world leading
MNCs since their markets are small, but could attract smaller regional players from South Africa or
elsewhere. Thus building RVCs in the short run could assist with integration into GVCs in the longer run.
Overall, this requires harnessing South African and MNC geese to the South African gateway, in a
mutually complementary strategy.

1 Introduction
Enhanced by multilateral liberalization as well as decreasing communication and transportation costs,
deeper global economic integration has led to greater flexibility for firms. Production processes today
are sliced or fragmented; and take place in global value chains (GVCs). This is important for developing
countries in particular, since it means they can build competencies in particular aspects of the value
chain without having to master the entire production cycle. This building of particular competencies can
lead to rapid industrialization and broader development, as experienced in, inter alia, East Asia and
Mexico in recent decades. Consequently, in recent years GVCs have risen to the forefront of the global
trade and investment policy debate.

GVCs are concentrated in what Richard Baldwin (2012) terms “Factory North America”, centered on the
US; “Factory Europe”, centered primarily on Germany; and “Factory Asia”, centered on Japan. The
existence of these regional concentrations of value chain activity highlights the fact that much of what
are called “global” value chains are in fact regional. One notable exception is China, which in recent
decades has been the world’s key player in international production fragmentation, serving as the
central location for processing and assembly of manufactured goods destined for global markets.
However, with rising Chinese labour costs production is relocating, partly back to the developed
markets and notably the US (Sirkin et al., 2011), or to developing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and
Mexico (Draper & Lawrence, 2013). It is this relocation process that offers, in theory, opportunities to
other developing countries, including in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Consequently, attention is turning to the possibility that Southern Africa may benefit from the
geographic relocation of GVCs. The question, therefore, is whether a “Factory Southern Africa” –
comprising the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia,
Swaziland (BLNS) and South Africa – is feasible, and if so what kind of policy mix would facilitate its
development? We examine this question in light of international comparative experience. We use the
term “Factory Southern Africa” to refer to the SACU countries throughout this report.

In the analysis we highlight the importance of regional value chains (RVCs) as a complementary
analytical category to GVCs. In essence the value chain concept is the same, regardless of whether the
analytical focus is regional or global. Nonetheless, the distinction we would draw between the two is
that RVCs are primarily operated within a particular region, by regional actors, for regional markets. By
contrast GVCs are primarily operated by global companies or multinational corporations (MNCs),
transcend regional boundaries even though they may be concentrated in particular regions, and are
oriented towards extra-regional (global) markets. RVCs may constitute the first step towards
establishing or tying into GVCs. We also acknowledge that there are many different kinds of value
chains, corresponding to different economic activities encompassing different economic sectors, from
minerals extraction, to agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It is beyond the scope of this paper to
delve into how SACU countries can orientate themselves within particular value chains, whether RVCs
or GVCs. Our analysis is high level, and focused on the policy orientations appropriate to building
participation in RVCs and GVCs, with application to SACU countries.

It is critical to locate the policy issues in international comparative experience. While there are
numerous examples we could draw on, East Asia has been the standout success story in the evolution
of GVCs so we focus on that region. At the heart of this story, at least initially, is the role played by
Japanese MNCs in sparking the growth of, first, RVCs, and GVCs over time. This points to the


                                                                                                  5
importance of a leading economy in the region concerned; in this case Japan drove the establishment of
“Factory Asia”. Similarly the United States (US) drove the establishment of “Factory America”, while the
origins of “Factory Europe” were more dispersed but are increasingly centered on Germany. In this
light, it is our contention that if “Factory Southern Africa” were to emerge, South Africa would be at its
centre.

Accordingly, Section 2 focuses on the “flying geese” pattern, highlighting the role of Japanese foreign
direct investment (FDI) and trade in driving East Asian economic integration and growth. We ask
whether a comparable process could conceivably unfold in Southern Africa, led by South Africa as the
“lead goose”. We argue that while South Africa is already driving regional investment to a significant
extent it does not possess the requisite capacities to propel the region into sustained growth and global
integration. Furthermore, we note that the SACU region possesses very different comparative
advantages vis à vis East Asia. Consequently, we argue that a different kind of integration process is
required in SACU.

In Section 3 we elaborate on this, focusing on attraction to the region of MNCs from outside the region,
using South Africa as their Southern African “gateway”. This draws on the later elaboration of the flying
geese pattern, in which Japanese MNCs were joined by their US, European, and East Asian counterparts
to drive the development of GVCs, centered increasingly on China. Since there is no China in Southern
Africa, the orientation of South African and global MNCs would necessarily be different, and probably
more oriented to regional rather than global markets. We briefly explore some contours of those
differences.

In Section 4 we then ask how the SACU region is currently positioned, from a policy perspective, in
relation to the “flying geese/gateway” proposition. This depends substantially on different countries’
comparative advantages, and the prospects for GVC-oriented industries to take root. A key issue for the
BLNS states is that South African firms dominate their economic landscapes, with MNCs occupying most
of the left over spaces. A central question, therefore, is how they can harness this dominance to their
own advantage; an approach that requires niche-oriented thinking. Simply put, the BLNS governments
need to actively identify the value chains their companies can realistically plug into, whether RVCs or
GVCs, then consciously assist their companies to access them. Therefore, concerted state action is
necessary, to build the enabling institutional environment MNCs require before they will transfer higher
order technologies, and to identify key lead firms for targeted investment promotion into the region.
Furthermore, the flying geese and gateway propositions require a liberal policy orientation – in order to
attract FDI by “lead firms” that coordinate GVCs or RVCs, the region has to make itself more attractive
by reducing transaction costs across the board.

However, some SACU countries are pursuing a different policy vision, one more sceptical of FDI by
MNCs. This policy approach is anchored in a view of RVCs that is akin to import substitution extended
from the national terrain to the region. While we are sympathetic to the impulses behind this approach
we argue that it would be to the region’s benefit to think about how to link RVCs to GVCs, rather than
how to replace MNC activities in the region. This requires a facilitative approach, harnessing the
gateway and actively promoting South Africa’s lead role; in other words working cooperatively with
both South African and foreign MNCs rather than seeking to curtail their activities.

2 The Flying Geese Pattern
Here we focus on lessons that may be learned from East Asia since the 1960s. The essence of the “flying
geese pattern” is that East Asian countries were incorporated into a largely Japan-centered regional
production network. The lead goose was Japan, with Japanese companies “flying” first into Northeast
and Southeast Asia, a process subsequently imitated by the four dragon economies (Hong Kong,
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan), and then to China when the latter opened up to FDI in the 1990s. This
RVC picture took on a global dimension when the activities of Western MNCs, from the US and
European Union (EU), were incorporated. They have participated enthusiastically in the opening up of
the Chinese economy to FDI, so that many have established GVCs around final assembly in China. In
doing so they also source parts and components from the East Asia region, thus blurring the distinction
between GVCs and RVCs, since their activities extend well beyond East Asia. So China nowadays serves
as the hub for production of parts produced in other countries in the region, to be assembled and
exported as final products to world markets. It is estimated that intra-regional trade accounts for more
than half of China’s total exports, and foreign investment into China’s exports are largely from other
Asian neighbours (Gaulier et al., 2007). With inexorably rising labour costs for low value added
operations in China, assembly and mass production are now being shifted to other countries such as
Vietnam, India and Bangladesh; thus the geese are once more on the move.

As a consequence of these integration efforts, in the last few decades East Asia has been the region
with the highest growth rates and development success in the world. The key to this success is the
growing economic interdependence in the region through the formation of RVCs/GVCs, with intra-
regional trade having been the fastest growing component of Asia Pacific’s total trade. In the period
1986–2007 import of non-oil products within the region rose from 40% of total trade to more than 60%
(Athukorala & Kohpaiboon., 2009). In addition, we observe soaring exports of intermediate products,
while the share of final products’ export remained under 45% from 1992 to 2007 (Athukorala, 2011).
This indicates the growing importance of product fragmentation in this period, aligning with the
formation of RVCs/GVCs.

Expanding intra-regional FDI flows, notably from richer countries such as Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries and China, have played a key
role in boosting trade and improving regional development. A complex industry that requires
sophisticated chains can be fragmented into specialized production processes located in different
countries, depending on their comparative advantages or endowments of labour, wages, skills,
availability of capital and technology, and competitive advantages including levels of infrastructure,
taxes and legislation in different industries, etc.

First we unpack the dynamics central to the flying geese pattern. Then we analyse how applicable it is
to SACU.

2.1 MNCs and FDI
The flying geese metaphor of structural transformation was first coined by Japanese economist Kaname
Akamatsu (1961) and later developed by many other theorists as one of the most important
explanations for the emergence of RVCs in East Asia, with its legacy to be the theoretical grounding for
the Asia Pacific Economic Community (APEC) (Kojima, 2000). Foreign MNCs from the US and Europe
historically took an important role in the Japanese economy to transform the country into Asia’s leading
powerhouse in the 20th century. Through licensing and original equipment manufacturing (OEM)
arrangements, Japanese firms successfully absorbed technology from overseas, mainly European and
US MNCs (Ozawa, 1974), in what is described as the first and second patterns of flying geese (or
domestic patterns) for Japan’s learning-based approach to industrialization (Hayter & Edgington, 2004).
After the Second World War and until recently Japan, as a source of advanced technological
independence, was the leading goose in its third flying geese paradigm (or international pattern).
Japanese FDI took the crucial role of developing its neighbours’ economies and technology through the
process of dynamic industrial shifting among countries in the region to form East Asia’s RVCs (Chen,
1989). The most important impact of Japanese FDI was and is the dynamic change of factor
endowments in East Asian host countries, which lifted their industries to higher value chain production
over time through transfer of technology and knowledge from MNCs to their local partners. The MNCs’
role is anchored in investment decisions made by profit-seeking entities, and trade is driven by import
and export firms, not primarily by states (Memis, 2009).

Box 1: The Flying Geese Model – brief history
Investment from Japan to other Asian nations can be traced back to the 1960s, when the majority of initial
Japanese FDI flew to Taiwan and later South Korea, two countries that had previous colonial links with and
are geographically proximate to Japan. Sanyo was the first MNC to establish its business in Taiwan in 1963,
initially producing electronics products for domestic demand and later exporting to the US and other
markets (Hobday, 1995b, p. 104). South Korea, under military dictatorship and the “Heavy-Chemical
Industry Drive” policies centered on large domestic firms (chaebol), initially practiced import substitution to
the point that FDI was not legally permitted until 1959. It only opened for FDI inflow from 1960 under the
Foreign Capital Promotion and Inducement Act, and promoted foreign investment from Japanese firms after
the normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan in 1965 and the further reduction of FDI restrictions in
1966 (Chung, 2007, p. 173). Other important destinations for Japanese FDI included Singapore and Hong
Kong (Edgington, 1993). Investment in this period concentrated on import substitution to serve local
markets, driven by the lack of domestic production, reliance on imports of major appliances such as air
conditioning, TVs etc., and import barriers. In the Malaysian case high tariffs on imported consumer goods
such as TVs and refrigerators drove the inflow of FDI from Japan as early as the 1960s into these sectors
(Lim & Pang, 1991).

Japanese experience of the major “high yen” (endaka) period in 1985 and 1993 and rising domestic labour
costs combined with the desire to circumvent mounting US import barriers to accelerate the process. Thus
Japanese MNCs relocated their manufacturing facilities to lower cost ASEAN countries such as Thailand, the
Philippines and Indonesia, this time for the purpose of exporting to global markets, in what was regarded as
“pro-trade oriented FDI” (Kojima, 2000). However, the Asian financial crisis in 1997 caused major shifts of
Japanese MNCs’ operations to China and later Vietnam and India

2.1.1 The lead goose and following geese
Within the flying geese framework, Japanese FDI moved into its proximate region and drove the
elaboration of RVCs notably in the electronics and automotive sectors, accompanied subsequently by
MNCs from other regions such as the US and Europe in a mimicking process greatly boosted by China’s
subsequent emergence and market potential. So it was not only Japanese firms taking the role of the


                                                                                                        8
lead goose in certain industries (e.g. electronics products), but also MNCs from other countries. This is a
particularly relevant lesson for Southern Africa, since it is highly dependent on third-country investors.

In Asian RVCs, Japan serves as the “growth pole” in initiating the dynamic development chain to create
spill-overs to other countries, and China as a big player also takes the key part in formulating and
duplicating RVCs into a massive “factory”, as we are seeing today. In the SACU context South Africa,
relatively, is analogous to Japan in terms of driving regional investment patterns and therefore RVCs. A
key difference, however, is the absence of a China in the region to act as an attractor for GVCs, meaning
that RVCs loom larger in SACU. Only Nigeria with its large and rapidly growing population and its
dynamic domestic market is somewhat comparable to China in the early 1990s.

Furthermore, East Asia preserves significant comparative advantages for the development of its RVCs.
Southeast Asia is geographically proximate to Japan, and now China, in terms of population density and
easy, particularly sea-based, transportation. The structure of comparative advantage in the SACU region
is quite different; a fact to which we return in 2.4.1. Nonetheless, the flying geese pattern is in essence
based on the mechanism of “recycling comparative advantage” (Ozawa, 2009). Empirical studies to
quantify the flying geese pattern are mostly based on the index of revealed comparative advantage
(RCA), which ranks countries by degree of comparative advantage for each particular industry (Ballance
et al., 1987). Results show that Japan not only loses its comparative advantage in traditional sectors
over time but also in high-tech industries, whereas the newly industrialized economies (NIEs – Hong
Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) have gained competitiveness in both sectors. Members of
ASEAN are losing comparative advantage in traditional products but gaining in high-tech industries. This
process of industrial shifting is central to the flying geese pattern.

2.1.2 Driving forces of industrial shifting
The main driving forces of industrial shifting are dynamic comparative advantages (in labour-intensive,
low cost manufacturing assembly operations) and competitive advantages (in logistics, business
environment and policy suitability). Cheaper labour costs in less developed countries and the ability to
engage greater local markets with lower transaction costs, i.e. transportation and tariffs, pushed
efficiency and profit-seeking Japanese MNCs to rearrange their lower value added activities to their
neighbours. From the host countries’ point of view, the need for welfare enhancement from not only
production for domestic demand and exports but also job provision and corporate tax collection, or
“FDI-led growth”, has pushed their governments toward trade and FDI policy liberalization. Moreover,
the presence of foreign MNCs’ products raised domestic firms’ competition capability and quality of
goods produced. In the longer term, late-comer countries should benefit from technology and
knowledge transfer from foreign MNCs to climb up the value chains of production.

2.1.3 Reverse production cycle
In the short run, host countries can generally benefit from the establishment of MNCs’ factories, which
not only create jobs for local inhabitants but also generate wealth and public revenues. In the longer
run, transfer of technology and know-how from foreign MNCs pushes the economy up – RVCs as well as
GVCs – from producing primary, labour-intensive products to mature, capital-intensive products. This
process of technology transferring can be explained via the “reverse product cycle” model (Hobday,
1995a), as depicted in Figure 1. It indicates a late-comer country’s ability to acquire technology for
production by adopting a product’s production cycle, from simple skilled mass production and assembly




                                                                                                    9
operations (stage 1), to advanced, adaptive procedures that improve productivity and efficiency (stage
2), and finally core research and development (R&D) to build new products (stage 3).

Figure 1: The reverse production cycle

At stage 1 or the “mature” stage, the competitive advantage of low labour cost in developing countries
was the main driving force for Japanese (and later Taiwanese and South Korean) MNCs to establish
their factories for assembly operations. China is currently the largest product assembling destination
due to its abundance of low-skilled labour, but the potential is shifting to Vietnam, India, and

Stage 2 requires workers with “enterprise specific skills” (ESS) and “relation specific skills” (RSS) for
faster growth and innovation (Koike & Inoki, 1990). ESSs are developed from workers with expertise
and experience through dealing with both routine problems and being adaptive to new circumstances,
which enhance productivity (Patchell & Hayter, 1995). RSSs foster innovation by the stable exchanges of
technological knowledge and strong connections of core firms and their suppliers, which is at the heart
of Japanese corporate systems’ competitive advantages (Patchell, 1993). This stage demands skilled
labour to manufacture products rather than pure assembly operations.

Research and development makes stage 3 the most advanced but also the most difficult step to
achieve. Mastery of it allows host countries to be independent from MNCs to initiate new products and
become leading geese in particular value chains. From the host countries’ side, this requires highly
educated personnel, the availability of technology and working conditions/environment for R&D to take
off. Furthermore, this stage creates conflicts between MNCs and host countries in technology transfer
since R&D is the core competitive advantage of profit-seeking MNCs (Hayter & Edgington, 2004). MNCs

will no longer be needed when a country can domestically produce completed goods for local markets
as well as export, thus stage 3 ends the “reverse production cycle”.

2.1.4 The technology transfer challenge
The stage 3 challenges highlight the fact that while foreign investment is a key channel for technology
transfer through domestic spillovers, it is also by contrast a means of technology protection for MNCs
when investing into competitor markets. In this light it is important to appreciate that in the 1980s and
1990s a vigorous intellectual debate was waged over the precise causes of East Asian industrialization,
and the role played by the flying geese pattern. This debate can be observed in comparable intensity
and directions today. In general critics argue that the explanation for the flying geese pattern privileges
the role of FDI by MNCs, but neglects or underemphasizes the role of host countries’ policy, indigenous
capital, and control over the formation of domestic industries (Edgington & Hayter, 2000; Rodan, 1993).
Scholars argue that strong, developmental states pursuing interventionist industrial strategies
characterized by targeting of industries and firms, plus selective trade protection and curtailment of
FDI, were responsible for driving industrial development, first in Japan then the four “tiger” economies:
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore (Amsden, 1989; Chang, 1994). Furthermore, these
critics argue that the ability of late-comers to catch up with technology and move up the value chain
depends on MNCs’ willingness to transfer the technology and knowledge through stages of product
development.

Similarly, the “internalization” literature in international business theory (Caves, 1971; Dunning, 1988)
argues that MNCs seek to control their technology through FDI. In this light the technology gap can
narrow but the closer to the technology frontier the company/country concerned comes, the more
difficult it is to eliminate (Hobday, 1995b). This scepticism is the basis for modern advocates of
technology transfer policies, such as those pursued in Brazil, designed to force technology transfer from
MNCs (Gereffi & Sturgeon, 2013).

On the other side of the debate various proponents argue that while some of the interventionist and
protectionist policies advocated by critics were pursued in the 1950s and 1960s, by the 1970s and
1980s those states had turned to trade liberalization and opening up to FDI, which then drove their
rapid economic growth and industrialization (World Bank, 1993, 1997). Furthermore, as GVCs linked to
global markets bedded down in the region so these liberal policies became more important, in order to
attract the “golden geese” or MNCs, constituting the flying geese pattern (World Economic Forum,
2012). Advocates argue that this policy mix has delivered rapid development success in developing
countries that have implemented it.

Clearly East Asia exhibits very different experiences and approaches. After four decades of development
along the reverse production cycle, South Korean chaebol attained the status of world class producers
of electronics devices such as TVs, camcorders and CD players, while Taiwanese small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) were successful with PCs, fax machines and calculators (Box 2) (Hobday, 1995a).
Subsequently the late-comers South Korea and Taiwan, with their rising wages, could outsource low
value added operations to less developed countries with comparative advantages in labour costs i.e.
China and ASEAN.

Box 2. Technology Transfer in Korea and Taiwan
Using licensing, joint venture and OEM arrangements, local firms in Korea retained control of production
and were able to upgrade their technology to catch up with higher value chain stages. These Japanese


                                                                                                    11
strategies to acquire technology and intensive training from the US in previous decades were adopted by
late-comers in subsequent years (Kim, 1997). In the late 1970s, the South Korean government imposed
policies to limit FDI per se into the country and shifted from general export promotion to a sectoral
development strategy. Key policy instruments included cutting tax benefits for foreign firms and tightening
selective, targeted industries to be invested in e.g. chemicals, basic metals, fabricated metal products and
equipment (Chung, 2007, p. 274). Together with setting higher priority on joint ventures, these policies
made licensing agreements become the only way for MNCs to access the local market. Thus South Korea
successfully absorbed foreign technology, mostly from Japan since Japanese MNCs dominated licensing
agreements in this period. These policies prepared the ground for the “turning point” transition from the
second to the third stage in the reverse production cycle, where product innovations were initiated.

Another way to obtain productivity is via OEM arrangements, in which Korean OEMs produced large scale,
mass production, low cost standardized goods to serve customers in Japan and the US. Under the pressure
of providing highest quality at the lowest prices, OEMs served as the training school for Korean industries to
match international standards. Therefore, domestic OEMs not only acquired technology, staff training in
quality, and engineering support from OEM buyers from Japan, but also enjoyed economies of scale and
improving productivity under the pressure of providing highest quality at lowest prices (Hobday, 1995b).
The government enhanced technology transfers also by means of education policy.

Taiwan experienced to some extent the same development path as South Korea, although the Taiwanese
government did not intervene in the FDI flow like South Korea’s. However, Taiwanese firms also eventually
graduated from dependence on Japanese FDI by joining OEM agreements with US retail firms and Japanese
trading companies, or sogo shosha, which work very closely with their keiretsu (business groups) partners
(Hayter & Edgington, 2004). By combining investment on vocational training, overseas education, and
research projects both from government and domestic firms, these two countries have set up large
institutes for R&D to adopt foreign technologies.

The ASEAN story is different again. Although the region has still attracted a large amount of investment
from Japanese MNCs owing to lower labour costs and big markets (Ernst, 2000), major ASEAN
countries, notably the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, are at the lower tiers of RVCs,
struggling to develop past the first stage of assembly operations. Mostly this is owing to lack of good
institutional settings, notably low skilled, poorly educated workforces, weak government policies for
industrial development, and domestic partners showing little interest in unlocking the secrets of foreign
technology via reverse engineering (Hayter & Edgington, 2004). In addition, the technology and skills
learning procedure has only taken place within Japanese MNCs rather than broadly across the entire
country (Rasiah, 2003). This supports the view put forward by Hatch and Yamamura (1996) detailing
how Japanese MNCs keep technology secrets within the firm by parcelling out discrete bits of
production to different ASEAN countries so that no country would be able to imitate the whole cycle.

China, as the latest host of East Asian geese, opened up its economy rather late compared to major
Asian partners and subsequently has played a decisive role in the formation of East Asia’s RVCs owing to
its size and geo-political position. Beginning at the end of the 1970s with China’s selective liberalization
of its massive market, and associated workforce mobility, it received further boosts from the Japanese
high yen period and the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, both of which caused mass
production and assembly operations to shift to China, as the flying geese pattern predicted. By contrast,
China’s failed 1950s attempt to leap frog into industrial development via the “Great Leap Forward”
showed the difficulty for an economy to skip industrial development processes without the
improvement of its institutional setting, of which the enhancement of human resources takes centre
stage (Kwan, 2002).

This discussion surely does not have a final solution, but it teaches the importance of policies and
governments. International lead firms or “lead geese” are dependent on an investment climate that is
compatible with medium or long-term investment decisions. In other words, the institutional quality
and governance structure of the host countries plays a role. Corruption, conflicts, poorly defined
property rights, and weak rule of law all have negative effects on MNCs’ choice of location to invest. It
seems that Southern Africa in the past has suffered from deficiencies in this field, which certainly
contributes to the explanation why the region did not experience a flying geese period. The flying geese
pattern implicitly takes the institutional and policy requirements as given. In the following, we sketch
out some criteria for its successful implementation in SACU.

2.2 Criteria for Successful Application within SACU
In our view the flying geese model is an ex-post analysis rather than intended strategy since industrial
shifting was caused primarily by the private sector, in which MNCs took the crucial role. Nevertheless,
to use this approach successfully and influence industrial shifting within RVCs in Southern Africa, in
particular in SACU, requires a number of preconditions which can be identified by looking at East Asian
experience. We identify four in an indicative (but by no means exhaustive) list:

   1. From the host countries’ point of view, FDI-led growth pushed East Asian governments toward
      trade and policy liberalization to open up the economy for FDI inflows, thus paving the way for
      better integration to GVC/RVCs, and being a functioning goose within the flying geese model.
   2. The main driving forces of upgrading and industrial shifting are dynamic comparative advantages
      (in labour-intensive, low cost manufacturing assembly operations) and competitive advantages
      (in logistics, business environment, and policy suitability). Further analysis is provided in section
      2.3.1.
   3. Elaborating on 2, these dynamic comparative advantages are best developed with a skilled
      labour force. Labour skills levels decide where the country is allocated in value chains. The
      government’s impetus to adapt foreign technology, skills and knowledge transfer, determine the
      country’s ability to move up value chains. In this regard, human resources need to be improved
      via primary and skilled-base education. Furthermore, investment in research and technology are
      particularly important the closer the country gets to the knowledge frontier.
   4. The role of the “lead goose” in the region is clearly important, but is not enough. Thus it is
      important to not only attract firms from the region itself but also from other regions. Further
      analysis is delivered in parts 2.3.2, 2.3.3 and section3.

Other criteria for countries to participate in GVC/RVCs could be developed, for example those based on
Draper et al. (2014), and shown in Table 1:

    1. Technological readiness for the absorption and transfer of technology, measured by a number
       of indices in the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) (Schwab,
       2014).
    2. Market access, comprising indicators from Global Enabling Trade Index, and including domestic
       and foreign market access plus efficiency and transparency of border administration. Domestic
       market access focuses mainly on tariffs and the share of duty-free imports. Foreign market
       access includes tariffs faced in destination markets and the margin of preference in destination
       markets (Hanouz et al., 2014).




                                                                                                    13
        3. Logistics performance, based on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (Arvis et al.,
           2014).
        4. Institutional frameworks, as measured by the institutions sub index of the GCI, which takes
           account of a very wide range of public and private institutions.
        5. Quality of infrastructure index, taken from the GCI.
        6. Work force development, encompassing the health and primary education, higher education
           and training, and labour market efficiency sub-indices from the GCI.
        7. Business sophistication, drawn from the GCI.
        8. Innovation capacity, which is especially important for stage 3 in the reverse production cycle,
           and can be approximated by the Innovation index from the GCI.

 From the abovementioned criteria, a number of the determinants for application of the flying geese
 model to SACU will be discussed in detail in the next chapter, focused mainly on the comparison
 between SACU members and East Asian countries.

 2.3 How does the SACU region measure up?
 We defer the discussion of policy orientations towards FDI and trade liberalization to section 4, since
 section 3 reinforces the case for liberal approaches. Here we concentrate on comparative and
 competitive advantages, including the structure of the labour force, and South Africa’s potential to play
 the role of the “lead goose”.

 2.3.1 Comparative and competitive advantages and the production cycle
 Table 1 draws together key comparative indicators as referred to in Section 2.2. Interestingly, on most
 indicators there is not much to choose between SACU countries and the selected Asian peer group.
 Nonetheless, Table 1 shows that, in the longer term, leading industries in SACU need to improve their
 human capital quality and capacity with similar pace to what East Asia did with its education system. As
 said above, the enhancement of human resources is the key institutional prerequisite for value chain
 upgrading. As shown in detail below, the SACU region compares poorly in measures of human capital.

  The evident lack of big differences on the range of indicators highlighted in 2.2 highlights the crucial
  role of demographics in differentiating the countries. Simply put, Southeast Asia and China have a
  comparative advantage in population size that Southern Africa will probably never enjoy. This is
  demonstrated clearly in Table 2.

However, demographics in the region appear to be moving towards a favourable dividend. Mubila
(2012) estimates the continent’s total population would peak at 1.6 billion in 2030. However, that is
largely an East and West African phenomenon, potentially making those African regions more suited to
labour-intensive, assembly-based manufacturing down the line. At the moment, South Africa has a
substantial population of approximately 51 million but, by Southeast Asian standards, let alone Chinese
standards, it is of modest size. And the BLNS countries have small populations, averaging around two
million people each. In comparison, Southeast Asian countries have large populations totalling
approximately 600 million.

The labour pool in SACU is not only sharply limited relative to that on offer in East or Southeast Asia,
but Southern Africa also has the lowest population growth rate within Sub-Saharan Africa, with a 2%
fertility rate in 2012 compared to much higher rates of about 2.5% in West, East and Central Africa
(Mubila, 2012); not surprisingly it also has much lower overall population growth rates than East and
West Africa (see Table 2). However, lower fertility rates bring an advantageous facet for Southern
Africa: the region is also projected to have the highest ratio of working age over non-working age
population in the continent by 2050. It is predicted that by then per non-working person (e.g. children
or seniors) there will be 2.3 times more people capable of being in the labour force. The ratio in
Southern Africa is much higher than its Central (1.9), Western and Eastern (1.6) peers (Mubila, 2012).
This also reflects the emerging middle class in Southern Africa as the main factor for rising consumers
and potential booming markets. However, consumption within the SACU region will never come close
to East and Southeast Asian levels given the vast population differentials. Furthermore, the high
unemployment and (related) high inequality is a significant hindrance to the size and growth of the
consumer market.

Thus, with a limited labour pool and relatively small regional markets, production tends to operate at
relatively low volumes, making it difficult for firms and sectors to leverage scale economies for
productivity gains. This contributes to a situation where the manufacturing sector – which is at the
heart of the flying geese pattern – tends to be relatively undeveloped and uncompetitive (in a global

context) in the region. As can be seen in Figure 2, the share of manufacturing in SACU’s GDP is still far
below the level of its East Asian peers2 .

While the above is partly evidence of the existing gap in GVC participation between SACU and East Asia,
it also helps explain why a global export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing development path
difficult to initiate in the SACU region. We elaborate further on this in Section 4.1.3 with respect to
comparative unit labour costs. So it seems that even stage 1 of the reverse production cycle model is
challenging for Southern Africa given the demographic and human resources disadvantages the region
faces relative to East Asia in particular. Consequently, for the SACU region at its current developmental
trajectory, stage 2 seems the utmost the region can achieve. Stage 3 of product innovation requires
intensive investment in research and development, which is difficult to achieve if relying solely on
foreign investment. Outside of South Africa, the potential for such investment is limited.

2.3.2 Can South Africa be the lead goose?
South Africa is undoubtedly, and by a large measure, the leading economy in Southern Africa and the
one in the region with the most potential to drive a flying geese pattern of industrialization. It is rightly
considered the growth pole of the region owing to its relative economic weight and sophisticated
corporate capabilities, as reflected in its regional FDI and trade footprints. Its companies are significant
investors in the BLNS economies, and beyond in Southern Africa, in a range of sectors reflecting South
African relative comparative and competitive advantages (Naidu & Lutchman, 2004), from natural
resources extraction, through basic industries and utilities, to manufacturing and services (Page & te
Velde, 2004); (Draper et al., 2010). South Africa is also the largest foreign investor in Lesotho, Botswana
and Swaziland. Only South African companies have the potential to drive RVCs in these sectors; other
countries in Southern Africa such as Angola, Botswana or Zambia have infrastructure and capacity
primarily for extracting natural resources (Ogunleye, 2011).

 Swaziland shows a particularly high level of manufacturing contribution to GDP. This is explained primarily by the
dominant role in Swaziland’s economy of the manufacture of Coca -Cola concentrate


                                                                                                            17
Clearly post-Apartheid South Africa is not comparable to 1960s Japan on a number of levels, beginning
with economic capacity and reach, traversing through very different labour forces and population sizes,
into fundamentally different domestic political economies and associated constraints. South Africa
cannot emulate Japan in terms of scale of FDI, size and sophistication of home firms. The Japanese
outward FDI footprint is comprehensive, huge and powerful, as befits the third largest economy in the
world. South Africa lacks the necessary economic, political, and technological capacities to copy it. It
also has a limited (in global economic terms) presence.

Finally, the demographic structure in East Asia supports the flying geese pattern: Japan’s population is
aging and costly to maintain, which encourages relocation of low value added, labour intensive
operations to lower income, labour abundant neighbouring countries. However, South Africa may not
suit the role of Japan in the region since the former’s population is young, and the country has been
dealing with a stubborn structural unemployment rate of approximately 25% (World Bank, 2014d) for
two decades while the youth unemployment rate stands at approximately 45%, one of the highest in
the world (Biavaschi et al., 2012). Consequently capital is urgently needed in South Africa itself.

Therefore, relying on larger MNCs from outside the region is a necessary alternative.

2.3.3 China and/or the West as the lead goose?
One feasible scenario for the flying geese pattern to work in Southern Africa is from Chinese, US or
European investment into the region. This is particularly relevant in cases where South African
companies are not able to act as lead geese. International lead firms within GVCs could, as we elaborate
in Section 3, use South Africa as gateway and act as lead goose in the value chain.

In this regard Western companies are of importance in a number of sectors (see section 3.3). However,
though some Western MNCs are still active in Africa, in general they are losing relative impact in the
region. Over three decades, Western Europe’s share in all international trade with Africa decreased
from 51 to 28 percent (Luyten, 2013). Nevertheless, the declining European share in international trade
does not necessarily indicate that the influence of Western companies is decreasing, since the role that
companies play in value chains is more important; in other words European companies may simply be
sourcing more from their host bases in the region or indeed from Asia instead of sourcing from Europe.
One example is the automobile components industry in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng regions of South
Africa, which on the surface has been well integrated into GVCs through automobile OEMs. However,
the potential for SACU to form RVCs in SACU in this particular industry is ambiguous, since component
exports are largely limited to one African country, Zimbabwe, the remainder being destined for the
West (Barnes & Kaplinsky, 2000).3

Chinese companies, by contrast, have not to date acted as lead firms within GVCs. Nevertheless, China,
in its quest for natural resources via FDI and development aid, is expected to be a leading investor in
building Africa’s manufacturing base (Ozawa & Bellak, 2011). However, Africa’s development benefits
from Chinese investment are questionable, for example in terms of environmental and labour

3
 From the BLNS’s standpoint, this is notable as in the period covered in Barnes and Kaplinsky’s study they barely
participated in the regional automotive value chain. It is possible that SACU’s population structure plays the
crucial role in forming the RVCs. South Africa’s overwhelming population of 55 million is able to supply far more
components than its neighbours, with populations of 2 million each. This compares unfavourably to East Asia’s
population structure where Japan’s size is comparable to its partner “geese”. Thus it is notable that Zimbabwe
with its population of 13 million, rather than the BLNS, is able to take part in automotive chains with South Africa.


                                                                                                              18
standards, the need for improving institutional settings such as promotion of human rights and
combating corruption. Furthermore, Chinese infrastructure investments often are also claimed to be
poorly built (Scholvin & Strüver, 2013). Nonetheless, based on their experience with labour-intensive,
massive production of footwear, textiles and electronics, Chinese firms could establish factories in
Southern Africa, a process which seems to be underway as China-led special economic zones (SEZs)
have been established in a number of African countries, including Southern Africa (Davies et al., 2014),
although not in any SACU countries. But as argued above, labour costs in Southern Africa do not
compare favourably with Chinese neighbours such as India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and newly
liberalized Myanmar. Those countries also are located closer to China, in terms of population and
availability of regional supply chain.

Relying on China, therefore, may neither deliver the quality nor the quantity of investment needed.
Therefore, a combination of investors from different home countries is required. Rather than a single,
dominant South African flock, a multitude of smaller flocks is necessary.

2.3.4 Is the flying geese model applicable?
Despite the caveats mentioned so far, there is reason for optimism. Regarding the overall success of
East Asia’s RVCs development, in our view if the “flying geese” model could be successfully applied to
SACU, the implications would be substantially positive. The region would become a centre of export-
oriented industrialization, generating a virtuous circle of investment with attendant spillovers into
domestic economies. But as we have noted above Southern Africa does not have a Japan-equivalent
economy ready to drive rapid development in this way.

While it clearly has some capacity to drive regional development, not least through its own MNCs
investing into the region, far more FDI than South Africa can supply is required. But why would MNCs
from outside the SACU region want to engage in FDI there? To answer this question we turn now to the
“gateway model”.




                                                                                                 19
3 Attracting Flying Geese: The Gateway Model
At the BRICS Summit in New Delhi in March 2012, President Jacob Zuma referred to South Africa as the
“gateway into the [African] continent”. It spearheaded Africa’s economic integration and “provide[d]
guidance on African economic development opportunities” for overseas companies, Zuma said (Mail &
Guardian, 2012). Hence, the gateway affords MNCs from outside the region enhanced access to
regional markets. Since African markets, including some in Southern Africa, are growing rapidly in
relation to other parts of the world, outside Asia, this is an attractive proposition. Thus, for SACU, the
gateway model suggests that even if the immediate region is idea for GVC-oriented production, the
region may still integrate with global value chains as the host of “command-control” and facilitating
(services) functions of global supply networks.

3.1 What is a gateway?
Gateways are hinges between the regional and the global level. They open their hinterland to external
influences – goods, services, people, and ideas – and possess a nodal function. Regional clustering
occurs around them. The American geographer Saul Cohen (1982, 1991), who coined the term
“gateway”, argues that gateways have to be analysed by their success in achieving “nodality”. Links to
extra-regional partners are crucial for nodality; so is regional connectivity. In other words, the notion of
South Africa being a gateway complements the flying geese model because it plugs RVCs into GVCs, or
at least has the potential to do so. Key components of a gateway are hence transport infrastructure and
advanced producer services, such as banking and consultancy, which enables MNCs to coordinate their
businesses.

Krugman (1991a, 1991b; Krugman & Venables, 1992) argues that location, i.e. proximity, matters for
international trade and that regional economic processes tend to favour polarisation, for example
between a gateway and its periphery, because of economies of scale and associated agglomeration. The
World Development Report 2009 confirms this hypothesis: location and “economic distance”, meaning
distance measured in cost and time of transport, matter. Trade intensity and proximity correlate (World
Bank, 2009) – at least for most of South Africa’s neighbours. Distance as an obstacle to trade may be
reinforced by “division”, i.e. tariff and non-tariff barriers. With regard to the special role of gateways,
the World Bank (2009) introduces the term “leading area” and calls for clustering around strong
markets such as South Africa. Leading areas are marked by “density”, meaning the concentration of
economic activities. Density accounts for agglomeration advantages and economies of scale. Hence, it
exerts a self-enforcing effect on economic dynamics.

Gateways matter so much to peripheral places because they enable the latter to connect to global
markets via GVCs. Furthermore, through trade and FDI spillovers peripheral places will be incorporated
into RVCs, even if initially at the lower end of the scale. FDI in the lower stages leads to knowledge
spillovers via demonstration effects, vertical linkages, staff turnover, and competitive pressures,
allowing firms integrated into MNCs value chains the possibility to upgrade. Similarly, imports of
relatively advanced machinery and intermediate goods via MNC networks promote knowledge transfers
over time (World Bank, 2011a). In addition, competition via imports and FDI promotes productivity
increases. Since knowledge is the key to participation in value chains, and productivity is key to long
term growth and development, these effects are crucial to long term success.




                                                                                                     20
3.2 The policy environment underlying gateways
Translating density, distance and division into policy advice, politicians in the gateway (in our case South
Africa) and in the target countries (BLNS) should facilitate economic density by reducing distance and
division. This way, key industries will concentrate in some places. Dealing with distance and division is a
multi-scalar task: On the urban scale, people who want to do business in a gateway/gateway city should
not be prevented from doing so by obstacles such as crime and inadequate public services. On the
national scale, there is a need for legislation that eases cross-border business, for example visa
regulations. In addition, remedies of institutional weaknesses such as corruption, lack of property rights
and the like may harness the gateway function. Mostly on the regional scale, tariff and non-tariff
barriers to flows of goods and services have to be reduced because they hamper the interaction
between the gateway and its periphery. Hence, free trade areas encompassing goods and services
ought to be a key policy goal; so should adequate transport infrastructure (airports, ports, railway lines
and roads) as well as efficient border stops/customs controls. On the international scale, the gateway
has to be connected well to the cores of the global economy, most importantly by direct flights and
shipping lanes.

This advice boils down to factor mobility. If factors of production are mobile, they will concentrate,
generate economies of scale and (at a later point of time) account for economic impulses that are
beneficial to the periphery. There is one restriction to this statement though: Migration of unskilled
labour should occur for economic motivations and not in search of public services. The same condition
applies to the spatial concentration of economic activities. For this reason, institutions – in the broadest
sense – ideally have to be “spatially blind”, meaning that they apply equally to an entire state or
regional community. If politicians increase the attractiveness of a specific place by providing incentives
to capital and labour that are not available elsewhere, the developmental outcomes will be of doubtful
sustainability or even outright counterproductive.

Having said this, it may well be advisable to set up SEZs when it is politically not feasible to liberalise
certain markets because of vested interests. If the SEZ takes off, political pressure may evolve in other
regions or the whole country to reform the respective policy. Another reason for special treatment of
regions or sectors may lie in the lack of knowledge about the correct scope and scale of regulations. In
this case, the SEZs can be treated as elements of trial and error. Thus, policy competition within the
same country or region can be created. It must, however, be made sure that this yardstick competition
leads to a final adoption of the most adequate regulation for all. In other words, the application of
different regulations must be planned as a temporary phenomenon.

Another challenge to policies that boost a gateway is that many of them must be coordinated amongst
all regional states, including not only national but also provincial and municipal governments. Economic
activities concentrate in a gateway and trigger growth impulses for the periphery. Yet, there is a time
lag between the concentration of economic activities in the gateway, which partly happens at the
expense of the economic development of the periphery.

Moreover, if lagging and leading places are brought together in value chains, those that take a
subordinate role in the value chain will experience fewer benefits, initially, than those that take a
superior role. This is evidently a political challenge, in particular for the periphery that benefits later and
less than the gateway.




                                                                                                        21
Offsetting these political and economic challenges is the fact that over time agglomeration forces will
compel dispersion of economic activity into the peripheral region, once the cost structure in the leading
area rises beyond an optimal level. This is analogous to the flying geese pattern, which originated in
rising Japanese domestic costs and propelled Japanese MNCs into their region. There is evidence of
such forces being in play in Southern Africa, as we briefly indicate below.

So notwithstanding the challenges, South Africa’s gateway role is essential for its neighbourhood.
Southern Africa has a tremendous opportunity to transform its resource wealth and the present
resource boom into economic development. In order to integrate the resources, which are located in
the Southern African periphery, into GVCs, the region needs a gateway that provides and manages
transport infrastructure and can coordinate the management of value chains, as we show in the
following sub-sections. The realisation of value addition within the region instead of merely exporting
unprocessed goods depends largely on South Africa’s globally competitive and technologically
sophisticated enterprises; foreign MNCs; and regional policy approaches (more on this in Chapter 4).

3.3 South Africa as the Southern African Gateway
South Africa fulfils the gateway notion in two ways: i) through a connective transport and
telecommunications infrastructure; and ii) through a facilitative business environment, supported by a
wide range of key services. These are widely identified in the literature as crucial for participation in
global value chains (see inter alia the AfDB, the OECD and the UNDP (2014)). In sub-sections 3.3.1 to
3.3.3, we show that:

   Southern Africa, especially the members of SACU, depends on South African harbours in order to
    connect to world markets, particularly Durban and Richards Bay. By African standards, the broader
    Southern African region is connected very well to South Africa by railway lines and road corridors.
    The North–South Corridor is crucial for the overseas trade of landlocked countries (Botswana,
    Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe). South Africa’s strength in physical
    infrastructure is reinforced by a sophisticated business environment for the logistics sector.
    Regarding air transport, even the entire sub-Saharan region is tied to South Africa’s major airport,
    O. R. Tambo in Johannesburg, which interlinks regional and global flights.

   South Africa’s two global cities, Cape Town and Johannesburg, are the key locations for overseas
    companies that establish regional headquarters in order to coordinate their sub-Saharan African
    business. The reason for this is excellent corporate services available in Cape Town and
    Johannesburg. Durban is the principal logistics gateway for container shipping, centred on its port,
    although it largely fails to attract headquarters investments.

   South Africa also plays a critical role as a regional services hub, supporting a range of productive
    activities throughout the region. For example, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is a conduit
    for financial flows from the rest of the world to the entire African continent. Private banks and
    telecommunication companies provide excellent African networks. The Development Bank of
    Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) are by far the most liquid
    regional providers of credits for economic projects.

Indeed, South Africa already operates as the trade gateway for the region, at least for Southern Africa.

regional hub, in much the same way that Brazil does for South America, Russia does for the Baltics and
Central Asia, and Australia does for the Pacific region.

Note: Note: Larger bilateral trade flows are portrayed by closer distances between nodes. Hubs, which represent the main
trading partner for several countries, are drawn in darker colours and bigger shapes. Peripheral countries are represented in
lighter colours

Nevertheless, there are some pitfalls ahead: South Africa, which is located at the southern edge of the
African continent and at great distance to the cores of the global economy, is not the only possible
gateway to Southern Africa. South Africa implements a range of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
Domestically, there is a severe lack of skilled labour. Visa and work permits for foreigners are not easy
to obtain. In addition to this, the South African government does not appear to have a coherent
gateway strategy. Some of its policies and the general political climate in South Africa work against the
country’s gateway status. We address these problems in Section 3.4.

3.3.1 South Africa as a Transport Hub
During the colonial era, there were numerous small gateways in Southern Africa. The British, German
and Portuguese conquests started at harbours, usually bays that offered protection from ocean
currents and storms or at least places that allowed unloading of goods. In the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, the colonial powers built railway lines to the ports in order to export crops and mining
products from the hinterland. These railway lines also reinforced their territorial control. Accessing the
interior of Southern Africa soon became much easier, although the Great Escarpment, a region that
features tremendous changes in elevation, sharply separates the narrow coastal strip from plateaux at
an altitude of about 1,000 metres. However, the transport infrastructures built by the colonial powers
were not meant to integrate the different parts of their colonies. They rather fragmented them,
individually linking several corridors to Europe via their respective gateways. For example, railway lines
and road corridors from the colonial era connect harbours in Angola (Lobito, Luanda and Namibe), the
two Congos (Matadi and Pointe Noire), Mozambique (Beira, Maputo and Nacala), Namibia (Lüderitz and



                                                                                                                     23
Walvis Bay) and Tanzania (Dar es Salaam, Mtwara) to the nearby hinterland. Only the Coast2Coast
Corridor from Maputo to Johannesburg to Walvis Bay and the North–South Corridor from Durban via
Johannesburg, Harare and Lusaka to Lubumbashi bind the regional countries together, and in both
cases reinforce South Africa’s gateway role. Furthermore, the quality of regional infrastructure is poor.

Roads tend to be filled with potholes. Sometimes they are untarred, for example about half the way
from Mozambique’s port of Nacala to Blantyre in Malawi. Railway tracks date back to the colonial era.
In central Mozambique, trains that transport coal from Tete Province to Nacala go as slowly as 20
kilometres per hour on average (Scholvin & Plagemann, 2014). In the worst cases, tracks are overgrown
by vegetation, for instance between Kolwezi in the DR Congo and the Angolan border (Senior officials of
the DBSA, 2011). All this highlights the crucial role of South African infrastructure (Box 3).

Box 3: The Crucial Role of South Africa’s Ports
Within this regional transport network, South Africa’s ports play a critical role. First, they are relatively well
interconnected by the two just-mentioned corridors. A study by the World Bank indicates that 59% of the
roads between Lubumbashi and Durban, which are completely tarred, are in good condition, meaning that
there is no immediate need for maintenance work. As a comparison, the same study rates 72% of the roads
from Harare to Beira as in fair condition, with the remaining 28% not rated (Ranganathan & Foster, 2011).
Moreover, because of much higher port capacities, which account for economies of scale, advanced
equipment/technologies and more efficient management available there, the bulk of the overseas trade of
South Africa’s direct neighbours, Malawi and Zambia passes through Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and
Richards Bay. Map 1 shows major harbours in East and Southern Africa as well as their connections to the
interior of the region. It also indicates the volume of goods handled at each harbour, demonstrating South
Africa’s dominance.

The advantages of South Africa’s ports that result from equipment/technology and management are
exemplified by container dwell time, which is four days on average in Durban. Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and
Namibia’s port of Walvis Bay reach slightly higher values with six to eight days. The corresponding figures for
Beira, Luanda and Maputo are 20, 22 and 12 days respectively (AICD, 2011). The port of Dar es Salaam,


                                                                                                           24
which constitutes the main alternative gateway for the Congolese–Zambian Copperbelt, is congested and
hence suffers from enormous delays. A World Bank study that concentrates on the foreign trade of the
landlocked regional countries shows that delays at Dar es Salaam make Durban the faster option for
Zambia’s exports and imports. Dar es Salaam has, however, an advantage in terms of costs for rail transport
– not necessarily time – because of being physically closer to Zambia. The advantages of Durban are even
clearer in comparison to Beira, which is the seemingly natural gateway for Zimbabwe and played this role
prior to the Mozambican civil war (Ranganathan & Foster, 2011). Hence, South African ports do particularly
well for transhipments, linking the harbours of the regional countries to extra-regional trading partners.
South Africa’s ports serve as hubs insofar as large container vessels from overseas are sent there, mostly
carrying goods destined for the South African market. A few goods are then reloaded onto smaller vessels
that go to ports nearby in order to service small local markets. Furthermore, port congestion boosts South
Africa’s role in transhipments: South Africa’s transport company Transnet is entering into port-pairing
arrangements, most notably with Luanda. These set in where the smaller non-South African ports do not
have the capacity to handle incoming cargo, meaning they redirect such cargo to South Africa either via
mooted regional feeder lines or land transport (Senior official of the DPE, 2012). Adding another example,
United Africa Feeder Line (UAFL), a regional shipping company, links the Mozambican ports of Beira,
Maputo, Pemba and Nacala to Durban, offering MNCs, in particular those from the mining sector, an
alternative to road transport.

Related to this, the high level of economic development in South Africa has brought about an
environment that facilitates business activities, including transport. The World Bank’s Logistics
Performance Index (LPI), as shown in Table 3, reveals that South Africa offers better conditions for
transport than other regional countries.

By global comparison South Africa belongs to the first tier of countries, on the same level as New
Zealand, South Korea and Turkey. Its neighbouring countries belong to the third and fourth tiers, which
are almost exclusive to the world’s least-developed countries.

It is unlikely that South Africa’s dominance for the transport of goods in large quantities will cease in the
near future. A major reason for this is that the development of corridors that bypass South Africa,
especially regarding transport by rail, is hardly economically feasible because of the low quantity of
transported goods (TradeMark Southern Africa, 2012). China’s massive investment in transport
infrastructure does not appear to constitute a challenge yet because of insufficient quality: Angolans
speak of “disposable roads” built by Chinese construction firms as they wash away after one rainy
season (Scholvin & Strüver, 2013).



                                                                                                      25
Even where overseas companies seek to export tremendous amounts of goods, as coal mines do in
central Mozambique, alternative gateways will probably remain limited to the sub-national scale and
niches: a coal terminal handles bulk goods and does not help much for containers. Presently, alternative
gateways within the region face the obstacle of insufficient port infrastructure. Corridors to the
hinterland require intense rehabilitation. The Tanzania–Zambia Railway (TAZARA), the main project to
bypass South Africa during the apartheid era, is hampered by the unfavourable geography of the East
African Rift Valley: in addition to high elevations, mudslides frequently block the track. Tanzania
Railways Ltd operates at 50 per cent of its capacity and TAZARA is indebted (Hirschler & Hofmeier,
2010). South Africa’s rail company Transnet contrariwise maintains the highest level of productivity of
any railway in sub-Saharan Africa, and is in the early stages of a massive capacity expansion.

South Africa’s outstanding connectivity in terms of maritime transport is revealed by the Liner Shipping
Connectivity Index (LSCI) which measures, using various variables, how well the ports of a country are
connected internationally on a scale of 0 to 100. As Table 3 shows, South Africa’s ports are much better
connected to global markets than those of any other country in East and Southern Africa.

Yet, there is more to transport infrastructure than railway lines, roads and harbours, especially when
thinking about gateways. An overseas company that seeks to invest somewhere in South Africa’s
periphery or has to manage an investment project there, needs to send in its managers from time to
time. New business contacts usually require face-to-face interaction. Hence, the question of how
individuals from the cores of the global economy can reach the periphery matters.

Data compiled by Draper and Scholvin (2012) on flight connections from O.R. Tambo, which is South
Africa’s main international airport, reveals that this air hub (Box 4) not only interlinks South Africa
globally (see Error! Reference source not found.). O.R. Tambo also provides excellent regional flight
onnections (see Error! Reference source not found.).

Box 3: O.R. Tambo as a Central Air Hub
Practically every economically relevant city in the SACU region can be reached directly from Johannesburg
several times a day, and even smaller towns — in particular in Mozambique — are well connected to
Johannesburg. And while flight connections become thinner beyond Southern Africa. O. R. Tambo offers
direct flights to major cities in sub-Saharan Africa at least once per day. Airports there provide links to towns
nearby. North of the Sahara, only Cairo can be reached directly. Beyond Africa, the old and new cores of the
global economy are well connected to Johannesburg, with a clear dominance of flights from Europe.

South Africa’s excellent flight connections also matter for moving goods; albeit less bulky ones than those
usually transported by rail and road – gold, platinum or even vegetables as opposed to coal. Dettmer,
Freytag and Draper (2014) show that South Africa exports a much larger share of products with high air
cargo relevance to Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe than to industrialised countries. Hence, air cargo
transport appears to be a valuable option to overcome trade barriers associated with land transport,
including corruption at border stations (more on this in section 3.5). This reinforces South Africa’s gateway
role insofar as airports in neighbouring countries are even less connected with non-African places than ports.

As these considerations suggest, linking with South Africa eases overseas trade for Southern African,
and particularly SACU, countries. While Namibia has its own access to the sea via the port of Walvis Bay,
Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland are landlocked. This adds significantly to their trade costs, but those
costs would be much higher if they had to rely on the infrastructure and organizational capacities of
other countries in the region. For example, fully exploiting Botswana’s coal resources is currently
limited by the fact that the landlocked country does not possess a sufficient rail link from its coalfields
to a nearby port. Linking Botswana’s coalfields to those of South Africa, which are already connected by
rail to Richards Bay, would significantly increase development opportunities for Botswana (Scholvin,
2014).

3.3.2 South Africa’s Global Cities
Even if overseas companies decide to use transport infrastructure in South Africa’s neighbourhood,
seemingly bypassing the South African gateway – such as the Brazilian mining giant Vale did in central
Mozambique – South Africa will remain crucial for them. The business environment that South Africa’s
global cities provide is the reason for this. Vale does not coordinate its Mozambican business from an
office in Beira or Maputo. Its executives work in Gauteng, South Africa. In other words, being linked to




                                                                                                    27
the South African gateway is beneficial for the regional countries insofar as South Africa makes them
accessible for transnational companies.

There are various components of what appears to be a regional headquarters function. Johannesburg
and surrounding Gauteng is the largest urban economy in sub-Saharan Africa. It is the centre of
sophisticated services networks, which underpin a range of economic activities increasingly centred on
regional markets.

Network services, comprising communications, finance and transport; arguably constitute the backbone
of Johannesburg’s competitive proposition. They are readily available at relatively reasonable cost
compared with other sub-Saharan countries. Energy supply is secure, at least by African standards.
These location advantages also apply to Cape Town; albeit it plays a secondary role compared to
Johannesburg and has to specialise in niche sectors such as oil and gas. Similarly Durban has access to
these inputs, although its role as a headquarters economy has been limited to date.

Over time, this sophisticated economic structure of Cape Town and Johannesburg has been
supplemented by agglomerations of other services that enable the complex business processes
required to run modern economies and associated MNC networks. Those related services encompass a
wide range of activities, from professional services such as legal and accounting, through consulting, the
education services provided by South Africa’s relatively sophisticated business schools and well-
endowed universities, the widespread availability of various news and analytical services through
numerous and growing channels, to the vibrant free press that underpins these. Such knowledge
services are critical to head office functions, enabling knowledge accumulation at the centre in order to
better manage subordinate activities in satellite countries (Draper & Scholvin, 2012).

These factors must at least partly explain why office space provision has grown rapidly in Johannesburg,
with a range of foreign companies setting up offices there since the end of apartheid. It is difficult to
establish empirically the extent to which those foreign operations represent regional headquarters
coordinating a network of regional activities, as opposed to operations based in South Africa and
targeting the local market. Nonetheless, Parnreiter et al. (2013) calculate that non-South African
companies comprise 39 per cent of the headquarters of 181 large companies located in the
metropolitan area of Johannesburg. In Midrand, they are even dominant with a share of 53 per cent.

Moreover, soft factors reinforce South Africa’s attractiveness to foreigners. The country offers a
Western style and standard of living, or what one commercial diplomat called the “golf course effect”,
whereas other sub-Saharan destinations such as Angola or Nigeria are regarded as “hardship posts”
(Commercial attachés of the British, Japanese and US embassies in Pretoria, 2012). Some interviewees
from Cape Town even suggested that overseas managers “fight in the boardroom” for the opportunity
to supervise a project there because of the city and its surroundings being a highly attractive tourist
destination with a Mediterranean climate. They also pointed out that the attractiveness of Cape Town
has a strong monetary expression: well-paid managers from overseas are willing to go to the office of
their company in Cape Town, working for the salary they used to earn in their home country. In order to
get managers to other places in Africa, multinational companies have to offer them considerably higher
salaries (Managers of a maritime supply company, 2014).




                                                                                                   28
Cape Town and Johannesburg should not only be seen as entry points for companies and managers
from overseas. The sophisticated business environment and excellent producer services they offer are
essential for companies from the regional periphery seeking to plug into global value chains. What is
more, the region’s highly skilled labour force is, at least partly, formed in Cape Town and Johannesburg,
as the large number of SACU and SADC (Southern African Development Community) students at South
African universities demonstrates. Related to this, businesspeople and politicians from the region seek
consultancy advice in South Africa, simply because cities like Lusaka and Windhoek do not possess a
strong knowledge economy. If economic development in Southern Africa is to be based on skilled
entrepreneurs who have access to advanced producer services that allow them to grow their
businesses and globally interlink them, the South African gateway will be a condicio sine qua non.

3.3.3 South Africa as a Services Hub
Although South Africa possesses the strongest manufacturing sector in Africa, its gateway role rests
more on producer services such as consultancy and finance. One should not underestimate the
relevance of producer services as they make the manufacturing sector more competitive. OECD/WTO
data shows that the value created directly and indirectly by services as intermediate inputs represents
more than 30% of the total value added in manufactured goods. Countries that have open and
competitive services markets tend to be more competitive in manufacturing (AfDB et al., 2014).
Producer services also tend to be marked by a high local/regional component: research on Latin
America indicates that around four-fifths of the service component of manufacturing exports consists of
domestic value added (OECD et al., 2013).

The recent acquisitions of Massmart Holdings by Walmart, of Absa Bank by Barclays Bank PLC and
Vodacom by Vodafone in the retail, financial services, and telecommunication sectors respectively,
indicate that South African MNCs have built African networks that are of strategic interest to global
MNCs. By purchasing South African enterprises and their regional networks, companies from overseas
use South Africa as a gateway.

Given the relatively large size and sophistication of South Africa’s financial sector and the liquidity of its
financial markets, especially the JSE, intuitively the proposition that South Africa channels financial
transactions from overseas to Africa makes sense. Relative to its African peers the JSE is the giant, with
an average day’s trade being more than the annual trade of Mauritius and Nigeria put together. The
single listing of Telkom SA at USD 11 billion roughly equals the total capitalisation of the Nairobi Stock
Exchange. Total assets of deposit-taking banks and of financial intermediaries in South Africa are
significantly larger than the combined value of assets in the other SACU members. In terms of
institutional investment, South Africa is similarly predominant with about 80% of the total pension
assets of sub-Saharan Africa (Irving & Manroth, 2009).

By contrast, South Africa’s fellow SACU members are marked by relatively shallow financial secto rs with
low ratios of deposits to gross domestic product, embryonic capital markets with limited competition
and a deficiency of long-term finance. Their regulatory frameworks and market support institutions are
in most cases still under development. Financial skills are limited. The assessment of credit access for
enterprises in the World Bank’s (2014b) Doing Business Report, demonstrates these differences within
SACU. While South Africa compares globally on access to credit (ranked 28th in 2014) the BLNS countries
ranked 73rd, 159th, (joint) 55th, and (joint) 55th respectively.




                                                                                                       29
Foreign investors can theoretically use South African financial markets for at least two purposes from
the gateway perspective: to invest in South African companies, in other words portfolio investment, in
order to access an African growth story by leveraging South African corporate networks; or to raise
finance in South Africa directly for their own African operations. As far as the JSE is concerned the first
proposition dominates and in that sense South Africa, the JSE specifically, is an African gateway, but the
sources of funds are primarily portfolio in nature. Senior officials of the JSE (2012) do not see the
second proposition as having much traction with respect to MNCs moving into the region. MNCs tend
to have their own sources of finance, and South African exchange control regulations make the exercise
difficult. The JSE is also exploring how best to link African commodity markets to South African and
potentially global buyers (Draper & Scholvin, 2012).

What is more, South Africa has a number of long term development finance institutions – in particular
the IDC, which finances industrial development projects largely in South Africa but also continent-wide,
and the DBSA, which funds infrastructure projects in the SADC area. These two institutions co-finance
with both the private and public sector, including FDI. They provide advice and skills transfer to African
partners in areas such as due diligence, risk management and governance. They also contribute to the
development of the financial sector through risk reduction mechanisms such as guarantees, provision of
credit lines to, and co-financing with, other financial institutions.

All this means that being tied to the South African financial sector enables SACU countries to generate
investment capital. The relevance of these links is exemplified by large-scale energy projects. Not only
does South Africa’s power utility Eskom often guarantee to purchase a certain amount of electricity
from yet-to-be built power stations in neighbouring countries, which makes their construction possible
in spite of tiny domestic markets, but loans for these projects are usually provided by the
aforementioned financial institutions or at least channelled through them (Maupin, 2015).

In terms of lending and investment, the IDC and the DBSA are by far the largest regional development
finance institutions, with capacity to co-finance larger scale industry and infrastructure investment. The
IDC (2013) is currently sustaining an average financing level of approximately ZAR 13 billion, largely for
minerals, energy and industrial projects. The DBSA (2014) is operating at a current level of ZAR 8.0 to
9.0 billion per annum, of which 40 to 50% is for projects outside South Africa. According to available
annual reports, the DBSA’s exposure in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland amounts to
approximately 20% of its loan portfolio outside South Africa; a significant proportion4.

3.4 How Could SACU Countries Benefit From The South African Gateway?
The BLNS countries already benefit from South Africa’s gateway status through the access afforded to
superior transport infrastructure and services; global cities that offer conduits to and from the
developed world and beyond; and access to sophisticated producer services that support their own
economic development processes. If South Africa, particularly its global cities, reinforces its gateway
role, intensified FDI into South Africa and associated investment flows into the region, will result. In
other words, a functioning South African gateway can be expected to deepen investment in the region
and, provided that certain tariff and non-tariff barriers are eased (see Section 4), also the regional
division of labour intensive manufacturing. Beyond this, spillovers from the services support functions

    We were unable to establish comparable figures for the IDC


                                                                                                    30
of the gateway, including headquarter and back office activities along with facilitating business services
and logistics may well spill over to proximate parts of the region endowed with human capital and
quality infrastructure (e.g. Gaborone, given its location vis-à-vis Gauteng).

Along with FDI come knowledge transfers, or at least the potential for knowledge transfers since the
nature and extent of such transfers depends, crucially, on the absorptive capacities of the host state.
Those capacities are generally weak in the BLNS countries, with skills shortages in particular occupying
the dubious position of primary bottleneck (World Bank, 2011a, pp. 117 - 118). Assuming those
absorptive capacities can be enhanced, then the BLNS countries could be well-placed to leverage off the
South African gateway by plugging into RVCs and GVCs, in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, and
over time upgrading within them. That should create a virtuous growth spiral which contributes
substantially to addressing the major development challenges the region faces, in particular high
unemployment levels amongst youths.

3.5 Emerging Challenges to the South African Gateway Strategy
Despite the highly favourable conditions analysed above, South Africa’s gateway role is hampered in
several ways. First, some MNCs have decided to run their African business from their global
headquarters considering the relatively small size of African or SACU markets. They connect directly
with the periphery and do not use a gateway; at least not as a location for a regional headquarters. This
appears to be the case for some European enterprises which benefit from the historically developed
African networks available in London and Paris, in particular. Enterprises from the Far East and North
America contrariwise depend more on an office located in Africa; also because of being in a different
time zone, which considerably reduces the overlap of business hours.

Second, some offshore locations have arisen as rivals to South Africa. Dubai offers an excellent business
environment, including a globally interlinked airport with direct flights to many African destinations and
a financial hub with its own set of attractions all subject to English law. Mauritius, which sees itself as
the hinge between Africa and Asia, benefits from its extensive double tax agreement treaty network
and favourable corporate tax treatment. South Africa, by contrast, imposes relatively high restrictions
on inward investment. For example, cross-border acquisitions of local entities financed wholly or in part
by the exchange of shares in the foreign company, or mergers that create domestic shareholdings in a
new merged foreign entity, fall under exchange control approval processes. Related to these controls
on the externalisation of South African assets, the re-domiciling of South African companies is subject to
approval from the minister of finance.

Third, South Africa faces considerable geographical obstacles: Being located at the southern edge of the
African continent, South Africa does not lie between African countries and extra-regional trading
partners – which would boost its role as a gateway – but rather outside of these main geographic
currents. Even as a node for RVCs South Africa’s location is unfavourable because it lacks centrality, or is
distant from the cores of the global economy and most African countries (World Bank, 2009). For the
BLNS countries in SACU such considerations clearly matter less, given their physical proximity to South
Africa.

Fourth, borders in Africa, which fall into the World Development Report’s category of “division”,
massively hamper trade between the SACU region and Southern Africa. For example, while Botswana
and Namibia possess one-stop border posts that take 20 minutes for lorries, transport from Windhoek



                                                                                                     31
to Lubango in southern Angola can take up to 15 days because of border controls, involving corruption,
and insufficient roads in Angola (Advisor of the Namibian Agricultural Trade Forum, 2010). Similarly, a
recent World Bank report indicates that delays at Beitbridge on the border of South Africa and
Zimbabwe were on average 34 hours for traffic northwards and eleven hours for traffic southwards,
while at Chirundu on Zimbabwe’s border with Zambia, lorries waited another 39 hours if they went
north and eleven hours if southbound. Goods transported along the entire North–South Corridor spent
about one third of their total transport time waiting at borders (Curtis, 2009). Taken together, delays at
Beitbridge and Chirundu equalled a 25% surcharge on transport costs (Teravaninthorn & Raballand,
2008). While matters have improved recently, significant progress has not materialised mostly owing to
bureaucratic obstacles and problems in applying technologically sophisticated procedures at borders
(OECD & WTO, 2012).

Beyond transport, tariff and other non-tariff barriers are serious obstacles for the South African
gateway too. Even within SACU, quality standards are applied arbitrarily, constituting a tool of market
protectionism. The BLNS countries in SACU regularly invoke the 2002 agreement’s “infant industry”
clause to erect internal trade barriers to other SACU states (but principally South Africa’s) exports.
Furthermore, the BLNS countries impose a wide variety of import bans on agricultural and agro-
processed goods from South Africa. For its part South African customs officials reportedly regularly
interdict goods moving across the BLNS countries borders into South Africa (World Bank, 2011b).
Beyond SACU, two member countries of SADC are effectively not part of the free trade area that this
organisation officially forms (Senior officials of the DTI, 2013). These officials regard the Tripartite-Free
Trade Area (TFTA), which may be formed by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the East African Community (EAC) and the SADC, as a means to deal with ongoing trade
facilitation challenges and thus boost economic growth through a larger regional market and regional
commodity chains.

Fifth, South Africa has to address considerable domestic challenges in order to maintain or even expand
its gateway role. The first is the lack of skilled labour. The recent “National Skills Development Strategy”
stresses the inadequate skill levels and poor work readiness of people leaving secondary and tertiary
education. It points to the inadequate link between institutional and workplace learning.

Synergies between universities, Further Education and Training (FET) colleges5 and government training
centres are poor. The country’s progression towards intermediate and higher skills required for growth
sectors in a knowledge economy is considered insufficient (Department of Higher Education and
Training of South Africa, 2012). It is, therefore, not surprising that South Africa suffers from vacancies in
the professional and technical fields as well as in accounting and other business-related professions. In
spite of this, South Africa’s immigration and work permit acquisition procedures remain challenging for
foreigners, and a source of constant complaint from foreign companies. Regulations apparently fail to
list skills eligible for the newly instituted critical skills work visa. It therefore appears that overseas
missions are presently unable to process “legal” visa applications until they have more clarity (Business
Day, 2014). A similar pattern occurs throughout the SACU region.

The second domestic problem is a combination of the lack of an explicit gateway strategy and
conflicting policies. South Africa does not appear to possess a coherent strategy that would boosts its

training offered in technical colleges, community colleges and private colleges.


                                                                                                          32
gateway role. For example, the National Treasury has apparently been working on a strategy to
promote Johannesburg as the financial gateway to Africa for at least ten years, without sustained
results (Senior official of the DBSA, 2012). South Africa’s huge infrastructure build programme is
targeted primarily at the domestic coal, iron and manganese railway lines and associated port
infrastructure, whereas it appears no one at the Department of Transport or at Transnet is currently
thinking systematically about the gateway vision. Rather, the domestic infrastructure programme is
primarily about poverty reduction (Former advisor to the Minister for Public Enterprises, 2012; Senior
official of the DBSA, 2012).

What is more, an explicit gateway strategy could throw up some surprises in terms of existing
government approaches to the role of transport state-owned enterprises. For example, South African
Airways appears to exercise a hold over the Department of Transport’s allocation of flight licences,
which it allegedly uses to minimise competition (Senior official of Wesgro, 2014). A gateway strategy
might, however, require an expressly liberal approach in order to maximise passenger and cargo
movements through O.R. Tambo and other airports. In other words, because of vested interests and a
different vision for economic policy, Cape Town (and, by extension also Durban) seemingly faces
significant difficulties to increase its global connectivity by air.

Conflicting policies go much further and have a serious, negative impact on South Africa’s political
climate. The recently re-elected African National Congress (ANC) government is under great pressure to
enact socially transformative economic policies, especially regarding ownership of agricultural land and
mines. Such policies could be incompatible with South Africa’s role as a gateway because they come
along with the possibility of nationalisation in other economic sectors or at least strong governmental
interference.

For example, the draft “Protection and Promotion of Investment Bill”, which would remove national
treatment for MNCs wishing to invest into South Africa and make it subject to a prior screening test,
also pushes in this direction and is the subject of much discussion in diplomatic circles and their
associated business interests. The bill also seeks to redefine expropriation in order to subject it much
more firmly to “public interest” considerations (South African Institute for International Affairs, 2014).

Notwithstanding these various challenges to the gateway strategy, we still think it is an eminently
suitable approach for South Africa and its SACU neighbours; one that accords with obvious economic
and geographic realities. Crucially for our argument, it also fits, broadly, with the flying geese pattern.
So where do both fit within the regional policy debate, and in relation to other options? We turn to this
next.




                                                                                                    33
4 South Africa, SACU, and the RVC/GVC Policy Debate
We argued above that attracting flying MNC geese requires a liberal trade and investment policy
orientation, and that this is consistent with a gateway strategy since conduits for value chains need to
minimise bottlenecks. However, South Africa and to some degree the wider SACU region, seems to be
pursuing a different strategy, in which GVCs appear to be regarded as somewhat threatening to
domestic and regional industrial capacity. South Africa’s policy is particularly important given its
gateway role. Its priority appears to be coordinating regional economic policies and setting up RVCs in
the industrial sector (Draper & Scholvin, 2012). This could be construed as wishing to extend import
substitution into the region. Furthermore, the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) approach to
regional economic integration, labelled “developmental regionalism”, is not primarily about tariff
barriers. It rather concentrates on economic policy coordination in order to set up RVCs (preferably in
the industrial sector). This perspective is strongly influenced by the DTI’s thinking on industrial strategy
at the domestic level which draws heavily on the “developmental states” explanation for East Asian
success (see Section 2.1.4), rather than the “flying geese” approach. In the developmental state
approach, both domestically but also at the regional level, manufacturing is emphasised but services
are minimised. This minimises the comparative advantages that the gateway model confers on South
Africa, and on the region.

In this light we next identify two visions for regional integration emerging from intra-SACU debates and
our elaboration of the “flying geese” pattern and “gateway” model. The first is anchored in import
substitution at the regional, but also national, level, and seeks to build on comparative advantage in
resource extraction to promote upgrading through beneficiation. This can be thought of as a coercive or
perhaps “developmental” policy approach, since it seeks to compel upgrading through the use of
(primarily) negative incentives. The import replacement strategy works with restrictions in order to
strengthen RVCs. The output of RVCs is then supposed to be sold both within the region and globally.
We offer a short critique of this approach with application to SACU, and the BLNS. The second approach
links RVCs to GVCs via MNCs. It can be considered a facilitative approach that works with and not
against MNCs, by offering incentives/support to MNCs so that they plug partners from SACU into their
GVCs. Hence these MNCs tie RVCs into GVCs. Thus, the liberal strategy seeks to respond to MNC
concerns rather than to compel outcomes; an approach we believe offers better prospects for success.

4.1 A Developmental Approach? Import Replacement and Beneficiation
Central to the import replacement approach is the claim that MNCs capture most of the gains from
GVCs, and flowing from this more value addition in higher stages of production needs to take place in
the region/country concerned. In this perspective the primary policy objective is either to oblige MNCs
to invest in value chain upgrading in the country or region, or to minimise competition from them so as
to favour domestic firms’ upgrading strategies. A mix of these objectives is also conceivable.

In SACU the RVC dimension could be characterised by South African companies, since they have the
corporate capabilities, sourcing inputs from their neighbours for fabrication and export initially into
regional markets; or relocating the less skill-intensive parts of their value chains into SACU neighbours.
Given the prominence of global MNCs in the South African marketplace, and in many cases their
regional orientation linking increasingly to the “Africa rising” proposition, it is to be expected that MNCs
in certain industries would play similar roles to South African companies in SACU. By virtue of being
MNCs many have global sourcing and production strategies and therefore would approach the regional



                                                                                                     34
proposition differently to their South African counterparts. Either way, the BLNS countries would need
to plug into these South Africa-centric or MNC-centric value chains by providing resources or, where
possible, niche components. For example, such an approach could be attempted in the clothing and
textiles sector, with South Africa providing capital-intensive textiles to labour-intensive clothing
factories in Lesotho, using cotton grown in Swaziland. Another theoretical example could be for
Namibia and Botswana to build tannery capacity, leveraging off their respective substantial cattle herds,
to provide hides for the South African automotive leather industry, in turn supplying leather seats to
the MNC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) present in South Africa. Possibilities such as these
are being actively explored in a study for a SACU member states’ task team on a potential SACU
industrial policy currently underway.6

4.1.1 Import replacement and beneficiation
The import replacement perspective manifests in “temporary” import protection in order to give
domestic and regional companies the space to acquire the requisite capacities to expand and grow their
competitiveness. Typical policy instruments include, inter alia: import tariffs or selective use of trade
defence instruments such as anti-dumping duties or safeguards; preferential government procurement
particularly through use of local content provisions; and ownership restrictions designed to favour
domestic ownership. These arrangements could also be extended to the regional level, generally under
the rubric of regional economic communities (RECs). The extent to which they apply across borders
within RECs depends on the degree of institutional integration of the RECs and the RECs’ overall
orientation towards outside investors and imports.

Since SACU is a customs union, not a common market, the primary collective policy instrument
applicable to the member states is the import tariff. In the import substitution model the tariff should
be configured to protect final-stage production, and could allow for sourcing required components to
import. In the first instance this would require agreement amongst the member states on which value
chains to prioritise and how the value chain would be “parcelled out” amongst the members, so to
speak, and corresponding import tariffs reviewed.

As the overall objective is to increase exports, careful thought would have to be given to which
segments of the value chain to protect in order to build domestic/regional capacities, in relation to the
overarching competitiveness of the end product exported from the region.

Beneficiation prioritises adding value to resources. Since resources are at the origin of manufacturing
value chains, this is essentially an upgrading strategy. The strategy also applies to the agricultural
processing sector, for example in the beef/leather value chain. The policy objective is to oblige those
MNCs that rely on imported resource inputs to invest in forward integration in the country/region that
is the origin of the resource in question. Strictly speaking this concerns orientation to GVCs, but in some
cases consideration might be given to sourcing regional inputs as an extension of the broader
beneficiation strategy. So iron ore beneficiation into steel, for example in South Africa, might involve
regional sourcing of inputs, for example coal from Botswana, to support the strategy.

There are several policy instruments that can be used. First, export restrictions, either through taxes or
quantitative measures (quotas or bans). The essential idea is to impose punitive penalties on exports of

the resource in question in order to disincentivize exports and retain the resource for domestic
processing.7 Second, a more extreme, nationalist variant would require that only domestically owned
companies undertake beneficiation, thus bringing investment policy (restrictions) into the equation. So
the government might declare a particular resource to be “strategic”8 and place inward FDI into that
resource on a negative list whereby national treatment for the foreign investor is not automatically
accorded. This would typically require establishment of an inward investment screening agency, so that
potential foreign investors would have to apply to invest in that resource. Then assuming permission
was granted, it would be done on condition that further processing takes place according to agreed
value-added percentages, for example.

4.1.2 Which export markets?
In arriving at decisions on which value chains and segments of those value chains to target,
consideration would also have to be given to the destination market. In some ways the SADC market
can be considered an extension of the SACU market since SACU enjoys preferential access into most
SADC markets by virtue of the SADC FTA. Hence the import substitution model, via a trade diversion
mechanism9, arguably extends into SADC. As renegotiation of the SADC FTA does not look feasible for
the foreseeable future, this would essentially have to take the SADC FTA tariff schedule as given. One
substantial exception is Angola, which does not participate in the SADC FTA yet but as the region’s
second largest economy offers some prospects to exporters. A similar logic would apply to the TFTA
involving SADC, COMESA and the EAC, except that the TFTA is currently under negotiation and may take
some years to conclude given the number of countries involved. Within the TFTA the key target market
for SACU exporters would be the EAC members, especially Kenya which is the largest economy – and
Tanzania already participates in the SADC FTA. Consequently there is a small prospect of more carefully
targeting particular value chain components, depending on whether SACU were able to cohere a
common plan in time. However, the markets concerned are relatively small. Overall, it could
theoretically make sense to target these markets as an extension of the import substitution model since
regional competition levels are relatively low, but the size of the export gains on offer is not compelling,
at least in the short to medium term.

A different proposition is to leverage external markets as envisaged in the Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA) with the EU, or the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) extended by the US;
or markets in Asia such as India and China. Since the markets are large they offer the prospect of
export-oriented industrialization as advocated by Gereffi and Sturgeon (2013), inter alia. However, in
the case of the EU and US while the trade diversion logic pertains by virtue of the preferential access
afforded by these two developed economies to SACU producers, these are arguably the most
competitive and advanced markets on the planet. Furthermore, since producers in developed countries
are at the cutting edge of most value chains, whereas Asian competition hinges on comparative and

competitive advantages not available to the SACU region (as discussed in Section 2.3.1 and Section 4.1.3
below); competing successfully in those markets is a very challenging proposition. So it is unlikely that a
SACU policy approach based on import substitution in key components of RVCs, which necessarily
entails increasing costs and therefore undercutting competitiveness, would be fruitful if targeted at
these markets. This highlights the importance of the RVC/GVC interface, to which we return in section
4.3. Next we briefly apply the policy logics inherent to this approach, as elucidated here, to SACU.

4.1.3 Application to South Africa and the BLNS
For these approaches to work the companies at the centre of them need to be competitive relative to
their global peers. This is partly a function of comparative advantage, and partly a microeconomic issue.

Regarding comparative advantages South Africa’s arguably does not reside in manufacturing, relative to
low cost East Asian producers or high cost but technology-intensive developed world producers. Rather,
overall South African manufacturing appears to be squeezed between the two. This general picture is
subject to some exceptions, since the country does have a base of technologically-sophisticated
manufacturing firms in certain industrial pockets such as manufacture of capital equipment. Figure 4
illustrates clearly the situation in the region. South Africa’s base wages (for low skilled workers) in
manufacturing are far above both regional and international peers. Obviously productivity must also be
considered, and the reality is that output per worker in South Africa also exceeds that of most peers.
But while South Africa’s unit labour costs have improved substantially over the past decade, they still
trail global peers. This has several implications when considering the RVC/GVC model. First, the data
highlights that South Africa’s competitive position in GVCs must be in higher skill intensive and
“command-control” functions. Looking within the region, the opportunity for specialization of low skill,
labour intensive activities in some BLNS countries linked to the South African core.

Figure 4: Minimum wages in manufacturing (2013)




Data Source: World Bank (2014b)

At the same time, Figure 4 shows that wage structures in the region are relatively higher than in Asian
comparators. Moreover, the labour pool is not particularly large, productivity is modest, and skills
shortages are severe and structurally embedded. This will continue to limit the potential for the region
as a whole to compete in many GVCs, particularly bearing in mind the relatively high transport costs the
region faces in reaching global markets.



                                                                                                    37
Indeed South Africa and the region’s comparative advantage in the production of goods arguably lie in
resource-related production, and agriculture in certain cases especially in the wetter Eastern regions. In
the case of resources South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia are particularly well-endowed with a range
of commodities ranging from coal to diamonds to uranium. An export-oriented agricultural sector
would also create jobs in large quantities – something urgently needed in all SACU countries.
Furthermore, as we argued above South Africa has built strong comparative advantages in certain
“gateway” services industries. Given this picture, it is not obvious why manufacturing should be
accorded primacy in an RVC strategy for SACU, especially if that strategy imposes higher costs on the
constituent economies. In this light it is important to bear in mind that trade liberalization is a crucial
driver of productivity gains (Freytag, 2011); whereas productivity gains are the sine qua non of long
term economic progress.

Regarding microeconomic factors, problems seem to be equally apparent. For example in the
automotive sector, long held up as the great success story of import-substitution industrial policy in
South Africa, outside of the SACU market the region freely imports second hand automobiles meaning
there is little demand for relatively expensive South African built new cars. Furthermore, those cars are
built by OEMs – that is MNCs – not South African companies.

Those OEMs all operate GVCs and will look to leverage their global networks wherever feasible since
South Africa does not possess a comprehensive production base incorporating all tiers of parts
production and components supply.10 This is a function of the relatively small South African market. By
contrast Brazil, which implements a similar policy approach to South Africa, has a huge domestic
production system and market. But Brazil’s exports are overwhelmingly Brazilian or “made in Brazil”,
whereas MNC competitors’ are “made in the world” (Ferraz, 2014). The consequent productivity gaps in
both the Brazilian and South African cases may have to be plugged through increasingly higher levels of
effective protection, which would undermine efficiencies and cost competitiveness. For BLNS countries
looking to plug into the automotive value chain these dynamics sound a strong cautionary note.

Another microeconomic factor undermines the import substitution/RVC approach. Key industrial inputs
into South African manufacturing, such as steel and chemicals, are characterized by monopoly pricing
based on import parity prices. In fact the problem of price-leadership based on oligopoly prices, and
associated collusion, is apparently significant in South African manufacturing (Govender & Holland,
2013). Furthermore, in labour-intensive areas of production South Africa’s strong trade unions and
relatively high cost structures greatly inhibit production for regional markets. This dynamic nonetheless
affords the BLNS countries, particularly Lesotho with its tradition of labour-intensive export-oriented
manufacturing in clothing, an opportunity to take advantage of industrial shifting from South Africa.
Lesotho is already succeeding to some extent in this endeavour, by consciously courting South African
clothing manufacturers to relocate across the border.11 Clearly Lesotho’s strategy does not rely on
South African compliance or assistance, and may in fact be succeeding despite official South African

policy. Nonetheless, coordination of RVCs with final assembly in South Africa, while it may alleviate
some constraints on the input side, will run up against the same competitiveness issues in South Africa.

Overall, the main challenge with this model concerns its potential drawbacks regarding the promotion
of globally competitive industries. As is well known, import substitution can, and frequently does,
undermine long term competitiveness, not least because it generates powerful interest groups invested
in the policy regime, which resist subsequent reform. Strong (in the institutional sense) East Asian
states may have been able to manage policy transitions away from this trap, but it is not clear that
countries in the Southern African region possess the requisite capacities to do so. If they cannot, then
the region risks becoming trapped in a siege economy cycle, suffering from declining competitiveness,
growth, and development. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan African markets are small, albeit growing
reasonably quickly. This means import substitution opportunities will be relatively quickly exhausted.
And at the same time the “Africa growth” story is attracting greater levels of investment into the region
from outside it.

Hence competition is likely to intensify, meaning the regional market cannot be relied on. So the region
has to face up to the need to compete globally, sooner rather than later.

The approach has additional institutional and political problems. At the regional level the key policy
issue is to identify a workable division of industrial effort amongst the countries concerned, and to
afford countries in the region sufficient relative protection or compensation to make the effort
worthwhile. This is where matters become complex very rapidly. Since each sovereign government
wishes to promote maximum economic advantage for its citizens, and generally this means favouring
manufacturing development, it is as likely to see its neighbours as a threat as an opportunity. Within
this, South Africa’s BLNS partners are very unlikely to be satisfied with merely serving as spokes in South
African dominated value chains, no matter how practical or theoretically sound this approach might be.
In addition, not all SACU states share the vision of regional import substitution industrialization since
they recognise that they pay part of the cost. Therefore, it is likely that perceptions of relative gains and
losses arising from this approach to RVC development will bedevil intra-SACU negotiations, potentially
drawing them out and making it difficult to reach mutually rewarding compromises.

Consequently, rather than a coercive approach a facilitative approach would minimise intra-regional
politicking, and therefore enjoy greater chances of success.

4.2 A Facilitative Approach: RVC/GVC Interlinking
The general idea of development through value chains is that subordinated players in a value chain first
provide hardly processed goods and standardised services strictly specified by their superior partners.
Being part of the value chain, they successively acquire knowhow and become able to operate with less
guidance. They process the goods that they provide to GVCs and work more and more independently,
meaning that their producer services become more complex. This is not only beneficial to players that
realise an according upgrading. It also allows their superior partners to outsource more tasks,
concentrate on their core business and hence work more efficiently. The Africa Economic Outlook (AfDB
et al., 2014) accordingly argues that integrating further into value chains can increase human
development in Africa.

In this light, the RVC model should be linked to the GVC model. In Southern Africa, RVCs could be driven
by MNCs investing into the region in order to produce sub-components or final products for regional


                                                                                                      39
and/or global markets. This RVC/GVC model, in essence a flying geese model, also links to the gateway
model. Thus South Africa serves as the gateway for MNCs to invest into Southern Africa, in the process
supporting those investments but also enabling its own companies to participate in RVCs oriented
towards GVCs and regional markets.

An important dynamic in this approach is inward investment promotion, namely attraction of lead
MNCs to establish in the country/region. So the central policy objective is to facilitate investment by
MNCs, primarily, but extending to South African companies, into sourcing from regional markets in
particular niches that plug into GVCs.

Since production is ultimately for GVCs oriented towards global markets, a different policy orientation
than the essentially coercive import substitution model would be required. Its foundation would be akin
to the country/region recognising that it is in a “beauty contest” with other regions to make the
country/region more attractive to MNCs that are weighing many options. Key external markets would
move into the frame, notably the US and EU whose companies are at the origin of most GVCs, towards
which end leveraging trade arrangements such as AGOA and the EPAs could be advantageous, not least
because the MNCs would ensure that components sourced from the region meet the standards for
those markets.

Practically, there are two broad policy dynamics entailed in this approach. First, promotion of a
competitive proposition in order to afford MNCs a favourable location in which to base their facilities.
And second, clear targeting of lead MNCs for sustained inward investment promotion. South Africa and
its SACU neighbours are quite challenged on the competitiveness front, particularly in manufacturing,
as we noted in section 4.2. This necessitates a niche strategy12, working from areas of comparative
advantage such as agro-processing – for example of specialty leathers derived from beef herds; certain
manufacturing niches such as low cost clothing for the South African market, and services such as
tourism. All of this has to be buttressed by a strong focus on building competitive network services
infrastructure – telecommunications, energy, transportation - to support the economy as a whole in the
first instance, and the targeted niches in particular, and allow MNCs to link with local partners. The
investment promotion dynamic builds on those policy imperatives, but also requires a targeting process
as outlined for the import substitution variant. The country/region still needs to have a strategic
perspective on which value chains to promote and why; which segments of those value chains are
amenable to competitive regional sourcing; and which lead MNCs driving those value chains might be
amenable to “wooing” – and why. In other words the state would still play a strong, developmental,
role, but in a facilitative sense rather than a coercive one.

Without a strong competitiveness proposition at both macro and micro levels the promotional effort
will struggle. But assuming that proposition is in place then, as with all countries/regions, an attractive
company specific investment proposition still needs to be formulated. This could consist of, inter alia, a
mixture of financial and tax incentives, suitable land, access to industrial facilities, SEZs, and all the
other locational factors that MNCs consider when choosing their investment site. Such instruments
must, of course, be designed to facilitate inward FDI and not to import it at all costs, potentially leading
to a race to the bottom.

  The examples are taken from a consulting study currently being considered by a SACU task team investigating
regional industrial policy options. As it is confidential at the time of writing it cannot be referenced.


                                                                                                         40
Strong investment promotion agencies must reside at the apex of this organizational effort. They should
be empowered to drive the process in government. Not only would they require technical capacity to
understand the GVCs and MNCs being targeted, but they would also require strong political support
within government to overcome the inevitable political and bureaucratic hurdles that will arise in the
process of negotiating with lead MNCs.

And assuming that FDI attraction is a central feature of economic policy, such agencies would need to
be central players in the policy formulation process, since they would contain critical tacit and explicit
knowledge of how foreign investors think; how they perceive the country; and the issues that constrain
establishment of productive facilities through FDI.

Since two countries in the SACU region, South Africa and Namibia, are moving towards legislating more
restrictive approaches to inward FDI, it is worth raising an important exception to the facilitative
approach outlined here. Clearly not all investment is good, and not all MNCs operate according to high
ethical constraints. Furthermore, some MNCs are closely associated with the national security
establishments in their countries of origin. Therefore, states may need to implement safeguards to
protect against these potential hazards. But this should be predicated on the assumption that FDI is
generally good. In other words coercive FDI-related legislation should operate under as much
transparency as possible, and according to clear institutional parameters and operational guidelines.

All of this is relatively easy to envisage at the national level. Translating it into the regional context is
much more challenging. Flowing from the competitiveness proposition, it is clear that MNCs favour
minimal transactions costs, in the broadest sense. That entails relative freedom to move goods,
services, capital, and people across national borders within SACU and the broader Southern African
region in order to maximise intra-firm efficiencies while minimising costs. This would facilitate sourcing
from within the REC, in principle. And it points to a common market approach to building the REC.
Theoretically this approach could extend to joint targeting of lead firms, but in practice that is likely to
prove a bridge too far in most regions. Further, as argued earlier, there are many NTBs inhibiting intra-
SACU trade, and a few tariff barriers too. In addition, some policy makers are deeply sceptical towards
the deeper integration that a common market approach would require, fearing loss of sovereignty in
particular. Consequently it is not easy to see how this approach could be implemented in practice.

5 Summary and Conclusions
Southern Africa, in particular the group of countries comprising SACU, is currently not well-integrated
into the global division of labour or, more precisely, into GVCs. Partly for this reason the region suffers
from unemployment and development problems. Several options for SACU to integrate better into
GVCs are discussed in this think piece.

We first assessed the probability that SACU can copy the Asian flying geese pattern, which was initiated
by Japanese MNCs that invested in several East and Southeast Asian countries and became the lead
geese; to be joined later by MNCs from other countries and regions. This investment was accompanied
by technological transfer and spillovers, leading to a catching-up process termed the reverse production
cycle. However, we argued that the conditions for the flying geese pattern to be transferred to SACU
are not given, and that South Africa, while an indispensible actor in the SACU economic space, cannot
play Japan’s role given the vastly different economic potentials.

Therefore, we argued that more is required, specifically that the region needs to build on South Africa’s
role as the gateway for trade and investment into, and with, the region. South Africa’s gateway role was
explored in several dimensions, encompassing transport infrastructure (airports, harbours, railway lines
and roads); as services hub; and the role of its two major cities – Cape Town and Johannesburg – as the
most attractive places in sub-Saharan Africa in which to locate regional headquarters. This means that
MNCs from outside the region would use South Africa as a base from which to build their value chains
into the region, thereby playing the role of lead geese. Thus, the flying geese and the gateway models
become compliments. Within this the BLNS countries need to actively seek out value chain niches with
a view to assisting their companies to “plug into” them.

We then provided a general review of the policy environment in the SACU region vis a vis MNC
attraction. We noted that the dominant emphasis seems to be on building RVCs as an extension of
import substitution, rather than a focus on integration into MNC GVCs. We argued that RVCs can well
have a value, but are best seen as complements to GVCs. SACU countries may benefit from
technological spillovers arising from MNCs building regional networks in the short run, and qualify for
integration into GVCs in the longer run. This requires an investment friendly climate and trade
openness, and concerted state action to produce both of these prerequisites but also to target key
MNCs for investment attraction.
