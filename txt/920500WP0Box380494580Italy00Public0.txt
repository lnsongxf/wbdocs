THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

       Under the Lazio Regional Regulation no. 2 of February 7, 2012, since
       January 1, 2013, the application to obtain the seismic authorization
       shall be done online by using the so-called SITAS system. The
       applications delivered by hand are not accepted.
       The Regional Office “Genio Civile” checks for the compliance of the
       project with the technical provisions set forth by the competent
       administration through an internal control committee and issues the
       seismic authorization. This authorization is mandatory for the building
       permit to be valid.

       Structural projects are randomly selected for control in the first ten
       days of the month following application. Projects that are not selected
       are automatically authorized. However, the applicant must wait until a
       formal letter of seismic approval is received. The letter arrives
       approximately within two weeks.

       For projects selected for control, the procedure lasts at least 60 days.

       Obtain building permit

       The application for a building permit is filed with the Sportello Unico
       dell'Edilizia (one-stop shop). BuildCo must file proof of title of
       ownership to the property for which the building permit is requested,
       as well as the project design drawings signed by an engineer or an
   2   architect, including the drawings relating to electric utilities, air        135 days        EUR 38,661
       conditioning systems, and fire protection devices. The SUE will also
       request project clearance from the Fire Department and from the Public
       Health Agency. The municipality takes 135 days on average to issue the
       building permit.

       The fees for the issuance of the building permit are calculated based on

      municipality. The fee based on building value must be paid no later
      than 60 days after the completion of the building; the fee based on
      urbanization costs must be paid upon issuance of the building permit.

      the Law Decree no. 70 of May 13, 2011 has introduced the "consent by
      silent" for the case building of permit processes. Specifically, in towns
      with more than 100,000 citizens, the Municipal Agency must reply
      within 150 days from the receipt of the relevant documentation and, in
      case of silence, the entrepreneur is entitled to start construction
      activities (unless there are restrictions on the land/building for
      historical, landscape or cultural reasons). Such time does not consider
      any extension of time necessary for any request of integration or

      Hire an independent engineer to test structure

      The structure tests must be performed by an engineer or an architect
      who was not directly involved in the project. In addition to the final test
      on completed structures, the work site director must provide test
      results for the structural material used to build the structure. In the case
      of reinforced concrete, the testing must be done on three samples

      File certified notification of starting activity (“SCIA”)

      A certified notification of starting activity (“SCIA”) is a declaration
      produced by BuildCo that the building is in compliance with all fire
      safety regulations. For a warehouse containing books, the cost will be
      EUR 216.00 as per the D.P.R. 151/11 (Presidential Decree 151/11 of             0.5 days      EUR 216

        Registration of the deed

        The notary files the deed of sale and the transcription note on line using
        the “Modello Unico Informatico (MUI)”. It is mandatory for the notary to
        file the documents within 30 days of the signature of the contract.
        Otherwise, the notary will be fined. With a single electronic transmission
        digitally signed by a notary, the following information is sent: (i) the data
        concerning the payment of taxes (debited from bank account), (ii) the
        offices of destination, i.e. Tax Agency for tax registration, Land Agency
        for the Land Registry and Cadastral office (jointly), Land Registry Offices
        (Ufficio Tavolare) for the municipalities where this specific method of
        registration for real estate transfers is operational; (iii) the certified copy
        of the deed with its attachments. Taxes are credited directly to the
        central Revenue Office and the various offices retain the competence to
        verify the correctness of the payment. The notary gets online receipts of
        the various Procedures and payments made. In the case of a warehouse
        used for commercial purposes, sold by a company that is not in the
        construction business the cadastral tax is equal to 1% of sale price,                           Included in

        of sale price. Italian VAT law applicable to commercial properties states
        that the sale of a commercial property is generally VAT exempt, unless (i)
        in the cases mandatorily provided for by the Italian tax law (ii) if the seller
        has elected for the VAT regime. In any case, the transfer of a commercial
        property where both the seller and the purchaser are Italian companies is
        subject to a fixed registration tax rate. The Land registry and cadastre
        are 2 different databases, but managed by the same government agency
        since 2008-2009. The Land Registry has the purpose of rendering deeds
        enforceable towards all third parties. Until a deed has been registered in
        the Land Registry, it is only enforceable between the parties thereto. The
        Italian Land Registry system is based on the principle of continuity of the
        registrations ("continuità delle trascrizioni"). This means that an
        individual or an entity may sell a property only if the relative deed of
        purchase has been registered beforehand in the Land Registry.

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making

for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business
