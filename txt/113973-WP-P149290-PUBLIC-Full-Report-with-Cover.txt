 Social Sector Notes

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In response to a request from the Government of Egypt, the World Bank
undertook the analysis of selected sectoral issues in education and health and
their link to public spending. The objective of the analytical task was to inform
policies to enhance human development impact of social sector expenditures
in line with Egypt’s new constitutional mandate, which requires earmarked
increases in the government’s expenditures on health, education and research1.
The studies focus primarily on the education and health sectors and constraints
to achieving better outcomes in these sectors. It draws on information from the
national budget, household survey data and evidence from previous analytical
work.
This series of studies were conducted under the overall coordination of Gustavo
Demarco. The technical team included Quentin Wodon, main author of the
notes, with contributions from the following co-authors: Lire Ersado, Brooks
Evans, Chata Male, Adenike Onagoruwa, Aboudrahyme Savadogo, Ali Yedan,
Alaa Hamed, Aaka Pande, Emelyne Calimoutou, Amr El Shalakani and Minh
Cong Nguyen. Amira Kazem and Shahram Paksima provided substantive
inputs to the Education note. Souraya El Assiouty provided research support
and Mariam Ghaly provided general assistance to the team.
This technical assistance is part of overall support to the government of Egypt,
under the leadership and supervision of Asad Alam, Country Director. Poonam
Gupta, Husam Abudagga, Safaa El Kogali, Hana Brixi, Yasser El Gammal,
Ernest Massiah and Margaret Grosh provided guidance and substantive
comments during the process and final review. Peer reviewers were Nistha
Sinha, Caroline Krafft and Pablo Facundo Cuevas.
The main notes produced under this task aim to provide insights into the
education and health sectors in Egypt, as well as the cross-cutting issue of child
marriage. While the main focus is on the education and health sectors, attention
is also given to labor, since the outcomes in the labor market are directly and
indirectly affected by investments in education and health. Other topics are also
considered within the notes, including early childhood development and child
marriage.
The scope of the work is comprehensive, but limited by time and data availability,
and therefore not exhaustive. A number of additional interventions of high social
and developmental potential impact can be analyzed as part of future studies
on the matter.
1 According to the Constitutional amendment, Egypt is required to increase spending on pre-university
and university education to reach 4% and 2% of GNP, respectively, from the current total for both of
around 3.5%; spending on health to 3% of GNP from less than 1.5%; and on scientific research to 1% of
GNP from near zero, http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/01/07/new-constitution-raises-spending-on-
