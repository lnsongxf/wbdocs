                          irst in a series, which aims to analyze the recent economic and financial
                          situation in cote d’Ivoire, this report analyzes the main macroeconomic
                          developments and structural policies of the country from 2013 until mid-
                 2014. It also reflects on the underlying factors of the strong economic recovery in
                 côte d’Ivoire since the end of the post-election crisis, to assess the likelihood of
                 sustained economic growth and significant poverty reduction in the country. finally,
                 the report analyzes the effects of declining oil prices and the appreciation of the
                 dollar against the euro and the cfa franc on the Ivorian economy.
                 this edition does not examine the impact of strong economic growth on the Ivoirian
                 population’s well-being indicators such as, poverty, employment and inequality.
                 Within the scope of this report, the objective is to understand the factors
                 contributing to the strong economic recovery in côte d’Ivoire.
                 this Economic Update is targeted toward a larger audience, in order to stimulate
                 constructive debate on public policy in the country and between the country and
                 its development partners.

            this is based on the review of empirical work that finds that, on average the boom in exports and investment are important factors
         to the economic recovery in post-conflict environments (see david el al., 2011). Ideally, case studies would allow comparing the
         experience of economic recovery in cIv with the experience of specific countries in post-conflict situation. such case studies are at
         the moment quite rare.

            the method of analysis for contributions to growth recovery in cIv is comprised of an examination of developments in four demand
         factors over intervals of conflict and relative stability in the country: (i) real exports of goods and services, and three components of
         investment- (ii) foreign direct investment, (iii) public infrastructure spending and- (iv) domestic private fixed investment. analysis of
         the dynamics of the factors is carried out by comparing the average real value of each during 2012-13 (current growth recovery) with
         values in 2008-09--a relatively peaceful period in cIv, relevant for understanding changes in performance. an additional comparison
         is made with developments during 2010-11 (second politico-military crisis) in order to better distinguish between catch-up effects
         and potential shifts in underlying growth paths.

            the euro-depreciation simulation is carried out over a 3-year forecast horizon (2014-2016), using the ‘isIM’ World Model system
         developed at the World Bank (dEc prospects Group). the model, which is used to generate projections found in Global Economic
         prospects reports of the World Bank, is grounded on the demand side of economies, and links some 140 countries through
         connections in goods trade and country-specific export- and import prices, tied in turn to exchange rate projections. for this
         simulation, the dollar-per-euro exchange rate has been lowered by 10% in 2014 and sustained at this level for the following two years
         (against an unchanged baseline forecast for exchange rates), and the effects on trade and Gdp dynamics as found for cote d’Ivoire
         are examined.
         22
            the real effective exchange rate (rEEr) takes into account the nominal exchange rate of a country’s key trade partners, as well as
         price developments in the home-as well as partner markets- to arrive at a measure of real competitiveness. a 2.7 percent
         improvement in cIvs rEEr (contrasted with a greater 4.5 percent gain for the Euro area) is tied to the large share of cIv trade that is
         carried out with the cfa (WaMEU) and Euro Zones, such that nominal exchange rates versus partners are changed fairly little, as
         well as stronger inflation pass-through of currency depreciation for cIv vis-à-vis Europe.
