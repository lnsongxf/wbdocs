FOREWORD
Evidence from the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) survey on the global burden of disease shows
that nearly 600,000 Africans die annually and millions more suffer from chronic illnesses caused by air pollution
from inefficient and dangerous traditional cooking fuels and stoves. This tragic and avoidable first-order public
health crisis disproportionately harms women and children. Moreover, cooking with wood, charcoal, crop waste,
dung, coal, and potentially dangerous and polluting modern fuels, such as kerosene, also imposes tremendous
direct costs on economies and households in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and contributes to a wide range of
negative environmental and climate change effects.
The authors of this report believe that—with the right blend of political will, carefully targeted technical and
financial support, and a renewed focus on enabling frameworks—the next 5–10 years can serve as a turning
point for the African cooking sector, leading to a much broader uptake of cleaner and more efficient fuels
and stoves. Important new developments include the emergence of new, clean cooking solutions; growing
demand for fuel-saving alternatives due to escalating pressure on biomass resources and prices; innovation
in business models for base-of-the-pyramid (BoP) products; and rising support for the clean cooking agenda
from the public health community, governments, and donors. The African cooking sector also increasingly
represents an attractive niche market for the private sector—as reflected by increasing entry over the past few
years of social enterprises, multinationals, impact investors, and carbon finance projects, including the launch of
several large-scale, Africa-based manufacturing facilities for cleaner and more efficient biomass stoves and fuels.
However, despite these encouraging trends, there is also ample reason for continued skepticism. So far, three
decades of efforts to promote both modern fuels and improved biomass stoves have seen only sporadic
success at scale in the region and globally. Penetration of clean cooking solutions remains limited, and efforts
to promote their adoption face substantial obstacles, including the limited ability of consumers to afford high-
quality clean stoves and fuels, and lack of consumer awareness of, and willingness to pay premium prices for,
cooking solutions that offer long-term health benefits. Moreover, large gaps in financial and technical capacity
across stove and fuel supply chains, and gaps in the enabling environment for both fuel and stove markets,
including the continued absence of coherent quality and performance standards, present additional challenges.
Addressing these barriers will require substantially higher private and public investment, greater stakeholder
coordination, and improved information to help decision makers learn from past experience, innovate, and
measure progress in what continues to be a very opaque and fragmented sector.
This overview report, prepared in support of the World Bank’s Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES)
initiative, builds on earlier reports from the World Bank and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC).1 The
report establishes a baseline for the SSA cooking landscape and offers an overview of emerging opportunities to
encourage increased investment in clean and improved cooking businesses across the region. This document is
meant to serve as a companion to the recently issued report The State of the Global Clean and Improved Cooking
Sector (2014), jointly published by Energy Sector Management Assistance Program/World Bank (ESMAP/WB) and
the GACC.
In terms of its scope, this report covers the full range of “clean” and “improved” cooking solutions in SSA that
can enhance the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of traditional technologies, each varying widely in
terms of fuel feedstock, design, construction materials, methods of production, and harm mitigation potential
(Figure 1).2
The typology in Figure 1 is an attempt to rationalize existing clean and improved cooking-sector definitions and
is used throughout the report for consistency. These definitions should be seen only as indicative, given the
wide range of cookstove models and performance within each stove category. Wherever possible, the report
has linked these definitions to the provisional standards and performance tiers adopted via an International
Workshop Agreement (IWA 11:2012) by the International Standards Organization (ISO), which establish a
common quantitative vocabulary for clean and improved cookstoves (ICS) based on absolute, not relative
or comparative, measures of efficiency, emissions, and safety performance (see Appendix 1).3 The provisional
agreement was ratified in June 2013 with the formation of the ISO Technical Committee 285, the key global
body charged with developing, approving, and monitoring improved and clean cooking standards in the

Under the term improved cooking solutions, the report includes all cookstoves that improved fuel efficiency
without reducing particulate matter emissions to the low levels necessary for optimal health outcomes as
defined by WHO household air pollution guidelines. The “improved stove” category includes (1) basic chimney
biomass and coal cookstoves, including many “legacy” biomass cookstoves distributed in early national stove

programs (ISO Tier 0–2 for fuel efficiency, Tier 0–1 for emissions);5 (2) “basic” portable wood and charcoal ICS (Tier
1–2 for efficiency, Tier 1 for emissions); and (3) highly fuel-efficient “intermediate” rocket-style ICS (Tier 2–3 for
efficiency, Tier 1–2 for emissions).
Clean cooking solutions include low-particulate-emission technologies (ISO Tier 3–4 for emissions), such as
(1) high-performance advanced biomass cookstoves (ACS) which use fans or natural-draft (ND) gasification
principles, particularly when such stoves are combined with biomass briquette/pellet fuels;6 (2) modern-energy
cooking solutions, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, natural gas, and electric stoves; and (3)
a variety of renewable, nonsolid-fuel solutions, such as biogas, methanol, ethanol, solar cookers, and retained-
heat cooking devices. The categorization of kerosene stoves as a clean cooking technology in this report is
subject to a major caveat. While well-designed kerosene stoves have minimal particulate emissions, emissions
from the low-quality kerosene stoves typically deployed in the SSA region are often much higher than expected
and, more generally, there is a growing body of evidence about the dangers of kerosene cooking.7
The report incorporates the review of more than 300 secondary sources; analysis of primary data in dozens
of existing market and household surveys, including the recent GACC market assessment reports; publicly
available product-testing databases; impact evaluation data from large regional and country programs; focus
group discussions with sector stakeholders in eastern, western, and southern Africa regional consultations;
and interviews with more than 80 sector participants, including product designers, manufacturers, distributors,
financiers, program managers, and policy makers. Data collection efforts have included the development
of several country-level databases on historical fuel mix, energy expenditures, fuel prices, and cookstove
penetration. Market models and analyses built for the report include an Africa-wide cost-benefit analysis
tool for evaluating sector opportunity costs, a fuel use and expenditure forecast model, a cooking consumer
segmentation, a manufacturer sales database, and a cookstove market forecast model. Depending on the
analysis, the report uses data from 2010–14, with every effort made to ensure comparability across different
sources and data points.
The resulting figures, facts, and analyses provide the most comprehensive picture of the clean and improved
cooking sector in Africa available to date, but also have several weaknesses due to underlying data challenges.
Across different sources, sector technology definitions, impact indicators, and sales-tracking methodologies are
often inconsistently defined and variably applied. Therefore, end-user data, including information on consumer
usage patterns and preferences, are of variable quality and available for only a small proportion of SSA markets.
Finally, private-sector ICS and fuel sales information and public-sector cookstove program indicators are self-
reported and, therefore, not always credible. The information assembled in this report constitutes a best-effort
attempt to harmonize definitions and data sources, with the caveat of occasional lack of precision due to
definitional and data-quality challenges. The report interprets data conservatively and highlights potentially
contentious and ambiguous areas where appropriate. Consequently, this document should be seen as a
starting point for sector analysis, and the data should be updated in future editions as the African cooking
sector evolves.

Executive Summary
Reliance on solid-fuel cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a large and growing problem. More than 700
million Africans (82%) use solid fuels, such as wood, charcoal, dung, crop waste, and coal, for their primary
cooking needs—a number that will reach 850–900 million by the end of the decade. This high level of solid-fuel
use, combined with household reliance on inefficient and unsafe traditional cookstoves, constitutes a first-order
public health crisis: household air pollution (HAP) from solid-fuel cooking emissions kills nearly 600,000 Africans
annually and is now recognized as the second-largest health risk factor in terms of death and disability in the
region. Solid-fuel cooking in SSA accounts for up to 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 6% of global
black carbon, an important additional driver of climate change because it both absorbs solar radiation in the
atmosphere and deposits soot on snow and ice surfaces. Solid-fuel cooking also imposes significant costs on
African households and economies, with a mid-range estimated opportunity cost of 3% of regional annual gross
domestic product (GDP)—including avoidable spending on solid fuels, time losses due to firewood collection,
the economic costs of increased mortality and morbidity burdens, and the environmental and climate costs of
deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions.
The clean and improved cooking sector in SSA has evolved significantly, but is still highly underdeveloped.
Only 11% of Africans use “clean” cookstoves that run on modern fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
(5%) and electric stoves (6%), as their primary cooking appliances. Many of these households continue to use
traditional biomass-burning stoves as their secondary cooking device due to the common phenomenon of
fuel and stove “stacking” (simultaneous usage of multiple fuels and stove technologies). Kerosene, which is used
by 7% of Africans, likely does not qualify as a clean cooking solution in many instances, given the increasing
evidence of harm from typical kerosene stoves in Africa. Stoves that run on such renewable fuels as biogas,
ethanol, and solar are uncommon (less than 1%), and the penetration of “advanced” biomass gasifier cookstoves
(less than 0.1%) that can come near the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO’s) Tier 4 emission
performance is still at a pilot stage. A growing number of SSA households (about 3.5%) use intermediate
improved cookstoves (ICS) (e.g., rocket stoves), which are substantially more fuel efficient but do not achieve
the emission reductions needed to realize the full health and environmental benefits of clean cooking. Another
9–10% of SSA households have access to both basic ICS (less than 5%) and legacy cookstoves (less than 5%) that
offer only moderate improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions over traditional cooking technologies. In
aggregate, Africa has a significantly lower rate of access to clean and improved solutions (25%, excluding legacy
stoves) than any other region globally.
The continuation of current trends over the next decade is likely to offer ample opportunities for transformative
advances in the adoption of more efficient and cleaner cooking solutions. On the demand side, key factors
include a large urban population (a result of the region’s two decades of rapid urban population growth); the
emergence of an aspirational lower/middle class with rising incomes (the African population with discretionary
income is expected to grow 50% over the next decade, to 130 million households); and escalating prices for
cooking fuel (charcoal prices rose 11%, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices rose 8%, annually in 2000–10),
a consistent long-term trend despite recent fossil fuel price declines in 2014-2015. A large and growing share
of SSA consumers (50%) already pay something for their cooking fuels and can benefit tangibly from adopting
even basic energy-saving cookstove alternatives. There is growing evidence across multiple SSA markets of
consumer willingness to pay for basic ICS. Evidence of consumer demand for more expensive intermediate and
advanced ICS is more limited, but emerging consumer survey data suggest that—with extensive consumer
awareness building and the right products—demand for higher-cost, quality-controlled cooking solutions
could grow rapidly.
On the supply side, key trends include accelerating technological innovation across the full spectrum of cooking
technologies, including most notably the development of fan-gasifier biomass cookstoves that combine high
rates of fuel efficiency (up to 50%) and very low levels of particulate-matter emissions (90%+ reduction vis-à-
vis traditional biomass stoves). Other notable developments are the increased use of scalable and centralized
industrial production—international players, such as Philips [ACE], Envirofit, and BURN Manufacturing, have
opened new Africa-based manufacturing facilities, and EcoZoom also plans to do so in the near future—along
with improved capacity for regional semi-industrial players. All these factors hold the promise of improved

performance and higher product quality at lower cost. Another important supply-side trend includes the
increasing availability of financing for manufacturers and distributors through the Global Alliance for Clean
Cookstoves (GACC), the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, the Global Villages
Energy Partnership, and recently launched private funds, such as the Base of the Pyramid Impact eXchange
Fund, or BIX.
Meanwhile, two important trends are affecting both supply and demand in the region. First is the emergence of
new distribution and financing models for reaching the poor, including carbon finance, microlending, lay-away
and leasing schemes, and utility models for distributing renewable biomass pellet or ethanol fuels. Second is
the growing number of entrepreneurs across all segments of the clean fuel and ICS value chain: over the past
five years, the number of Africa-based industrial and semi-industrial ICS manufacturers has grown from less than
10 firms to more than 40.
The enabling environment for clean cooking solutions uptake is also seeing positive developments. There is a
growing consensus among regional policy makers on the case for clean cooking energy. National cookstove
programs are being launched or aggressively scaled up in such countries as Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria,
Rwanda, Senegal, and Uganda. There is an increased focus on cookstove quality testing and standards,
as manifested by the adoption of provisional International Organization for Standardization/International
Workshop Agreement (ISO/IWA) standards for stoves (see Appendix 2) and the growing number of testing
centers across the region with increasing capacity to carry out tests according to the established protocols.
There is rising interest from donors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),, and industry in championing
innovation in clean and renewable cooking technologies. The monitoring and evaluation of cooking projects
is improving. And, last but not least, global coordinating platforms are emerging—such as the GACC and the
United Nations’ Sustainable Energy for All; regional market transformation efforts, such as the World Bank’s Africa
Clean Cooking Energy Solutions program; and fuel-specific initiatives focused on Africa, such as the Global LPG
Partnership and the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme.
Major obstacles remain on the path to maximizing the reach of clean and improved cooking solutions in
Africa. Consumers’ limited willingness to fully adopt new cooking solutions and limited ability to pay for higher-
cost, clean, and improved cookstoves and fuels are the greatest long-term obstacles to broader adoption of
clean cooking in Africa.
From the standpoint of willingness to adopt, limited consumer exposure to new technologies and low
awareness of their benefits limit demand. Even when consumers are educated about stove benefits, however,
willingness to adopt is often still low, due to the new solutions’ inability to fit with consumers’ cooking preferences
(due to the reality or perception of inappropriate design); lack of consumer trust in stove performance and
durability; concerns about the accessibility of fuel supply and after-sales support; and the behavioral (e.g., risk
aversion, present bias) and cultural obstacles to sustained adoption of new technologies. The willingness-to-
adopt challenge is not just an obstacle to initial stove uptake, but also affects sustained adoption and use—as
manifested in the near-universal phenomenon of stove and fuel “stacking,” where end users retain traditional
cooking solutions for use alongside clean or improved solutions to accommodate both diverse household
cooking needs and the force of tradition.
Even where households are willing to adopt improved and clean cookstoves and fuels, they often lack the
ability to pay for the stove and fuel due to insufficient disposable incomes and/or the lack of savings. This
“affordability challenge” is particularly acute for clean cooking solutions. The high upfront costs of higher-end
cooking appliances (US$75–100 for fan gasifiers and US$25–100 for LPG and electric modern-fuel stoves) and
the high ongoing costs of modern-fuel use relative to traditional biomass alternatives serve as a major constraint
to the size of the clean cooking market. Affordability is likewise consistently rated as the top demand constraint
by the manufacturers and distributors of industrially manufactured, high-quality intermediate ICS (rocket wood
and charcoal stoves) in the US$15–50 range. For low-cost improved stoves (i.e., basic ICS in the US$3–15 range),
aside from the poorest segments of the African population, affordability is a smaller obstacle, but nonetheless
still serves as a brake on faster market development.
In making the decision to adopt or pay for improved and clean cooking solutions, Africans are primarily interested
in fuel and time savings, convenience, smoke reduction, durability, and safety, with relatively little interest in
the long-term health benefits and public-good aspects of cooking solutions. Reduction of fuel expenditures
is the most powerful motivator among these factors, but does not apply for many end users. Only half of SSA



                                                                13
                                Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
households currently purchase cooking fuel, and many such fuel-buying households continue to rely on fuel
collection in parallel, adjusting their mix of purchased and collected firewood as opportunities and economic
situations dictate. Although the number of such fuel-purchasing households is growing, the pace of this change
is unclear due to a lack of long-term data. The economic motivation for fuel-saving stoves is particularly weak for
the poor (i.e., those earning less than $1.25 per day), collectors of wood and other biomass fuels (such as dung
and crop waste), who constitute nearly 30% of the SSA population. Biomass-collecting households do face the
physical harms and time burdens of firewood gathering, but tend to place a low value on time losses, given
the low opportunity cost of rural labor; polychronic traditional cultures that generally undervalue time; and
patriarchal family structures in which men play the dominant role in stove-purchasing decisions, leaving the
time burdens of fuel collection to fall primarily on women and girls.
Many of these willingness-to-adopt and -pay issues can be addressed via consumer education and awareness
building, as well as marketing solutions that enhance end-user trust (e.g., warranties, right to return). In addition—
assuming that the underlying technologies are appropriately designed, distribution and financing approaches
can build up end-user comfort through exposure (e.g., free trials), and innovative financing techniques (e.g.,
installment payment plans, pay-as-you-go/utility business models, and consumer financing) can address the
liquidity constraints of those consumers whose income levels can sustain stove purchases but who lack the
near-term savings needed for stove purchases.
For many cooking solutions, even when such approaches are applied, willingness to pay will remain a barrier
to adoption. There is strong evidence that most African consumers are not willing to pay price premiums
for stoves and fuels that generate incremental long-term health benefits—a factor that inherently limits the
market-based potential of clean solutions that cannot compete with traditional or improved stoves on purely
economic terms. Willingness to pay is also an issue for intermediate ICS technologies, where actual willingness
to pay can be significantly below the stove’s fair market price. Even after willingness to pay is improved through
marketing, many ICS providers will still need to subsidize the upfront cost of their stoves—with carbon revenues,
for example—to see adoption at scale, particularly in rural areas.
On the supply side, corresponding obstacles to wider adoption of improved and clean cooking solutions
include the cost and complexity of last-mile distribution; the limited business management capacity and
financial constraints of cooking-sector entrepreneurs; the still-limited adoption of uniform quality standards and
product certification to minimize market spoilage; biomass supply market failures limiting fuel sustainability;
and regulatory constraints, such as high taxes and duties on clean technologies or perverse subsidy incentives
for the ongoing use of harmful fuels.
To address these various obstacles, sector funding is a cross-cutting challenge involving financing for fuel-
supply chains, working capital for improved stove producers and distributors, public-sector funding for market
transformation programs and enabling market infrastructure, and—where sensible—targeted subsidies and
incentives tied to access, health, and climate change goals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the
funding needed for universal access to clean cooking energy in SSA at more than US$1 billion annually through
2030—whereas the current fund flow is US$50–125 million. Public- and donor-sector funding, in particular, is
far below levels that can realistically address the immensity of the health challenges caused by household air
pollution: current SSA funding levels are an estimated US$100–250 per death for HAP versus US$2,000–4,000 per
death for public health crises, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.
The “business-as-usual” scenario for the clean and improved cooking sector’s growth is encouraging but
falls far short of potential and need. Existing market dynamics will ensure that tens of millions of new SSA
households will gain access to at least minimally improved cooking solutions by the end of the decade without
any further interventions. But by 2020, the business-as-usual scenario would still leave 80% of Africa’s population
without clean cooking solutions and more than 60% without access to even minimally improved cooking
solutions. This would still represent a much lower level of access than what is currently seen in such regions
as South Asia, where the lack of clean cooking solutions is being addressed as a major crisis. Furthermore, in
the absence of significant public- and private-sector investment, the spread of clean cooking solutions across
SSA will be highly uneven—with successes in countries, such as Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa
(where the combined penetration of ICS and clean fuels is already above 50%) serving as exceptions amidst
the overwhelming majority of SSA countries still mired in traditional solid-fuel cooking. In places where ICS
adoption is growing quickly, much of this growth is still in basic and intermediate ICS, rather than in clean



                                                               14
                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
cookstoves and fuels. Furthermore, the vast gap in clean cooking access between rural and urban areas is
likely to widen further in the absence of new targeted investments. African governments, the development
community, and the private sector can and must do better.
Disrupting the status quo will require stepped-up investment and a differentiated approach. While this is a
moment of great promise, it is also one of great responsibility for sector stakeholders. To ensure that the current
revival of interest in clean cooking does not become a passing fad or disappoint with meager results, new
investments are needed to accelerate the uptake of clean, high-quality cooking appliances and fuels in such
countries as Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa, where sizable markets
for clean fuels already exist. Many of these countries—and others, such as Ethiopia and Uganda—already have
significant markets for basic and intermediate ICS that could likewise benefit from further acceleration.
At the same time, it is also vital to establish the foundations for clean and improved stove ecosystems in the
vast majority of other African countries, where the current penetration of ICS is negligible and the enabling
environment antecedents for clean cooking are weak. While a major push is needed in both cases, the relative
intervention priorities and appropriate technologies will vary by market stage. In less developed countries,
public-sector support will be particularly critical, since the creation of artisanal ICS markets and early-stage
“market-seeding” awareness campaigns are time- and resource-intensive efforts in which the private sector is
typically less willing to invest.
Changing the status quo likewise requires a significant further tailoring of sector approaches based on target
technologies, consumer-segment characteristics, and policy objectives. Market-led approaches hold significant
promise for expanding access to clean cooking solutions for middle-income consumers, particularly for
the urban and peri-urban segments that have growing disposable incomes. The optimal strategy for such
consumers involves expanding uptake of modern fuels and, where biomass cooking persists, progressively
displacing household biomass stoves with clean or highly improved biomass cooking solutions to transition
the entire fuel “stack” to cleaner cooking energy.
Poor urban consumers, who already often face significant fuel costs, similarly offer growing opportunities for
the private sector. Reaching them, however, will likely require different strategies and challenges, such as (1)
capitalizing on carbon finance markets and growing demand via businesses that generate fuel savings (e.g.,
via highly efficient charcoal stoves), or (2) offering competitively priced alternatives to expensive biomass (LPG,
biofuels, biomass briquettes) that can also create significant health co-benefits.
In contrast, for rural poor consumers and other marginalized segments (e.g., refugee camp populations), the
path forward will very likely involve continuing to expand low-cost artisanal ICS markets that, while potentially
generating significant fuel savings, will realistically have only minimal health benefits. High-quality intermediate
ICS, advanced biomass cookstove (ACS) technologies, and clean fuels will likely remain inaccessible to most
rural African consumers without public-sector leadership and significant subsidies for many years to come.

Recommendations
Aside from an across-the-board need for new investments, the report highlights the following specific
recommendations for sector stakeholders.
Public Sector, Donors, and NGOs
•	   Increase investment in clean cooking solutions, while maintaining momentum for intermediate and
     basic ICS technologies where cleaner solutions are not feasible in the near term. The scale of the HAP
     public health crisis calls for a revision of donor priorities, with a need for expanded investment in clean
     cooking technologies. Achieving proportionality to investments in such public health challenges as HIV/
     AIDS and tuberculosis would require at least a tenfold increase in public-sector and donor funding for
     clean cooking technologies. At the same time, the slow pace of transition to clean solutions and the
     unaffordability of these solutions for the rural poor dictate sustained large investment in intermediate and
     basic biomass ICS.
•	   Design interventions to drive consumer behavior change; simply distributing cleaner cooking solutions
     and fuels will not lead to optimal health and environment outcomes. The challenge of achieving the
     benefits of universal clean cooking in SSA is not simply one of technology and economics. Like water



                                                               15
                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
     and sanitation programs and other public health initiatives, clean cooking promotion efforts can achieve
     health impact objectives only when accompanied by large-scale behavior change in the target end-user
     population.
•	   Prioritize market-based approaches, but also deploy direct subsidies linked to health and climate
     impacts. Market-led models should be emphasized wherever feasible to ensure sustainability. However,
     maximizing climate and health benefits might also require targeted subsidies delivered through carbon
     markets and focused “pull” mechanisms (e.g., results-based credits for health benefits).
•	   Support sustainable production of clean-biomass and renewable-fuel alternatives alongside stove
     efficiency and emissions. Given rapidly rising demand, more efficient cooking solutions alone will not be
     enough if the sustainability issues in African woodfuel value chains remain unaddressed.
•	   Focus on providing critical public goods to accelerate the development of the clean cooking sector.
     Emphasize consumer education, access to finance, funding for research and development (R&D), the
     expansion of standards and testing, and clean cooking focused policies (e.g., tax, tariff, and subsidy reform).

Private Sector
•	   Invest to capture the opportunity. Despite many challenges, the untapped SSA demand for clean and
     improved cookstoves is immense. The opportunity is further enhanced by a resilient and fast-growing
     voluntary carbon finance market and the potential for additional funding streams from social impact
     investors, governments, and donors for the health benefits of clean cookstoves and fuels.
•	   Focus on cooking-fuel opportunities, not just cookstoves. The SSA cooking-fuel market (US$20 billion) is
     orders of magnitude larger than the market for cooking appliances, though it is also more complex due to
     often perverse regulatory incentives, vested interests, significant investment requirements in the case of
     modern fuels, and fragmented and informal markets for biomass.
•	   Address the affordability challenge to grow market share. Recommended measures include reducing
     stove prices via low-cost design and economies of scale, transitioning to local production or assembly, and
     embracing innovative distribution and financing models that can lower upfront stove costs.
•	   Address willingness-to-pay (WTP) barriers head on. Even if you have the ideal product, focus on adapting
     marketing, distribution, and financing models to address WTP challenges, such as low consumer awareness,
     trust gaps, and liquidity constraints through proven approaches, including consumer education, field
     demonstrations, trial periods, warranties, and pay-as-you-go schemes.
•	   Use a variety of distribution channels, with an emphasis on getting closer to the consumer. Getting to
     scale requires exploiting a range of models (e.g., direct, third-party, institutional), with the greatest scale
     seen by those who take on the expense of building direct bridges to consumers, or partner with third
     parties with direct-sales or demand-aggregator capabilities (e.g., distributors of synergetic products and
     household appliances, carbon project coordinating/managing entities).
•	   Design products with an emphasis on the complete end-user experience and attention to quality
     at every provisional ISO/IWA performance tier. Most consumers, even the poor, are willing to pay for
     improved design, with an emphasis on “aspirational” stove designs that require minimal behavior change,
     while maximizing fuel savings, end-user convenience (e.g., cooking time), and durability.

Key Facts and Figures
The Cooking Energy Challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa

•	   Cooking with traditional fuels and stoves represents a US$32 billion opportunity cost (3% of SSA GDP).
•	   Each year there are nearly 600,000 avoidable African deaths, and more than 26 million disability-
     adjusted life years are lost.
•	   More than 40 million worker years are wasted each year on fuelwood gathering and slow biomass
     cooking.
•	   Solid-fuel cooking in SSA accounts for 6% of global black carbon emissions and 1.2% of carbon dioxide
     emissions.

Cooking-Sector Demand
•	   An estimated 700 million Africans (82%) cook primarily with solid fuels (and 850–900 million will do so
     by 2020), 7% with kerosene, 5% with LPG, and 6% with electricity.
•	   SSA is already a large cooking market: US$20 billion was spent annually on cooking fuels in 2010, and
     US$300–400 million was spent on all types of stoves. By 2020, fuel spending is set to more than double
     to US$47 billion.
•	   Fuel prices are rising fast across the region, stimulating demand for fuel-saving solutions. Annual price
     growth is 8% for LPG and 11% for charcoal, and the average charcoal cooking cost is now higher than
     that for LPG, a trend that has accelerated with recent fossil fuel price declines.
•	   Half of all SSA consumers already regularly pay for cooking fuels. Although 70–80% can afford the
     upfront cost of basic ICS (US$5), less than 20% can easily afford high-end cookstoves (US$50–100).
•	   Willingness to pay/adopt is a major constraint: 10–30% of SSA consumers are not readily willing to
     adopt new solutions. The initial willingness to pay for quality ICS is often 20–50% of stove value, but
     can be increased with marketing and consumer education.


Cooking-Sector Supply
•	   In SSA, the growth in uptake of clean modern-fuel solutions is slow—the annual growth of primary
     users is 3.5% for electric stoves and less than 5% for LPG—though total volumes of fuel use are likely
     growing faster.
•	   The biomass ACS market is nascent: 50,000–100,000 gasifier stoves have been distributed across a
     handful of SSA pilots.
•	   The number of renewable fuel project pilots is growing, but penetration is likewise very low: about
     40,000 biogas stoves, 50,000 solar cookers, 75,000 ethanol stoves, 0.5 million retained-heat cookers,
     and 25,000 biomass pellet stoves.
•	   Biomass ICS distribution is small but growing: fewer than 10 million SSA households use basic ICS, 5–7
     million use intermediate “rocket” or highly improved charcoal ICS, and another 7–8 million have legacy
     stoves.
•	   The ICS supply is focused on urban areas: less than 20% of urban solid-fuel households have ICS,
     versus less than 5% of rural households.
•	   More than 90% of ICS in Africa are artisanally manufactured cookstoves—chiefly portable, ceramic,
     jiko-style ICS; legacy chimney stoves; and, in select geographies, efficient rocket stoves.
•	   Adoption of industrially manufactured ICS is growing quickly: there are more than 40 SSA industrial/
     semi-industrial manufacturers (35 more than five years ago), and major players are seeing 35–100%
     annual growth in sales and 5–25% self-reported margins (10% on average), including carbon revenue
     streams.
•	   Sector financing is a major challenge: funding needs (US$1 billion annually) are 8–20 times the current
     level of investments by donors and the private sector in ICS (US$50–125 million annually).

The Case for Clean Cooking

This chapter draws on cutting-edge academic research and a wealth of recent household survey data to build
the case for donor, government, and private-sector investment in improved and clean cooking solutions in
Africa. The analysis begins by examining the harmful effects of traditional cookstoves and fuels. This includes (1)
an assessment of the economic opportunity cost of traditional cooking for the region and (2) an aggregation of
never previously linked research on the economic, social, health, and environmental harms resulting from Africa’s
dependence on solid fuels. We then review the potential of existing clean and improved stove technologies to
mitigate these harmful effects in SSA.


The Harmful Effects of Solid-Fuel Cooking and Traditional Cookstoves
Reliance on solid fuels and inefficient cookstoves imposes significant costs on SSA. More than 700 million
Africans (82%) depend primarily on solid fuels for their cooking needs, and the penetration of clean cooking
technologies in this population is negligible (<0.1%).8 The mid-range economic value of the resulting health,
economic, environmental, and gender-equity externalities is a staggering US$40 billion annually (US$5–58
billion) or 3% of the region’s annual gross domestic product (GDP). 9 This chapter addresses each area in turn.

Health
The release of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other harmful products of incomplete combustion
(PIC) from solid-fuel cooking is strongly linked to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, cataracts, and low
birth weights.10 Across these illnesses, household air pollution (HAP) contributes to at least 581,000 premature
African deaths per year and the loss of more than 26 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), out of a
global total of 4.3 million deaths (2012) and 110 million HAP DALYs (2010).11 In SSA, HAP was the second-highest
risk factor for DALYs and the third-highest driver of premature deaths in 2010—a ranking likely to increase in
the next revision of the Global Burden of Disease database (Figure 2). In absolute terms, the level of HAP-related
mortality in Africa already exceeds SSA public health crises, such as tuberculosis (TB); globally, HAP deaths
exceed the mortality burden from HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria combined.12
Other health effects of solid-fuel cooking not quantified in this total, with varying degrees of epidemiological
evidence, include asthma, TB, adverse pregnancy outcomes, pediatric sleep disorders, depression, bacterial
meningitis, a variety of moderate-to-severe physical injuries associated with firewood collection, burns, and
widespread minor ailments from smoke inhalation, such as eye irritation and headaches.13 The negative health
effects of cooking with low-quality kerosene cookstoves in Africa are likewise not included in current disease
estimates, but could be substantial.14

Aside from differences in fuel preferences, cooking technologies, and general health outcomes, the wide
disparities in HAP-related morbidity also stem from differences in household cooking behavior. For instance, the
proportion of households cooking outdoors—typically presuming that better stove ventilation results in lower
exposure to particulate emissions—is highly culture-dependent, with major differences across SSA (Figure
4). These differences suggest that the importance of public efforts to improve access to clean and improved
cooking solutions, relative to other drivers, such as economic and climate change impacts, will vary significantly
by country.

Economics
African households dedicate a significant portion of their expenditures (7% on average) to lighting and cooking
energy (Figure 5). The largest economic impact falls on the urban poor, who spend 15–20% of their monthly
incomes on high-cost cooking fuels, such as charcoal, in some urban slum areas.15 Because of the inefficiency of
existing cookstoves and fuels, total fuel spending has risen to US$10 billion annually, or half of the total African
household cooking fuel bill of US$20 billion—an amount that will more than double in the coming decade if
current price and fuel-consumption trends continue.16
Africans also waste billions of potentially productive hours on avoidable fuel-collection tasks and—due to the
slow cooking time of traditional solid-fuel cookstoves—suffer an efficiency loss of roughly 40 million potentially
productive person years annually.17 For an individual African firewood-gathering household, the average time
spent on fuel collection daily ranges from just under 1 hour to more than 5 hours, with a regional average of 2
hours spent on the task daily (Figure 6)—an immense loss of human productivity.

Environment and Climate Change
The production and use of solid fuels for cooking lead to the consumption of more than 300 million tons
(MT) of wood annually across SSA.18 Of this amount, the wood harvested for charcoal production (130–180 MT
annually) contributes to forest degradation, biodiversity loss, and, in a few instances, localized deforestation.19
In terms of climate change, SSA solid-fuel use and charcoal-fuel production generate 120–380 MT of carbon
dioxide (CO2)-equivalent of Kyoto protocol greenhouse gases (GHGs) (0.4–1.2% of global CO2 emissions) and
up to 600 MT CO2-equivalent, including non-Kyoto PIC (Figure 7).20

Solid-fuel cooking in SSA also accounts for 6% of global black carbon (BC) emissions. The impact of BC
emissions—the granular form of pure carbon that is the primary component of soot—is an important area of
research because BC emissions contribute to local climate change and may be an important anthropogenic
driver of global warming.21
Aside from issues associated with solid-fuel consumption, there are (1) inefficient biomass fuel production
technologies, such as low-efficiency charcoal kilns, and (2) governance challenges across traditional biomass
supply chains—including lack of sustainable forestry management, high rates of informality, poorly targeted
taxes, and supply bans—that hinder the sustainability of traditional cooking approaches.22 These challenges
must be addressed as part of any holistic clean cooking interventions.
The scale and severity of the environmental impacts of traditional biomass cooking are likely to vary greatly
across SSA. Likewise, climate-forcing emissions from traditional solid-fuel cooking are not spread evenly. Five
large countries account for half of the solid-fuel-linked emissions in the region, and the top-10 SSA countries
account for two-thirds of the emission-related impacts.23
Figure 8 shows one potential way of visualizing the relative environmental threat potential across SSA. The
intensity of woodfuel harvesting is shown on the vertical axis, and existing deforestation pressures appear on
the horizontal axis. The bubble size reflects a country’s total woodfuel (charcoal and firewood) consumption
from biomass cooking. The total solid-fuel population size is highly correlated with the GHG and BC emission
potential of each country, and also shows the relative scale of the deforestation and degradation challenge
across geographies.

The figure shows clearly that a number of Africa’s largest countries—such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and
Uganda, as well as several smaller Sahelian nations—fall into the highest woodfuel biomass pressure zone. In
this zone, high rates of deforestation are accompanied by significant use of woodfuel for cooking. While the
two variables may not be directly related, it is reasonable to presume that the risks of woodfuel scarcity are
higher in those geographies where the two trends coincide. There is also a wide intermediate zone of countries
where the likelihood of forest degradation effects is significant, especially for those countries using a significant
portion of their national stocks for cooking. For a number of countries in the “low-pressure” zone, biomass
scarcity and forest degradation may still be significant issues at the subnational level, even if the effect is not
visible in the aggregate. Furthermore, recent research suggests that, in countries like Rwanda, the official Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) forest cover data used in this analysis may significantly
understate actual deforestation rates.24

Gender Equity
The negative effects of traditional solid-fuel cooking on gender equity are clear (Figure 9). Women bear
a disproportionate burden of the costs of solid-fuel cooking because of their primary responsibility for fuel
collection (in most markets), cooking duties, and greater risks of physical injury and sexual violence during fuel-
collection trips.25

Notably, despite women’s greater proximity to cooking fires, new epidemiological evidence suggests that in
absolute terms, men and boys bear a slightly higher burden of HAP-related disease because of the generally
higher background mortality and morbidity rates in the male population.26 In addition, roughly half of
the solid-fuel HAP disease burden falls on children under the age of five.27 Other negative social outcomes
include decreased educational opportunities for children, particularly girls; impaired nutrition resulting from
the diversion of scarce resources to fuel purchases; and the aesthetic disutility of kitchens, dishes, and home
environments damaged by smoke and soot.28


The Harm-Mitigation Potential of Clean and Improved Cooking
Solutions
A range of cooking technologies can mitigate these harmful effects, but there is no ideal solution for all
users. At the level of an individual cookstove, the potential to address the harms of traditional cooking varies
greatly by impact objective, cooking technology, and the quality of the specific cookstove. Although a range
of basic improved solutions can generate significant fuel and time savings for biomass consumers, climate
benefits are harder to capture and are limited to only a subset of clean cooking technologies. In terms of health
effects, only the very cleanest cooking solutions can address the severe harms of long-term exposure to HAP.
Appendix 1 discusses the relative benefits of improved and clean cooking solutions compared with a traditional
biomass stove (e.g., a three-stone fire) for the most common impact dimensions in the literature.
While different technologies have their own advantages, there is no universally applicable answer to the
challenges of solid-fuel cooking. The ideal solution will vary based on market circumstances and on the social
impact deemed most important. Even when the relative benefits of different solutions are clear, extrapolating
from the features of an individual stove to market-level impact potential is difficult due to the complicating
factors of stove and fuel affordability and consumers’ willingness to adopt a specific technology. Many of the
cleanest solutions from a health standpoint (e.g., biogas, LPG, electricity), which feature quick cooking times
and other desirable features, such as safety and durability, are also the most expensive, limiting their uptake at

scale. Cleaner solutions, on the whole, also require more behavior change on the part of the consumer relative
to baseline cooking technologies. Therefore, any generalizations about the best solution must also take into
account an assessment of the possibility of adoption at scale.
The following sections review in more detail what we currently know about the cooking solutions available
in the African market in terms of economic benefits, environmental and climate change benefits, and health
effects.

Economic Benefits
Fuel savings are both the most achievable and the most tangible benefit of clean and improved cooking
solutions. Program evaluations and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Africa show that, while “legacy”
biomass chimney cookstoves typically generate limited fuel savings under real-world conditions over long time
periods,29 well-designed, basic ICS can lead to meaningful savings in fuel and collection time. These savings
are in the range of 20–35%,30 and 35–65% for the portable wood and charcoal intermediate ICS that are the
focus of large-scale Africa distribution efforts by such companies as Envirofit, Ezy Stove, EcoZoom, and Burn
Manufacturing.31 Results for intermediate built-in brick and mud rocket ICS of the type that have been distributed
at scale in such countries as Kenya and Uganda are comparable.32
Self-reported field evidence from Africa suggests that advanced biomass ICS (i.e., fan-gasifier stoves) can match
or exceed the fuel-saving levels of intermediate ICS technologies (40–80%), particularly when paired with well-
calibrated renewable pellet fuels. Savings of 50–65% are reported for fan-gasifier stoves using standard (i.e.,
chunky biomass) fuel and more than 70% for a number of ND gasifier models.33
Actual savings at the household level over time tend to be lower than such figures suggest because, in most
cases, households continue to cook with traditional stoves alongside the new solutions. For modern and (non-
biomass) renewable cooking technologies—for instance, where full transition to the new stove and fuel should
theoretically eliminate solid-fuel use entirely—actual results in SSA pilots are more modest due to baseline
technology persistence (e.g., 30–70% biomass fuel savings for users transitioning to LPG, 66–80% for biogas, and
10–40% for solar).34
From the end user’s perspective, the relative affordability and lifetime cooking costs of various solutions are
in many ways an even more important dimension than relative fuel savings. Even if full adoption of LPG can
help eliminate household spending on inefficient and harmful charcoal, for instance, this will mean little if the
household is unable to afford the upfront costs of an LPG stove and cylinder or the ongoing costs of cooking
with this fuel. Africa-wide averages and the range of costs for key stoves and fuels are demonstrated in Figure
10. Electricity is, on average, the most expensive fuel from a total cost perspective, followed by charcoal cooking
with traditional stoves, and LPG. Renewable solutions, such as biogas and solar (not shown, as the stove does
not entail any fuel costs), have the lowest life-cycle costs. The tradeoffs between upfront costs and lifetime
cooking costs are explored in more depth later in the report in Figure 44.

Environmental and Climate Change Benefits
Environmental and climate change benefits are more challenging both to realize and to measure. Although
there is some evidence that fuel-efficient biomass cookstoves have reduced net woodfuel consumption in such
countries as Senegal, the scale of ultimate environmental impacts is unclear, given the limited empirical data on
woodfuel consumption and forest degradation.
For climate change, the impact of basic and intermediate biomass ICS is likewise uncertain, since many types of
improved cookstoves either fail to meaningfully decrease or, in the case of some rocket stoves, actually increase
net climate-forcing GHG emissions once BC and other non-Kyoto PICs are included in the calculation.
Among biomass solutions, biomass gasifier cookstoves hold the greatest promise for climate change mitigation,
given their large reductions in BC emissions (85–95%). However, more field data are needed to fully understand
their net climatic impacts. For modern energy, the climate emission benefits of LPG and electric cookstoves
are substantial at the point of fuel consumption, but are complicated by the climate costs of fossil-fuel and
electricity production—which reduce and, in some cases, may cancel out the benefits of using low-emission
modern energy sources. When adoption issues can be surmounted, renewable biogas and solar have the best

overall environmental and climate change outcomes, but the two technologies have thus far seen little success
in Africa.

Health EFFECTS
Health impacts for such serious conditions as ALRI, COPD, and cardiovascular disease are the most difficult
benefit to achieve. This is because meaningful reductions in HAP-linked morbidity and mortality require
disproportionately large reductions in emissions due to the steep slope of the exposure response curve for
particulate emissions (Figure 11).
The bottom of Figure 11, based on the best evidence available, explores the likely mapping of common
improved and clean cooking technologies in Africa against this dose-response curve.
LPG, electricity, biogas, and solar generate the highest particulate matter (PM) emission reductions vis-à-vis
open wood fires (90–99%).35 Ethanol cookstoves likewise enable significant emission reductions (85–95%) based
on field trials in Madagascar, but have not yet been conclusively linked to improved health outcomes.36
For biomass cooking, only well-performing fan gasifiers and, to a lesser extent, natural-draft gasifier stoves
approach the emission levels of LPG and hold the potential to significantly reduce the incidence and severity
of HAP-linked illnesses.37 Even the best of these gasifier technologies cannot yet fully match the performance
of gas stoves, however,38 and a number of questions about the emission abatement potential of gasifier stoves
for small PM remain unanswered.
The search is currently on for a biomass gasifier stove that can achieve an IWA Tier 4 rating for emissions. A
number of research and development (R&D) initiatives are in place, and there is optimism from some sector
stakeholders that such a technology can be developed and piloted within the next two to five years.39

What is already clear is that non-gasifier biomass cooking solutions are likely to have limited positive health
effects. Vented (i.e., chimney) rocket stoves under ideal circumstances and with full adoption can likely have
small but material health benefits (e.g., a 60% PM reduction leading to reductions of 20–35% in respiratory
illness, based on evaluation results in Guatemala).40 Unvented basic ICS and rocket ICS—this includes nearly
all stoves promoted in current African cookstove programs and carbon finance projects—likely have no or
minimal impact on serious health conditions. These technologies are not, however, entirely without health
merit, because improvements in minor maladies, such as eye irritation, headaches, and respiratory discomfort,
are widely reported by basic ICS users and supported by mini-RCT data.41 Broader claims about the health
benefits of ICS solutions in Africa must be interpreted with caution.

Combining the Health and Climate Dimensions
Combining potential health and climate impacts of stove emissions, Figure 12 illustrates the directional
impacts of the most common SSA cooking solutions, with the white dotted zone lines indicating approximate
provisional ISO/IWA emission tiers. The horizontal axis shows the relative health performance of different stove
technologies, while the vertical axis focuses on the global warming potential of each technology.
The resulting positioning of different solutions requires several qualifications. First, the high health rating of
kerosene is deceptive, as the analysis does not account for many harmful particles of kerosene combustion,
such as polycyclic hydrocarbons. The climate impacts shown for fossil fuels reflect emissions only at the point
of fuel consumption (i.e., emissions from the cookstove during the cooking process), whereas actual climate-
warming impacts can be much more negative, particularly in cases where the fuel is produced via inefficient
methods (e.g., electricity generated via traditional charcoal-powered plants). It is also important to note that the
averages shown in Figure 12 may obscure the wide range of emission performance for these technologies, as
can be seen in Appendix 11.

     3. Climate impact of electric and LPG stoves only includes CO and particulate emissions at point of fuel consumption; production of these fuels may have
     signi cantly negative climate e ects e.g., in the case of electricity production from coal combustion but such climate costs vary across countries and
     are di cult to estimate.
     4. Kerosene stove results re ect measured PM and CO emissions and do not incorporate potential kerosene carcinogen e ects.

Even with such qualifications in mind, Figure 12 makes it clear that—in the case of full displacement of baseline
technologies by the new cooking solution—such technologies as solar, biogas, LPG, electric stoves, and to a
lesser extent fan- and ND gasifier stoves (ACS) produce the best health and climate outcomes.
Regrettably, as Figure 13 shows, in most instances the cleanest and greenest cooking solutions are also the
ones that have either higher upfront costs or higher lifetime usage costs, or both. Achieving significantly
greater penetration of clean cooking technologies will therefore require either (1) improving the affordability of
existing clean cooking solutions (e.g., via financing to reduce upfront costs and, potentially, subsidies to improve
ongoing affordability), or (2) creating lower-cost variants of stove and fuel technologies.
Currently, from an annualized cost perspective, using modern-fuel and renewable biofuel solutions, such as
LPG, electricity, kerosene, and ethanol, results in very high costs that are unaffordable for the vast majority of
Africans. Basic and intermediate biomass ICS (shown in light and dark blue) have low-to-moderate annualized
usage costs, but also—with the exception of the highest-performing charcoal stoves—limited health benefits.
Clean solutions, such as solar and biogas, and near-clean solutions, such as fan- and ND gasifiers (ACS), have
relative low annualized costs. However, as is clear from the second chart in Figure 13, many of these solutions
are still unaffordable for the majority of African consumers in the absence of financing or subsidies, given their
high upfront costs.
The way forward must therefore involve either increased clean stove affordability or the continued migration of
lower-cost biomass solutions to higher levels of emission performance.

Demand for Clean and Improved Cooking
Solutions
Although the case for deploying clean and improved cooking solutions in SSA grows stronger by the day, there
is still little comparable, up-to-date information on the African cooking fuel and stove demand landscape. This
chapter reviews trends in the region’s cooking fuel mix and fuel demand, provides a forecast for fuel demand,
progresses to an in-depth segmentation of the African cooking consumer, and then concludes with an overview
of key cooking demand drivers and barriers specific to the region.


Demand Landscape for Household Cooking Fuels
The share of SSA households dependent on solid fuels stands at 82%, the highest level among developing
regions (Figure 14).42 Globally, the use of solid fuels for cooking has declined from 50% to 40% of households
since 2000; in Africa, by contrast, it has stagnated at more than 80% since at least the mid-1990s.43 In such
countries as Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, longitudinal survey data
show that demand for modern fuels has declined in relative and even absolute terms in recent years because
of rapid population growth, escalating fuel costs, and fuel supply interruptions.44 This has resulted in the rapid
growth of biomass-dependent households.

The level of solid-fuel dependence varies across SSA countries and between rural and urban areas. As Figure
15 shows, across SSA, wood (66%) and charcoal (13%) are the primary cooking fuels, followed by kerosene
(7%), electricity (6%), and LPG (5%). The “other” category in the figure includes a number of other notable fuels.
Although animal dung plays a minor role in the region overall (less than 1.2%), it is locally important in such
countries as Ethiopia, Lesotho, and Senegal. Coal use is likewise low in the region (1.2%) in absolute terms , but
is locally important in such countries as South Africa and Sudan.

                                                Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
The use of crop waste for cooking is widespread, particularly in West Africa, but is typically captured under wood
biomass or “other” categories in survey statistics and, therefore, is difficult to quantify.
As a general trend, solid-fuel use predominates in rural areas; only 6% of rural households rely on modern fuels
for their primary cooking needs, as opposed to 36% of households in urban areas.
By subregion, solid-fuel dependence is most acute in East and Central Africa. However, even in Southern
Africa and West Africa, where urban modern-fuel penetration is moderate to high, the vast majority of rural
households continue to depend on biomass cooking (Figure 15). The situation is particularly dire in a quarter of
SSA countries, where more than 98% of all households cook exclusively with solid fuels.
Primary fuel data must be interpreted with caution—there are more modern-fuel users in Africa than is
usually assumed, but the number of exclusive users of modern cooking fuels is very small. Even when SSA
households own modern-fuel stoves, many continue to use traditional or minimally improved biomass stoves
in parallel—a practice called “stove stacking.”45 Fuel and stove stacking are the rule across developing Africa.
In Botswana, for instance, a reported 75% of modern-fuel households use wood alongside their modern-fuel
stoves.46 Half of the households in rural and urban southwestern Nigeria combine modern (kerosene and LPG)
and traditional cooking solutions.47 Similar ratios have been reported in surveys in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya,
and Senegal.48
On one hand, this level of fuel and stove stacking suggests that the demand for clean modern fuels is much
broader in Africa than indicated by primary fuel data—such fuels as LPG, electricity, and kerosene likely reach
20–50% more households than primary modern-fuel cookstove numbers indicate.49 On the other hand, many
of these households continue to use traditional or minimally improved biomass stoves, thus losing many of the
benefits of clean cooking because even moderate exposure to particulate emissions leads to serious long-term
health effects. The number of households that use clean modern fuels, such as LPG and electricity, exclusively is
likely less than 5% of the SSA population.
The population relying on solid fuels in Africa is expected to further increase toward the end of this decade.
Historical fuel mix trends and demographic drivers, such as population growth, suggest that the number of
Africans relying on solid fuels as a primary fuel will grow to 850–900 million by 2020 (Figure 16).50
Even in scenarios of successful modern and renewable fuel scale-up, such as the achievement of the Global
LPG Partnership’s target of 70 million new African LPG users by 2018 and the Africa Biogas Partnership’s target of
biogas access for 10 million people by 2020, the SSA solid-fuel population would still be significantly higher than
today (>750 million).51 Within this overall trend of persisting solid-fuel reliance, historical fuel-mix data suggest
that charcoal will constitute a growing share of solid-fuel demand and, within the modern-fuel sector, LPG and
electricity will continue to take shares from kerosene users—important news in light of increasing evidence
about the harms of kerosene cooking (Figure 17).

Against this background of persisting reliance on solid fuels, high and rising fuel prices will be a major
demand driver for fuel-efficient biomass ICS and clean-fuel alternatives. Over 2000–2010 time period, in
nominal terms, LPG prices have risen 8% annually for key Africa LPG markets (11% globally); kerosene prices
have grown 9% annually; electricity costs have grown more slowly, but vastly exceed the cost of other cooking
fuels in most markets; and the price of ethanol, a potential alternative cooking fuel, has remained above that of
kerosene.52 Because of increasing demand and growing biomass scarcity, however, charcoal prices have grown
even faster—more than tripling in a decade (>11% annual growth). This long-term trend in fuel pricing has held
steady over the long term, with a recent spike in fossil fuel prices in 2013-2014 compensated with moderate
(10-20%) price decline for LPG and kerosene in late 2014-early 2015. Though fuel prices vary at the country level,
as of 2011 the average cost of cooking exclusively with charcoal across the SSA region exceeded the costs of
cooking with LPG and kerosene (Figure 18). This is particularly the case for the urban poor, who pay 25–70%
premiums (45% on average) for their small-unit charcoal purchases.53
Although firewood continues to be the cheapest cooking option overall, anecdotal evidence suggests that in
at least some geographies wood scarcity is increasing—with rising firewood prices, a greater share of firewood-
using households purchasing their wood, and longer collection times for firewood gatherers. Aside from
continuing to increase energy poverty, in the years to come these trends should improve the appeal of modern
fuels, increase demand for cookstoves that can save on biomass fuel, and improve the business case for such
sustainable alternatives as renewable biomass briquettes, biofuels, and biogas.

Fueled by these trends, the absolute size of the SSA cooking fuel and stove market will grow quickly. In 2010
alone, consumers spent US$20 billion across all cooking fuels in SSA—an amount that will grow to an annual
expenditure of more than US$47 billion by 2020, with such traditional fuels as charcoal and wood accounting
for more than half of this total (Figure 19).54

       spending for lighting .

Although fuel markets are magnitudes larger than the market for cooking appliances, spending on stoves is
significant and growing. Annual SSA consumer spending on cooking appliances (across all traditional, clean, and
improved technologies) is likely in the US$300–400 million range today out of a global stove appliance market
of less than US$8 billion in the developing world.55 The SSA market is small compared with global stove sales,
because of much lower SSA access to modern-fuel stoves, and the low Africa penetration of biogas digesters
(US$300–1,500 globally), which drive much of the annual spending on cooking energy appliances (e.g., 5–7
million new biogas digesters were deployed in China alone in 2012).
The large scale of the African cooking fuel markets makes it clear that SSA consumers are already spending
significant funds on cooking on an annual basis. Furthermore, the relative scale of cooking fuel and appliance
markets highlights the size of the opportunity for those private-sector players that go beyond stove appliance
sales and are able to develop effective cooking-fuel production and delivery models (e.g., green charcoal and
crop-waste briquettes, ethanol, methanol, or LPG).


African Cooking Consumer Segmentation
End-user demand and product preferences vary significantly across SSA customer segments. African
consumers are an extremely diverse group, with a range of preferences across fuel types and stove designs.
Although generalizations at the scale of a continent necessarily obscure regional- and country-level variation,
it is nonetheless illuminating to divide the African consumer into seven segments based on a combination of
income levels, urban versus rural status, fuel use preferences, and fuel procurement approaches (Figure 20).56
These segments fall into four broad groups: wood collectors (labeled in shades of red in the figure), wood
purchasers (blue), charcoal users (yellow), and modern-fuel users (green).

Familiarity with the key consumer segments and their needs is essential to developing a nuanced understanding
of the African clean and improved cooking opportunity. We will here review the segmentation in detail by
profiling each of the four broad customer segments. The detailed methodology behind this segmentation is
covered in Appendix 6.
The subsequent sections then turn to consider cross-cutting Africa demand drivers and constraints, such as
stove design, consumers’ willingness to adopt (and pay for) new stoves and fuels, and their ability to afford clean
and improved cooking solutions.

Wood Collectors
Rural wood collectors, including a small segment of nonwood biomass collectors (i.e., dung and crop waste
users), represent roughly half (48%) of African households. Most of these households (about 30% of the SSA
total) are extremely poor (BoP <500). Many are subsistence farmers and pastoralists living in remote areas with
little or no integration into the modern cash economy. Unsurprisingly, such households are difficult to reach
through existing distribution channels. Tradition is important for this segment, and achieving behavior change
requires finely tailored solutions. The fuel-saving motivation for most wood collectors is relatively weak, given
their lack of direct economic benefits from such savings.
Firewood collectors do appreciate the time savings from wood collection that can be achieved by ICS and clean-
fuel solutions, but the value placed on time savings by male household heads may not be high when the costs
are borne disproportionately by women and girls. Although the avoidance of the immediate consequences
of indoor smoke, such as coughing and eye irritation, is important to women in this segment, the longer-term
health effects are rarely understood and scarcely valued.
Middle-income (BoP 500–1,500) fuel-collector households (15% of the SSA market, or a third of this segment) can
be persuaded to adopt and pay for improved stoves, given their greater means, educational levels, and greater
exposure to markets. For the poorest wood collectors, however, ensuring adoption of improved solutions
requires significant investment in behavior change and very low or, in some cases, fully subsidized ICS costs.

Wood Purchasers
Wood purchasers, including middle-income and low-income wood buyers, constitute 20% of African
households. A third of SSA households use wood as a primary fuel (Figure 21). While the overall share of
households cooking with wood will decrease by 2020 (Figure 17), the wood-purchasing segment will likely
continue to grow as firewood collection becomes more difficult.57

Middle-income wood purchasers: Middle-income wood purchasers (10% of SSA) are mostly rural (>60%) and
are represented largely by middle-income farming households who can afford to avoid fuel-collection tasks by
paying for their wood. There are also large urban populations of middle-income wood buyers who consist of
salaried government employees (e.g., teachers), lower-income professionals, and small traders, particularly in West
African countries with large commercial urban firewood markets. Although urban households in this segment
often have access to modern fuels, such as LPG, kerosene, or electricity, adoption and use are constrained by
high fuel costs. Across both rural and urban areas, wood buyers tend to be more socially conservative and risk
averse in outlook than comparable charcoal and modern-fuel users, with the result that behavioral challenges
to transitioning to new solutions can be substantial.
More important than the barriers of custom and tradition, the economics of cleaner cooking are the biggest
challenge for this segment, as the leap in costs to modern fuels is large—an increase of 2–5 times relative to the
annual costs of cooking with biomass fuels and stoves. The breadth of this gap suggests that, in the absence
of large modern-fuel subsidies, fuel-efficient ICS are likely the optimal cooking solution for many households in
this segment. For wealthier wood purchasers, clean fuels and wood gasifier stoves are also an option, as their
disposable incomes and education make them more amenable to public health messaging.
Poor wood purchasers: Poor wood buyers (10% of SSA households), in contrast to the middle-income wood
buyers, are primarily urban and are heavily concentrated in West Africa, where there is no tradition of charcoal
cooking in most markets and firewood foraging is difficult or impossible near big cities. In urban areas, this
segment largely consists of low-wage, informal-sector workers and slum dwellers. In rural areas, households in
this segment are typically lower- to middle-income farmers.
Many poor wood purchasers (20–40%) resort to markets for only a part of their firewood needs, because purchased
wood is often supplemented by wood collection, particularly in rural areas.59 The size of this segment changes
seasonally. There is ample anecdotal evidence that fuel purchasing by the African poor increases substantially
during periods of heavy rain, when households are unable to collect sufficient firewood themselves.60
Given their income constraints, these households are highly opportunistic and primarily motivated by fuel
savings in their choice of cooking solutions. Fuel-efficient ICS, when appropriately designed, can be an attractive
solution for these consumers, but their ability to afford ICS is limited and, due to the low cost of firewood,
payback periods are likely to be long for all but the most basic ICS.

Charcoal Users
Africa is characterized by two distinct segments of largely urban households that use charcoal as their primary
cooking fuel (24 million households in SSA, 15% of the total)61—the urban charcoal-dependent poor (4%) and
middle- to high-income charcoal users (11%). Both of these subsegments will grow quickly.62
Middle-class charcoal users have some disposable income, but are often unable or unwilling to migrate to
modern fuels due to cost and access constraints. These consumers constitute a large minority in many of the
continent’s urban centers, with many concentrated in African megacities, including Nairobi, Dar es Salaam,
Antananarivo, Addis Ababa, Kampala, and Kinshasa in East and Central Africa; Maputo, Lusaka, and Lilongwe in
Southern Africa; and Accra, Bamako, Dakar, Luanda, and Abidjan in West Africa.63 While this segment is primarily
motivated by value due to the already high and fast-rising costs of charcoal, the cost of stoves and fuels is not
the sole driver of demand. Time savings, convenience, durability, and a modern appearance are important
features. These consumers can be reached by mainstream urban distribution channels and, like modern-fuel
users, already have experience with other consumer durable goods, including relatively high rates of adoption
of mobile phones, radios, low-cost televisions, and refrigerators.
The middle-income charcoal user segment is likely the most studied and best understood by commercially
minded ICS and clean-fuel promoters. It is currently the target market for most of the large urban-ICS and clean
stove enterprises in the region, and is the anchor for the vast majority of successful SSA carbon finance projects.
This segment also has the highest current penetration of improved and clean cooking technologies, ranging
from (1) basic charcoal jiko-style ICS that are the baseline charcoal cooking solution in many big urban markets,
to (2) high-performance rocket charcoal stoves in Kenya and Uganda, to (3) competing technologies like
ethanol in Mozambique; LPG in markets like Kenya, Ghana, Mali, and Senegal; and electric stoves in South Africa
and Ethiopia. The appeal of this segment is not surprising: it combines ease of access for distributors (given
the density of urban populations), strong economic incentives for fuel-efficient technologies, and sufficient

                              Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
disposable incomes to purchase stoves upfront for cash, including at relatively high price points (US$25–50).
Migrating such households to more efficient ICS or, when possible, to clean fuels remains a major commercial
opportunity.
The poor charcoal user segment is also heavily concentrated in African cities (50% urban), but otherwise has
very different needs and preferences. Although these households are part of the modern cash economy, they
are some of the poorest (<BoP 500) and most disadvantaged on the continent. Poor charcoal users are often
recent arrivals from rural areas or long-term residents of large slums and informal settlements; some live in
provincial towns, peri-urban areas, or rural regions in proximity to major charcoal-producing centers.
Disposable incomes for this segment are nonexistent, penetration of other durable goods is negligible, and
education levels are typically low. Fuel savings are the urgent and overriding motivation, since charcoal
expenditures are among their biggest monthly budget items, with fuel purchases in some cases reaching more
than 20% of monthly incomes. These households typically access charcoal via small daily (1–2-kilogram (kg) bag)
purchases. From an ongoing cost standpoint, it is the only fuel these households can afford, since falling back
on firewood collection is not an option in many urban settings. Demand for fuel-efficient solutions is therefore
likely to be high, but ability to pay upfront for fuel savings is severely constrained.

Modern-Fuel Users
The modern-fuel segment (30 million households, 17% of total)65 includes LPG (5%), electric (6%), and kerosene
(less than 7%) stove users, and comprises largely urban, middle-income consumers with moderate disposable
incomes. Though still small, this segment is projected to grow by 30–50% by the end of this decade, in line with
Africa’s increasing wealth.66
Relative to other user segments, African modern-fuel users are often better able to access clean and improved
cooking solutions via their proximity to modern retail distribution channels in urban areas. Openness to new
technologies for this segment is generally high, since such consumers have already adapted their cooking
techniques significantly for modern-fuel use. This segment expects durable, aesthetically pleasing, “modern”
appliances that adequately reflect their middle-class status. These users may have the education to appreciate
the economic, health, and climate benefits of clean cooking; are typically reachable through mass media;
and have at least limited access to modern financial services via banks, microfinance institutions, savings
cooperatives, or mobile money channels.
This segment is not, however, without its clean cooking access challenges. Because unimproved or minimally
improved appliances, typically charcoal and wood stoves, continue to serve as a secondary cooking solution
in many middle-class SSA homes, many modern-fuel users continue to suffer the harmful effects of traditional
solid-fuel dependence. A large number of SSA modern-fuel households (7% of the total) cook with kerosene
stoves of variable quality that likely generate highly negative health outcomes.67 Access to modern fuels can
be difficult to arrange even for those who can afford such solutions, due to sporadic supply shortages for
kerosene- and LPG-using households and frequent electricity outages for electric stove users. Many modern-
fuel households continue to seek ways to reduce their energy bill via more efficient stoves or lower-cost fuels
as high fossil fuel prices, compounded by reductions in modern-fuel subsidies, continue to be expensive for
African middle-class budgets, even despite recent LPG and kerosene price declines across the region.
Although SSA modern-fuel users are typically not the focus of ICS promoters, the segment should not be
ignored. As modern-fuel infrastructure on the continent is extended via enabling policies and investments,
there is an immense opportunity to introduce millions of Africans to modern-fuel use and to improve the
performance and quality of such modern-fuel technologies as kerosene stoves.
Equally important, there is an opportunity to convince modern-fuel households to eliminate their secondary
biomass stoves—or, at the very least, to upgrade such stoves to intermediate or advanced ICS solutions, such as
high-end charcoal ICS and fan-gasifier biomass ACS. Modern-fuel households, due to their disposable incomes,
can be the ideal “early adopter” entry point for innovative cooking products and business models that can
ultimately reach a much broader swath of the SSA population. Targeted marketing to such households could
help social enterprises marketing cooking fuels and cookstoves establish themselves sustainably, creating
the potential for cross-subsidy business models that can serve harder-to-reach consumers. Working with the
modern-fuel segment can also broaden awareness and acceptance of new technologies among the urban
poor and rural consumers who reach for aspirational technologies.

Demand for Clean and Improved Cookstoves in SSA: Drivers and
Constraints
Although cooking preferences among African consumers vary widely, important cross-cutting demand
drivers exist for stove adoption in the region. These include the appropriateness of stove design, consumer
awareness of the new solution and its benefits, consumer trust in the vendor and confidence in the advertised
benefits of the technology, consumer ability to access the stove and fuel, and the solution’s affordability (Figure
22).68

The relative importance of these five demand drivers differs based on the specific cooking solution, as well as
the cultural context, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics of the end user. Nevertheless, a
number of common points are clear.
The primary adoption driver across all consumer segments—appropriate stove design—encompasses the
performance, quality, and appearance of the cooking solution. Among a multitude of other stove design
features, fuel savings, time savings, fit with existing cooking preferences, and durability are critical adoption


                                                                                     46

factors—with fuel savings by far the strongest motivator for stove purchase and sustained use for households
who purchase cooking fuel.70 Although well-designed stoves are built with such features in mind, sector
interviews and literature reviews suggest multiple recurrent issues in current ICS and clean stove designs; these
are reviewed later in this report.
Awareness of clean and improved solutions and their benefits is an important demand driver that has been
demonstrated to boost adoption and sustained use of new cooking technologies.71 However, levels of awareness
vary significantly by country and stove technology. All else being equal, awareness is a particularly acute issue in
markets that lack a history of large-scale ICS programs (e.g., Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria),
in remote rural areas, and for newer and higher-performing ICS and ACS technologies, such as rocket stoves
and biomass fan gasifiers, which have had limited exposure in most African markets. The challenge is not just a
lack of consumer knowledge about improved and clean stoves, but is also consumers’ willingness to internalize
such knowledge. The existence of “present bias” in poor consumers—impatience with long-term outcomes and,
correspondingly, a very low value placed on future benefits when weighing them against near-term costs—is
an underlying challenge72 that is extremely difficult to address through consumer education and awareness
raising alone. The present bias issue tends to undermine stove program-awareness efforts focused on long-
term outcomes in health (e.g., “buy a stove now to lower the risk of death in a decade”) and financial well-being
(e.g., “pay now to save more in the future”).
More important than general awareness of clean cooking solutions, there is much evidence to show that
cookstoves are a quintessential “experience good.” Consumer exposure to specific solutions is thus critical
to building confidence in new cooking technologies and trust in stove and fuel vendors.73 Poor African
consumers are by nature risk averse when it comes to the adoption of new consumer durable technologies.74
Anecdotal evidence from interviews with regional stove manufacturers and retailers suggests that risk aversion
is especially acute for poorer, more rural, and older consumers. This risk aversion expresses itself in skepticism
about the stated benefits of stove adoption (e.g., stove seller promises of quick break-even periods due to fuel
savings), and in a lack of confidence about stove durability and after-sales support.75 Given the quality issues
affecting general consumer durables in many African markets, SSA consumers’ low-risk appetite is not entirely
unwarranted when it comes to purchasing relatively high-cost products, such as cookstoves.
Even when African consumers are aware of an appropriate cooking solution, it is often unavailable or difficult
to access. Access to stoves and fuels is therefore another important factor in many settings. Although access to
basic ICS is typically not a challenge in most urban SSA environments, even basic ICS solutions do not penetrate
to remote rural areas—and access and availability issues are compounded for clean fuels and intermediate and
advanced biomass stoves.76
Finally, the issue of stove and fuel affordability is a key constraint on demand, given the very limited means and
liquidity constraints of most African consumers.77
The preceding four demand drivers (stove design, awareness, trust, and access) translate into the consumer’s
willingness to adopt a new solution. The fifth driver, affordability, equates to the consumer’s ability to pay, in
terms of both providing upfront payments for a new stove and the ability to afford ongoing fuel purchases and
stove maintenance costs relative to disposable income. In cases where the stove is marketed on a commercial
or quasi-commercial basis, all of these drivers determine the consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP), which is
informed by both willingness to adopt and disposable incomes.79
Across all five of these demand drivers, assuming that the cookstove design meets end users’ requirements, the
lack of willingness to adopt and lack of ability to pay are the overarching constraints to the initial uptake of clean
and improved cooking solutions. The relative importance of these two factors is largely an academic question;
both matter greatly, and the balance between the two depends on the specific technology and consumer
segment in question, with ability to pay and absolute affordability gaining in importance where higher-cost
solutions and poorer consumers are concerned.

African End-user Preferences for Stove Design and Performance
Appropriate stove design is a central factor to consumer uptake of improved and clean cooking solutions.
Stove design—and the resulting performance—directly affect consumers’ willingness to adopt and pay for new
stoves and are the critical determinants of sustained, long-term stove use.80 The extensive literature on Africa
cookstoves suggests that several ICS design features are particularly important (Figure 23).81

Primary Preferences
The first five design features shown in Figure 23 are the most significant. First, fuel savings—due to the increased
thermal efficiency of improved and clean cooking solutions—is the most powerful stove-adoption factor across
most SSA consumer segments, countries, and cooking technologies.82 Savings are a particularly powerful driver
for the roughly half of Africans who purchase their cooking fuel, a fast-growing group that faces increasing
pressure from rapid fuel price growth across the continent. The use of more efficient cooking solutions for such
households leads to direct and immediate reductions in household expenditures on fuel, which is a critical
consideration for cash-constrained consumers. For firewood collectors, reduced fuel use is likewise important,
as it reduces the economic opportunity costs of biomass collection, though this benefit is less direct.
Although time savings is typically rated as the second-most important adoption factor in African ICS household
surveys, it often comes first for ICS households that do not purchase their fuels—and for the users of relatively
expensive clean-fuel solutions, such as LPG, electricity, and ethanol.83 Time savings includes the reduced time
spent on fuel collection, as well as food preparation; the latter feature is common for improved and clean
cooking solutions with the highest thermal-efficiency and heat-transfer levels (e.g., biomass ACS, LPG, biofuels).

                                             Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Smoke reduction is a universally appreciated feature in end-user surveys for ICS and clean-fuel program
evaluations and commercial pilots. It is a benefit that households can easily appreciate, due to reduced eye and
throat irritation, even if they are unaware of, or uninterested in, the long-term health benefits of reduced PM
emissions.84
The fit of the stove with the user’s cooking preferences is likewise among the top demand drivers related to
cookstove design.85 This factor—often referred to as convenience, ease of use, or cooking comfort—covers a
panoply of performance and design features that often link to deep-rooted cultural beliefs and practices and
are therefore impossible to generalize across SSA. Some of the most common of these design features (see the
right side of Figure 23) include the fit of the stove with preferred pot sizes; the ease of fuel feedstock preparation,
stove kindling, and refueling; heat intensity and control to accommodate specific dishes (e.g., grilling of meat
over open flame, rather than slow heating of long-simmering dishes); the ability to access food during cooking
(e.g., for the stirring of stews);86 specific adaptations for common national or regional dishes (e.g., the ability to
accommodate the baking of injera flatbreads in Ethiopia and Eritrea); stove size and height to accommodate
the design of end-user lodgings and typical cooking posture; stove portability and the presence of chimneys to
accommodate indoor or outdoor cooking preferences; and stove impact on the cleanliness of cookware and
lodgings.
A few of these features have the potential to affect the taste of food, and changes in the taste of common
dishes arise in quantitative and qualitative end-user surveys (which is a barrier for transitioning from charcoal
for cultures where meat grilling is common). However, taste appears to be a secondary consideration relative to
other consumer behavior practices.
Overall, attention to consumer cooking preferences is essential. Experience of stove programs in Africa and
elsewhere shows clearly that even significant fuel and time savings are unlikely to salvage a cookstove that does
not fit consumers’ needs or requires dramatic behavior change.87
Stove durability rounds out the top-five adoption factors. This variable includes the actual expected life of the
stove; the need for maintenance (e.g., ceramic liner replacements for basic ICS, battery replacements for ACS,
plant tune-up and repair for household biogas plants); and the perceived durability of cooking solutions (e.g.,
sturdy build and weight).88 Durability is particularly important for households that are unable to afford frequent
replacements or maintenance.

Secondary Preferences
A secondary set of stove design features affects stove demand but is generally of lesser priority. It is important
for stove designers and manufacturers to meet the basic level of performance on these dimensions, but they
are unlikely to be the primary demand drivers for most consumers.
Stove safety, encompassing physical stove stability and the risk of burns, falls into this category and is especially
important for households with small children and for technologies where the consumer is already cognizant of
the risks of burns and explosions from such fuels as LPG and ethanol.89
Aesthetic considerations—traditionally undervalued by stove program developers, but now increasingly
becoming the focus for stove designers—likewise belong to this category, at least for now. Although stove
appearance does not rate highly relative to other adoption factors in historical evaluations of SSA region ICS
programs,90 the data are likely not representative of current stove-marketing efforts in Africa, especially those
focused on urban and peri-urban consumers. New research suggests that status considerations can be extremely
important for a subset of “aspirational” urban and rural consumers, typically those who are younger, exposed to
mass media, and integrated into the cash economy, and who are therefore more attracted to cooking solutions
that are designed and promoted as symbols of modernity and wealth. This factor is less important for older
and more traditional consumers—who are, in any case, less likely to serve as early adopters for new cooking
technologies.91
A related variable to cookstove appearance is the cleanliness of the house and dishes that results from the
adoption of improved and clean stoves. This point is a nearly universal secondary factor in systemic reviews of
stove adoption factors and regional ICS program evaluations.92
In contrast to the primary demand drivers reviewed earlier, there is strong consensus in the sector that some
of the genuine advantages of improved and clean stove design have little impact on stove demand for


                                                                49
                                Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
most consumers. Specifically, there is little evidence that most current or potential end users appreciate the
health advantages of clean cookstoves.93 The long-term health benefits of particulate emission abatement
are too remote a concern for most African households. This generally high “discount rate” for future health
benefits means that health considerations often have limited impact on stove uptake—or, more specifically,
on households’ WTP premiums to gain the incremental health benefits of new cooking technologies. While
this does not mean that health considerations are entirely unimportant in driving stove demand, experience
suggests that expectations for health-motivated uptake of clean solutions should be modest.
Similarly, environmental and climate benefits and related public-good messages with respect to clean cooking
technologies seem to be an insignificant demand driver for most Africans.94
The complexity of stove design factors and diversity of SSA consumers mean that human-centered design
innovation must remain at the forefront of efforts to increase clean and improved stove demand. Africa-
focused manufacturers of industrial ICS, ACS, and modern-fuel stoves increasingly place ethnographic research
and end-user experience at the core of their stove designs.95 Artisanal stove program developers likewise tend
to be highly sensitive to end-user preferences and often seek opportunities to tailor products to local market
niches.96 The issue of design has also received increasing attention from policy makers and the Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves.97
Despite increasing focus on design, several cross-cutting challenges to better stove design will likely persist
in the coming years in the absence of significant interventions. One such issue is that there are very little
quantitative data on the cooking preferences of African consumers and on the resulting importance of various
design features from an end-user standpoint. Such data are very costly to collect for any given market player, and
donor investment in open-source ethnographic research is only now beginning to take off. A second related
issue is that African policy makers and stove program managers, as a whole, still focus much of their energy on
“fundamental” performance parameters of fuel efficiency, emission reduction, durability, and safety—a trend
reinforced by ISO/IWA cooking standards—rather than on harder-to-capture usability features requiring a
greater understanding of local consumers and markets. Finally, the challenge lies in the heterogeneity of the
African consumer. Consumers from different regions, cultures, and customs will continue to place varying values
on different design factors. There are natural limits to the degree of customization that stove entrepreneurs can
pursue, because customized design comes at the cost of higher stove prices and reduced scalability.
While end-user design focus has become more common in the African cooking sector, many new, improved,
and clean cooking solutions continue to fall short of consumers’ requirements. From an end-user perspective,
the most common ICS and ACS design challenges highlighted in the literature and in stove entrepreneur
interviews conducted for this report are noted in Figure 23 earlier in this section. Key issues include relatively
long cooking times for many basic ICS and intermediate rocket-design ICS;98 imperfect fit with local cooking
practices, including failure to accommodate common pot sizes; inconvenience of stove refueling and fire
tending; difficulty of fuel preparation; inability to use multiple pots for larger families;99 durability concerns (e.g.,
poor quality and short life of some basic ICS);100 and actual or perceived safety challenges (e.g., poor stability).101


Willingness to Adopt and Pay for Improved and Clean Solutions
A lack of willingness to adopt improved and clean cooking solutions is a major demand constraint across
most African stove technologies and end-user segments. The design-related obstacles to cookstove uptake
discussed in the previous section are an instance of a broader challenge to stove adoption. Consumers at all
income levels have rejected improved and clean stoves, even when they have been made available to them at
no cost or at a nominal cost. For instance, there are sizable nonadopter populations in SSA cookstove program
pilots, with up to 30% of target ICS end users (Figure 24) rejecting stoves that were provided to them at no
cost or expressing no willingness to purchase them at any price after an initial trial period. This proportion of
nonadopters is similar to the experience of other global ICS distribution efforts in such countries as Bangladesh,
India, and Mongolia.102
There is less quantitative evidence for nonbiomass improved and clean cooking technologies, but anecdotal
reports from sector stakeholders suggest that similar nonadoption issues apply to clean modern fuels (LPG),
biofuels (ethanol), and biogas.103

Even more problematic is the frequently cited difficulty of convincing consumers to continue to use their
new stoves. Long-term stove trials tend to show a drop-off in use over time. This challenge has been noted
for technologies ranging from legacy stoves to basic biomass ICS, rocket stoves, natural- and fan-draft gasifier
stoves, solar cookers, biogas, and LPG. The drop-off stems from a variety of factors, including changes in fuel
prices, fatigue with required behavior change, durability issues, and inability to access or afford a replacement;
but they all highlight the fact that willingness-to-adopt issues do not end once the stove is purchased or used
for an initial period. 104
Despite these challenges, there is incontrovertible evidence of the long-term adoption and use of many
types of improved cooking solutions in SSA. For instance, evaluation data for basic efficient wood stoves and
intermediate ICS solutions suggest that in most instances, ongoing use of improved stoves is high.105 Ongoing
use and sustainability are also strong for basic, efficient clay-lined metal stove technologies (e.g., the Kenya
Ceramic Jiko), which—though they face a range of quality challenges—are on their way to being the baseline
cooking solution for urban charcoal users in such countries as Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda,
Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda. Global household-fuel surveys likewise demonstrate that modern-fuel
solutions, once adopted, tend to see continued use over the years in the absence of major fuel price shocks.106
Like stove abandonment, the stubborn cross-technology persistence of stove- and fuel-stacking behavior (using
multiple fuel and stoves in parallel, including traditional cooking solutions) indicates that low willingness to
adopt—or, at least, low willingness to fully transition away from traditional solutions—is a widespread problem
across all consumer segments (Figure 25).107

Affordability and Ability to Pay
Although many Africans can theoretically afford at least basic improved cooking solutions, high costs are
a critical obstacle for the poor and impede the overall growth of the market. The nature of the affordability
challenges varies greatly by cooking technology and consumer segment. For low-cost, basic ICS, affordability
and ability to pay are not major issues, except for the very poor. The vast majority of SSA consumers (70–90%)—
including many of those who fall below the BoP 500 income tier (less than US$1.25 per day)—are able to afford
paying US$3–7 for basic ICS, once they have access to improved stoves and are convinced of the quality and
utility of the product.108
At the same time, for many long-established ICS and clean cooking technologies, cookstove and fuel affordability
are likely the bigger near-term demand constraints relative to willingness to adopt. The affordability challenge
is especially problematic for higher-end cooking appliances and modern fuels,109 where high upfront costs
(US$75–100 for biomass fan gasifier stoves, US$50–100 for LPG and electric stove kits, US$500–1,500 for biogas)
severely limit the clean cooking market’s potential for the bottom half of the SSA market.110 The challenge is not
limited to upfront costs; for such modern fuels as LPG and electricity, the ongoing costs of the fuel can be 4 to
10 times more expensive on an annual basis than purchased firewood. However, when compared with more
expensive biomass fuels, such as charcoal, in some cases, modern fuels can be competitive, particularly where
they are unsubsidized.
The acuteness of the affordability challenge for cookstoves is sometimes dismissed by referencing the high
and growing penetration of mobile phones in Africa: more than 70% of SSA adults111 own a US$15–100 mobile
phone handset. Matching this level of mobile handset penetration would mean more than tripling the number
of SSA households (20%) that currently own intermediate ICS (US$15–30) or clean cooking solutions (US$50–100).
The analogy to mobile phone markets must be viewed with extreme caution, however, since the budgets
of resource-constrained consumers differ widely for such categories as household energy, housing, food,
communications, and entertainment. While a household may be able to afford spending more than the SSA

average of 7% of its income on household energy in absolute terms, in relative terms incremental spending
may be unaffordable, as it would mean reducing already constrained household consumption of vital goods
and services, such as food and shelter. Furthermore, while investments in improved and advanced cooking
solutions result in qualitative improvements over the traditional stove, the adoption of cell phones allows
households access to an entirely new service that had not been previously accessible. Therefore, the value of
the improvement is not comparable.
Historical purchasing behavior shows the importance of affordability as a factor. Less than 20% of SSA
consumers today have spent more than US$15–20 on their primary cookstoves.112 Shell Foundation surveys in
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, though somewhat dated, more broadly show that only 10–20% of households
in these countries purchased any consumer durable item costing more than US$30 over the course of a year.113
Therefore, the adoption of an intermediate ICS solution in the US$15–30 range implies a significant reallocation
of household budget priorities for an average SSA household. The challenge is even greater for clean cookstoves,
since the average prices of such clean stove appliances as LPG and biomass fan gasifiers (US$50–100) are higher
than the cost of an average SSA mobile phone handset (US$30–50). Furthermore, beyond stove costs, such
clean cooking solutions as LPG, electricity, and ethanol have the additional hurdle of high ongoing cooking
energy costs.115
In light of the data, it is likely that only the wealthiest 15–20% of SSA consumers can in the near term afford cash
purchases of the highest-cost clean cooking solutions (US$50–100) without major saving mobilization or major
shifts in consumer preferences.116 Households’ ability to afford intermediate ICS (e.g., industrial rocket stoves)
and lower-cost ACS (e.g., ND gasifiers) costing US$15–40 is much higher, but likely is still restricted to less than
half of the SSA population under normal circumstances.


Addressing Consumers’ Willingness to Pay
Willingness to adopt and pay for improved and clean stoves is a function of (1) consumers’ exposure to
these technologies and (2) their ability to afford them—or, in other words, the extent to which their “liquidity
constraints” can be reduced. This section discusses each of these factors in turn.

Increasing Consumer Exposure
Willingness to adopt and pay for improved and clean stoves is a function of consumer exposure to these
technologies—and can thus be influenced by stove designers and marketers. As noted earlier in Figure
24, a sizable portion of consumers will remain disinclined to convert to cleaner and more efficient cooking
technologies in the near term at any stove price. However, the experience of the SSA cookstove sector (and of
comparable BoP consumer durable technologies, such as solar lanterns) shows that stove program designers
and entrepreneurs have several tools at their disposal to influence consumer WTP.

One important tool is exposure to the new technology. Clean and improved cookstoves are an “experience
good,” a product whose benefits are difficult to appreciate prior to consumption.118 Assuming adequate design
and performance, WTP for such experience goods as cookstoves, solar lanterns, and malaria bed nets is directly
correlated with consumer exposure to the product. Evidence from the field suggests that the exposure effect
for cookstoves could be substantial. A large-scale RCT on intermediate charcoal ICS in rural and urban Uganda,
for instance, has demonstrated that consumers’ WTP doubles after one week of experience with the stove
(Figure 26).119 This is comparable with IFC Lighting Africa research on solar lanterns, where WTP for different
types of solar lanterns increased 1.3–5 times after a week of exposure.
It is important to note that uptake does not have a linear relationship to exposure. The relative benefits of
increased exposure after some initial period will taper off and, in many cases, it is entirely possible for usage levels
to fall with increased exposure as consumers learn more about the downsides of the improved technology.120
The “experience good” status of improved and clean cookstoves does mean, however, that as long as the stove
is well designed, relative to having no experience with the product, exposure will tend to improve adoption
and WTP.

Reducing Liquidity Constraints
Aside from exposure, there is also significant evidence showing that WTP can be increased by reducing
households’ liquidity constraints. In the Uganda study, moving to an installment payment option (four
payments over four weeks) led to a twofold increase in WTP. In another large-scale experiment in rural Uganda,
which focused on a rocket wood stove, a 42% increase in WTP resulted from moving to weekly installment
payments.121 A WTP study for a highly improved charcoal ICS in Mozambique likewise found a 51% increase in
WTP by moving to installment payment plans.122
When combined with a free trial, the installment plan option in the Uganda trial shown in Figure 26 led to
a twelvefold increase in uptake for both rural and urban consumers, the equivalent of a 250% increase in
the price consumers are willing to pay—a phenomenal result.123 A similar twelvefold increase in uptake has
been demonstrated for a US$16 wood rocket stove in another large-scale Uganda pilot with a free trial and
installment payment approach.124
Aside from installment payments, liquidity constraints to WTP can be minimized by designing and marketing
solutions that result in a quick payback period (i.e., the time needed for the savings generated by a new stove to
exceed upfront stove costs). Evidence in the literature on both fuel-saving cookstoves and analogous devices,
such as solar lanterns, suggests that a target of a two-month or shorter payback period is a strong rule of
thumb for minimizing liquidity constraints for the very poor, though the range of acceptable payback for most
consumers will likely be between one and six months.125
Such stove economics are feasible only with relatively low-cost solutions and where consumers already pay
substantial amounts for their baseline cooking fuels. Other tools for easing liquidity constraints to WTP include
providing upfront loans for expensive stoves,126 applying stove-leasing and fuel-utility models in which stoves
are provided with little or no cost and the value is recouped through ongoing fuel payments,127 and deploying
technology-enabled pay-as-you-go solutions in which the stove can be activated remotely when users pay
their cooking utility payment via a mobile payment or account top-up Scratch Card.128
Unfortunately, the transaction costs for many such approaches are high—often prohibitively so, given the
capital constraints and relatively low margins of many stove entrepreneurs. Figure 27 reviews the broader set
of tools that can be deployed by stove designers and marketers to maximize demand by overcoming WTP and
affordability constraints. All of these tools have been noted in the literature anecdotally but, pending further
research, their relative value is at this point unclear.
While affordability is a challenge, it is clear that the truly nonmarketable population that cannot be reached
by lower-cost commercial cooking solutions is small. Identifying likely market sizes for improved and clean
cooking solutions requires considering ability and WTP by customer segment.
African urban consumers already purchase relatively expensive fuels and can realize immediate economic
gains from switching to more efficient cooking solutions. Therefore, they will often show considerable WTP for
new stoves within their relative affordability constraints.

At the same time, most such urban consumers also have moderate, but growing, disposable incomes. When
combined, these segments (i.e., most urban modern-fuel and charcoal users) represent nearly a third of SSA
households, and should be a prime market for highly efficient and clean stoves and fuels (Figure 28). Evidence
from the field supports this hypothesis: the vast majority of profitable, unsubsidized intermediate ICS business
models in Africa focus on this segment, given its very high inherent willingness and ability to pay. For instance,
surveys in Kenya, even in poor slum areas, show that a significant share of charcoal users are willing to pay
more than US$30 for an improved stove—a substantial amount that allows users to purchase relatively high-
cost charcoal cookstoves manufactured by such companies as Envirofit and BURN Manufacturing.129 A caveat
nonetheless remains: in most countries in Africa, from a mere fuel-savings perspective, the payback periods for
such cookstoves can easily exceed an entire year of stove operation.130

Another 20% of African households rely partly or exclusively on purchased firewood and, theoretically, should
also find the fuel-saving value proposition of ICS attractive.
The remaining half of the SSA consumer market, however, consists of rural households who collect their
biomass (circled with a thick red line in Figure 28). Interviews with program developers and social entrepreneurs
who focus on these segments suggest that most of these consumers do not place a high value on the time
lost to fuel collection. Therefore, they are less motivated by the fuel-saving potential of improved cookstoves.
Even among this rural segment, however, anecdotal data from cookstove entrepreneurs suggest that the uptake
of improved stoves could be significant, though more difficult to achieve and requiring lower price points
than urban markets. Survey evidence from the Millennium Villages Projects (MVP), for instance, shows that a
significant share of consumers in rural Uganda and Tanzania (17–30%) were willing and able to pay US$17.50 or
more for quality intermediate ICS (Figure 29).131
This suggests that the absolutely “unmarketable” segment may be much smaller than is usually assumed.
It is likely that less than 15–20% of all African consumers will view improved solutions as being absolutely
unaffordable or will have no interest in adopting a new stove under any circumstances (see dotted white line
segment in Figure 28).
This does not mean that WTP challenges for low- and moderately priced ICS are immaterial. The gap between
WTP and the fair-market value of such moderately priced technologies as intermediate ICS and ACS can be
substantial in rural areas (rocket stove WTP can be 20–50% of a stove’s retail value),132 with many cooking-sector
players interviewed for this report describing both psychological and affordability barriers for solutions that
greatly exceed an upfront cost of US$10–15. Even if WTP can be improved significantly with exposure and
financing for such consumers, this will usually still mean that the cookstove entrepreneur will need to subsidize
upfront prices (e.g., by recouping costs from carbon-financing revenue streams) to see significant adoption at
scale.

Cooking Solution Supply
Chapter 2 reviewed the main determinants of demand for cooking energy in SSA, including the fuel landscape
and consumer preferences. This chapter focuses on how this demand is being served through supply—
that is, the manufacturing and distribution of stoves and fuels. Therefore, while it also touches upon issues
related to the cooking fuel mix, this chapter examines a different set of questions, including the number of
clean and improved stoves currently manufactured and distributed in SSA, their segmentation by type and
performance level, and the growth and geographic distribution of stove sales over time.133 It then discusses
stove manufacturing models, cooking-sector market structures, product and supplier economics, emerging
technology and business model innovations, and distribution approaches.


Penetration of Clean and Improved Stoves in Africa
Snapshot of Current Stove and Fuel Distribution
The penetration of clean cooking energy in the SSA region today is very limited—only one in six Africans has
transitioned to clean fuels and cookstoves for the majority of his or her cooking needs. Clean cookstoves—
defined for the purposes of this report as stoves running on LPG, electricity, kerosene,134 liquid and gel biofuels,
biogas, and solar energy, as well as retained-heat cookers and biomass gasifiers (ACS)—were the primary cooking
solutions for only 30 million African households, constituting 17% of the SSA population (Figure 30).
In 2010, the SSA penetration of modern-fuel stoves stood at 8 million for LPG/liquefied natural gas (LNG), 10
million for electricity, and less than 12 million for kerosene.135 While the number of Africans using modern-fuel
stoves as a secondary cooking solution is not known, estimates from sector experts, triangulated with detailed
survey data on multi-fuel use in such markets as Kenya and Senegal, suggest that the total number of African
modern-fuel stoves is likely 20–50% higher than the number of primary cooking appliances, translating into
10–12 million LPG, 13–15 million electric, and as many as 15–18 million kerosene stoves.136
ACS and clean renewable cooking alternatives, such as biogas, solar, and liquid biofuels, cumulatively reached
less than a half million African families by 2010 and as many as 1.3 million by late 2013.137 The most recent
figures available (late 2013/early 2014) show that the penetration of advanced biomass cookstoves is at a very
early stage, with 40,000–100,000 natural- and fan-draft gasifiers distributed across pilot project sites in Africa.138
Biogas stoves (about 50,000),139 biofuel (ethanol, methanol, and ethanol gel) stoves (about 350,000),140 and
processed solid-fuel briquettes and pellets (about 25,000 end-user households)141 have likewise seen minimal
distribution across the region. Solar cookers (about 80,000)142 and retained-heat cooking devices (600,000–
700,000) also have limited penetration.143
In aggregate, these figures overstate the true reach of clean cooking in Africa. As noted earlier in this report,
while often categorized as “clean,” a large but unknown share of the SSA kerosene stoves likely should not qualify
for the clean cooking designation.144 For many of the clean cooking products, such as solar and retained-heat
cookers, an additional complication is that many such solutions are supplemental to existing household stoves
(i.e., their adoption rarely means transition to clean cooking).
Including all basic and intermediate ICS, penetration of clean and improved cooking solutions is roughly a
quarter of the SSA market potential. National surveys and self-reported regional and country-level data sets

from manufacturers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), donors, and governments145 suggest that by 2011,
20 million African households owned biomass stoves that met the broadest possible definition of an improved
cookstove.146 This grand total included 7.4 million households with basic ICS and 4.4 million with intermediate
ICS; another 8 million households cooked with legacy stoves. Accounting for multiple basic ICS stoves per
household, the total number of improved and legacy stoves on the SSA market was likely in the 20–22 million
range.147 This is roughly 10% of the more than 200 million legacy and improved solid-fuel cookstoves globally.148
The remainder of biomass-dependent Africans use traditional unimproved biomass stoves as their primary
cooking device. Although most of these are home-built, three-stone fires (more than 75% of all traditional
stoves) and unvented mud stoves, the traditional stove category also includes 15–30 million low-cost (US$0.5–5)
metal unimproved charcoal stoves—like the malgache stoves in Burkina Faso and unimproved metal coal pots
in Ghana—that are typically purchased by households directly from artisanal producers in village markets.149
Excluding the legacy stove segment for conservatism (because such stoves are unlikely to offer measurably
stronger performance than traditional cooking solutions),150 the aggregate penetration of improved stoves
was 7%, for a total clean and improved 2010–11 penetration of 24% of all SSA households. As explored in the
following section, the share of clean and improved stoves is growing and may surpass 27% by 2013.

Cookstove Market Dynamics
The SSA clean and improved cookstove market is seeing strong overall growth; LPG and electric stoves are
gaining share, and dissemination of intermediate and basic ICS is growing rapidly. Most segments of the
SSA market for clean and improved cooking solutions are growing more rapidly than the region’s population
at large. Figure 31 provides an overview of the growth trends for major SSA cooking technologies extrapolated
from self-reported sales data from dozens of stove manufacturers, distributors, and cookstove programs. These
trends show that individual stove market segments are growing quickly.151

Clean modern fuels: As noted in the fuel demand section earlier in this report, clean modern fuels are slowly
becoming more available (Figure 32) and are stimulating stove sales as middle-class incomes rise, particularly
in the LPG and electric stove markets. Extrapolating from long-term fuel-use trends, LPG and electric stove
numbers are growing by 5% annually from the 2010 baseline, while the number of kerosene stove users will
likely continue the slow decline experienced over the past few years, due to the suspension of kerosene
subsidies in key markets, such as Nigeria.152

Contrary to the regional trend, LPG adoption has slowed in some markets, due to subsidy reductions and
infrastructure bottlenecks that have led to fuel shortages and price spikes.153 More recently, LPG adoption
appears to be increasing rapidly in several markets like Kenya as consumers react to falling LPG prices against
the background of continuing high charcoal prices in urban areas. Even faster growth of this market seems
possible because the Global LPG Partnership—a public–private alliance with an ambitious target of transitioning

50 million developing-world consumers to LPG by 2018—is launching an intensive set of market development
activities in several SSA countries, starting with Cameroon, Ghana, and Kenya.

Markets for Renewable Cooking Fuel
Markets for renewable cooking fuel in Africa are at a very early stage of development. The market penetration
of biogas digesters has grown from a few thousand units across the region five years ago to 40,000 units by early
2014, driven largely by the efforts of the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme (ABPP) in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Progress has been slower than initially expected, but the program has recently
secured a new round of funding and is planning to launch a second phase of work (2014–17) to promote the
construction of an additional 100,000 biogas units in its core countries and in additional geographies, such as
Benin, Cameroon, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
The liquid and gel biofuel stove market has seen some significant investments in recent years. Despite the
uptake of about 350,000 ethanol stoves across SSA by the end of 2013—largely in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa—the track record of commercial efforts has been mixed. One of the
best-funded ventures in this sector, CleanStar Novozymes Mozambique, was recently liquidated by its investors.
Despite selling more than 30,000 stoves, the company was unable to achieve the stove penetration required
to make the venture financially viable for its investors, given high marketing costs and the extensive (40–50%)
subsidies embedded in the sales price of the Domestic CookClean ethanol stove used in that effort. The venture,
under the NDZiLO brand, is still continuing on the ground, with some success with a new business model and
under local ownership. CleanStar is also continuing its activities in the sector, with a new ethanol venture in pilot
stage and is slated for a launch in Kenya in 2015. Other ethanol gel businesses, such as BioHeat/BioCorp (South
Africa), Consumer Choice Limited (Kenya), and ThermoSafe (Nigeria), are seeing steady growth. Some, such as
Nigeria-based Green Energy & Biofuels (“KIKE Green Cook” stove), already report reaching significant scale, with
up to 200,000 stoves reported in multiple West African countries in just three years of operations.
The market for briquette and pellet fuels, although at an early stage, is attracting investment, with new
consumer-focused pelletizing and briquetting factories launched in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana,
Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and elsewhere (Figure 33). This is a major step forward
alongside longstanding artisanal briquette manufacturing initiatives promoted by NGOs.
The African solar cooker market is growing, but slowly. Despite efforts by a number of dedicated NGOs and
entrepreneurs, it has seen few major new projects in recent years in terms of private-sector or donor investments.
Cumulatively, the various NGOs (e.g., Solar Cookers International) and private-sector players in this sector are
deploying fewer than 10,000 new solar cooker units annually across the region.
Finally, retained-heat cooking, while still a small niche, has grown with the adoption of the WonderBag in
South Africa and ambitious plans by Native Balance, the WonderBag’s manufacturer and promoter, to expand
distribution across Africa in the coming five years.

Improved and Clean Biomass Cookstoves (ICS and ACS)
The African improved and clean biomass cooking market is still dominated by legacy stoves and basic ICS, but
sales of more efficient ICS are growing quickly, and much cleaner (ACS) biomass stoves are moving toward
broader rollout. A review of the ICS market’s composition over the past three years illustrates the region’s
changing biomass stove landscape (Figure 34).

Legacy stoves and basic ICS account for more than 80% of all improved and clean biomass stoves in SSA. Legacy
stoves (~8 million) are a difficult market segment to quantify. The category includes mud chimney stoves (more
than 6 million units), such as the vented mud stoves in Malawi; Malagasy chimney wood stoves in Madagascar;
and enclosed low-efficiency nonchimney mud stoves of the type that have been commonly distributed in
Ethiopia (less than 2 million).156
Within the basic ICS segment (8–10 million), the most common technology is the Kenya Ceramic Jiko and
analogous charcoal ICS, which is manufactured via artisanal and semi-industrial providers across the continent.157
Basic wood ICS158 were a smaller but, at 2.5–3 million units, still substantial segment in 2011. Both of these segments
received strong donor support through such initiatives as GiZ ProBEC, the EnDev program, the activities of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), and a range of stove-dissemination projects led by NGOs, such as Practical Action, Enterprise Works/
Relief International, Mercy Corps, Peace Corps, Care International, Concern Universal, and World Vision.
The intermediate ICS (4.4 million) segment in 2011 consisted of portable rocket-style stoves designed for
charcoal (less than 0.1 million) and wood (0.5 million) fuels and much larger subsegments of built-in rocket
stoves, such as the Tanzanian Okoa, the Ugandan Rocket Lorena, the Kenyan brick rocket, and the Malawi TLC
rocket (1.7 million), as well as specialized rocket injera stoves (1.8 million), such as the Ethiopian Mirt and the
Eritrean Adhanet Magogo.
Finally, ACS were practically nonexistent in Africa in 2010–11, at a maximum numbering in the tens of thousands
across various pilot sites around the SSA region.
Comparing the 2011 landscape with the situation in early 2014, it is clear that the market has undergone
some significant shifts—an evolution that points to important trends for the coming years. Legacy stove
penetration has continued its stagnation or decline (depending on country), as households increasingly
abandon old stoves that are no longer being supported by government and NGO efforts.159 Basic charcoal ICS
penetration is growing at a rapid pace, as semi-industrial manufacturers, NGO–intermediated artisan collectives,
and individual artisanal entrepreneurs continue to scale up production to meet the demand caused by growing
urbanization, accelerating charcoal use, and quickly rising charcoal prices.160 Basic wood ICS adoption has grown
more slowly, with the fastest growth tracked as part of ICS promotion programs. One example of the latter is the
rise of basic wood ICS penetration in urban Burkina Faso households to 10% from nearly zero over the past few
years as part of the FAFASO program.161
In absolute terms, the most dramatic increase in rocket stove sales and dissemination is illustrated by the
doubling of the penetration rate of intermediate (i.e., rocket stove) ICS technologies in Africa, from roughly 4
million in 2011 to 8 million by the end of 2013.162 There are several causes for this acceleration: the maturation
of international rocket stove manufacturers in the past few years as they perfect their products and extend their
distribution networks; the on-shoring of production in Africa during 2012–14 by major players in the rocket
stove segment, such as Envirofit, EcoZoom, and BURN Manufacturing; the growing scale of domestic semi-
industrial firms, such as Ugastove in Uganda and Toyola in Tanzania (both with small but growing wood rocket
stove businesses); the shift to rocket stove promotion by national programs in some geographies; and the rapid
growth of carbon-financed projects across the region in 2012 and 2013, which significantly enhanced profits for
distributors of wood rocket stoves.
The growth in rocket stove sales is expected to continue, given the major investments in manufacturing scale
by several rocket ICS producers in 2013–14;163 the growing portfolio of rocket stove technologies offered by
the largest carbon program developers, such as Impact Carbon; and the explicit new commitments to rocket
stoves (both funded and still seeking funding) by national programs—such as Rwanda’s partnership with Del
Agua Health and EcoZoom to distribute 600,000 rocket stoves to poor households across the country over an
18-month period starting in 2014.164
Finally, for ACS solutions, while it is premature to talk about distribution or sales growth trends, given the early
stage of the marketing efforts of the key players, the number of stoves on the market has increased to up to
100,000 stoves, and a further accelerated pace of distribution is anticipated as ACS manufacturers and ACS-

Trends in Stove Distribution
The distribution of clean and improved cooking solutions is highly uneven across SSA, skewing heavily to
urban areas, charcoal users, and a handful of countries with more developed stove and fuel markets. The
good news of fast-growing access to ICS and other clean cooking solutions in Africa appears less rosy when one
considers the highly inequitable patterns of access.
Considered in terms of the urban/rural split of penetration and sales, access to clean and improved stoves is
significantly higher in urban areas than in rural Africa. Excluding legacy stoves, nearly half of urban Africans
own some form of clean or improved stove, compared with less than 10% of the rural population (Figure 35).
Greater urban ICS adoption is also reflected in the much greater SSA penetration of ICS among charcoal (23%)
rather than wood (13%) users, since charcoal is the quintessential urban solid fuel. The trend is most notable in
such well-developed ICS markets as Kenya, where such basic charcoal ICS as the Kenya Ceramic Jiko have now
become the new baseline technology (used by 70% of overall charcoal users and 80–90% of charcoal users in
such cities as Nairobi and Mombasa), but wood ICS penetration among firewood users is significantly lower (less
than 10% in 2004, up to 30% in 2010) (Figure 35).165

The uneven pattern of distribution is also obvious for stoves running on modern fuels. National household
survey data show that just five countries across SSA contain 56% of LPG stove users, 74% of kerosene stove
users, and 90% of electric stove users.166
These disparities, when both “clean” and “improved” cooking solutions are combined, translate into very uneven
coverage across Africa. Penetration of clean and improved solutions stands above the 50% mark in only 10 SSA
geographies, typically represented by relatively more developed nations, such as Botswana, Kenya, Senegal,
and South Africa. The combined share of households using clean and improved stoves in these 10 countries
is nearly half of all improved and clean stoves in Africa. In a full quarter of SSA countries, less than 10% of the
population used anything other than traditional fuels and stoves for cooking in 2010–11 (Figure 36).

Structure of the Cookstoves Manufacturing Sector
While the African cookstoves sector is currently dominated by artisanally produced cookstoves, industrial
and semi-industrial manufacturers are rapidly gaining in scale and market share. Improved and clean biomass
cookstoves can be categorized into three methods of production: artisanal, semi-industrial, and industrial
(Figure 37).

Terms and attributes describing industrial production models are often used inconsistently. For the purpose
of this report, industrial production is defined as scalable manufacturing that relies on a large degree of
automation, precision tools, sophisticated materials, highly skilled and trained workers, and rigorous quality
control. Industrial manufacturers are also likely to have significant in-house R&D capabilities, though in the case

of Africa-based production and assembly, the R&D capacity may often reside outside the continent in such
locations as Europe, the United States, and Asia.
Artisanal production is manual, with self-trained or minimally trained artisans (often individual micro-
entrepreneurs in the informal sector), indigenous materials, simple designs, and much weaker quality control
measures. In their most sophisticated form, intermediated artisanal models (e.g., EnterpriseWorks and Tatedo)
rely on decentralized production models (i.e., individual artisans), but with an overlay of centralized procurement,
quality control, and sales provided by an NGO or social enterprise.
Semi-industrial production is the most difficult mode to define. It ranges from relatively low-skilled assembly of
prefabricated components to domestic manufacturing with moderate levels of automation. Tools used for semi-
industrial production will typically include flanging, bending, and rounding machines for metal works; folding,
drilling, and welding sets for stove assembly; and extruders and improved kilns for liner production. Unlike the
industrial assembly-line process, semi-industrial manufacturing will typically have a workshop workflow with
multiple artisans/workers working in parallel on individual stove construction and finishing. Figure 38 reviews
key features of each of these modes of production.

Although each mode of production has its own sets of challenges, there are common themes. These
include the growth of materials and labor costs affecting overall product affordability, the difficulty and cost of
distributing stoves to the last mile, and—though the size and nature of the financing needs differ dramatically
by segment—a lack of access to capital markets.
Artisanal and small-scale semi-industrial players, in particular, contend with low margins, rising materials
costs (particularly for metal components), low managerial and business planning capacity, and lack of working
capital financing. Most critically, there are also significant quality control issues, which include the high cost and
logistical challenges of accessing stove-testing services, and the limited technical ability of producers to ensure
the quality of their products as they increase production.167

The quality control issue—combined with the growing economic pressures on small artisans and artisan
collectives, and, historically, a lack of standards in African cookstove markets—has led to widespread quality and
market spoilage issues. Many artisanally produced stoves in the field suffer from significant performance and
quality challenges, including poor durability (e.g., short 3–12-month shelf lives before cracking); poor safety (e.g.,
they flip over easily, causing burns); and weak standardization of materials and designs, leading to fuel-efficiency
levels that are far below potential.168
Semi-industrial manufacturers, which are typically relatively sizable family businesses, share some of the
challenges of artisanal markets, but have specific issues, which include limited managerial and business planning
capacity to scale beyond starting models, pressure on both labor and materials costs, and very poor access to
financing due to their lack of formal business banking relationships and traditional collateral.
For industrial manufacturers, in contrast, the biggest challenges are the high cost of materials and production
relative to highly income-constrained consumers; high import duties and taxes for bringing imported stoves
and components into most African geographies (in some countries, end users face a 40–60% mark-up in stove
prices when all taxes and fees are accounted for); and the cost and complexity of building large-scale distribution
channels (or tapping into existing channels) to reach target consumers.
The composition of the market is changing quickly across these three production approaches. Excluding
legacy cookstoves, which are typically built by the users themselves, about 90% of biomass ICS and ACS sold
in Africa annually have been produced by artisanal methods in local workshops or built on location by trained
masons. Semi-industrial and industrial stoves account for roughly 5% of annual production and sales each.
The sales mix across the three production methods is changing quickly. Manufacturer and stove program data
for Africa suggest that industrial and semi-industrial stove enterprises and programs have had much more rapid
annual sales growth (35–200%) relative to the annual sales growth trend of 10–25% for the artisanal sector
over the past five years. Factoring in replacement sales, these growth trends suggest a significant expansion of
improved industrial and semi-industrial stove manufacturing capacity in Africa over the past 5–10 years, albeit
from a very low base.
Such growth of semi-industrial and industrial manufacturing share is encouraging given the relatively higher-
build quality levels of such cookstoves. Projecting these trends forward, even with very conservative growth
assumptions, points to a rebalancing of the market toward industrial and semi-industrial solutions (for instance,
20–30% of annual biomass stove sales in 5 years versus 5–10% today).
Irrespective of such rebalancing, after decades of basic ICS technology promotion by donors and NGOs, the
artisanal sector in Africa is large and, in the case of such technologies as the Kenya Ceramic Jiko, predominantly
self-sustaining. There are commercially driven artisanal production sites across the region, and particularly large
artisanal production clusters exist in such countries as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda
(Figure 39).
In contrast, the promise of the industrial and semi-industrial production revolution in cookstoves manufacturing
is reflected in the growing universe of such manufacturers across the region: more than 40 such companies
are now manufacturing or assembling their cookstoves across a dozen countries (see partial list in Figure 40).
Half of these companies started their Africa operations or entered the cookstoves market from other lines of
business during the past five years. Others—such as CooksWell/Museki Enterprises in Kenya, Toyola in Ghana,
and Ugastove in Uganda—are veterans of the cookstove trade, with roots in the NGO- and government-led
basic ICS promotion efforts of the 1990s.
Currently, most industrial manufacturers of African improved and clean cooking appliances (ICS, ACS, and
stoves running on modern or renewable fuels) are clustered in Kenya and South Africa. Semi-industrial ICS
manufacturers, meanwhile, are present in two-dozen countries, chiefly Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda (Figure 40). Francophone Africa, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mali,
and Senegal have sizable artisanal and, in some cases, semi-industrial manufacturing hubs, but the density of
private-sector enterprise is substantially lower than in East Africa, and many players that do exist are still entirely
dependent on their affiliation with donor and national government programs.

                                             Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Important industrial factory launches in the past two years include Envirofit’s new plant in Nairobi; the launch
of the ACE factory in Lesotho (with a license to produce the Philips fan gasifier stove); the opening and scale-
up of BURN Manufacturing’s Nairobi plant; EcoZoom’s ongoing efforts to onshore its assembly and production;
BioCorp’s expansion of its ethanol stove manufacturing facilities in South Africa; and the launch of biogas plant
manufacturing in Tanzania by SimGas in partnership with Silafrica Tanzania Ltd., the largest plastics manufacturer
in East Africa.
Notable recent launches of semi-industrial manufacturing facilities include the Baker Stove/Top Third Ventures
factory in Kenya, the InStove manufacturing and assembly facility in Nigeria, the Biso Na Biso basic ICS factory
in Kinshasa, and the Soutra Fourneau factory in Côte d’Ivoire. The estimated scale of investments in these and
other comparable businesses is north of US$25 million over the past 3–4 years, with ambitious plans by several
of these players and others to move up the local production value chain from assembly to more sophisticated
component manufacturing and, within the next few years, expansion of manufacturing facilities or satellite
assembly hubs to new geographies.
Despite this progress, however, the industrial and semi-industrial sectors remain small and highly fragmented.
Fewer than 10 industrial and semi-industrial players in the entire region have reached a scale of 50,000-unit
annual sales; most produce between 2,000 and 15,000 units a year (Figure 41).

Furthermore, the number of models available from each industrial and semi-industrial manufacturer is limited,
given the subregional or regional ambitions of many of these players and the diversity of the SSA consumer. As
a point of comparison, the African solar lighting market features more than 100 solar lanterns and home system
designs and more than 60 manufacturers focused on SSA.169

Fuel Supply Trends
On the fuel supply side, the market suffers from inefficient supply chains for biomass fuel, limited investment
in alternative fuel production, and infrastructure bottlenecks for modern fuel energy. The fuel supply market
in SSA is well established. Because woodfuel value chains employ more than 15 million people in Africa—7
million in charcoal alone— they are an important source of livelihoods for many of the poorest households
across the region.170
At the same time, biomass value chains suffer from multiple market failures and regulatory challenges. These
include lack of sustainable forestry management and related forestry and land rights issues, perverse incentives
that impede sector reform (such as blanket charcoal-ban policies), high rates of sector informality (and related
leakage of potential government tax revenues), and oligopolistic and inefficient market structures that lower
overall sector efficiency and productivity (Figure 42).
The World Bank’s research suggests that there is a major opportunity to improve the sustainability of biomass
supply by addressing these challenges.171 Key steps encompass reforming and modernizing the fiscal and
governance framework for Africa’s biomass, promoting sustainable forestry management, and aggressively
promoting new, more efficient kiln technologies that reduce particulate emissions.

                     Cross-cutting challenges
                     • Lack of sustainable forestry management, potentially leading to high rates of resource depletion and
                       localized overharvesting
                     • Criminalization / periodic charcoal bans mean that information on sector is limited and ability to
                       influence sustainability is low
                     • High rates of informality account for 30-50% of end-price instead of being captured as tax revenue
                     • True economic costs of charcoal production not accounted for as wood seen as a “free” resource
                     • Disproportionate value capture by large transporters and wholesalers at expense of producers and
                       retailers, especially women

On the point of woodfuel governance reform, much-needed changes include formalizing the charcoal trade
to bring it out of the shadows, promoting sustainable forest management schemes, and rolling out sustainable
biomass certification programs.
For achieving sustainable biomass production, key aspects that need to be considered are community-based
forest management; clear rules governing sustainable lots; and the launch of innovative financing mechanisms,

such as United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) and the Forest Investment Program (FIP).172 Community-based
forest management (CBFM), in this context, means that rights and responsibilities associated with sustainable
forest management are transferred to the local level, technical oversight and capacity building is provided by
community authorities, and a share of taxes paid to the community or local government is earmarked and
reinvested for forest maintenance and local community economic development. There is a growing list of
successful donor-supported CBFM projects across Africa,173 but the scale of such initiatives and government
engagement is still very limited when considered from a regional perspective.
Finally, for the objective of improving kiln quality, major ideas include aggressively promoting new kiln
technologies (Figure 43) by creating charcoal producer groups and facilitating access to small- and medium-
sized enterprise (SME) financing and carbon finance streams for sustainable charcoal producers.

Needless to say, bringing about such deep systemic reforms is difficult. Most of these activities require significant
funding, multi-year commitments, and experimentation in difficult institutional settings. The importance of
engaging on the supply side does not, therefore, reduce the need to engage on woodfuel demand through
improved cooking technologies. Other important supply-side fuel market opportunities include the potential
for improving the supply of sustainable solid-fuel alternatives to traditional biomass, such as renewably
manufactured briquette/pellet fuels (i.e., carbonized or noncharcoal fuels manufactured from renewable
biomass, such as sustainably harvested woods and crop waste). As mentioned earlier in the report, while full
of promise, the briquette/pellet market has seen insufficient focus and investment from the clean cooking
community to date.174
In terms of modern and renewable fuels, there is an opportunity to significantly improve the uptake of both
clean fuels, such as LPG, and renewable biofuel alternatives, such as ethanol, through large infrastructure
investments and supporting regulations. Current efforts by the Global LPG Partnership are designed to
encourage this systemic change by improving upstream and midstream LPG infrastructure through both large-
scale investments (e.g., LPG storage facilities, cylinder manufacturing, cylinder-filling plants) and demand-side
interventions (e.g., consumer financing and consumer education) to drive the demand for clean cookstoves
and fuels for those consumers who can afford them. Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal are likely to
be the major focal points for such efforts.175

Cookstove Costs and Sector Economics
Improved and clean cookstove fuel and appliance costs are high and unlikely to decline over time. Relative
to the population’s purchasing power, most clean and highly improved cooking solutions in Africa feature both
high upfront costs (US$20–100 for most technologies, US$500–1,500 for household biogas plants) and, in the
case of many modern- and renewable-fuel stoves, significant annual fuel expenditures (Figure 44).
That said, cookstove prices do vary across the continent. For locally manufactured stoves, this is because of
differences in the price of labor and inputs; for imports, price differences arise from significant differences in
taxes and tariffs and transport costs. On average, West Africa tends to have significantly higher prices than East
Africa. Simple ceramic jiko-type cookstoves are 1.5–3 times more expensive in Ghana and Senegal than in Kenya,
for example, and West African countries, such as Nigeria, also feature some of the continent’s highest effective
tax and import duties for consumer durables. Across all stove types, manufacturing costs account for roughly
half of the end-consumer price, followed by distribution costs (last-mile transport and retailer margins) and
importation costs (Figures 45 and 46).

High distribution costs may decline in urban areas and as the sector reaches greater scale, but—holding quality
constant—there is no reason to expect major reductions in the manufactured cost component of ICS and
modern-fuel stoves, because both labor and materials costs for consumer durables are increasing worldwide in
real terms (i.e., faster than the rate of inflation).176
Cookstove costs are particularly sensitive to the price of steel, which has witnessed large price spikes in recent
years in both primary and scrap markets and will remain a key input for quality cookstoves in the foreseeable
future. The trend of rising prices distinguishes stove manufacturing from other off-grid energy products, such as
solar lanterns and solar home systems, where prices have fallen dramatically over the years and will continue to
decline, thanks to underlying technology improvements and trends in battery and lighting component markets.
Increased domestic manufacturing and assembly in Africa are probably the best near-term lever for reducing
cookstove costs. As shown in the following examples, this is because domestic production can reduce
international transport and tariff costs, while at the same time fostering skills and technology transfer (Figure 46).
However, mostly because of local infrastructure and capacity constraints, domestic production will not be feasible
in all African markets. Although the low-cost, scaled manufacturing of more sophisticated stove solutions—such
as fan gasifiers with thermoelectric generators, or TEGs—is still best effected in Asian manufacturing centers,
the potential for basic and intermediate stove manufacturing in Africa is large. Product simplification is another
promising lever for price reduction, particularly in the case of ND gasifier solutions which, with appropriate
controls, can be manufactured locally using semi-industrial processes (Figure 47).

                                              Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Although average margins are generally low across clean and improved cookstove enterprises, many
manufacturers have already achieved, or are on a path to achieving, profitability. They have done this largely
by drawing on carbon revenues and/or focusing on more profitable consumer segments, such as urban
charcoal users, where sustainable economics are possible without public-sector and carbon-market support.
Self-reported data from a dozen African companies across the clean and improved cooking value chain reveal
that, although overall margins are low, best-in-class industrial and semi-industrial stove manufacturers can
achieve a net income margin in the 15–25% range, while cookstove distributors—with their own sales forces
and deep reach into the last mile—can likewise approach the 15–25% profit margin range, particularly if their
businesses straddle both stove and fuel distribution (as is the case, for example, of integrated stove and pellet
fuel distribution models). Local artisans typically see 5–12% margins, though higher margins are possible in
new, less competitive stove markets. Semi-industrial manufacturers of basic and intermediate ICS consistently
achieve profit margins of 10–15%; deeper margins are possible but difficult to achieve at scale for semi-industrial
businesses once they fully penetrate their local base, as so much of their success is predicated on solutions
well tailored to local markets and strong distribution relationships with local dealers and retailers. For local
industrial manufacturers, while the trend may not apply more broadly, existing players are already achieving
higher margins than international manufacturers bringing products into the same country. This is because local
players are able to avoid taxes/import duties on their products and, all else being equal, are able to much more
quickly scale up their business models at a lower cost base.
Finally, for international manufacturers, there is a wide range of outcomes today, ranging from (1) money-
losing models that are heavily reliant on both donor and carbon-market revenue streams to (2) much more
commercially oriented models that are able to realize 10–15% profits, both by focusing on easier-to-reach and
wealthier urban segments and by supplementing their income with carbon finance profits. At this early stage
of market development, a significant portion of profits is reinvested into market expansion; however, based
on current profit margins, it is clear that higher net incomes are possible in the future, when these businesses
mature, with some targeting 20–25% gross earnings.

Technology and Business Model Innovation
Looking forward, the supply of clean and improved cooking solutions is being transformed via the
emergence of promising new technologies and business models.
In the market for nonbiomass modern and renewable cooking solutions, the most important innovations are
focused on developing lower-cost cooking appliances and relevant business models.
In the LPG market, to improve uptake by the urban poor and mass-market segments, firms have explored
business models involving small, 3-kg cylinders with integrated burners, partial cylinder refill capability, and
amortization of appliance costs built into fuel prices. Oando’s O-Gas and TechnoOil in Nigeria, EasyGas (Shell)
EasyCooka in South Africa, National Oil and Total in Kenya, and Viva Gas’s Butagaz brand in Morocco are a few
examples of African businesses promoting 3-kg cylinders to poorer consumer segments. The oldest use of such
models is the Blip Banekh stove/2.75-kg cylinder combination in Senegal, promoted by Senegal’s butanization
program since 1976. Gulf Energy’s Pima Gas in Kenya, aside from promoting very small (1-kg) cylinders, dispenses
LPG from a mobile pump and allows for partial refills with an automatic switch-off mechanism once the desired
amount has been filled. These approaches are innovative in the African context, but have precedents globally.177
While uptake of small cylinders has been relatively slow, ongoing experimentation with lower-cost LPG cylinders
and stoves is an important sign of long-term cooking-sector commitment to expanding LPG access to poorer
consumers.
Liquid and gel biofuel promoters, in an effort to manage supply-chain risks and reduce fuel costs, have piloted
new approaches to sustainable, decentralized fuel supply, such as micro-distilleries and feedstock outgrower
programs. At the same time, they have aggressively promoted the adoption of biofuel stoves for urban kerosene
and charcoal users. Building on its earlier African pilots, Project Gaia is continuing its micro-distillery and stove
promotion efforts in such countries as Ethiopia and Nigeria.178 Thus far, biofuel production models have been
attempted with limited success for such fuels as jatropha and methanol. In the ethanol cooking fuel market,
there is increasing innovation in ethanol feedstock and production processes—most notably, the innovative
approach from Green Energy & Biofuels in West Africa to produce ethanol from low-value biomass, such as
water hyacinth and sawdust, and ongoing efforts by multiple ethanol producers to improve the quality of their

products. From a cooking appliance perspective, the ethanol cooking market is still dominated by just a few
stove models, but ongoing research suggests that the efficiency and emissions performance of current ethanol
and ethanol gel stoves can be improved significantly with moderate investments in stove design.180
The biogas digester sector is seeing the arrival of household biogas plants that are cheaper, modular, and easier
to install. It is also benefiting from new distribution, promotion, and subsidy models that may accelerate biogas
household adoption, though evidence from the field is still at an early stage, and the results such efforts as the
Africa Biogas Partnership Programme have so far fallen below target. From a technology standpoint, the most
exciting innovation in this sector is the small-scale biogas plants from SimGas, a Dutch firm operating in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Zambia that is promoting mass-produced, low-cost, easy-to-install biogas digesters prefabricated
from polyethelene.181 Other innovative, lower-cost, prefabricated digester technologies at various stages of
commercialization include plastic bag digesters from EcoFys, piloted in South Africa and Tanzania,182 and plastic
or fiberglass solutions from AGAMA Biogas in South Africa.183
Some of the most important technology and business-process innovations are taking place in the biomass
cooking sector. New biomass cookstove technologies include better-performing and more durable basic
ICS developed over years of trial and error by specialist NGOs and donors, such as the range of products
distributed by GIZ/ProBEC and EnDev; and a growing number of intermediate ICS rocket stove models with
advanced materials, precision engineering, and market-specific design adaptations (e.g., Envirofit, EcoZoom,
and Prakti Design). Most critically, the biomass cookstove sector is seeing the emergence of semi-industrially
and industrially produced natural- and fan-draft gasifier cookstoves (Figure 48) that hold the promise of truly
transformative health and environmental benefits.

While none of the current gasifier stove models fully reaches the particulate emissions performance of modern
fuels, the best-performing fan gasifiers, particularly in combination with high-quality pellet fuels, already achieve
IWA Tier 4 for efficiency and can come close to IWA Tier 4 indoor emission standards.
Many of the stove designers interviewed for this report believe that a Tier 4 biomass gasifier stove, in terms of
both efficiency and emissions, is technically feasible and—on the basis of current R&D efforts in the region—
predict that several Tier 4 biomass stove models will be ready in prototype form in 2015. Such stoves will initially
be highly expensive (US$100–200) due to a range of likely features, including the presence of multiple burners
(i.e., to reduce the number of times the stove needs to be lit for each cooking session); the use of high-end


                                                                             80
                                             Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
materials and precision engineering for the stove body and combustion chamber; and the need for a chimney
to maximally reduce household PM levels. Although stoves at this level of cost will not be commercially viable
for most consumers as an upfront lump-sum payment, the possibility of Tier 4 performance from biomass
cooking is a potentially transformative development when seen in the light of pay-as-you-go business models,
which can theoretically resolve affordability barriers for relatively expensive products.
Another important technology development is the rise of electrically powered or electricity-generating
biomass stoves. Stoves with built-in sources of electric power (e.g., electricity-generating stoves or stoves
powered by external power sources, such as solar panels) have several potential advantages. First and foremost,
they enable the fan functionality essential to reaching the very low emissions levels of the best-performing
gasifier stoves. They improve the economic value to the end user by allowing for phone charging (which
can cost more than US$0.25 per charge in many African markets), and potentially saving household lighting
expenditures on inefficient and expensive fuels, such as kerosene, by powering light-emitting diode (LED)
lights, as in the case of the new ACE-1 Ultra-Clean Biomass Cookstove.1
Furthermore, stoves with an electric power component offer the option of integrating low-cost, stove-use
monitors (SUMs) or more sophisticated particle and temperature sensors (PATS) into the stove design. In the
case of the BioLite stove, for example, SUMs enable data capture of time-stamped usage metrics that can
be tracked over time, including frequency of stove use, duration of use, approximate firepower profiles, and
charger usage.ii The use of more complex built-in particle sensors (US$12–20) can further allow the monitoring
of a stove’s emission signatures in real time.3
The presence of a stove power source—in a functionality that has not yet been tapped—also creates the
potential for integrating clean biomass cookstoves into remote-controlled utility business models. For example,
this could involve embedding a low-cost mobile chip (i.e., Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM]
module) into a stove, allowing for remote stove activation or deactivation. In combination with SUMs, GSM chip
functionality theoretically allows for instantaneous remote data collection on millions of stove users—a boon
for any large-scale stove carbon-finance program where stove-use monitoring is a requirement—the possibility
of much deeper insights into consumer behavior, and potentially a tool for stove entrepreneurs to help adjust
their strategy and tactics to maximize clean stove adoption.
Within the general trend of biomass stoves with electric functionality, the most exciting development is
the introduction of TEG technology, illustrated in greater detail in Figure 49. TEG stoves eliminate the need
for replaceable batteries or such alternative stove power sources as solar panels. In Africa, the technology is
currently only available in BioLite stoves, but the lineup of such products is expected to grow. Already, “generic,”
lower-quality TEG fan-gasifier stoves are available from Chinese manufacturers, and a number of BioLite’s Africa-
focused competitors have explored TEG functionality, though the ability of branded manufacturers to release
new TEG products is constrained, given some of the patent protections regarding TEG use in stoves.187 Other
important developments for electric fan-assisted stoves beyond TEG include the introduction of stoves with
long-lived batteries and alternative charging options, such as solar panels (e.g., the ACE-1 stove), which allow for
a broader array of functionality, such as using the stove as a device to power household lights; and the inclusion
of GSM chips that allow for remote stove activation and monitoring.
Several entrepreneurs are also exploring the potential of retrofitting existing African cookstoves (traditional or
ICS) with TEG units to tap into the potential economic benefits (e.g., phone charging) of TEG functionality.188 In
2014, BioLite introduced a new product in the market with such functionality called the KettleCharge; using TEG
principles, this product is an electricity-generating kettle that draws power from a variety of heat sources, such
as open fires and stoves, to produce 10 watts of power.
From a business model perspective, the most important innovation in the improved and clean biomass
cooking sector is the emergence of integrated fuel/stove project designs. Developed by such companies as
Inyenyeri in Rwanda, Emerging Cooking Solutions in Zambia, the African Briquet Factory in Ethiopia, Awamu in
Uganda, and Greentech in The Gambia, this model has the potential to dramatically improve both manufacturer
and end-user economics, while achieving high levels of health and environmental benefits.

Inyenyeri, for instance (Figure 50), operates more like a cooking-fuel utility company than a typical cookstove
distribution venture. The company distributes high-performance Philips fan-gasifier ACS (US$70 wholesale
price) to urban and rural households in Rwanda. The vast bulk of revenues comes from the sale of densified
(compressed) biomass fuel pellets to urban customers, with stove-leasing fees (US$7 per stove annually in
urban areas) and carbon credits contributing to a lesser degree. All household customers are offered a fuel-
supply and stove-lease contract, in which Inyenyeri retains ownership of the stoves and is obligated to train the
customer how to use them with fuel pellets. The company absorbs all future repair and maintenance costs, thus
eliminating risks that might otherwise inhibit adoption.
Rural households opt to sign a version of the contract, whereby they bring clean, dry biomass to regional
“collection hubs” in exchange for a no-cost lease of stoves and fuel pellet supply, thus working for the clean
benefits that they receive.190 Training in the use of a fan-gasifier stove with pellets is an intensive process—
particularly as it pertains to how to use several stoves in a household to eliminate the charcoal fuel and charcoal
jiko-type stoves that are common in urban Rwanda. Thus, it is essential to recreate the retail distribution ubiquity
of charcoal down to the neighborhood street level and even into evening hours, as customers must be able to
purchase pellets quickly to match the convenience of charcoal. Inyenyeri operates its own retail shops, which
also serve as training sites. However, these are too few and are spaced too far apart to meet customer needs, so
pellet distribution is expanding to include charcoal vendors, small shops, and umbrella street vendors working
on a commission basis.
The Inyenyeri model, which is now being replicated in different variations by half a dozen businesses across
Africa and Asia, simultaneously addresses a number of problems. These include high upfront stove costs and
liquidity constraints for the poor; lack of willingness to pay and experience with new technologies; household
tendency to combine old cooking solutions with new ones (the Inyenyeri model distributes 2–3 stoves per

household from the very beginning and, potentially, a multi-burner biomass gasifier stove in the future; and—via
focus on the lucrative urban charcoal markets—lack of commercial sustainability. Perhaps the most noteworthy
aspect of such business models is that the gross profit from pellet sales can pay for the capital cost of two or
even three high-cost, high-performance stoves per household in 1–1.5 years.
Another new development that is further out on the horizon is the potential to apply mobile pay-as-you-go
models to cookstoves, including remote stove activation and monitoring. The major challenge of traditional
pay-as-you-go models, particularly for stove businesses that have less proximity to the end customer, involves
the transaction costs of extending credit to and collecting payments from end users. Although the market for
TEG-enabled or battery-powered fan stoves is still embryonic, the rise of stove technologies with autonomous
electric power sources (such as the BioLite and the new ACE 1 Ultra-Clean Biomass Cookstove) creates the
possibility for mobile solutions to address the transaction cost issue and, at least theoretically, to launch cooking
utility businesses.
While the potential for success for such models is highly speculative, it is becoming clear that the mobile
activation, monitoring, and payment technologies that are currently being applied to such off-grid BoP
appliances as solar home systems could soon be piloted for cookstoves. The core idea of such concepts is to
use mobile payments and remote appliance monitoring to manage long-term leasing or utility arrangements.
Upon receipt of payment from the end user, the off-grid appliance can be activated for a discrete period of time
(e.g., a week of cooking), at which point a new payment is required to avoid disactivation.
One option for bringing such models to life—leveraging the technology of information and communications
technology (ICT)-enabled energy-access companies, such as mKopa and Mobisol—could involve embedding
a GSM module into a stove or a linked stove-activation controller. The stove utility manager could track the
periodic mobile payments for stove use and enable the system to be locked remotely in case of overdue
accounts—thus decreasing the risk of payment default. Another approach is to link the stove to an off-grid
activation controller that lacks GSM capability, but can be activated through pre-set activation codes.

One example of such an approach from the solar lighting sector is Angaza Design’s Energy Hub system. After
depositing funds into Angaza’s mobile money account, the end user receives a phone call from the automated
energy hub system. Customers holds their phone near the Angaza activation unit in their home, allowing for
audio-based transfer of data to the unit (to trigger activation) and audio-based transfer of usage and diagnostic
data from the unit back to Angaza (Figure 51).

The low cost of the Angaza household unit (US$2) suggests that this approach could be piloted in the cookstoves
context as long as the stove has an autonomous power source, such as the TEG on such stoves as the BioLite.
Aside from enabling pay-as-you-go models, the two-way flow of information in such systems as Mobisol, MKopa,
and Angaza allows for usage tracking that helps companies with after-sales maintenance support, ongoing
product improvement, and—important for the cookstove context—remote usage data capture for monitoring
carbon finance compliance.

Clean and Improved Cooking Distribution Models
Market players use diverse distribution models, with no single channel offering the “key” to all SSA consumers,
given the diversity of the market. SSA cookstove market players pursue a variety of distribution models,
ranging from direct sales to third-party dealer-distributor networks, micro-franchise models, and institutional
sales strategies (Figure 52).

The vast majority of ICS have been distributed either via direct sales to consumers—a highly effective but
resource-intensive option—or via third-party dealer distributor networks. Micro-franchising pilots are generally
at an early stage. Institutional sales and social-sector partnership channels (i.e., distribution via partner NGOs)
have likewise seen smaller volumes to date, but are an important channel for accessing the lowest-income
and most excluded segments of the rural population. Given the complexity and fragmentation of the SSA
market, many successful players tend to work across multiple sales channels or—if they have the local presence,
relationships, and know-how—focus their energy on building out their own direct distribution strategies.
Direct models are the preferred options for local semi-industrial and artisanal manufacturers that are closely
integrated with their customers and are able to break down behavioral WTP barriers through intensive
engagement. Toyola Energy in Ghana is a perfect example of this model. The Toyola sales staff provides stoves on
credit to consumers and gives them time to learn about the technology, thereby reducing potential adoption
barriers. The PERACOD project in Senegal similarly markets stoves to consumers via the bëccëk daily installment
sales system, stretching out a typical charcoal stove payment over a period of 12 days.

The direct model is also pursued by large carbon project developers, such as UpEnergy and the Paradigm Project.
These players have realized that reaching the last mile is a highly thought-out capability that international
manufacturers are neither able nor willing to invest in sufficiently, even once the carbon-financing streams are
secured. As a result, these players have deployed their own door-to-door sales forces (e.g., the Avon model) in
order to drive stove adoption.
Large industrial players, on the other hand, prefer indirect distribution models. They will typically distribute
either through the existing infrastructure of ongoing carbon projects with their own distribution channels, or
through other third-party distributors that can provide rapid access to the market (though at the cost of heavy
markups).
To date, the majority of stoves, and in particular artisanal stoves, are sold and distributed through direct channels
(Figure 53), an approximate analysis in the absence of robust Africa-wide sales data. Manufacturer data available
to the report team suggest, however, that products from industrial manufacturers are being channeled primarily
through third-party dealer/distributor networks, which account for 50-90% of Africa sales for most players in this
segment.

The Enabling Environment
Having reviewed the supply and demand landscape for improved and clean stoves and fuels in SSA, we now
turn to a review of the “enabling environment”—the ecosystem of institutions and policy initiatives, including
funding, surrounding the sector.


Overview of the Cooking Ecosystem in Sub-Saharan Africa
The enabling ecosystem for clean and improved cooking solutions is evolving rapidly. The clean and
improved cooking sector in SSA is a complex ecosystem in which hundreds of institutional and private-sector
players focus on different, often overlapping market niches and interventions. Figure 54 illustrates the range of
sector participants, with a focus on region-wide or subregional examples, but is not meant to be exhaustive.191
From a sector coordination standpoint, coordinating platforms and advocacy initiatives have contributed to
improved sector transparency; increased collaboration across donors, governments, and the private sector;
and the continued mobilization of funds and raising of global awareness for clean and improved cooking
solutions. These initiatives include the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC) and associated subregional
and country-level clean cooking associations (e.g., in Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria); the United Nations’ (UN’s)
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All); the World Bank’s Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES) initiative;
new knowledge networks, such as HEDON; and specific technology and fuel champions with an Africa-wide
mandate, such as the Global LPG Partnership, the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme (ABPP), and Project Gaia.
Funding for cooking initiatives and interventions in SSA is growing steadily, with the most active region-wide
donors being the governments of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States via a
range of programs and funding vehicles. Among multilateral institutions, the World Bank is the primary funder
via ACCES, the Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa (BEIA), the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) multi-donor trust, and a number of sector-lending operations with dedicated biomass energy and/or
cookstove components. Drawing on funding from these donors and others, the most prominent international
NGOs and implementation agencies in the Africa cooking sector include EnDev, the Global Villages Energy
Partnership (Clough 2012), Mercy Corps, SNV, World Vision, Practical Action, EnterpriseWorks, and such UN
implementing agencies as UNDP and UNHCR.
Having significantly scaled up their capacity in the past 1–2 years with the help of the GACC and other donors,
stove-testing centers have become important players in the regional ecosystem and are active in Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Uganda. Providers of wholesale finance are also a dynamic subsector, with
increasing numbers of impact investors and, most notably, carbon finance project developers emerging over
the past 2–3 years. Finally, a growing number of research and advisory institutions are regularly contributing to
Africa cooking-sector knowledge development. The most important, aside from the GACC, are the World Bank;
GiZ; United States Agency for International Development (USAID);192 NGOs, such as GVEP, SNV, MercyCorps,
and Practical Action; health researchers across several institutions globally, typically funded by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health;193 and independent research organizations, most prominently the Stockholm Environment
Institute (SEI).

			                                Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions Initiative


The objective of the Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES) initiative is to promote the enterprise-driven,
large-scale adoption of clean cooking solutions throughout SSA, with the goal to reduce poverty, health-related
risks, and adverse environmental impacts associated with traditional cooking technologies and practices.
ACCES was established through a consultative approach to identify the main barriers that impede market-based
development of the clean cooking sector in SSA. It builds on experiences and lessons learned from donor,
government, public, and private investments in clean cooking solutions; the World Bank’s own operations;
as well as the Lighting Africa off-grid lighting market-transformation program. ACCES supports World Bank
project design and implementation by leveraging funding from project operations and by providing its own
technical support in order to maximize the impact of clean cooking activities. It has designed a set of tools and
mainstreaming approaches that reflect varying country priorities and sector policies to help build momentum
and economies of scale needed for market transformation. It operates using the following three main lines of
support:
“Delivering Products”—facilitating the creation of catalytic linkages between industry leaders and
distributors
The implementation of country programs will include supporting commercial distribution models that are
more likely to rapidly achieve economies of scale, strengthen the sustainability of the sector, and support the
market-based approach of the initiative. Support will include:
•	  Facilitation of manufacturer-distribution partnerships.
•	  Design of distribution roadmaps and national rollout plans for cleaner stoves and fuels.
•	  Design of “challenge funds” and incentive packages for development, implementation, and scale-up of
    distribution models.

                  —establishing a comprehensive quality assurance and technical support (QA&TS)
“Managing Quality”­
system
The regional QA&TS program helps provide a level playing field for market competition and more coherent
support aligned with ongoing global efforts for developing ISO standards and testing capacity in the sector
in order to enhance product information and consumer confidence in quality products. To help steer clean
cooking markets in ACCES countries toward higher-quality products that present a strong value proposition to
consumers, the ACCES initiative has developed:
•	   Baseline assessments of performance for the most prominent cooking technologies in its target countries.
•	   Definition of quality and tools for assessing the adequacy of quality control measures for stove manufacturers,
     distributors, and testing centers.
•	   Minimum performance thresholds for stove quality that vary in their level of ambition according to national
     and/or sectoral priorities and policy agendas, with the goal of supporting progressively higher-performing
     technologies over time.
•	   Technical support to manufacturers for improving quality and performance.

“Activating Customers”—engaging consumers through targeted commercial marketing and promotion
campaigns
This line of support will include a differentiated and narrowly targeted approach to enhancing consumer
awareness through below-the-line marketing efforts for key consumer segments, as well as broader information
campaigns, depending on country context. More specifically, support in this area may include:
•	   Improving field-based evidence of adoption though country-specific reviews of consumer engagement
     efforts, identification of best practices, and key socioeconomic and contextual drivers.
•	   Design of country-specific communication action plans and roll-out of high-impact marketing campaigns.
•	   Development and field testing of sales-promotion and consumer-finance schemes.

Beyond the growing number and sophistication of regional cooking-sector stakeholders, various cross-cutting
developments are trying to address systemic supply-side gaps. These developments include increasing industry
convergence on ICS quality with the establishment of provisional IWA 11:2012 standards for ICS performance
tiers and progress toward the adoption of ISO standards based on these guidelines;194 the evolution of new
cookstove monitoring and performance-measurement techniques, such as growing use of SUMs to assess
household-level performance;195 and the broader adoption of experimental and quasi-experimental techniques
to assess stove impact and refine distribution and marketing approaches. On the policy side, there is increased
government focus on regulating biomass fuel production196 and some movement on regulatory barriers, such
as cookstove taxes and tariffs.197 Better market intelligence resulting from new investments in consumer and
market research is also an important cross-cutting development.198


National Programs
Another important cross-cutting trend is the continued growth of national programs promoting clean and
improved cooking solutions across the region. The number of country-level African cookstove programs has
grown significantly over the past few decades (Figure 55). Since 2010, half a dozen new programs have been
launched with the impetus of the GACC and new efforts by leading cooking-sector donors, such as EnDev and
the World Bank.

African countries with large active national-level programs currently include Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi,
Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, and Uganda. Some of these programs are in fact supranational, with international
donors supporting a range of large-scale cookstove interventions across the continent. Older national cookstove
programs in countries, such as Kenya and Tanzania, and regional programs, such as GIZ’s ProBEC, have already
generated significant impacts and have often transitioned into market-based initiatives or have been handed
off to NGOs and industry associations. Figure 56 provides an overview of the most active national programs;
Figure 57 reviews the major regional and subregional programs, such as ACCES, EnDev, ProBEC, and the West
African Clean Cooking Alliance (WACCA).

Despite their increasing number, few national programs in SSA have achieved large-scale stove distribution or
created sustainable markets. Among the larger, more successful programs have been those in Ethiopia, Kenya,
Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Tanzania’s program, led by NGO TaTeDo with initial support from GIZ, distributed
an estimated 2 million stoves from 2000 to 2010. As of 2006, national programs in Kenya, Senegal, and Uganda
reached approximately 3 million, 200,000, and 80,000 households, respectively. Ethiopia’s national program,
which is ongoing, has reportedly reached several million households and has been the biggest success at scale
to date in increasing basic and intermediate ICS penetration.
While the various SSA national programs vary in terms of national government role, business model, and
level of ambition, there are similarities. Most national cookstove programs pursue commercial or hybrid
models; very few, like the Rwanda initiative to distribute 600,000 rocket stoves to poor rural end users, are
entirely covered by subsidies. The focus of early national programs in Africa has almost exclusively been the
environment (deforestation and climate change) and rural livelihoods, but improved health outcomes are
increasingly becoming an important focus. Other important trends for the more successful national programs
include intensive focus on R&D, increasing attention paid to standards, and diversification from a focus on stove
subsidization toward more holistic approaches involving the entire supply chain. Common problems include
overreliance on subsidies and inadequate consumer training to complement stove distribution.
Looking across the range of models, approaches, and tools used by the various national and regional
cookstove programs, there are a variety of lessons to be drawn. From the experience of both governments
and donor agencies, it is apparent that in the early stages of stove promotion programs, subsidization—in some
form or another—played an important role. The question of whether subsidies should be provided has been
hotly debated in the sector. The experience of various national-level programs shows clearly that, despite the
dichotomous “yes or no subsidies” debate by some stakeholders, the impact of a subsidy depends enormously
on elements of its design—that is, its mode of provision (direct/indirect), its value (high/low), and the time
for which it is provided (full time/phased out). Ultimately, this experience has shown that some degree of
subsidization may be required in the early stage of any effort to increase improved stove adoption. However,
there are three key caveats: subsidies should be introduced with a very clear phase-out plan and should not be
permanent; they should be of the lowest possible value to provide the needed support while not diminishing
the value of the product; and they should clearly target the appropriate consumer and product segments—
namely, the very poor (and often rural) communities and the high-performance, high-cost stoves where the
benefits of use are significant but upfront costs are prohibitive.
A second set of lessons can be learned about the importance of early and sustained consumer engagement
across the value chain. African cookstove programs have been most successful where product design has been
carefully developed to accommodate user preferences, cooking practices, and behaviors. Conversely, adoption
has been difficult where this was not the case, requiring multiple iterations of design and pilot. Particularly
important in the design phase is consultation with women: where programs actively engaged women (as the
ultimate users and often buyers of the stoves) in the design of the product, adoption has been more successful.
Overall, where communities were engaged in the whole process of program design and inception, training,
and development of artisans and enterprises, marketing and sales—as well as the crucial stage of feedback and
monitoring—programs have had a deeper and more sustained impact.
Finally, crucial to note from the programs outlined in this section is the importance of engaging in the sector
with a medium- to long-term time horizon. Most successful national programs take 5–10 years to achieve
meaningful scale, with the greatest impact often seen after program completion.
Although scaling up improved cooking solutions in Africa has historically relied heavily on both direct and
indirect subsidies, the more market-based approaches have worked best. Modern cooking fuels have had
the widest reach in Africa in places where governments have injected significant fuel subsidies into the sector.
This includes Angola, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Senegal in the case of LPG; Nigeria in the case of
kerosene; and South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in the case of electric cooking. While tens of millions of
households have gained access to modern cooking energy in the past few decades as a result, many of these
countries have eliminated or lowered fuel subsidies in recent years because of fiscal pressures, with the result
being slower growth or retrenchment in the number of low- or moderate-income households with access to
clean fuels. The distribution of renewable stoves has likewise been based on direct subsidies. Most solar cookers,
for example, have been distributed at no cost via NGO efforts, and African biogas digester installations involve
substantial subsidies (20–50%) for upfront system costs.

In contrast, the biggest African successes in scaling up access to improved biomass cooking solutions have
involved public-sector or donor-driven cookstove programs with strong market-based logic. The Kenya ceramic
jiko technology, for instance, after two decades of donor and government promotion, cross-border replication,
and transition to market-based distribution, now reaches more than 25 million Africans in at least 14 countries
as the baseline charcoal-cooking solution in many urban centers. Other successful examples of improved
cookstove distribution at scale include Mirt injera stoves in Ethiopia (more than 2 million units distributed, greater
than 60% urban household penetration); Rocket Lorena stoves in Uganda (more than 500,000 households); and
brick and mud rocket stoves in Kenya (more than 1 million households). Self-reported data from the GIZ/ProBEC
and EnDev programs linked to a number of these stove technologies show that the programs have extended
access to basic and intermediate ICS to more than 15 million Africans in less than a decade. Although indirect
subsidies and market facilitation were required at early stages of all of these programs, the most successful
efforts have minimized direct subsidies and relied on enterprise-based and market-based mechanisms for
growth.


Challenges to the Enabling Environment
Despite promising trends, many policy and institutional challenges remain in the stove and fuel markets.
The most notable gaps in the enabling environment have to do with tax and tariff policies, the infrastructure for
cookstove quality testing, regulations on biomass and modern fuels, and access to finance.

Stove taxes and Tariffs
Taxes and import tariffs in many countries are set at levels that significantly reduce consumers’ access to high-
quality clean cooking appliances. Alternative domestic products are unavailable in most of SSA because of
technical and infrastructure constraints. Paradoxically, taxes and tariffs may also impede the development of
domestic assembly markets by taxing the import of stove components.

Infrastructure for Cookstove Quality Assurance
Despite the development of new ISO IWA stove standards and the launch of four regional testing centers
across Africa with the support of the GACC, cookstove quality standards and testing are still a significant gap.
The provisional ISO standards, while an important step forward, have limited awareness and buy-in among
local African stakeholders; local standards are not aligned to the provisional ISO guidelines; many local African
stove models remain untested; and the build quality of artisanal products distributed via pure private-sector
channels (e.g., Kenya ceramic jiko-style stoves) is often low. Regional testing centers have limited funds and
human resource capacity, testing costs are prohibitively high for many potential users (e.g., artisanal and semi-
industrial manufacturers), and reliable in-field testing programs involving cookstove usage monitors and field
emission meters still require the involvement of costly international experts.
Even in the future, when stove test results will be obtained and regularly updated for a comprehensive set of
clean and improved SSA cooking solutions, the major challenge will remain of ensuring that sector stakeholders
integrate them into stove design and distribution decisions. There is therefore a need for a sector quality
assurance program, such as the activities of the World Bank ACCES initiative on this issue, that can ensure
that such results provide incentive for improvement, reveal technical support areas, and guide quality control
measures that need to be put in place.

Regulation of Biomass and Modern Fuels
African governments have focused their domestic cooking energy policy efforts on promoting modern fuels,
rather than the sustainable harvesting and use of woodfuel biomass. Policies, such as charcoal bans (in place
throughout the continent), insufficient investment in forestry management, and poor incentives throughout
biomass fuel supply chains, impede more rational biomass fuel use that can complement demand-side efforts
to reduce biomass consumption and supply-side policies that promote modern and alternative renewable
fuels.
With regard to modern fuels, stronger regulatory frameworks and investment are needed across the SSA
region to ensure consumer safety and channel capital to large-scale infrastructure development (i.e., storage



                                                               102
                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
and transport infrastructure). Safety is a particularly important concern for LPG markets, where weakly defined
certification and licensing policies, the absence of training for fuel distributors, and limited enforcement of
existing regulations are major obstacles to consumer uptake. Additionally, tax and subsidy regimes for modern
fuels are often poorly implemented, with unsustainable subsidies that have regressive outcomes and contribute
to sporadic fuel shortages.
Specific protocols are required for transporting, storing, and using such liquid fuels as LPG and kerosene safely.
Appropriate training must extend through the value chain to small-scale distributors to prevent accidents.
SSA countries lack the certification and licensing to ensure such handling, in part because the physical
infrastructure for safely transporting liquid fuels is not in place. Pursuit of stronger standards and requirements
for fuel distributors, in conjunction with joint investments in infrastructure, would increase the integrity of the
value chain and effective distribution of liquid fuels. Consumer education is especially important for LPG and
kerosene, because they are responsible for proper storage and operation after sale.201 Malfunctioning LPG
canisters can cause explosions, and improper fuel storage poses risks to the entire household; 60% of child-
poisoning incidents in Kenya and South Africa are a result of accidental ingestion of kerosene.202 As such fuels
as LPG become increasingly affordable, SSA governments will need to work with companies to disseminate
safe-use guidelines and minimize risks to public health.

Lack of Access to Finance
Lack of access to finance is another major, cross-cutting obstacle to faster market-based growth. At the micro
level, the challenge cuts across the value chain. Manufacturers and distributors, like any SME in Africa, are
often unable to access credit to fund product innovation, distribution network development, and consumer
marketing. For cash-strapped consumers who often lack disposable income for upfront purchases of improved
cookstoves, few microfinance institutions (MFIs) or retail banks focus on clean cooking—and, in any case,
traditional financing solutions often do not work in this sector because of the high transaction costs involved
relative to cookstove costs.
Despite these challenges, there is great promise in a number of existing and innovative financing mechanisms
across the cookstove and fuel supply chain. Carbon financing has played an important role in accelerating
improved cookstove uptake in Africa in the past few years—particularly for more expensive (US$30–100)
industrial and semi-industrial ICS or clean ACS, most of which have been sold via manufacturers or distributors
that have access to CDMs and voluntary carbon market schemes. The continued and growing importance of
the carbon market is well illustrated by the fact that, despite depressed carbon prices, half of the 8.2 million
stoves distributed and sold in 2012 (as tracked by the GACC) received some support from carbon finance
projects. This support is up from 15% in 2010–11.203
Carbon credits, via 21 registered CDM projects204 and 33 registered and listed Gold Standard VER (verified
emission reduction) projects205 covering 19 SSA countries206 have allowed manufacturers to reduce end-user
prices by 20–50% and/or use the proceeds from carbon financing to invest in distribution and generate higher
returns for their investors.
While the prospects for the carbon market are uncertain in a post-Kyoto scenario, stove CDM project registrations
are continuing at a fast pace (nine SSA projects in 2013), and the voluntary market for stove projects is booming,
with Africa overall accounting for a disproportionate share of global cookstove program offsets (Figure 58).
Carbon credits will not, however, pay for the incremental health benefits of clean cooking solutions. The
carbon reduction potential of most ACS, such as fan and ND gasifiers, is often proportional to fuel efficiency—
which, in many cases, is comparable between intermediate ICS and ACS. For instance, a high-performance wood
rocket stove, despite its relatively limited health benefits, may be able to generate 50–70% carbon savings—a
result comparable with some of the best ACS. Against this background of comparable carbon emissions
performance, the 1.5–4-times price differential between industrial ACS (US$75–120) and high-quality industrial
rocket ICS (US$20–80) suggests that carbon project developers interested solely in carbon impact will prefer
technologies that have fewer positive health impacts.
To avoid such outcomes, new financial incentives—social impact bond revenue streams, for example, or results-
based financing (RBF) facilities linked to health—are needed to drive socially desirable investment toward
the sector. The Department for International Development is already experimenting with an RBF approach
through a dedicated RBF fund, with an RBF pilot in progress to facilitate the extension of cookstoves to 200,000

rural households in Ethiopia.207 The feasibility of applying RBF mechanisms for clean and improved cooking
solutions in Africa is also currently being explored in World Bank-sponsored research in Uganda,208 Indonesia,
and elsewhere.
While there is no commercial market for clean cooking impacts, there are a number of important efforts under
way to explore such approaches, with immediate potential application to Africa. The C-Quest Capital team,
for instance, drawing on its carbon finance market expertise, is exploring the potential to create a CDM-like
market for cookstove health impacts, and is working on piloting a potential new RBF methodology.209 Similarly,
the newly launched BIX fund, while most immediately focused on carbon finance revenues, is working on a
methodology to package cookstove health impacts for social impact investors.210
Although downstream financing for micro-entrepreneurs and consumers is also a major need, affordability
challenges are more likely to be addressed through innovative pay-as-you-go models. Further downstream,
micro-entrepreneur financing programs for last-mile cookstove retailers are beginning to generate interest
from large African MFIs, such as FINCA. They have already been piloted by financial institutions, such as KUSSCO
and FAULU in Kenya, though as yet few dedicated cookstove-financing programs are in place.
For end-consumer finance, extensive cooking-sector interviews and examples from other industries (such as
solar lighting) suggest that the biggest potential resides in (1) replicating pay-as-you-go schemes of the type
piloted by Toyola Energy in Ghana; (2) extending new mobile-metering/payment models, such as those from
M-Kopa, IndiGo, and Angaza to the cookstove sector; and (3) integrating the fuel/stove business model (i.e.,
building upfront stove costs into the fuel price) that Inyenyeri has pioneered in Rwanda for biomass pellet stoves
and that CleanStar and Green Energy & Biofuel have applied to ethanol stoves in Africa. Figure 59 summarizes
the more recent innovations in financing models.

Funding for SSA Cooking Sector
At the highest macro level, the key issue is the still-inadequate supply of funding for clean and improved cooking
interventions. Current funding in SSA for clean and improved cookstoves is US$50–125 million annually—less
than a tenth of what is needed on an annual basis for the next decade (US$22 billion from 2010 to 2030, or more
than US$1 billion annually, according to the International Energy Agency [IEA]) to move the region to universal
clean cooking energy access.
Finally, from a public health standpoint, it is important to point out that the funding currently made available
for combating household air pollution from traditional cookstoves is only a minute fraction of the amount
channeled globally to such public health crises as HIV/AIDS and malaria on a per-death basis (Figure 60).

As the case for clean and improved cooking solutions becomes stronger in the coming years, there should be
increasing opportunities to dramatically scale up funding for the sector through public health investments
from international donors and national governments.

Looking Forward
The clean and improved cooking sector in SSA is poised for solid growth. The evolving demand and supply
environments and historical uptake trends suggest that, even under conservative assumptions, the penetration
of improved and clean cookstoves (excluding legacy stoves) will rise from 24% (48 million households) in 2010
to 36% (80 million households) in 2020, a net addition of more than 32 million households (Figure 61).

However, this business-as usual-scenario still leaves the vast majority of Africans without access to truly clean
cooking solutions. Barring major interventions, the penetration of such clean cooking solutions as LPG,
renewable biofuels, and ACS will remain less than 20% of the SSA population. Moreover, any gains in access
to clean cooking will be highly unequal across geographies and income tiers—leaving the very poor further
behind.
This 2020 projection would still represent a much lower level of access than what is currently seen in such
regions as South Asia, where the lack of clean cooking solutions is being addressed as a major crisis. Furthermore,
in the absence of significant public- and private-sector investment, the spread of clean cooking solutions
across SSA will be highly uneven—with successes in such countries as Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa
(where the combined penetration of ICS and clean fuels is already above 50%) serving as exceptions amidst the
overwhelming majority of SSA countries still mired in traditional solid-fuel cooking. In places where ICS adoption
is growing quickly, much of this growth is still in basic and intermediate ICS, rather than in clean cookstoves
and fuels. Furthermore, the vast gap in clean cooking access between rural and urban areas is likely to widen
further in the absence of new targeted investments. African governments, the development community, and
the private sector can and must do better.
Major obstacles remain on the path to accelerating the uptake of clean and improved cooking solutions.
Consumers’ limited willingness to fully adopt new cooking solutions and limited ability to pay for higher-cost
clean and improved cookstoves and fuels are the greatest long-term obstacles to broader adoption of clean
cooking in Africa.
From a willingness-to-adopt standpoint, limited consumer exposure to new technologies and low awareness
of their benefits cause limited demand. Even when consumers are educated about stove benefits, however,
willingness to adopt often remains low because of the new solutions’ lack of fit with consumers’ cooking
preferences (due to the reality or perception of inappropriate design), lack of consumer trust in stove performance
and durability, unreliable fuel supply and after-sales support, and the behavioral (e.g., risk aversion, present
bias) and cultural obstacles of new technologies. The willingness-to-adopt challenge is not just an obstacle to
initial stove uptake, but affects sustained adoption and use—as manifested in the near-universal phenomenon
of stove and fuel stacking (i.e., end users retaining traditional cooking solutions for use alongside clean or
improved solutions to accommodate both diverse household cooking needs and the force of tradition). Even
where households are willing to adopt improved and clean cookstoves and fuels, they often lack the ability to
pay for the stove and fuel due to insufficient disposable incomes and/or the lack of savings. The affordability
challenge is particularly acute for higher-priced clean cooking solutions.
Many of these issues can be addressed via consumer education and awareness building, marketing solutions
that enhance end-user trust (e.g., warranties, right to return), and—assuming that the underlying technologies
are appropriately designed—distribution and financing approaches that build up end-user comfort through
exposure (e.g., free trials). In addition, innovative financing techniques can address the liquidity constraints of
those consumers whose income levels can sustain stove purchases, but who lack the near-term savings needed
for stove purchases; these techniques include installment payment plans, pay-as-you-go/utility business models,
and consumer financing.
For many cooking solutions, even when such approaches are applied, willingness to pay will remain a barrier
to adoption. There is strong evidence that most African consumers are not willing to pay price premiums
for stoves and fuels that generate incremental long-term health benefits—a factor that inherently limits the
market-based potential of clean solutions that cannot compete with traditional or improved stoves on purely
economic terms. Willingness to pay is also an issue for intermediate ICS technologies where actual willingness
to pay can be significantly below the stove’s fair market price. Even after willingness to pay is improved through
marketing, many ICS providers will still need to subsidize the upfront cost of their stoves (with carbon revenues,
for example) to see adoption at scale, particularly in rural areas.
On the supply side, corresponding barriers to wider adoption of improved and clean cooking solutions include
the cost and complexity of last-mile distribution; the limited business management capacity and financial
constraints of cooking-sector entrepreneurs; the still-limited adoption of uniform quality standards and
product certification to minimize market spoilage; biomass supply market failures limiting fuel sustainability;
and regulatory constraints to improved stove uptake, such as high taxes and duties on clean technologies or
perverse subsidy incentives for the ongoing use of harmful fuels. Oversubsidized donor programs that crowd

out private-sector investment and, in some cases, contribute to market spoilage as well, must bear a share of
the responsibility for skewing private-sector incentives for market entry.
Funding the sector while addressing these various barriers is a cross-cutting challenge that involves providing
financing for fuel supply chains, working capital for improved stove producers and distributors, public-sector
funding for market transformation programs and enabling market infrastructure, and—where sensible—
targeted subsidies and incentives tied to access, health, and climate change goals. Based on IEA estimates, the
funding needed for universal access to clean cooking energy in SSA exceeds US$1 billion annually through
2030 versus the current fund flow of US$50–125 million. Public- and donor-sector funding, in particular, is far
below levels that can realistically address the immensity of the health challenges caused by household air
pollution: current SSA funding levels are an estimated US$100–250 per death for HAP versus US$2,000–4,000 per
death for public health crises, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.
Figure 62 rates each of these barriers in terms of its significance for various types of improved and clean stoves
and fuels, while Figure 63 summarizes many of the cross-cutting barriers described in detail in the preceding
sections of this report.

Figure 63: Overview of market barriers

Affordability and                 In the case of ICS, ACS, and modern fuels, affordability to the end consumer is a major
willingness to pay                barrier to adoption. Cost is likewise a critical obstacle for the bottom 15–30% of SSA
                                  consumers, even where low-cost artisanal ICS solutions are concerned. WTP is an
                                  even more important cross-cutting issue: even when the affordability challenge can
                                  be removed via subsidies, there is abundant evidence that Africans are unwilling to
                                  pay for the health benefits of clean cooking and have substantial behavioral barriers
                                  to replacing their existing stoves with clean cooking technologies.
Consumer awareness                Consumer awareness of the harmful effects of traditional solid fuels and knowledge
                                  of the availability and benefits of improved, affordable alternatives are low. This
                                  market failure cannot be addressed by the private sector alone; it will require
                                  significant government and donor support to drive consumer demand and change
                                  the surmountable behaviors holding back the adoption and use of improved and
                                  clean cookstoves.
Last-mile distribution            Distribution of clean cooking products is costly, with no easy answers to the
                                  challenge of reaching rural consumers; progress will require both experimentation
                                  with new institutional and retail approaches and significant investment in channel
                                  development. In the immediate term, commercially oriented ventures likely need
                                  to focus on more profitable urban and charcoal users; reaching the rural consumer
                                  requires cross-subsidization from more profitable urban market segments or less
                                  commercially driven business models.
Producer capacity                 Domestic producers of clean fuels and improved stoves lack the business
                                  management and technical skills that would allow them to improve quality and
                                  performance; for international industrial manufacturers, technical capacity challenges
                                  are less of an issue. Overall, producer capacity is a less significant challenge in the
                                  cooking market than in other donor-supported off-grid product markets, such as
                                  solar home systems and solar lanterns.
Producer finance                  Building successful last-mile clean cooking businesses in Africa is a costly endeavor.
                                  This is due to product importation hurdles, logistic and transport challenges, the
                                  need for intensive consumer marketing, and the importance of extending credit to
                                  both last-mile retailers and end users (i.e., via pay-as-you-go schemes). Although lack
                                  of access to working capital is generally a challenge for African SMEs, the issue is
                                  compounded for cooking solution enterprises, because they are often promoting
                                  new technologies in markets with uncertain or still-limited consumer demand and
                                  limited understanding by financial institutions of their products and economics.
Cookstove quality and             The number of improved cookstove models and fuel-production solutions
performance                       customized for local environments is still low. There is evidence that many basic ICS
                                  have poor quality in the field, at least in part due to the difficulty of accessing high-
                                  quality materials. Moreover, systemic support remains limited for innovation and R&D
                                  on breakthrough solutions offering higher performance (e.g., fan gasifiers) and, even
                                  more important, designs that are more attractive, functional, and adapted to the end
                                  user. For solutions that do reach the market, access to standardized testing is limited
                                  or unaffordable for many producers.
Policy environment                Ineffective or perverse incentives are common in regulations governing solid-fuel
                                  production and improved biomass cookstoves; incentives for scaling up clean fuels
                                  are often absent or, in the case of large, direct modern-fuel subsidies, unsustainable;
                                  and high, poorly targeted import duties currently hold back the development of
                                  more effective domestic clean cooking sectors. Donors programs can crowd out
                                  private-sector investment and compound policy challenges.

Recommendations
Disrupting the status quo will require stepped-up investment and a differentiated approach. To ensure that
the current revival of interest in clean cooking does not become a passing fad, new approaches and large
investments are needed to accelerate the uptake of clean, high-quality cooking appliances and fuels.
While a major push is needed in all countries in SSA, sector approaches, intervention priorities, and technologies
will need significant tailoring based on the development stages of target markets and the specific needs of
each consumer segment.
A differentiated approach to improved and clean cooking energy promotion must acknowledge that,
although market-based efforts to promote clean cooking technologies are the preferred approach in the
quest for universal and sustainable clean cooking energy access, markets are not a panacea; in many cases,
“transitional”—improved, but not clean—cooking technologies will remain the best feasible solution in the
near term.
For poor consumer segments, clean cooking solutions, such as LPG, electricity, biogas, or ethanol, and near-
clean technologies, such as biomass gasifiers will likely remain unaffordable at sufficient scale for many years
to come without large public-sector subsidies or innovative utility business models. The path forward for the
poorest African consumers will therefore need to involve the continued promotion of low-cost artisanal and
intermediate ICS that—while generating both significant fuel savings and associated social, economic, and
environmental benefits—have no or minimal health benefits. When appropriately tailored to local context,
such basic and intermediate ICS solutions should not impede—and should even facilitate—future adoption of
cleaner stoves and fuels. From a supply market perspective, the distribution of “transitional” improved solutions
involves investment in last-mile distribution infrastructure, credit extension, and logistics—all activities that
should facilitate the promotion of even cleaner technologies at a later stage. From a demand perspective,
while empirical data for such transition effects are lacking, basic and intermediate ICS distribution should in
theory help sensitize consumers to the benefits of commercially manufactured, quality-controlled, fuel-saving,
and smoke-reducing appliances and fuels—something that should improve consumer willingness to purchase
more expensive and cleaner appliances and fuels in the future.
Early-stage “market-seeding” efforts—such as basic awareness campaigns, build-out of distributor networks, and
the establishment of local stove-testing infrastructure—are extremely time- and resource-intensive activities
in which the private sector is typically less willing and able to invest in nascent markets. While market-based
approaches are preferred for basic and intermediate ICS promotion, for the very poorest consumers and for
marginalized groups like refugee camp populations, ICS market-creation efforts will in many instances take years
to develop, justifying the application of more direct subsidy models, despite some risks of market distortion.
In contrast, market-led approaches hold much greater promise for expanding access to clean cooking solutions
in more developed markets that are characterized by growing segments of middle-income consumers with
disposable incomes. The optimal strategy for such consumers, at the higher levels of the income distribution,
involves expanding uptake of modern fuels and renewable biofuels, such as ethanol.
Poor urban consumers, who already often face significant fuel costs, similarly present growing opportunities
for the private sector. Reaching them, however, will likely require different strategies and challenges, such as
(1) capitalizing on carbon finance markets and growing demand via businesses that generate fuel savings (e.g.,
via highly efficient charcoal stoves), or (2) offering competitively priced alternatives to expensive biomass (LPG,
biofuels, biomass briquettes) that can also create significant health co-benefits.
Figures 64 and 65, on the following pages, summarize key recommendations that reflect this differentiated
approach by focusing on consumer segment and technology. The remainder of this section reviews a number
of additional cross-cutting recommendations that are independent of these two areas.

Figure 64: Recommended approach for policy makers, by SSA consumer segment

 Modern fuel (17%)*                •	 Promote increased or exclusive use of modern-fuel stoves within the household fuel/stove
                                      stack via education campaigns on the health benefits of modern-fuel cooking
                                   •	 Create policy incentives for reduced reliance on less-clean or unsafe modern-fuel cooking
                                      solutions (e.g., reduce kerosene subsidies, strengthen LPG and kerosene safety standards)
                                   •	 Improve affordability, accessibility, and reach of modern fuels through increased infrastructure
                                      investment (e.g., LPG storage terminals and distribution networks)
                                   •	 Promote clean biomass stoves (ACS) and fuels (e.g., renewable charcoal) as a secondary
                                      solution for modern-fuel users to transition their fuel/stove stack to cleaner cooking
 Urban middle class                •	 Promote transition to modern fuels, such as LPG or electricity, potentially with well-targeted
 charcoal (11%)                       subsidies for appliance and fuel costs
                                   •	 Promote commercial adoption of biomass gasifier ACS and renewable briquette/pellet
                                      biomass fuels, potentially via integrated fuel/stove utility models
                                   •	 Target replacement of traditional and basic (jiko) charcoal ICS with advanced charcoal ICS
                                      models that can generate greater household savings and reduce CO2 emissions
                                   •	 Align policies and boost investment in sustainable biomass pellet/briquette fuels and
                                      renewable alternatives, such as ethanol
 Urban poor charcoal               •	 In markets where the costs of charcoal cooking already exceed clean alternatives, promote
 (4%)                                 modern-fuel (LPG, electricity) and biofuel (ethanol) adoption by the urban poor, even if such
                                      solutions initially constitute a secondary technology with little daily use; for this segment,
                                      targeted, ongoing fuel subsidies (e.g., voucher schemes) may be appropriate
                                   •	 Promote highly efficient, high-end charcoal ICS from industrial manufacturers
                                   •	 When charcoal prices are not sufficiently high, promote low-cost, high-quality basic charcoal
                                      ICS produced by reputable artisans and semi-industrial manufacturers
                                   •	 Align policies and boost investment in sustainable biomass pellet/briquette fuels
 Firewood purchasers               •	 Promote migration (1) to LPG and gasifier ACS for the highest-income wood purchasers and
 (20%)                                (2) to low-cost natural-draft gasifiers (semi-industrially produced) for the urban poor
                                   •	 Experiment with integrated fuel/stove utility models that have potential to extend fan-gasifier
                                      ACS access to poor firewood purchasers with no or limited stove appliance costs
                                   •	 Where clean cooking solutions are infeasible due to local market economics or other barriers,
                                      promote best-in-class rocket ICS, preferably multiburner with chimneys
                                   •	 Invest in local artisanal and semi-industrial rocket ICS market creation and growth (e.g.,
                                      by creating a trained cadre of built-in rocket stove masons/installers or promoting local
                                      manufacturing/assembly of portable rocket stoves and ACS to reduce costs)
                                   •	 Align policies and boost investment in sustainable biomass pellet/briquette fuels
 Middle-income                     •	 Trial the fuel/stove integrated utility models for ACS, requiring service in kind (e.g., biomass
 wood collectors                      collection) in return for free or very-low-cost ACS stove and fuel access
 (15%)                             •	 Promote fuel-efficient and low-cost rocket stoves and natural-draft gasifiers, with a heavy
                                      marketing emphasis on fuel-collection time savings, fast cooking, durability, and the
                                      aspirational value of modern-looking stoves
                                   •	 Invest in domestic (semi-industrial and industrial) rocket stove manufacturing to drive down
                                      the costs of more efficient technologies
                                   •	 Support shift from wood to renewable biomass pellets/briquettes, particularly where such
                                      consumers are beginning to adopt charcoal in peri-urban areas
                                   •	 “Free trial” marketing is particularly important for this segment to drive willingness to adopt
                                      and pay, given the lack of financial pressure on such users to shift to more efficient stoves
 Poor rural wood,                  •	 Trial the fuel/stove integrated utility models for ACS, requiring service in kind (e.g., biomass
 dung, and crop                       collection) in return for free or very-low-cost ACS stove and fuel access
 waste collectors                  •	 For the very poorest segments (e.g., bottom 10% of rural population, Israel Defense Forces
 (31%)                                camp refugees), consider free or highly subsidized distribution of gasifier ACS
                                   •	 Promote adoption of basic ICS for households where there is much to be gained, even with
                                      switch from three-stone fires to basic ICS

* Share of households using fuel as their primary cooking solution; overall number of HH in each segment is higher.

                                 Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Recommendations for Governments, Donors, and NGOs
1. Increase support for clean cooking solutions, while maintaining momentum for intermediate and basic
ICS technologies where cleaner alternatives are not feasible in the near term. The scale of the HAP public
health crisis calls for a revision of donor priorities, with a need for expanded investment in clean cooking
technologies. As noted in this report, achieving proportionality to investments in such public health challenges
as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria requires at least a tenfold increase in public-sector and donor funding for
clean cooking technologies. At the same time, the slow pace of transition to clean solutions, combined with
the unaffordability of these solutions for the rural poor, dictates sustained ongoing investment in intermediate
and basic biomass ICS.
Growing evidence for the negative health effects of solid-fuel cooking suggests that full technology neutrality
is not a viable option for donors and policy makers. Only the cleanest modern-fuel, renewable biofuel, and—
pending further evidence from the field—ACS can meaningfully mitigate the HAP-linked deaths and DALYs
of millions of Africans over the coming decade. Interventions should therefore prioritize the uptake of high-
performing clean cooking solutions that—due to their cost or early stage of commercialization, or limited
consumer willingness to pay for incremental health benefits—are unlikely to reach scale without major new
investments in fuel infrastructure, stove design, impact research (e.g., investment in RCTs and field performance
studies focused on emerging range of ACS), distribution capacity, and end-user finance.
While precise numbers are unavailable, current public- and donor-sector funding for clean and improved
cooking efforts in Africa is heavily biased to basic ICS and, in a shift to rocket technologies apparent over the
past 3–5 years, to intermediate ICS solutions. ACS projects have only recently began to attract donor attention,
but most funds have thus far flowed to fundamental R&D projects and public health RCTs, rather than funding
for ACS business models and market pilots. Public-sector and donor financing for modern-fuel and alcohol
biofuel projects is likewise still extremely limited.
Increasing the penetration of clean cooking technologies consequently requires a large shift in current
donor and government funding trends and priorities. The shift must entail both an increase in overall
funding levels and a reallocation of funding share across different cooking technologies. In practical terms,
this means significantly boosting overall annual funding across the improved and clean cooking technology
spectrum—from more than a hundred million to several billion U.S. dollars annually—with a relative reallocation
of funds from basic ICS and intermediate rocket stove solutions to cleaner modern-fuel, biofuel, and biomass
gasifier technologies, where health impacts can be proven and market circumstances allow for distribution at
scale (e.g., a middle class exists to anchor more sustainable market-driven clean stove and fuel interventions).
Despite the fundraising successes of the GACC and renewed attention to clean stoves and fuels from major
clean energy donors, such as the World Bank, effecting this funding shift will require the entry of “nontraditional”
clean cooking funders. Incremental billions of dollars of funding will remain unavailable from energy and
environment budgets. A redirection of donor and public-sector public health funds that are currently allocated
to such conditions as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB—and increased attention from public health thought leaders,
such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and WHO—are likely needed to truly transform Africans’ access
to clean stoves and fuels.
Although a rebalancing of sector investments toward cleaner solutions is needed, as noted above, the public
sector and donors should continue to support fuel-efficient solutions, such as intermediate and basic ICS,
particularly in poorer, less developed cooking markets and for excluded populations. Some basic and, in
particular, intermediate rocket ICS can generate fuel-saving benefits of clean biomass stoves at much lower
price points; have moderate health, environment, and climate benefits; and in many cases remain the only
improved solution that is reasonably accessible and affordable for Africa’s poor. Furthermore, short payback
periods for fuel-efficient ICS and possible positive externalities from the development of artisanal and semi-
industrial stove markets suggest that establishing an intermediate technology baseline will not impede—and
may even accelerate­  —consumer migration toward cleaner cooking.
2. Design interventions to drive consumer behavior change; simply distributing cleaner cooking solutions
and fuels will not lead to optimal health and environmental outcomes. The challenge of achieving the
benefits of universal clean cooking in SSA is not simply one of technology and economics. Like water and
sanitation programs and other public health initiatives, clean cooking solution promotion efforts can achieve

health impact objectives only when accompanied by large-scale behavior change in the target end-user
population.
As reviewed in depth throughout this report, challenges linked to consumer behavior include the all-pervasive
phenomenon of stove and fuel stacking, which reduces the actual benefits of any clean cooking technology;
the dependence of cookstove performance on the quality and characteristics of the fuel used (e.g., health effects
of dung vs. firewood vs. charcoal vs. quality-controlled biomass briquettes for any given biomass stove); and the
wide variability in improved and clean cooking solution performance, depending on the skill of the end user
in starting and sustaining a fire, cooking preferences (e.g., types of dishes prepared), and cooking setting (e.g.,
cooking outdoors vs. indoors, indoor airflow in the dwelling). Furthermore, health and environmental outcomes
of clean cookstoves are subject to community effects, whereby the reduction of household air pollution by
select households in densely populated areas will result in few climate benefits and in only partly improved
health outcomes if the levels of household air pollution are high in neighboring dwellings.
Even when consumer behavior is the underlying driver of variability, donors and governments can address
some of the variability in cooking solution performance by promulgating locally appropriate standards and
by supporting appropriate stove and business model design. For instance, donors can support stoves that
constrain variability in emissions during different use patterns (e.g., some stove designs can minimize emissions
in both low and high heat settings); encourage the adoption of clean multiburner stoves that may mitigate the
incidence of stove stacking with inferior cooking technologies); and promote integrated stove-fuel distribution
models (e.g., Inyenyeri in Rwanda) that lend themselves to more controlled stove emission outcomes for end
users.
In most cases, however, behavior change cannot be managed through technology selection alone. The
public, donor, and NGO sectors must complement private-sector stove and fuel distribution initiatives with
intensive consumer awareness efforts—similar to the hand washing, public defecation, and vaccination
campaigns already familiar in the public health setting—that can educate end users about the harms of stove
and fuel stacking; encourage outdoor cooking and better indoor ventilation; and train end users on optimal
cooking techniques, including fuel preparation (e.g., biomass drying prior to cooking), kindling, fire tending, and
optimal heat adjustment and dish sequencing for best fuel efficiency and emissions.
Aside from encouraging appropriate technology and supporting consumer education initiatives, consumer
behavior change also requires new incentives and accountability requirements for donor and public-sector
efforts. This should include, for instance, rigorous metrics for tracking multifuel and multistove use (i.e., rather
than just total numbers of households reached or the penetration of clean and improved technologies as the
“primary” household cooking solution). Such metrics should link to increased support for those initiatives that
have greater potential to address the stove- and fuel-stacking challenge. As an example of the challenge, despite
nearly universal recognition by sector experts about the harmful effects of stacking on lean and improved
cooking solution interventions in Africa, there are few incentives for stove project developers to reduce
stacking behavior. In the case of carbon projects, there are diminishing marginal returns to developers from
distributing multiple improved stoves to the same household (i.e., the carbon credit received for the “second”
stove is significantly lower than that received for the first stove). Donor-supported market-driven and subsidy-
orientated stove distribution projects likewise often focus incentives on top-line reach metrics (i.e., number of
households with one clean or improved stove), rather than on multistove or multiburner clean stove adoption
that is likely to more fully displace traditional cooking solutions and, as a result, lead to better health outcomes.
3. Prioritize market-based approaches, but also deploy direct subsidies linked to health and climate impacts.
Market-led models should be emphasized wherever feasible to ensure sustainability. However, maximizing
climate and health benefits might also require targeted subsidies delivered through carbon markets and
focused “pull” mechanisms (e.g., results-based credits for health benefits).
Indirect subsidies for cooking market support and facilitation (e.g., consumer awareness, testing centers,
industry associations) have been an essential feature of all successful clean fuel and cookstove programs, both
in Africa and globally to date. The results of direct subsidies for producers have been more mixed, however,
and subsidies for consumers have been the most problematic in both modern-fuel and ICS markets—with
some evidence of slower longer-term cookstove uptake than via purely commercial approaches, higher risks
of promoting technologies that are not desired by consumers, and serious sustainability challenges when fuel
subsidies are withdrawn.



                                                               118
                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Despite these dangers, direct incentives via CDM and voluntary carbon schemes and new incentives tied to
health outcomes are needed to scale up genuinely clean cooking technologies, especially given their high
costs and the resulting affordability barriers. The logic of fuel savings, combined with larger and better-targeted
investments in consumer awareness, will continue to convince consumers to adopt highly efficient fuel-saving
appliances, such as rocket stoves. Holding fuel efficiency constant, there is little evidence that consumers are
willing to pay the incremental US$25–70 that separates high-quality industrial rocket stoves (US$25–50) from
truly clean advanced biomass gasifier solutions (US$50–100). If CDM markets recover, they may bridge a part
of this gap (e.g., lowering the end-consumer price by US$5–20), but additional measures will be needed to
compensate producers for introducing incremental health benefits that are not appreciated by consumers.
Potential mechanisms for structuring such producer and distributor incentives include performance-based
grants tied to proven health impacts, or perhaps innovative social impact bonds that can be linked to projected
public health system savings. Direct consumer subsidies can likewise be linked to impact and carefully targeted
via vouchers or comparable mechanisms, drawing on lessons from malaria bed nets, biogas digesters, and
existing ICS programs.
4. Support sustainable production of clean-biomass and renewable-fuel alternatives alongside efforts to
improve stove efficiency and reduce emissions. Given rapidly rising demand, more efficient cooking solutions
alone will not be enough if the sustainability issues in African woodfuel value chains remain unaddressed.
Historical trends make it clear that the rapid growth of woodfuel consumption in Africa, particularly charcoal, will
not be resolved via the adoption of more efficient ICS. Even universal adoption of basic ICS, for instance, will only
maintain the status quo of overall charcoal consumption by 2020, as it would simply cancel out the projected
30% increase in charcoal use. Mitigating the harmful environmental and climate change effects of biomass
cooking requires supply-side interventions—including more rational biomass supply markets (e.g., linkages to
sustainable forestry); more efficient biomass fuel-production technologies (e.g., higher-efficiency charcoal kilns);
renewable solid fuels from new sources (e.g., agricultural waste briquetting); the wider adoption of alternative
fuels, such as biogas and ethanol; and—where culturally appropriate—the promotion of supplementary
cooking solutions, such as solar ovens and retained-heat cookers.
Fuel-side interventions, when properly executed, have high potential for sustainable market-based approaches,
given the significantly larger scale of consumer spending on fuels than on stoves. Furthermore, some fuel
interventions have the advantage of the large labor force involved in producing and distributing cooking fuels—
which can, in theory, be co-opted into value chains for new improved and clean cooking fuels. In contrast, in
the case of modern fuels, such as LPG, and liquid biofuels, such as ethanol, fuel interventions can contend
with significant opposition from vested interests and may be politically sensitive whenever they compete with
traditional biomass fuel sources that are large drivers of employment.
5. Focus on providing critical public goods to accelerate the development of the clean cooking sector. Policy
makers should emphasize consumer education, access to finance, funding for R&D, the expansion of standards
and testing, and enabling fiscal and trade reforms (e.g., tax, tariff, and subsidy reform).
Despite numerous ongoing efforts of actors, such as the GACC and the World Bank, there is still a great deal
of debate about the role of donors and governments relative to the private sector in the improved and clean
cooking space. Report findings strongly suggest that even with very strong private-sector leadership, there
are multiple public goods that will require continued public-sector investment—with particular emphasis on
consumer education, access to finance for producers and distributors, quality standards, policy reform, and
market intelligence.
Publicly funded consumer education and marketing campaigns to promote awareness of solid-fuel harms
and new clean cooking solutions are an important complement to private-sector marketing efforts—as seen
in other market-transformation interventions focused on behavioral change (e.g., solar lanterns, malaria bed
nets, water filters, hand-washing campaigns). Aside from supporting “above-the-line” mass media campaigns for
clean cooking, governments also have a role to play in supporting the “below-the-line” experiential marketing
efforts of first-mover industrial stove promoters in rural and peri-urban areas. This can be achieved through
public–private partnerships that leverage the rural reach and consumer-education capabilities of government
agricultural and health extension agents who number in the several hundred thousands across SSA. While
such support will create private benefits for cookstove promoters, government and donor support for stove

                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
marketing on a cost-sharing basis is an appropriate measure for jumpstarting nascent markets for quality
cooking appliances.
Access to finance is a constraint across stove and fuel value chains, but donors and governments are uniquely
well positioned to support critical upstream and midstream finance bottlenecks (e.g., in-country producers,
importers, and distributors), via their engagement with financial institutions and SME promotion activities. As
for many other relatively low-cost consumer durable products, downstream access to finance is less promising,
given the high transaction costs of financing sub-US$100 products in Africa, with no successful examples of
downstream cookstove financing at scale. Downstream finance is important, however, for higher-cost cooking
technologies (US$500–1,500), such as biogas digesters.
Market intelligence is a vital public good at this early stage of sector development. Major knowledge gaps
include the lack of systematized field data on the performance of such new solutions as gasifiers under real-
world conditions; the weak base of knowledge on the systemic health, climate change, and livelihood impacts
of clean biomass and modern-fuel stoves; and a poor understanding of the potential African clean energy
consumer. Private-sector firms are poorly positioned to generate such market intelligence, given the high cost
of deploying large-scale consumer surveys in rural Africa. Donors have stepped up their market intelligence
activities, most notably in the market and consumer reports currently being funded by the GACC and the World
Bank’s ACCES program. In most cases, such investments are one-off contributions to improving the state of the
sector’s data. Longer-term government engagement (e.g., incorporation of more data on household cooking
into national energy, health, and demographic surveys) is therefore still needed to create a repeatable baseline
for clean and improved cooking solution penetration and use data.
On quality and standards, despite ongoing support from the GACC, the WB ACCES program, and other donors,
much more still needs to be done to facilitate a robust stove- and fuel-testing infrastructure. The capacity of
local testing laboratories is still constrained, and access to regional and global testing facilities is cost prohibitive
or impractical for many smaller cookstove enterprises, including the majority of artisanal and semi-industrial
ICS SMEs in Africa. High-quality stove emissions testing is costly and difficult to implement—an argument for
ongoing investment and technical assistance for a small subset of regional testing centers in Africa that will likely
have the capacity to carry such activities forward in the long term. On the other hand, stove efficiency testing
and field-testing know-how to verify the activities of stove manufacturers and carbon project developers are
important capabilities to build at a national level across the region.
Even with much more widespread stove testing in coming years, market participants interviewed for this report
uniformly reported that quality standards will remain an important issue, so long as artisanal stove manufacturers,
distributors, and—most critically—consumers are poorly educated about stove products and unable to
differentiate between the various performance and quality levels of stoves on the market. Governments can
play an important role in linking stove-testing results to consumer-labeling provisions and awareness-raising
interventions, in order to improve the overall quality profile of the African cookstove and cooking fuel market
over time. An important caution on donor efforts for quality assurance is that excessively burdensome standards
and testing procedures, if poorly deployed or if improperly interpreted by governmental standard-setting
bodies, may serve as a disincentive to market entry for high-quality producers.
Trade policy is also a major a barrier in many fuel and stove markets. For industrially produced cooking
appliances, taxes and duties often exclude the best technologies from domestic markets. For example, the
combination of value-added tax and tariffs tops 30% in a dozen markets across Africa, leading to 50–100%
increases in the end-user cost of stove appliances when all distribution value-chain margins are accounted for.
Even more important, such policies often adversely affect domestic cookstove assembly and manufacturing
because of the high cost of imported components. Retaining trade barriers to protect domestic artisanal stove
manufacturing is in many cases not a sensible approach, since artisanal stove markets and imported industrial
stoves often target different consumer segments. As in the case of other renewable and clean technologies,
such as solar lighting, a far better approach is to maximize the entry of high-performing stoves into the market
through tax exemptions for clean technologies and their components, while encouraging investment in local
assembly and manufacturing of clean and improved cooking solutions.
Supply-side policies also play an important role in fuel markets where better regulation of traditional biomass
supply chains is needed to bring woodfuels into the formal sector—and where government support and
public–private partnerships are vital for the development of modern (e.g., LPG) and renewable (e.g., ethanol)

revalidation and certification standards).

Recommendations for Private-Sector Stakeholders
1. Invest to capture the opportunity. Despite many challenges, the untapped SSA demand for clean and
improved cookstoves is immense—an opportunity further enhanced by a resilient voluntary carbon finance
market and attractive margins for market leaders. The market has tremendous potential, with more than 90
million fuel-purchasing households, including a growing middle class (more than 15% of consumers have a
per capita income of more than US$1,500) and spending of more than US$20 billion on cooking fuel annually.
Despite high prices and affordability constraints, the use of modern fuels is growing at a quick pace in several
markets (e.g., 16% year-on-year volume growth in Kenya); clean solid biomass production and liquid biofuel
enterprises are showing encouraging early results; and industrial and semi-industrial ICS manufacturers are
experiencing rapid year-on-year sales growth (30–200%), attractive margins (5–20%), and, thus far, low levels of
competition. The range of products and suppliers is very small relative to the potential consumer demand and
in comparison with other analogous markets. For example, fewer than 10 sizable international manufacturers
are focused on improved cookstoves, compared with more than 80 international manufacturers focused on
solar lanterns. This does not mean that the market lacks challenges; rather, the opportunity for early entrants,
including both multinational corporations and social entrepreneurs, is large.
2. Focus on cooking-fuel opportunities, not just cookstoves. The US$20 billion market for cooking fuel in SSA
is orders of magnitude larger than the market for cooking appliances. However, it is also more complex due
to often perverse regulatory incentives, vested interests, significant investment requirements (in the case of
modern fuels), and fragmented and informal markets for biomass fuel.
There is a significant opportunity for formal-sector entrepreneurs with access to capital to adopt improved
production technologies (e.g., efficient charcoal kilns) and capture attractive margins and rapid sales growth
from burgeoning charcoal markets. Renewable solid-fuel briquette and pellet manufacturing is a growing
opportunity for private enterprises ranging from artisanal producers to mid-sized industrial enterprises
manufacturing thousands of tons of fuel annually. For maximum uptake, end-user impact, and (potential)
profitability, clean solid biomass and renewable fuels can be integrated into clean cookstove business models
(e.g., free or low-cost cookstove distribution subsidized by high margins on fuel refill sales). The integrated fuel/
stove model is being piloted in several projects throughout Africa, and the early results are encouraging.
3. Grow market share by addressing the affordability challenge. Producers can reduce stove prices via low-
cost design and economies of scale, transitioning to local production or assembly, and embracing innovative
distribution and financing models that can lower upfront stove costs.
Affordability, while it is not the only barrier to cooking market development, is a major obstacle to the faster
adoption of higher-cost improved and clean stoves and fuels in Africa. The challenge may require demand-side
solutions, such as consumer finance, but in the near term can likely best be addressed by producers via tailored
product development and distribution strategies. Anecdotal evidence from interviews with Africa cooking-
sector stakeholders suggests that even small reductions in cost can have major uptake implications, with many
suggesting that a US$15–25 price point for highly efficient and clean stoves (US$15–75 lower than current
prices) is required to ensure much broader market volumes. The importance of price-reduction strategies is
also clearly evidenced by other SSA product markets, such as LPG, solar lanterns, and mobile phones, though as
described earlier in this report, any parallels to the mobile market must be drawn with caution.
Drawing on lessons from other sectors, from a product design standpoint, manufacturers can lower costs by
embracing “frugal design” solutions that include the use of indigenous or recycled materials; modular designs,
such as the ability to add separate accessories, pot holders, or plug-in TEG and fan units; and flat-pack solutions
that allow for local assembly with manageable trade-offs for product quality. The development of low-cost
intermediate ICS technologies in the US$10–20 range (e.g., semi-industrial metal rocket ICS in such markets as
Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, and Uganda) and an emerging tier of US$15–25 natural-draft gasifier stoves in multiple
pilots across the continent (e.g., GreenTech stove in The Gambia and Awamu/Mwoto in Uganda) are important
illustrations of the opportunity.

                               Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
Given the scale economies of Asia-based manufacturing, domestic production in Africa is not necessarily a path
to lower costs, but should be explored by industrial manufacturers of higher-cost ICS, ACS, and clean-fuel stoves
serious about the Africa market. Because transport, insurance costs, import duties, and related expenses (e.g.,
warehousing, importer margins) represent a large share (20–35%) of the final cost of international ICS products,
domestic production or assembly may be the answer in those SSA geographies that have sufficiently large
markets, low labor costs, sufficient labor quality, and access to quality materials. Africa-based production may be
most sensible in well-connected regional hubs (e.g., Kenya, Senegal, South Africa) where infrastructure linkages
and regional customs unions can ensure a large potential market for the logistics and tax exemption benefits
of local solutions. For low-tech/low-cost ICS, production is already predominantly local, so the more important
levers for cost control (while maintaining or boosting quality) are improved monitoring, mechanization, and
scale for existing artisanal enterprises—which in some cases may mean shifting from artisanal to semi-industrial
forms of production.
4. Address willingness-to-pay barriers head on. Focus on adapting marketing, distribution, and financing
models to address such willingness-to-pay challenges as low consumer awareness, trust gaps, and liquidity
constraints through proven approaches, including consumer education, field demonstrations, trial periods,
warranties, and pay-as-you-go schemes. At this stage in the market’s development, answering the willingness-
to-pay challenge calls for replication and scaling investment, more than it does for innovation. We already know
a great deal about marketing and distribution techniques that can boost consumer adoption, though such
approaches are still used by only a minority of market participants due to the siloed nature of many stove
markets and the poor understanding of the African consumer by many new market entrants.
5. Use a variety of distribution channels, with an emphasis on getting closer to the consumer. Reaching
scale will require exploiting a range of models—direct, third-party, institutional—with the greatest scale
seen by those who either take on the expense of building direct bridges to consumers or partner with third
parties possessing direct-sales or demand-aggregator capabilities (e.g., distributors of synergetic products
and household appliances, or carbon project coordinating/managing entities). The experience of the African
cookstove sector to date suggests there are no quick shortcuts to distribution scale. In rural areas, in particular,
appropriate distribution channels often simply do not exist and must be built from scratch by market players
serious about reaching such consumers. One important implication for the private sector is the need either
to built one’s own distribution networks or, for those players who wish to specialize in manufacturing and
design, to partner with large-scale distributors, such as carbon finance project managers, micro-franchising
experts (e.g., Living Goods), or even other off-grid energy device companies (e.g., solar lantern manufacturers).
These distribution partners typically have already gathered significant experience with constructing last-mile
distribution channels, comparable consumer segments, and equivalent behavior-change challenges.
6. Design products with an emphasis on the complete end-user experience and attention to quality at
every ISO performance tier. Most consumers, including the poor, are willing to pay for improved “aspirational”
stove designs that require minimal behavior change, while maximizing fuel savings, end-user convenience (e.g.,
cooking time), and durability.
While market spoilage stemming from consumer disappointment with low-quality products is only a concern
for the cookstove sector in a few countries, experience in other household energy markets (e.g., solar home
systems, solar lanterns) shows that the African consumer is mindful of product quality in terms of durability,
shelf life, and safety. There is also anecdotal evidence that better-performing cookstoves see faster sales growth
than products with inferior fuel efficiency and emissions performance. This is confirmed by the much faster
growth rates of semi-industrial and industrial stove enterprises in comparison with artisanal versions of the same
technologies. Consumer surveys likewise suggest that product design matters with end users—cookstoves
that are better adapted to consumer usage patterns (e.g., pot size, stove height, cooking time) receive higher
ratings from end users and are associated with higher willingness to pay. Self-reported sales and stove project
data suggest that the highest market growth in SSA today (at least for high-end ICS solutions) is correlated with
products that are perceived by the sector to have better design features.

Appendix 3: METHODOLOGY
FOR SIZING SOLID-FUEL COOKING
OPPORTUNITY COST
Our SSA impact model incorporates commonly attributed economic, health, and environmental impacts of
solid-fuel cooking and represents the total economic value—or opportunity cost—foregone annually because
of reliance on solid fuels. This is considered in relation to a best-case scenario of full adoption of higher-
performing ICS by African households, intermediate Tier 2–3 rocket stoves at the bottom of the range, and Tier
3–4 gasifier biomass stoves at the top of the range.
Naturally, the precise numbers will vary based on the assumptions used and on the counterfactual baseline.
For instance, in an alternate scenario where households that currently pay for solid fuels are shifted to LPG and
biomass fuel collectors are shifted to high-performing ICS, the mid-range opportunity cost of solid-fuel cooking
would be $27 billion, with higher health and environmental benefits and lower economic savings due to the
relatively high costs of LPG fuel use. Independently of the precise scenario used, however, it is clear that the
magnitude of the opportunity cost is in the high tens to the hundreds of billions of dollars.
For economic impact, key variables are avoidable economic values of solid-fuel spending, firewood collection
time, and cooking time. For health impacts, the model includes the economic costs of the most recent Lancet
HAP-related morbidity and mortality estimates, with the addition of burns linked to traditional solid-fuel stoves
and minor eye conditions linked to indoor smoke exposure. For environment and climate change impacts,
the model estimates the costs of deforestation (valued via potential afforestation costs) and the carbon credit
value of avoidable GHG emissions. The opportunity costs of time and related values throughout the model (e.g.,
cost of death due to HAP) are based on average gross national income for the SSA region and agricultural value
added using human-capital methodology. Cooking-fuel mix and fuel-use data draw on an up-to-date database
of national fuel consumption surveys for all 47 SSA countries.
The core methodological framework is derived from Hutton et al. (2007) and Jeuland and Pattanayak (2012).
Underlying assumptions are derived from the extensive existing literature on solid-fuel impacts, with strong
weighting toward SSA examples.

Appendix 4: Methodology for
Calculating SSA Fuel Mix and
Fuel Mix Evolution
The regional fuel mix was calculated by aggregating household survey data for 45 SSA countries based on
data maintained by the WHO Global Health Data Repository and/or from underlying country surveys from
the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the Living
Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), or national census sources for the most recent year available. As a proxy
for the year 2000, the analysis used household survey data from 1998 to 2002, depending on the country;
for the year 2010, 2007–12 data were used. Only actual survey data were used—the aggregated results were
triangulated with WHO parametric estimates for 2010, but WHO parametric data were not used. Survey data
were cleaned to ensure that rural and urban mix data tallied to country totals, and absolute counts of fuel-user
populations were computed by multiplying fuel mix with UN population estimates.
The regional fuel mix was projected to 2015 and 2020 by computing the historical annual changes in fuel
share for each fuel (2000–10) for both rural and urban areas, assuming that the historical change will continue
going forward in a linear fashion through 2020, and remixing the forecasted urban and rural fuel shares by UN
forecasts for rural and urban population for each country. In effect, this analysis derives an “inertial case” fuel mix
for each cooking fuel, adjusted for population growth and urbanization rates. At a country level, this approach
may be inaccurate (it does not take into account differential GDP growth, for example), but at the regional
level the data are likely robust and fit well with IEA/OECD 2010 projections for the overall African solid-fuel
population (about 850 million in 2020).

Appendix 6: Methodology for
Fuel Market Sizing and Forecast
The value of the fuel market in 2010 is based on the estimated fuel mix, average SSA fuel prices, and average
annual per-household fuel consumption for users of “primary” fuels. The logic of the model is that households
using “primary” fuels (as reflected in fuel mix data) purchase a standard amount of fuel and pay the prevailing
average retail market price.


Data Sources and Methodology for 2010 Market Sizing
Fuel mix: The SSA regional fuel mix is derived from the regional fuel mix analysis and draws on surveys for all 45
SSA countries (see Appendixes 4 and 5).
Fuel prices: Average 2010 fuel unit prices draw on a proprietary database of LPG, charcoal, kerosene, and
electricity for the SSA region derived from press searches and pre-existing databases, such as the 2000–9
kerosene price database from Lighting Africa (2012), the UPDEA (2009) survey of electricity prices across the
continent, and Data Monitor Statistical Review of LPG and WLPGA for LPG retail prices. Where possible, the
prices are weighted by country fuel volumes (e.g., for charcoal, LPG, and electricity), to get the true average
regional price. For those fuels that may be freely collected (e.g., dung, crop waste, firewood), the fuel collector
vs. purchaser share is estimated based on country-level surveys (e.g., 12 country data points on the share of
firewood-using households purchasing wood).
Fuel-use volumes: The average annual per-household fuel consumption data from Schlag and Zuzarte (2008)
and the World Bank (2011b) assumes a standard household cooking “diet” of 320 MJ per month per household
using a fuel as its primary cooking source, which equates to 2.5 meals per day for a household of 5. The average
fuel consumption is computed for each major stove type (e.g., traditional, basic, intermediate, advanced for
wood), using the average fuel savings rate for each fuel. Total fuel consumption volume calculations take into
account the baseline penetration of each stove type. The size of the “secondary” cooking fuel market is estimated
separately — i.e., fuel use by households who use a different fuel as their primary cooking energy (e.g., LPG use
by households who primarily cook with biomass). The secondary market is estimated based on a few country
proxies (e.g., Kojima et al. 2011 data on multifuel use for Kenya). Total cooking fuel consumption volumes for
the region have been validated by triangulating the results with other aggregate regional fuel consumption
databases (e.g., FAO 2010 data for wood and charcoal, WLPGA for LPG volumes, South Africa Coal Association
for SSA coal volumes).


Methodology for 2020 Fuel Market Forecast
The 2020 fuel market forecast utilizes 2020 fuel mix data from the regional fuel mix analysis (Appendix 5),
projects stove penetration rates and associated changes in average fuel volumes per household from the ICS
penetration forecast model (Appendix 9), and projects fuel prices using historical price trends from SSA fuel
data series data for 2000–10. All fuel prices are discounted by the global Consumer Price Index inflation rate
(about 2.4%) to ensure comparability with 2010 data.
Tables 6.1 and 6.2 show key fuel volume, price, and price growth rate assumptions.

Appendix 7: Methodology
for Analyzing Emissions from
Solid-Fuel Cooking
To assess the environmental and climate change impacts of solid-fuel reliance in Africa, the report authors
developed a bottom-up inventory of the GHG and black carbon (BC) emissions resulting from charcoal
production as well as solid-fuel cooking, using all common solid-fuel stove types. The analysis does not include
emissions from kerosene stoves.
The analysis has involved (1) identifying common emission ranges (grams per unit of fuel used) for key gases
and particles released from incomplete fuel combustion for all common types of SSA stoves, (2) converting
emissions to CO2 equivalents using a 100-year global warming potential (GWP-100) conversion factor, (3)
applying emissions to the volume of fuel burned by each type of stove in Africa, and (4) cross-checking
the aggregated GHG Kyoto emission and BC accounting with existing inventories of global emissions. Key
stove types considered include traditional wood stoves, basic efficient wood ICS (e.g., ceramic wood stoves),
intermediate wood ICS/rocket stoves, traditional charcoal stoves, basic efficient charcoal stoves (e.g., KCJ), and
unvented coal stoves. The report also assesses the emissions of LPG stoves, advanced wood ICS (fan gasifier),
and advanced charcoal ICS (e.g., Envirofit 4400), to develop a baseline for emissions abatement in the case
that households switch to clean (or cleaner) technologies. For CO2 emissions, the report assumes 50–90% fNRB
(nonrenewability ratio) for charcoal, 10–90% fNRB for wood, 0% fNRB for dung and crop waste, and 100% fNRB
for such fossil fuels as LPG and coal.
Detailed calculations are available upon request from the authors. Key assumptions and the results of the
analysis are shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.

Segmentation Methodology
To facilitate market analysis, this report relies on a rough segmentation of fuel users across the regions of SSA
(East, West, Southern, Central) for all major fuel types (wood, charcoal, kerosene, electricity, LPG, and others) by
three income levels (low = under BoP 500, medium = BoP 500–1,500, high = BoP 1,500+) and fuel procurement
approach (purchasing vs. collecting). The raw data generated by this analysis are used to further subdivide the
SSA consumer into 7 distinct segments, which are then profiled in the report.
The methodology and data sources for the analysis are presented in Tables 8.1 through 8.4.:

1.	 Regional fuel segmentation: Regional fuel mix data for 2010 (see Appendix 5).
2.	 Regional income segmentation: A consistent (absolute) income segmentation for each African region is
    derived from Hammond et al. (2007) income segmentation survey data, which allows us to segment the
    rural and urban population in each region into BoP income bands (<BoP 500, BoP 500–1,000, BoP 1,000–
    1,500, 1,500–3,000, 3,000+). WRI BoP survey data are available for only 11 African countries.

    Sudan, Swaziland, and Togo to extrapolate a general SSA-wide fuel penetration rate by income quintile.
    DHS income quintiles are remixed into High (top quintile), Medium (next two quintiles), and Low (bottom
    two quintiles).
4.	 Wood purchaser vs. collector: The wood-using population is segmented further into wood purchasers and
    collectors. On average, survey data from 12 SSA countries suggest that roughly 30% of wood primary fuel
    users purchase their fuel. Using this benchmark for the SSA average and survey data from half a dozen SSA
    countries where fuel-purchasing rates are available by income level, the report estimates fuel-purchasing
    rates per income tier.	
The data from these four analyses were cross-tabulated into an overall SSA consumer matrix, from which
the report extracts seven consumer subsegments with common hypothesized behavioral or purchasing
characteristics. These segments were then profiled in detail on the basis of desk research and interview insights.

Appendix 9: Methodology for
Analyzing ICS Penetration
The ICS penetration analysis draws on a country-level database for improved cookstove and modern-fuel
penetration; based on well over 100 sources, it contains data points for each country in SSA. The penetration
numbers are a conservative estimate, and ranges are used wherever possible.
Key aspects of the methodology and data sources include the following three databases.
ICS country-level database: The country-level penetration database tallies total ICS penetration using bottom-
up data sources ranging from WHO data for chimney stoves, to donor databases (ProBEC, EnDev), national
surveys (e.g., ProBEC country baselines, USAID country baselines, Shell Foundation), Global Alliance for Clean
Cookstoves market assessments, press searches, national program data, and stakeholder interviews. The data
are ranged where possible, and all numbers are adjusted to reflect current penetration. For example, cumulative
sales over long time series are converted into annual sales data and multiplied by average stove life, to ensure
that only the current stove-using HH number is used. Household survey data indicating ICS penetration are
prioritized in all cases where they are available.
Chimney stove penetration (WHO data): Chimney stove data, including information on both “legacy” chimney
stoves and vented intermediate improved solutions (e.g., chimney rocket stoves), are, based on a WHO country
database that draws on the most recent year known of DHS/MICS survey data. Countries where no DHS/MICS
survey data are available (a dozen across Africa) are conservatively rated at 0% chimney stove penetration, unless
other data on chimney stoves are available. While the chimney stove number has been used in earlier analyses
to defined the universe of “improved biomass stoves” (e.g., UNDP/WHO 2009), it is not used in this fashion in
this analysis, as the data are both over- and under-inclusive. First, chimney stoves include many stoves that are
not truly improved—i.e., self-constructed chimney stoves or legacy stoves with low fuel efficiency. Second, the
WHO chimney stove number does not include portable nonchimney ICS, which are a large and important
segment in the SSA region that ranges from portable basic wood and charcoal stoves to intermediate portable
rocket and charcoal stoves, and a rising number of advanced natural- and fan-draft gasifiers.
Industrial/semi-industrial manufacturer database: Using interview insights, publicly available manufacturer
data, and sanitized surveys from the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves,
the report team collated a database of sales for the top-30 global or domestic manufacturers focused on the
SSA region. The data are self-reported, are at times dated, and have been interpreted conservatively.
Across all of these data sources, ICS penetration information has been captured at the country level and, where
possible, categorized by (1) urban vs. rural customer share for each stove, (2) fuel type (wood, charcoal, hybrid),
(3) domestic production vs. import, (4) portable vs. semi-fixed, and (5) government vs. private sector vs. donor
program channel. The data have then been aggregated to enable the region-wide segmentation of common
stove types.

Appendix 10: ICS Market Forecast
The ICS forecast creates a baseline forecast scenario on the basis of historical cumulative penetration growth
rates of various cookstove segments. The data are relatively robust at the first level of the hierarchy (i.e., legacy
chimney vs. built-in vs. portable artisanal vs. portable industrial vs. portable semi-industrial). There is far less
certainty about the relative growth rates of different subsegments (e.g., portable wood stoves industrial versus
portable charcoal stoves industrial), so the subsegment forecast data are not used in the report.
Historical segment growth rates are based on market-penetration time series, cumulative sales, and annual sales
growth data for 3–20 years for a dozen stove types, drawing on press reports and confidential data shared with
the report team by manufacturers and stove program managers.

NOTES
1
  See GACC (2012), Ekouevi and Tountivate (2012), and World Bank (2011a). At the country level, the Global Alliance Market
Assessment reports are an important resource on the cooking landscape in such countries as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda (www.cleancookstoves.org).

    For a detailed overview of SSA cookstoves, see Appendix 1.
3
  That the ISO/IWA standards promoted by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves cannot be neatly mapped to stove
technologies is due to the range of stove performance in the field within each technology category. Indicative ISO tier ranges
are provided in Appendix 2 to suggest the relative performance levels of average stoves within each technology category,
excluding outlier products. The World Bank, in coordination with SE4All, is currently developing integrated performance
ratings across multiple performance dimensions (such as efficiency, emissions, safety, and stove life) that will incorporate
and build on the new ISO/IWA standards.
4
  Kenya’s Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and the United States’ American National Standards Institute (ANSI) serve as co-
secretariats of the ISO Technical Committee 285, which is comprised of other participating national committees, including
more than 20 participant countries, 14 observer nations, and approved external liaisons. The ISO Technical Committee held
its first meeting in February 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya, in order to review gaps in the current standards and to align on a
roadmap for future action. A subsequent meeting to further detail these standards with the aid of four sectoral working
groups was recently held in Antigua, Guatemala, in October 2014.
5
  Project evaluations and recent randomized controlled trials in India (Hanna et al. 2012) and Ghana (Burwen and Levine
2012) suggest that many “legacy” chimney stoves likely do meet Tier 1 standards for fuel efficiency and emission reductions,
but they are included here under the ICS definition due to their prevalence in the field.
6
 There is a wide range of performance in pilot-fan and natural-draft gasifier models tested over the years by reputable testing
centers and researchers (see, e.g., Berkeley Air Monitoring Group 2010, Jetter et al. 2012), with some of these appliances
falling into the Tier 2 or even Tier 1 particulate emissions range. The best-performing fan-gasifier stoves, including several
of the solutions that are currently being commercialized in Africa, do reach Tier 3 emissions performance and, based on
self-reported results, may approach Tier 4 performance under some circumstances. Natural-draft gasifiers tend to have
higher emissions than fan gasifiers, with higher variability of field performance. The best natural-draft gasifiers, however, can
approach average fan-gasifier performance under controlled cooking conditions.
7
  For emerging evidence on the HAP risks of kerosene cooking, particularly with poor-quality kerosene wick stoves that are
so common in Africa, see Berkeley Air Monitoring Group 2010, Lam et al. (2012), and Pokhrel et al. (2010). It is also important
to note that poorly made kerosene stoves in particular pose safety concerns, including the potential for severe burns and
injury associated with accidental fires (Peck et al. 2008).
8
  This is based on the latest solid-fuel penetration data for all SSA countries from DHS, MIS, LSMS, and national census surveys;
data have been triangulated with WHO Global Health Database parametric estimates for 2010. Data on penetration of
advanced gasifier stoves are based on self-reported manufacturer and program data across Africa.

  For the opportunity-cost analysis methodology, see Appendix 3. The analysis incorporates economic, health, and
environmental/climate change effects and is informed by previous cost-benefit analysis reviews of the sector, including
Jeuland and Pattanayak (2012), Garcia Frapolli et al. (2010), and Hutton et al. (2007).

al. (2000, 2004), and Ezzati and Kammen (2001); chronic pulmonary disease in Bruce et al. (2000) and Kurmi et al. (2010); lung
cancer in Hosgood et al. (2014) and Bruce et al. 2015; cataracts in Siddiqui et al. (2005) and Pokhrel et al. (2005); and low birth
weights and perinatal mortality in Misra et al. (2012) and Sreeramareddy et al. (2011).

   Household expenditure data are based on WB energy expenditure surveys in Bacon et al. (2010), national census sources,
and other energy surveys; cooking and lighting are typically not disaggregated, but calculations are based on average fuel
volumes and prices suggest that cooking constitutes 40–80% of total household expenditure, depending on country fuel
mix. Daurella and Foster (2009) report 7% of total household expenditure going toward LPG, kerosene, and charcoal cooking
fuels across a large sample of African countries; WRI surveys in 30 developing countries globally point to 7% average energy
expenditures, including both lighting and cooking (Hammond et al. 2007).
16
   See methodology in Appendix 3. The estimate is based on aggregate estimated fuel consumption volumes and
average market prices across Africa; the forecast is based on a linear extrapolation of historical fuel-mix trends, adjusted for
urbanization/population growth and historical fuel-price growth trends. It is consistent with the WB estimate of US$7 billion
in annual spending in Africa on charcoal alone (World Bank 2011b).
17
  The systemic review of 50 country-survey data points for this report indicates that the average SSA firewood-collecting
household spends two hours a day on firewood collection and three hours on cooking. To estimate time wastage, the report
assumes potential 100% time savings for firewood collection and 50% reduction in cooking time from switching to LPG from
baseline cooking technologies.
18
   This figure, which includes 200 million tons (MT) of firewood and 22 MT of charcoal for cooking, is based on SSA country
fuel-mix surveys and average-per-HH consumption data. It assumes six kilograms of wood per kilogram of charcoal and
compares with FAO’s 2010 estimate (which included nonhousehold and noncooking woodfuel uses) of 25 MT of charcoal
and 280 MT of firewood.
19
     See World Bank (2011b).
20
  See methodology in Appendix 4. The estimate is based on a bottom-up inventory of emissions for common fuel-stove
combinations across Africa applied to aggregate fuel-consumption volumes. The range reflects uncertainty regarding
the share of SSA woodfuel that is sourced nonrenewably (fNRB), since CO2 emissions from renewably sourced wood are
sequestered during wood regrowth and have no global warming impact. The report uses an fNRB range of 10% (Solomon
et al. 2007) to 90% (UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism) for firewood and 50% to 90% for charcoal.

   For the latest on impacts for stove emissions of black carbon, see Bond et al. (2013) and Ekouevi and Tountivate (2012).
Local BC climate impacts in Africa likely include contributions to Kilimanjaro and Rwenzori Range glacial melting and related
downstream effects.

     See World Bank (2011b); see also Figure 19 and related discussion in text.
23
  Rough estimate based on assumption of 2 tons of GHG (including non-Kyoto particles and PM) per ton of firewood
consumed and 8 tons of GHG per ton of charcoal produced and consumed. The top-10 countries, in order, are Nigeria,
Ethiopia, DRC, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Côte d’Ivoire.
24
   See, for example, Westinga et al. (2013), which compares consecutive (1990–2010) census-based FAO Forest Resources
Assessments (FRAs) of Rwanda, with contemporary fine-resolution satellite images that demonstrate significantly greater
deforestation than noted in FRAs. More generally, many scholars question the data quality of FRAs.

showing 27% savings (Bensch et al. 2013).

   Portable rocket ICS evaluations in Africa have shown significant savings; see, e.g., EcoZoom Dura wood rocket stove data
showing 65% wood savings (Barstow et al. 2014); and Envirofit and StoveTec/EcoZoom evaluation in Tanzania, Uganda, and
Malawi showing 38–50% fuel savings under real-world conditions (Adkins et. al. 2010);

32
   Semi-industrial and artisanal built-in rocket ICS, such as the Uganda Rocket Lorena (Malinski 2006) and the Ethiopia Mirt
stove (MeGen Power 2008), have demonstrated household-level savings of 40–66% in field trials.
33
  Independent RCTs are ongoing in Africa. Self-reported data from companies manufacturing fan-gasifier stoves, such as
BioLite and Philips/ACE, or Africa distributors working with such products, suggest that household-level fuel savings of
50–65% are achievable with traditional biomass fuels (e.g., straw, crop waste, wood) and, while the result is not directly
comparable, could exceed 80% for stoves calibrated for pellet use. Self-reported fuel-saving results for some African natural-
draft stoves are comparable or even higher—for example, 70% for the Vesto stove in Swaziland, 75% for the Aron stove in
Nigeria, and 80% for the “mlc” rice husk gasifier stove in Chad and Cameroon (Roth 2014). Comparable results have been
demonstrated in international field trials of ACS technologies; see Ternes et al. (2008) pilot data for Costa Rica natural-draft
ACS reaching 40–70% fuel savings, and Kar et al. (2011) for India gasifier trial data.
34
   For biogas, there are no robust field data from Africa pilots. The international experience in Lao PDR (Synesis 2011),
Indonesia (JRI Research 2011), and Bangladesh (iDE 2011) suggests that woodfuel savings can be significant (66–80%), even
when traditional stove persistence is factored into the analysis. For solar, Szulczewski (2006) reports household fuel savings
of 25–40% in a field trial of a cookstove in Kenya and Ethiopia, but a more recent RCT in Ghana showed no statistically
significant impact on fuel savings once fuel stacking was taken into account (Levine and Beltramo 2012). For LPG, Malla et
al. (2011) showed only woodfuel-consumption impacts in Sudan and Kenya from LPG pilots (50–70%) due to the lack of
displacement of baseline technologies.
35
   See MacCarty et al. (2008) for technology overview. For biogas, evaluations show very notable reductions in HAP exposures
and end-user reports of improved health outcomes, though impacts on lung function are not conclusive (Dooho et al. 2012;
Apsleya et al. 2014). Under normal use conditions, when stacking is taken into account, actual impacts on health are likely to
be substantially lower than the potential for the technology (see, e.g., Semple et al. 2014), showing only 25–30% decreases
in daily particulate emissions in biogas-using households in Uganda.
36
     Madagascar ethanol pilot data in Practical Action (2011).
37
   Simon et al. (2014) argue that only the very cleanest cooking solutions—a group that, pending further evidence, may
include the best-performing biomass gasifier stoves—can generate health effects. See also Hawley and Volckens (2014), the
first in-vitro study showing that improved cookstoves have the potential to reduce respiratory inflammation; it does this by
comparing the effects of a traditional, a rocket, and a gasifier stove.
38
   Currently, of all technologies actually commercialized in the Africa market, the Philips HD4012 fan-gasifier stove likely
comes closest to an IWA Tier 4 standard, but even with well-calibrated pellet fuels, is still a Tier 3 emissions stove (Jetter et al.
2012). Anecdotal evidence from Asia suggests that multipot chimney gasifiers can reach into the Tier 4 emissions range, but
independent evidence for such stoves is not yet available.
39
  Burn Design Lab, for instance, is working on developing a prototype of a natural-draft gasifier that can approach IWA
Tier 4 standards by 2016. It is doing so with financial support from the U.S. Department of Energy and in collaboration
with players, such as Berkeley Air Monitoring Group 2010 (see www.burndesignlab.org). Designers who would prefer to
remain anonymous at this stage are also beginning to work on the development of a next-generation, multipot, IWA-Tier-4-
emissions fan-gasifier stove with advanced functionality (e.g., spark ignition).

  Regional data and specific-country trends are based on (1) the most recent available fuel-use survey data for all SSA
countries from MICS, DHS, and LSMS and (2) national census and energy surveys.
43
  WHO’s Global Disease Burden 2010 analysis, which is based on more than 600 survey data points, shows a decline in global
solid-fuel dependence from 53% in 1990 to about 50% in 2000 and to 41% in 2010 (Bonjour et al. 2013). WHO’s analysis of
Africa over the same time period, using parametric country estimates for 2010, shows a decline from about 80% in 2000 to
77% in 2010. This report’s analysis of actual (nonparametric) survey data for years most closely approximating 1995, 2000, and
2010 suggests no noticeable decline for the SSA region (i.e., solid-fuel use remains in the 80–82% range).
44
   The most common drivers for such “backsliding” down the energy ladder are modern-fuel supply chain interruptions and
the discontinuation of subsidies. Nigeria is a notable example of both, with the high prices of kerosene and LPG leading
to large spikes in woodfuel demand. Between 2000 and 2008, for instance, tracking the overall countrywide trend, the
percentage of households using firewood as the primary source of domestic energy rose from 10% to 45% for low-income
groups and from 4% to 25% for medium-income consumers (Abd’razack et al. 2012). In Zimbabwe, the rapid recent increase
in urban firewood consumption has been triggered by electricity outages (Chazovachii et al. 2013). In Senegal and Tanzania,
rising charcoal use can be traced to LPG shortages.

   The 20–50% estimate range is based on sector stakeholder interviews in such countries as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and
Senegal. Interview perspectives were triangulated with data from a large-scale Kenya household survey that related primary
and secondary fuel-user numbers for a range of modern-fuel types; the resulting data in Kenya showed a 52% (maximum)
overlap between primary (16.9% of total HH) and secondary (9% of HH) modern-fuel users. For individual modern fuels,
the secondary-to-primary user ratio was 36% for LPG users, 80% for electricity (albeit with a very small sample), and 56% for
kerosene (raw data sourced from Kojima et al. 2011). A similar World Bank survey in Senegal (Practical Action 2014) showed
a ratio of 20–50% for LPG in urban and peri-urban Dakar and 30% in urban Sant-Louis.
50
   This report’s forecast methodology uses a linear extrapolation of 2000–10 fuel-use trends, adjusted by overall population
growth and urbanization, and suggests that the SSA region may reach up to 900 million solid-fuel households by 2020. IEA/
OECD conducted a similar analysis that suggests an SSA solid-fuel population that is closer to 850 million in 2020, continuing
to grow to 918 million in 2030 (IEA 2010).
 A minimum solid-fuel population of 850 million, minus 70–80 million of incremental LPG and biogas users (based on the
51

most optimistic industry and program forecasts), still leads to a solid-fuel population of more than 750 million.
52
   Fuel-price trends are based on 2000–12 time-series data for key cooking fuels for 15–45 countries in Africa (depending
on the fuel). The data were collected from multiple sources, including pre-existing databases (e.g., the IFC/Lighting Africa
kerosene database), official price bulletins (e.g., electricity and LPG prices published by regulatory agencies), and press
reports on retail fuel prices (typically in the capital city market). Note: Due to complex structure of retail LPG and kerosene
cooking fuel markets, the last mile fuel prices tends to lag considerably behind global fossil fuel indices with a 50% decline
in oil prices in 2014-2015 leading to only a 5-15% decline in LPG prices at the last mile based on our fuel tracker.


53
   The poverty premium for charcoal purchases is based on data points for 10 SSA countries comparing the costs of 1–2-kg
charcoal sacks/buckets against the costs of standard 40–60-kg bags.
54
     See Appendix 4 for methodology.
55
   This analysis is based on estimated sales by cooking technology in 2010, including replacements and new penetration
of all variants of charcoal and wood ICS, ethanol stoves, LPG stoves, electric stoves, and Africa biogas plants. Drawing on
historical penetration rates, average stove life, and typical costs for key stove types, the market for clean and improved stove
technologies is estimated at less than US$250 million annually, not including the US$50–100 million annual SSA carbon
finance revenue streams that are not paid by consumers. It was more difficult to estimate the annual sales of unimproved
wood and charcoal stoves. Data on the number of such stoves that are purchased commercially (e.g., traditional charcoal
bucket stoves, ceramic wood stoves), as opposed to self-manufactured by households (e.g., mud stoves, three-stone fires)
are scarce. Even at the high end of estimates, however, annual purchases of traditional stoves in SSA are unlikely to exceed
US$50 million annually (assuming 50% of all traditional stoves are purchased, purchase price of less than US$2, and a lifetime
of 1–2 years).
56
  Potential customer segments can be defined in innumerable ways; the report team has chosen the present segmentation
in consultation with sector stakeholders to reflect distinct fuel- and stove-purchasing characteristics of large swaths of the
African population. It is also important to note that African households using renewable solutions, such as solar, biogas
digesters, and briquette/pellet fuels, and biofuels like ethanol are too few for meaningful segmentation (at maximum, in the
tens of thousands for each of these technologies), and are therefore excluded from the analysis. While the methodology
differs, for a dozen SSA markets and some market niches (e.g., LPG use in Kenya), more detailed country-level segmentations
are available in market assessment reports developed by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. See the growing list of
market assessments at www.cleancookstoves.org.
57
  Hard longitudinal survey data in Africa on the share of firewood-dependent households purchasing fuel rather than
collecting it are limited, but there is extensive anecdotal evidence from interviews with stove program managers that wood-
purchasing behavior is increasing as incomes rise and firewood collection becomes more difficult (i.e., progressively longer
collection time due to wood scarcity in the vicinity of urban areas).
 Urban firewood-purchasing poor are most common in large West African urban markets, such as Cameroon, Burkina Faso,
58

Gambia, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, where firewood use in urban areas exceeds half of the urban population.
 Dalberg’s database on SSA wood use, with data points on more than 20 countries, shows, for instance, that 30% of Kenya
59

wood-purchasing households also collected fuel; the ratio was comparable in Malawi and stands at 20% in Mozambique.




                                                                  156

60
   Press reports of spikes in firewood purchasing during the rainy season abound in countries as diverse as Nigeria, Uganda,
Cameroon, Rwanda, and Kenya, but no quantitative survey data on this phenomenon can be found.
61
  As with modern fuels (see note 50), the number of primary fuel users for charcoal is deceptive, given the prevalence of
multifuel and multistove households. Data from Kenya (Kojima et al. 2011) and Senegal (Practical Action 2014) suggest
that the actual number of charcoal users may be anywhere between 1.5 and 2.5 times larger than the number of primary
charcoal-using households. Applying an average multiplier of two yields a total charcoal-using population of about 50
million African charcoal users.
62
  Old FAO models suggest 30–50% growth in the number of charcoal users by 2020; the market forecast model in this report
suggests the market could grow even more quickly (50–70%), based on current charcoal demand trends.
63
  The city list is informed both by Africa-wide household survey evidence for charcoal cooking dependence, as well as by
the sanitized proprietary database developed by a cookstove manufacturer that focuses on African urban charcoal cooking
markets.
64
     Author interviews in Kibera, Kenya, in 2011.
65
   Although modern fuels serve as the primary fuel for 17% of Africans, in absolute terms the number of SSA modern-fuel
users is substantially larger. Applying a 1.2–1.5x multiplier to modern-fuel users to reflect fuel stacking, there may be as many
as 45 million households in Africa who use one of these fuels at least occasionally, and are therefore owners of a kerosene,
LPG, or electric stove (see note 50 and associated text).
66
   McKinsey (2010) projects that the African population with disposable incomes, defined as households with purchasing
power parity (PPP) incomes of above US$5,000 annually, will grow from 85 million to 128 million in 2020.

     See note 7.
68
   A good starting point for the literature on (largely demand-side) factors for improved stove uptake is the in-depth systemic
review recently conducted by a team of researchers with Department for International Development support (Rehfuess et
al. 2014 and Puzzolo et al. 2013) and an earlier multicountry review focused on stove-adoption factors (Lewis and Pattanayak
2012). Building on such global systemic reviews, the demand driver discussion in this report is also informed by end-user
preference data from 20 SSA stove program evaluations across eight countries and extensive report team interviews with
SSA stove program managers, stove designers, and entrepreneurs.
Key country end-user survey data sets reviewed for this analysis included, by country: Mozambique ICS end-user survey
(Risseeuw 2012); Kenya evaluation of a basic ICS (jiko upesi) program (Person et al. 2012) and household survey of urban
intermediate charcoal ICS (Burn Design Jiko Poa) users (Sharma 2012); Burkina Faso FAFASO rocket and basic ICS stove
program evaluation (Bensch et al. 2013); Malawi basic ICS evaluation for ProBEC (Malinski 2006); Ethiopia Mirt stove evaluations
(Gebreegziabher et al. 2014 and MeGen Power 2008); Uganda efficient ProBEC stove user survey (AED 2008), Rocket Lorena
impact evaluation (Malinski 2006), ICS pilot evaluation for the Uganda Millenium Village Program (Adkins et al. 2010),
formative research on peri-urban stove users near Kampala (Martin et al. 2013), and Acholi district stove consumer survey
(Nicholson and Beevers 2013); Ghana household energy survey in Axim region (Manyo-Plange 2011); Senegal household
energy survey in multiple locations around the country (Practical Action 2014); and Tanzania Jiko Bora charcoal ICS program
evaluation for ProBEC (Evodius 2010) and an assessment of an ICS pilot for the Millenium Village Program (Adkins et al. 2010).
69
   Generally, ICS and clean fuel adoption is positively correlated with greater household income and wealth (Rehfuess et al.
2014; Lewis and Pattanayak 2012; Miller and Mobarak 2011; and Levine et al. 2010). Educational attainment is a positive proxy
for demand, as it reflects greater household awareness of stove benefits, including a better ability to assess the economic
pay-off of switching to new technologies and a greater appreciation for such noneconomic benefits as health (Rehfuess et
al. 2014). The household status of women, including their level of autonomy and decision-making power, is an important
determinant of demand in patriarchal developing-world societies, as it correlates with women’s ability to actualize their
preferences for improved cooking solutions (Miller and Mobarak 2013). These factors are often context-specific. For instance,
household size is positively correlated to demand in markets where households have no choice but to purchase their
fuel (Levine et al. 2010); however, in rural and very poor urban environments, there is some evidence that large biomass-
dependent households may actually have less demand for improved stoves than smaller ones, since they have more spare
labor, and therefore lower implicit opportunity costs, to collect firewood for cooking (van der Kroon et al. 2014; Mekonnen
and Kohlin 2008).
70
     See in-depth discussion under “African End-user Preferences for Stove Design and Performance” later in this chapter.
71
   Consumer awareness is consistently rated as an important demand driver, and overall levels of ICS awareness and
knowledge of the harms of traditional cooking are low across the SSA region (Rehfuess et al. 2014; Puzzolo et al. 2013. Even
where there is awareness of basic ICS, there are very few places in Africa with extensive awareness of more efficient and
cleaner cooking solutions and their benefits. For example, in a recent large-scale Uganda survey, 58–60% of consumers
were not sure that an ICS saves either time or money (TNS 2013). In a survey conducted in Maputo, Mozambique, 28% of
consumers were not aware of potential ICS impacts on fuel expenditures, and a full 55% did not know about the long-term

health harms of traditional charcoal cooking (Risseouw 2012). In a survey of women in the Gondar region of Ethiopia, the
results showed that only 20% of women realized that traditional stove emissions are harmful for children, and only 13%
believed that inhaling indoor emissions is a “cause for concern” (Edelstein et al. 2008).
72
  There is a growing body of cognitive economics research on the issue of “present bias” in the context of distributing health-
or wealth-generating products to the base of the pyramid (see, e.g., Banerjee and Mullainathan 2010). Levine et al. (2012)
explore this issue for cookstoves in the context of a Uganda ICS pilot. The issue is, of course, not unique to African stove
consumers; it is a challenge marketers have successfully tackled in developed markets for such products as life insurance
that require trading near-term costs for long-term benefits. The particular challenge in the Africa cooking market case is to
develop the kind of refined awareness-building and marketing techniques that acknowledge and then work around the
present bias issue.
73
  See the discussions on consumer trust and its importance for stove adoption in Beltramo et al. (2014a and 2014b), Levine
et al. (2012), O’Dell et al. (2013), and Miller and Mobarak (2011).

77
  Affordability issues are often discussed interchangeably, with adoption factors affecting consumers’ willingness to use a
new solution. For terminological clarity, we deal with affordability separately from other stove-adoption factors later in the
report.
78
  The literature on clean and improved cooking solutions has no universally accepted definition of willingness to adopt.
We define “willingness to adopt” as the household’s openness to partly or fully displace its existing cookstove with a new
cooking solution on a sustained basis. The features and performance of the cooking technology, consumer awareness, trust
in quality, and easy access to the stove, its replacement parts, and associated fuel are directly linked to the initial willingness
to adopt a technology. Sustained use, as distinct from the initial adoption decision, is largely determined by only the first of
these factors—i.e., stove design and performance. For the distinction between factors of initial adoption and sustained use,
see Puzzolo et al. (2013).
79
   The household’s willingness to pay, defined as the maximum amount a person would be willing to pay, sacrifice, or
exchange in order to receive a new cookstove, is related to willingness to adopt but is a distinct concept. A high willingness
to adopt a new product may not translate into willingness to pay for it when households believe that the product may be
obtained elsewhere at lower or no cost (e.g., via government subsidy schemes, through NGO efforts) or when lower-cost
alternatives are available. Unlike willingness to adopt, which is independent from considerations of cost and affordability,
willingness to pay a specific amount for a new stove is contingent on consumers’ disposable incomes. All else being equal, a
household that is wealthier or has less liquidity constraints will be willing to pay more for a desirable stove than a household
that faces more rigid income and savings constraints.
80
  Since the goal of this section is to focus on consumer preferences, the key features of stove design in the discussion are
described from an end-user perspective. A number of these stove features are linked to a small set of technical characteristics,
such as combustion efficiency, heat transfer efficiency, and particulate emissions.
81
   The rating of design features in this figure is specific to SSA ICS and ACS biomass stove users. Global systemic reviews of
stove-adoption factors suggest that, while there will be many commonalities, the ranking order will vary for other cooking
technologies. For instance, cooking time and safety will be more important adoption factors for LPG, electricity, and biofuel
stove users than fuel savings; aesthetic and status considerations will also be more important for such households (see
Rehfuess et al. 2014).
82
   Fuel savings are consistently ranked as the primary motivator for SSA stove purchases in household surveys conducted for
stove program evaluations and baseline studies. Viewing, more generally, global systemic review evidence highlighting the
primacy of fuel savings as a driver for improved cooking solution adoption, fuel savings were the top-rated adoption factor
among hundreds reviewed (Rehfuess et al. 2014).
83
  Time savings is the second-highest rated factor in the recent systemic review of stove- and fuel-adoption factors (Rehfuess
et al. 2014) and across the dozen ICS program evaluations reviewed for this report (see note 68). It is important to note
that women’s appetite for time saving does not always directly translate into demand for stoves, since their time may be
undervalued by male household heads, where men have the dominant voice on household cash outlays. Furthermore,
the time benefit may be not be fully appreciated in rural African settings, which are often characterized by polychronic
traditional cultures in which time awareness is poor and tasks are not strictly bound by time pressures (see, e.g., Concern
Universal 2012).
84
  Smoke abatement is consistently rated among the top 3–5 adoption factors in the dozen SSA stove program evaluations
and household surveys referenced in note 69.



                                                                   158

85
   This factor is expressed differently in various SSA household surveys and is typically expressed via such terms as convenience,
fit with specific cooking preferences, and suitability to local cooking conditions (see surveys referenced in note 68 and Rehfuess
et al. 2014).
86
  For instance, several common foods in Uganda require strong stirring, called “mingling.” Three-stone fires can nestle a
round-bottomed pot, permitting the cook to stir with both hands. This has implications for any ICS design in Uganda and
other East African countries with similar cooking practices (Harrell et al. 2013).
87
   Lack of stove design fit to cooking behavior is a common factor for recent evaluations of stove-adoption factors—see
Rehfuess et al. (2014), Puzzolo et al. (2013), and Lewis and Pattanayk (2012)—and goes back to the earliest comprehensive
reviews of stove programs and technologies in the early 1990s (Barnes et al. 1994).
88
     See note 68.
89
     See Puzzolo et al. (2013).
90
   Attractive stove appearance has rated as a top decision factor for only 0–5% of households in SSA end-user surveys
referenced in note 68—as compared with 50–90% ratings for such variables as fuel savings, time savings, and smoke reduction.
Many older surveys entirely exclude stove appearance from the list of ratable attributes, impairing the comparability of
findings.
91
   See, e.g., O’Dell et al. (2010). Aspirational marketing focused on the stove’s appearance for both urban and rural consumers
is a feature of nearly all SSA industrial stoves reviewed by the report team and is a common theme for other consumer
durables, such as solar lanterns, targeting comparable consumer segments (Lighting Africa 2013). Research on this demand
driver is ongoing, and many questions remain on the gender implications (e.g., some research suggests that men are more
motivated by status aspects of “modern” stoves than women) and on the value of aesthetic considerations relative to more
fundamental dimensions of stove performance.
92
  See Rehfuess et al. (2014), where cleanliness and home improved ranks 6th among 30 stove-adoption factors by number
of literature mentions cleaner floors, pots, and food from ICS and clean fuel cooking are important themes of most ICS end-
user surveys.
93
   A growing volume of theoretical research and survey evidence suggests that poor stove users do not highly value long-
term health impacts. The research of Mushfiq Mobarak, using Bangladesh data, has demonstrated low willingness to pay for
incremental health benefits, even when households are aware of the harms of traditional fuel cooking (Mobarak et al. 2012).
The low value consumers place on health benefits has been discussed and corroborated in numerous country reports for
Africa. See, for instance, the general discussion in Thurber et al. 2014 and stove-specific research from Rwanda showing
that perceived health benefits were not a major driver for EcoZoom stove adoption in Rwanda, despite the heavy health
orientation of the stove’s marketing (Barstow et al. 2014). Health benefits do become more important as a demand driver for
stoves for higher-income consumers, based on revealed preference surveys in various African countries (Takama et al. 2011).
Furthermore, there is evidence that women place more value on health effects than men, but due to their generally lower
decision-making power in households, this preference does not translate into improved uptake or willingness to pay (Miller
and Mobarak 2013; Beltramo et al. 2014).
94
   The lack of developing-world consumer interest in the public-good dimension of improved cooking technologies in
general, and of their environmental impacts in particular, is a common refrain in the literature. See, e.g., O’Dell et al. (2013).
95
   For instance, interviews and public statements suggest that human-centered design is at the core of the efforts of Africa-
focused industrial ICS manufacturers, such as EcoZoom, Envirofit, Burn Manufacturing, and Prakti Design; ACS players, such
as Biolite and Philips; and alternative fuel stove manufacturers, such as Dometic.
96
   Human-centered design, based on ethnographic research and rapid prototyping, was at the core of large-scale African
cookstove programs. Low-cost customized design was the hallmark of GIZ/ProBEC’s work in Africa in the past decade. The
current wave of EnDev initiatives across the continent likewise use rapid iteration of stove design as a cornerstone of their
approach. End-user-focused design thinking is likewise the hallmark of large Africa-focused NGOs that design or manage
artisanal stove programs; these include Practical Action, Relief International/EnterpriseWorks, and GERES. “Design thinking”
is likewise viewed as a core capability by such Africa players as the International Lifeline Fund and Potential Energy, which
focus on stove delivery to end users from the most disadvantaged environments, including the poorest of the rural poor
and residents of humanitarian relief camps.
97
  The volume of end-user research in the public sphere is growing, as witnessed by a new series of consumer-segmentation
reports from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. See, e.g., http://www.cleancookstoves.org/resources_files/ghana-
consumer-segmentation-exec-summary.pdf and IDEO.org’s research on Tanzania stove consumers at https://s3.amazonaws.
com/ideo-org-images-production/documents/9/original/20120323_Final_Small-1.pdf.
98
  Long cooking times, while not a necessary feature of improved cookstoves, are a major theme across many basic and
intermediate ICS evaluations. See, e.g., Adkins et al. (2010) highlighting the longer cooking times of several common
rocket stove models tested in Tanzania and Uganda relative to three-stone fires, with one stove taking 60% longer to cook


                                                                  159
                                   Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
typical dishes. Cooking time is likewise a major challenge for many rocket and natural-draft stove models tested outside
of Africa (e.g., 75% of consumers in Bangladesh reported longer cooking times relative to traditional stoves for a range of
six industrial ICS models manufactured by leading global and regional manufacturers (USAID WashPlus 2013). Alternative
cooking technologies, such as solar and retained-heat cooking, are also famously slow—50–100% longer cooking times
than traditional biomass cookstoves (see, e.g., ProBEC SunStove evaluation in Zimbabwe in 2007). In contrast, for modern-
fuel (LPG, electricity), biofuel (ethanol), and ACS stoves (natural-draft TLUD, fan-gasifier stoves), cooking times tend to be
significantly faster than baseline technologies.
99
   Fit with pot size comes up as an issue in many ICS evaluations, though for well-designed stoves the issue is addressable
with adjustable pot skirts. For instance, 40–70% of frequently used pots had a diameter above that of the common models
of ICS rocket stoves tested in Tanzania and Uganda (Adkins et al. 2010). Fuel preparation time and difficulty of refueling have
been common themes in reviews of natural-draft stoves; see, e.g., the recent Uganda TLUD stove evaluation in Martin et al.
(2013). The need for increased stove monitoring and fire tending is also a major theme in rocket stove program evaluations;
see, e.g., the EcoZoom experience in Rwanda (Barstow et al. 2014). Other common usability issues include stove size, the
ability to accommodate multiple stoves, and the need for constant monitoring to feed the stove small pieces of firewood;
see, e.g., Harrell et al. (2013).
100
    Durability has in particular been a challenge for basic ICS. This was a major nonadoption or stove abandonment factor
in large-scale basic ICS programs in Africa, as is reflected in GIZ ProBEC program evaluations (e.g., GIZ 2008) and is often
highlighted as the key challenge of Kenya Ceramic Jiko-style ICS around Africa (see, e.g., Njogu and Kuung’u 2013).
  Safety and stability issues affect the full range of ICS, including basic ICS stoves (see, e.g., GIZ ProBEC evaluations) and
101

many rocket stove technologies (see, e.g., USAID WashPlus 2013 and Harrell et al. 2013).
102
   A review of basic and intermediate ICS pilot and program evaluations reveals that 5–30% of consumers have failed to
adopt new technologies, even when they are provided at no cost. Rural consumers unwilling to use a stove free of charge
represented 30% in an Ethiopia Mirt stove survey (MeGen Power 2008), 20–30% in Uganda and Kenya for modern wood
rocket stoves (Shell Foundation, Breathing Space Survey 2007–08), 15–20% in Uganda and Tanzania for wood rocket stoves
(Adkins 2010), and 5–20% in most GIZ market baseline surveys conducted as part of the GiZ ProBEC program. Evidence
from other countries shows comparable results—e.g., 30% of rural Bangladeshis were unwilling to use an improved chulha,
even when it was distributed free of charge (Miller and Mobarak 2011). The level of nonadoption should and does differ by
technology, so further evidence is needed to appropriately set expectations for adoption levels for less common types of
highly improved and clean cooking technologies, such as natural-draft gasifiers, fan gasifiers, ethanol cookstoves.

104
    Declining use of improved technologies over time has been particularly notable for legacy mud stoves. For example, a
ProBEC baselining study found that mud stoves distributed under a national program in Malawi in the 1990s were completely
abandoned a decade later. Anecdotal evidence from interviews and press reports suggests a similar fate for chimney mud
stoves in Madagascar, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Ghana. See e.g., Ghana legacy stove evaluation in Burwen
and Levine (2012). For basic ICS, see GIZ ProBEC program reports, showing 50–90% use of distributed stoves 6–18 months
after distribution. For intermediate ICS, see, e.g., EcoZoom Rwanda distribution data showing 10–20% abandonment 5
months after the intervention (Barstow et al. 2014). For advanced biomass fan-gasifier cookstoves, see, e.g., Oorja experience
of more than 90% of end-user households abandoning the stove over time (Thurber et al. 2014). The ratio of nonfunctional
or abandoned household biogas plants has ranged from 20% to 75% for countries, such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, and India (Bond et al. 2013), though information from new biogas digester programs, such as those supported by SNV
(www.snv.org), shows significantly lower abandonment rates. RCT findings on the ongoing household utilization of basic
solar cookers have shown high rates of stove abandonment and disuse (Levine and Beltramo 2012). A similar fate has been
reported for ethanol gel-fuel stoves and ethanol stoves (Practical Action 2011).
105
   Evaluations of GIZ interventions in Africa (GIZ SUN, ProBEC , and EnDev programs) show 70–90% persistence of improved
stoves (based on ongoing use of or replacement rates) across a range of artisanal and semi-industrial ICS technologies. See
Schutze (2010), Khonje (2010), Evodius (2010), Chidamba (2010), MeGen Power (2008), and Malinski (2006).
106
    See, e.g., 89% persistence in LPG use in a program for low-income households in South Africa who received subsidized
LPG stoves and fuel (Mohlakoana and Annecke 2008).
107
      See note 28 and associated text.
108
    Surveys conducted by GIZ and EnDev ICS promotion programs in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda suggest
a village-level penetration of 70–90% for US$4–10 ICS products. In the urban setting, Kenya surveys show a >80% penetration
of Kenya Ceramic Jiko (US$4–8) stoves in such cities as Nairobi. In contrast, the very poorest in such low-income markets as
Ethiopia are unable to afford even very-low-cost stoves. For example, an in-depth 2011 market feasibility study of a US$4–7
Mirt injera improved stove in southern Ethiopia suggested that such a product would be absolutely unaffordable to 5–10%

  Africa research by the Global LPG Partnership (e.g., see 2013 Kenya LPG market assessment at www.cleancookstoves.org)
109

and interviews with modern-fuel experts across the region conducted for this report all point to the primary importance of
improved affordability for unlocking clean fuel market growth.
110
    While it is impossible to draw a precise demand curve for the SSA market for every cooking technology, the basic premise
is that clean cookstoves will be prohibitively expensive for the 50% of SSA households who currently earn less than US$1.25
per person per day, especially since many of these households currently pay nothing or nearly nothing for their stoves and
fuels. See more detail in the affordability discussion later in the report.
  Broadcasting Board of Governors/Gallup surveys suggest that 57% of the SSA adult population in 2010 owned a mobile
111

phone handset; more recent data from the GSM Association suggest that penetration will exceed 70% by the end of 2014.
112
    National energy survey data from DHS, LSMS, and MICS and national census data show modern-fuel stove (US$15–100)
penetration of 17–18% for SSA; this report’s estimates for ICS uptake across the region show a penetration of up to 2% for
intermediate ICS (US$15–30). These data suggest that at least 20% of households have paid more than US$15–20 in the past;
adding basic ICS (6%), at least 25% of HH have paid for some form of improved or clean cooking appliance that they use as
their primary stove. While there are no good data on secondary stove ownership, the best-guess estimates that are available
(see note 32), suggest that secondary modern-fuel stove owners may be at maximum another 6–9% of the SSA population,
for a grand total of up to a third (34%) of all SSA households owning a purchased (as opposed to home-built or three-stone
fire) cookstove.
113
    Shell Foundation, Room to Breathe Program (2007–09). Since the survey results are somewhat dated, projecting these
numbers into 2013 with 5–7% inflation and income growth suggests that the share of consumers who can afford a US$30+
product could now be a good deal higher. On the other hand, income levels in many parts of the continent are much lower
than in these three countries, so the evidence is still telling.
  Although average SSA handset costs are unknown and likely vary greatly by country, the literature and interviews suggest
114

that the average trends low (US$30–50) due to the introduction of low-cost (US$15–20) handsets over the past five years,
the high share of very-low-cost “counterfeit” phones from low-quality providers, and extensive use of old and second-hand
handsets across the region (see, e.g., Chabossou et al. 2009).
115
   Applying average SSA prices with typical unimproved stoves, the annual cost of cooking all meals with LPG for a household
of five (about US$260) is 40–50% higher than the cost of cooking all meals with purchased wood (US$180). The premium of
ethanol fuel use (US$200–300) over purchased firewood cooking is comparable. The cost of charcoal cooking is roughly on
a par with LPG on average, though the relationship varies dramatically by country and the lower costs of charcoal stoves and
easier access to charcoal constrain fuelswitching from charcoal to LPG.
116
   This estimate assumes that high-cost clean cookstoves are analogous to the average consumer durable in Africa and,
therefore, are unlikely to see more uptake than the historical share of consumers who annually buy US$30+ consumer
durables in countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This consumer segment roughly corresponds to the high-
income (>BoP 1,500) consumer in this report’s segmentation model, which corresponds to 16% of the SSA population.
117
    As one point of triangulation, the <BoP 500 consumer (<$1.25 per day) corresponds to roughly 40% of the SSA population
and would be highly unlikely to easily afford a cash purchase of a US$15–30 product that would require spending 10–20%
of monthly income—a significantly higher portion of income than is likely available for discretionary purchases of energy
appliances. This suggests that less than half of the SSA population would be able to afford such products.
118
    The concept of experience goods (Nelson 1970) has been widely explored in the development literature on health
economics for such products as malaria bednets and is increasingly being applied to research on off-grid energy products
for the BoP, such as solar lanterns (Lighting Africa 2013) and cookstoves. See, e.g., Levine et al. (2012) and Burwen (2011).
119
    Doubling in price was extrapolated by plotting a demand curve based on the experimental result of adoption increasing
from 4% in the control group (i.e., upfront cash purchase) to 29% in the treatment group (i.e., one week free trial) (Levine et
al. 2012).
120
    For instance, a Bangladesh trial of several stove models that are also marketed in Africa (e.g., EcoZoom, Envirofit, Grameen
Infra, Prakti) showed that, for the 100 households involved, 55% preferred the new stove to traditional solutions after 3 days
of use, whereas only 40% preferred them after 3 weeks of use (USAID WashPlus 2013).
121
   The amount consumers were willing to pay for an Envirofit 3300 stove increased from a mean of US$4.86 to US$6.83 with
the move to four weekly payments; this still represented only 30–40% of the stove’s actual retail price, but was a significant
result (Beltramo et al. 2014).

123
    Net of product returns, the baseline cash purchase offer led to 4% adoption, free trial to 29% adoption, weekly payment
offer to 26% adoption, and a cumulative “novel” offer with all of these features to 46% adoption—a 12-fold increase from
traditional cash sales (Levine et al. 2012).
124
   Research sponsored by the USAID TRAction Project in 2012 replicated a similar experiment for an Envirofit 3300 wood
rocket stove (US$16 cost) in rural Uganda, showing a 12-fold increase in stove demand when it was marketed with a 1-week
free trial and four-installment-plan payment option (Harrell et. al. 2013).
125
    While there is limited research on this topic, the literature estimates the optimal payback period to be within the 1–6-
month range, with payback of less than 2 months being seen as critical for poorer segments of consumers. See., e.g., an
assessment suggesting that a payback period of 1 to 3 months is needed for improved cookstove acceptability (IFC 2012),
an estimate suggesting that a 2–4 month payback period is optimal (USAID 2009), and a World Bank review of 1980s and
1990s cookstove programs suggesting an optimal payback period of 1 to 6 months for basic ICS technologies (Barnes et al.
1994). This rule of thumb also applies to other consumer durables for the BoP; for instance, the Lighting Africa market review
for solar lanterns concluded that liquidity constraints are minimized and willingness to pay increased significantly when
solutions can achieve a payback period of less than 2 months (Lighting Africa 2013).
126
    There is ample evidence that doing this is difficult due to the relatively high transaction costs of traditional consumer
finance (e.g., via MFI lending) relative to the small value and margins of the stoves; see, e.g., the Lighting Africa (2013)
discussion of transaction cost obstacles to consumer finance for small consumer durables.
127
   See, for example, the discussion of the Inyenyeri Rwanda model in the supply section of this report. Inyenyeri leases stoves
to consumers at low or no cost and recoups its costs through pellet fuel sales. Other models of this sort include the earlier
phases of First Energy’s distribution strategy in India for the Oorja gasifier stove and the CleanStar ethanol stove effort in
Mozambique.
128
   Several of the SSA market stakeholders consulted for this report were considering trialing this model for high-cost
cooking solutions on the basis of existing technologies and models being applied for lighting (e.g., IndiGo, http://www.
azuri-technologies.com/indigo), but thus far no projects of the sort have been launched.
129
    Surveys in urban Kenya show that two-thirds of charcoal-using households are willing to pay US$30 for a highly improved
charcoal stove (2-month payback with fuel savings); this is likely a major demand driver for Burn Manufacturing’s JikoKoa
(US$33) and Envirofit CH6600 (US$37) stoves (Sharma 2012).
130
   The heavily subsidized US$30 price of the CleanCook ethanol stove in Mozambique for the CleanStar/Novozyme
program has seen reasonable uptake, but is overly expensive for the majority of consumers. In major charcoal markets,
such as Madagascar, there is likewise good evidence that willingness to pay will be low. The average urban charcoal users in
Antananarivo spend on charcoal is US$6–7 per month; so even at a 50% fuel savings rate, a US$30-dollar stove would have
a 10-month payback period.
131
      Adkins et al. (2010).
132
    In Adkins et al. (2010) wood rocket stove trials in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, for instance, the average WTP was US$10–
12, compared with a US$20–35 fair-market value of the stove in these geographies (i.e., WTP was 30–50% of actual cost).
Nigeria research by Project Gaia showed that the WTP for the CleanCook methanol stove (US$30) was 50% of the lowest-cost
CleanCook stove model (Obueh 2008). An evaluation of a TLUD stove in Uganda showed that that WTP after a few days of
use was US$5 on average (US$2–8 range), vis-à-vis the TLUD’s costs of US$14 (i.e., WTP of 35% against stove cost) (Martin et
al. 2013).
  The data in this section rely on a roll-up of country-level stove sales, use, and penetration data points for 45 SSA countries
133

and involve the triangulation of (1) self-reported Africa-wide stove sales data from industrial and semi-industrial stove
entrepreneurs (more than 50 companies) sourced in interviews, reported in the press, or estimated by competitors; (2) self-
reported Africa-wide cumulative sales, annual stove sales, and “stoves in use” estimates for all major regional (e.g., PROBEC,
EnDev) and country-specific (e.g., Ethiopia) stove programs; (3) GACC member survey sales data, including raw data for 2011
and aggregated information from the GACC 2012–13 results report; (4) individual market assessment estimates for “stoves in
use”; and (5) country-level consumer survey data on primary fuel use and legacy stove ownership (“stoves with chimneys”)
aggregated in a proprietary fuel use database.
Where possible, the resulting numbers were assigned to individual countries. To get to an apples-to-apples comparison of
stove penetration by technology, the numbers were converted to a common “number of households owning stove” metric
using simplifying assumptions to derive household stove ownership estimates where the reported figures provide stove
sales or use, rather than number of unique households utilizing the solution.
The resulting data must be interpreted with caution due to inevitable imprecision, but should offer a directionally accurate
picture of the relative stove mix across the region. The report provides clarifications and caveats in footnotes where the
methodological certainty of the estimates is particularly low. See also the ICS penetration survey methodology in Appendix
9 for further detail.

      See note 7 and associated text on kerosene’s categorization as a clean fuel.
135
    This estimate is based on a roll-up of country-level survey data from DHS, LSMS, MICS, and national census surveys for all
SSA countries using 2008–13 data points; this should provide a reasonable average for aggregate modern-fuel primary-user
households in 2010–11, equating to 8.2 million LPG/LNG households, 9.6 million electric stove households, and 11.6 million
kerosene households. Assuming one modern-fuel stove of each type per household, these data also equate to the number
of primary household stoves of each type. In most cases the market is highly concentrated: 73% of SSA electric-cooking
households are in South Africa, 63% of kerosene-cooking households are in Nigeria, and 50% of LPG households are in just
five countries, including Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Senegal.
136
    This assumes one modern-fuel stove of each type per household. See note 50 for more details on converting primary-
fuel households into the total number of stove-using households and stoves. It is difficult to aggregate these numbers into
the total number of modern-fuel stoves in use in the market, since there is significant overlap between electric, LPG, and
kerosene stove users in markets where two or more of these technologies are present. At maximum, assuming zero overlap
between modern-fuel-using populations, the total number of modern-fuel users can be in the 48–56 million range. Given
the phenomenon of fuel stacking, the actual number is likely in the 40–45 million range (i.e., at the midpoint between the
estimate of 30–32 million primary modern-fuel users and the estimated 48–56 million modern-fuel stoves owned by SSA
households.
137
   The penetration numbers for 2010 include 10,000–50,000 ACS, 5,000–10,000 biogas stoves, 150,000–200,000 biofuel
stoves, 50,000 solar cookers, 150,000 retained-heat cookers—a grand total of >450,000 renewable cooking fuel households.
The source data for this information are listed in the notes and text that follow.
138
    This figure includes roughly 20,000 fan-gasifier stoves utilized in market pilots or RCTs by Q1 2014; the balance of stoves
are a variety of natural-draft gasifier stove models. Data on stove distribution are sourced by aggregating self-reported
project/manufacturer data and then triangulated with interviews with peer/competitor firms and the limited publications
available on the ACS sector; see, e.g., Roth et al. (2013). The estimate covers 15 ACS manufacturers, including Philips/ACE,
BioLite, New Dawn Engineering, Peko Pe, ARTI Sampada, WorldStove, Awamu/ABE (Uganda); GreenTech (Gambia); and
Aaron (Niger); 5 Star Stoves (South Africa); Wisdom Innovation, Kiwia, and Laustsen (Tanzania); mlc (Gambia); Arti Sampada.
With the exception of a few demonstration models, very few of these stoves (<15,000) have been sold; the vast majority are
models distributed as part of a range of commercial and noncommercial market pilots. The wide range on the estimated
stove count is explained by uncertainty about the validity of stove sales reported by several of the ACS market participants.
139
   These late 2013 data are from the Africa Biogas Partnership Programme, which is responsible for most of the biogas stoves
installed in Africa today; additional self-reported data come from unaffiliated biogas project developers in Burundi, Lesotho,
Rwanda, and Tanzania (e.g., SimGas).
140
    Includes less than 50,000 Domestic CleanCook stoves distributed in a range of market pilots, primarily the now liquidated
CleanStar Mozambique business in Mozambique (33,000 stoves); Project Gaia initiatives in Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Nigeria;
an estimated 160,000–200,000 Green Energy and Biofuel “KIKE Green Cook” ethanol-gel fuel stoves in Nigeria, Ghana, Togo,
and Cameroon; 45,000 ThermoSafe Energy ethanol-gel stoves in Nigeria; and an additional estimated 50,000–100,000 units
in Malawi (SuperBlu), Kenya (Consumer’s Choice Ltd. “Moto Safi” and “Moto Poa” stoves), and South Africa (BioHeat/BioCorp,
Greenheat, and ProtoEnergy ethanol stoves). All data are self-reported via manufacturer interviews and public statements.
141
   This estimate is based on self-reported data on pellet production volumes (focused at retail market) from mid-sized to
large producers in Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, triangulated with recent African reports on the pellet/
briquette sector; see, e.g., Ferguson (2012) and EEP (2013). Data on SME briquette/pellet producers and social-sector artisanal
pellet manufacturing projects come from the Legacy Foundation.

    Self-reported data sourced from Solar Cookers International (SCI) and a range of other solar project promoters throughout

147
    For most biomass stove technologies, the number of households owning a given stove type and the total number of
stoves in use are identical. This is not so for portable basic ICS in Africa, where top-down survey data often only indicate the
number of ICS households without tracking the number of stoves. Using rough estimates based on known ratios of basic
ICS stoves disseminated to stoves owned per ICS-using household (e.g., 1.25–1.5 in Kenya), it is likely that the total number of
basic ICS stoves, such as charcoal and wood jikos, is 30–50% higher than the number of households—i.e., bringing the basic
ICS count up to a maximum of 8–9 million stoves in 2010–11.

    See the forthcoming report titled The State of the Global Clean and Improved Cooking Sector, jointly published by ESMAP/
WB and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. The estimate is based on bottom-up country analyses for more than 75
countries globally, accounting for more than 90% of solid-fuel users.
149
   The precise number and proportion of three-stone fires in use in Africa are unknown, as such data are typically not
captured in national surveys. Interviews with stove program managers across the region suggest that three-stone fire
stoves constitute the absolute majority (70–85%) of all traditional stoves used as a primary household stove. The only
traditional segment where commercially produced stoves are common is the unimproved metal charcoal stove market,
with an estimated 10–15 million unimproved metal stoves used as a primary cookstove in Africa out of the 20 million
African households that rely on charcoal as their main fuel (i.e., this is net of the estimated 5–7.5 million improved charcoal
stoves in the market). Once secondary charcoal users are counted (50–100% of primary charcoal users based on the SSA
fuel database), the real number of unimproved metal stoves in the market could be twice as large­       —i.e., a total directional
estimate of 15–30 million traditional metal charcoal stoves.
150
    See note 4; most “legacy” improved stoves in the ground in Africa are either unimproved stoves with chimneys or very
basic home-built stoves that likely fall into ISO Tier 0–1 for fuel efficiency and Tier 0 for emissions.
151
    While an aggregate figure for market growth is difficult to derive from fragmentary self-reported data, survey evidence
from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (more than 700 members answering survey) suggests that cumulative clean
and improved cooking market sales growth is likely very rapid. For instance, there was 74% annual growth in the number
of stoves produced and tracked by the Alliance and its predecessors globally from 2003 to 2012, half of them in Africa, and
more than 80% sales growth year-on-year for many individual producers reporting figures in both 2011 and 2012 (GACC
2013).
  Historical (2000–10) growth trends for primary-fuel use across SSA, based on an aggregation of national surveys for 45 SSA
152

countries, are 5% annual increase for LPG, 3.5% for LNG, 4.3% for electric cooking, and 0.7% for kerosene (reflecting a negative
growth rate for kerosene use in the past 3–5 years).
153
    See, for instance, detailed data showing the retrenchment of LPG fuel use in Senegal in recent years (Practical Action
2014)—a trend that was likely attended by a corresponding softening in the LPG appliance market.

156
    The estimate for chimney stoves draws on Africa-wide DHS/MICS national survey data aggregated by WHO; the data are
problematic insofar as they are available only for 33 countries, are sometimes quite dated (2005–13), and may include what
are effectively traditional stoves with chimneys attached. To develop a continent-wide estimate, “missing” data points were
filled in through interviews with country stakeholders, subnational NGO surveys on stove prevalence, and in once instance
(Rwanda) a national census survey (RBESS 2009). For enclosed mud/clay stoves, the estimate is partly drawn from data
for 2009–11 for Ethiopia and anecdotal reports of hundreds of thousands of such stoves elsewhere in the continent. For
conservatism, only the Ethiopia numbers have been used, but the total number of such stoves may be significantly higher.
157
    For the geographic spread of the KCJ technology and its analogues, see Figure 36. More than 25 million African
households used the technology in 2011—a figure that has increased significantly in recent years to more than 30 million
African households based on report penetration figures in countries, such as Kenya, Senegal, Ethiopia, and Ghana.
158
    The basic wood ICS segment covers a wide range of technologies, including fired-clay solutions (upesi in Kenya and
Tanzania, opesi in Ethiopia, chitetezo mbaula in Malawi); ceramic or clay-lined metal wood stoves along the lines of the KCJ
(e.g., centrafricain in Chad and Cameroon, mandeleo metal clad upesi in Kenya, sewa/teliman in Mali); cement/brick stoves
(e.g., Ethiopia cement wood stoves, Malawi esperanza); and a range of all-metal wood stove designs in West Africa (e.g.,
roumdé in Burkina Faso, sakkanal in Senegal, nansu in Benin). This report’s estimate for the basic wood ICS segment is likely
an underestimate, since the dissemination of stoves of this type is fragmented over several government programs, 5–10
major international NGOs, and dozens of local NGOs throughout the continent. With notable exceptions, such as the GIZ
and EnDev programs, the governments of Rwanda and Ethiopia, and a few large local and international NGOs, data tracking
is extremely poor. The estimate in this report relies on self-reported data from reputable programs and triangulation from
country-level estimates captured in the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves’ market assessment reports and is likely an

                                  Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
159
    Anecdotal reports of the decline of the legacy stove segment were universal in the interviews conducted with more than
100 stove market stakeholders across East and West Africa for this report. The (admittedly sparse) data on the segment from
the WHO survey bears this out, with significant declines tracked for some countries (e.g., 8% chimney stove penetration in
Malawi in the 2005–6 household survey and less than 2% penetration in 2010).
160
    The acceleration in basic charcoal ICS production is reflected in survey numbers for countries, such as Kenya (i.e., showing
continued growth in urban ICS penetration, even as that market is beginning to reach saturation); the data of sizable semi-
industrial KCJ stove manufacturers from Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, and Ethiopia made available to the report team showing
15–60% annual sales growth; and the data of large-scale NGO (e.g., Enterprise Works) and government (e.g., Ethiopia Lakech
stove) efforts. The growth shown in Figure 32 is a conservative estimate based on known numbers of units (adjusted for
replacements and obsolescence) sold by major programs and manufacturers annually.
161
   Data on the Burkina Fasa roumde adoption path are available in Bensch et al. (2013); anecdotal evidence from Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda suggests that upesi-style stove sales are continuing to grow, but the extent to which these are
replacement sales versus extension of the technology to new households is unclear in the absence of tracking, since major
supporting programs, such as GIZ ProBEC, are no longer in place.
162
    This analysis is based on (1) an aggregation of self-reported rocket stove sales by the top-30 industrial and semi-industrial
manufacturers in Africa (or their carbon project development partners), and (2) the self-reported dissemination volumes
from major national and NGO chimney/built-in rocket stove initiatives. It is quite possible that this analysis underestimates
this segment’s rate of growth.
The 2012 Results Report from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC 20??), based on survey data from 744 Alliance
members, showed that 1.6 million rocket stoves were sold and distributed in 2012 (about 37% of the 4.3 million stoves
distributed to African consumers by survey respondents). Using a sales growth rate of roughly 50% annually, this corresponds
to the more than 4 million stoves added to the market during 2012 and 2013, as captured by this report team’s data.
Higher growth rates for the rocket stove sector are possible, however, based on anecdotal evidence from manufacturers
and distributors. For instance, applying the Global Alliance 74% year-on-year historical growth rate in stove sales for the
entire cooking sector overall would mean that the actual rocket stove penetration by the end of 2013 was even higher—a
total of more than 8.5 million. This report uses the more conservative figure of 8 million that can be traced back to individual
manufacturers, pending the release of new Global Alliance member survey data at the end of 2014.
163
   Key developments of this sort include investments in production capacity in Kenya made by Envirofit, Burn Manufacturing,
and EcoZoom, and exploratory measures by some of these companies and others to open manufacturing or subassembly
facilities in other African countries to serve as potential subregional hubs.
164
   In Rwanda, DelAgua Health has partnered with the Ministry of Health since 2012 to distribute free-of-charge household
water treatment and EcoZoom wood rocket cookstoves to approximately 600,000 poor households (about 3 million people)
throughout the country’s 30 districts. The pilot program was initiated in 2012, and mass-scale distribution was launched in
mid-2014. For more details on the program and initial pilot results, see Barstow et al. (2014).

166
   This result is based on the analysis of an Africa-wide database of DHS/MICS surveys (2005–13). The top-five markets for LPG
are Angola, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and South Africa. The six key markets for electric cooking, in rank order, are
South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Namibia, and Ethiopia. Key markets for kerosene
include Cameroon, Eritrea, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.
167
    These themes came across strongly in 2012–13 regional Global Alliance and World Bank ACCES consultations and are also
well documented in the literature on the artisanal sector; see, e.g., Clough (2012).
168
   While there are no robust quantitative data on stove quality, quality challenges—particularly for artisanally manufactured
stoves—were a consistent theme in the report team’s interviews across a dozen SSA countries. Stakeholders in the Kenya
stove market, for instance, reported that the average quality of Kenya Ceramic Jiko stoves in the field is low; the average
stove life has declined over time to 1–1.5 years, as many producers use low-quality metal casings and liner materials; and
average fuel efficiency levels (15–20%) are significantly below the KCJ technology’s potential (30–35%).

170
    The World Bank estimates that 7 million people are employed in the charcoal value chain alone across SSA today, with
aggregate charcoal-sector employment expected to reach 12 million people by 2030 (World Bank 2011b). Recent individual
country studies estimate the involvement of 700,000 in the charcoal sector in Kenya, around 200,000 in Uganda, more than
100,000 in Malawi, and several hundred thousand supplying the needs of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Country-level estimates
for the firewood trade are unavailable, but are likely to be on a comparable scale, particularly in West African nations with
large urban firewood trade markets. Many of these jobs are part time and provide only low or moderate income, but a
growing body of evidence points to the important livelihood benefits of woodfuel-sector employment for economically
vulnerable segments of the SSA population. In aggregate, informal and formal woodfuel-sector employment, including
part-time labor, could exceed 15 million individuals across the entire SSA region (Oksanen et al. 2003).

    One successful example is the Community-Based Woodfuel Production (CBWP) project in Senegal; covering 380,000
hectares of forest, it is supported by the World Bank and promoted as part of the PROGEDE program. Other countries
that have established plans for sustainable forest management include Benin, with a target of covering 600,000 hectares;
Mali, where 1.4 million hectares will involve sustainably managed wood-based biomass approaches; and Burkina Faso,
where 441,000 hectares are currently under sustainable forest management, and 270,000 are to be added. Ethiopia plans to
bring 300,000 hectares of natural forest under participatory management schemes. In Madagascar, much of the charcoal
consumed in the capital Antananarivo comes from sustainable eucalyptus plantations established around the capital since
colonial times (World Bank 2011b). The last few years have also seen the launch of large-scale CBFM projects in Tanzania as
part of the REDD+ initiative.
174
   See note 142 and related text. The report team believes that despite numerous challenges, such as a lack of financing, the
renewable biomass fuel sector is on the verge of much broader experimentation and scale-up, as charcoal prices in many
countries have approached or begun to exceed the costs of briquette/pellet production, making this market attractive for
entry. The growing dynamism of this market is obvious in the launch of Inyenyeri and other companies in at least eight
African countries focused on developing mid- to large-scale briquette fuel supply for households (targeting urban charcoal
consumers in particular).
175
    See the GLPGP/Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves recent report on the Kenya LPG market (Dalberg 2013); general
information on the Global LPG Partnership is available at www.GLPGP.com.
176
    Manufacturing labor costs in key stove-manufacturing markets in Africa (e.g., Kenya), China, and India have risen 8–13%;
steel prices, accounting for 70–90% of stove-material costs depending on product, have been highly volatile, vacillating
from US$500 to US$1,100 per MT (U.S. hot-rolled-coil steel) in the past five years. LPG and electric stoves are, of course, very
different technologically from industrial ICS, but are likewise not expected to come down significantly in cost since (1) these
technologies are already manufactured at great scale globally, including lower-cost models available in the SSA market; and
(2) some of the same labor and materials cost concerns apply.
177
   See Kojima et al. (2011). The most notable successful example of small-cylinder promotion is that of Indonesia, where
the government subsidized the distribution of 3-kg cylinders and cookstoves as part of its kerosene elimination campaign.
178
      See www.projectgaia.com.
179
   Project Gaia, for instance, has worked on producing and commercializing methanol captured from flared gas in Nigeria
in large-scale methanol stove pilots (see http://www.projectgaia.com/page.php?page=nigeria); the Protos BSH Bosh and
Siemens jatropha oil stoves have been discontinued by the manufacturer, but entrepreneurs are continuing to promote an
artisanally manufactured jatropha stove, the Jiko Safi, in Tanzania.
  See, for instance, Oketch (2013), showing that significant improvements are possible for baseline ethanol stove models,
180

such as the Moto Safi. See, generally, the overview of ethanol cooking appliances in Puzzolo (2013).
 SimGas markets both urban digester models (e.g., the GesiSafi, which uses kitchen waste) and larger-scale rural digester
181

models targeted at smallholder farmers (e.g., the GesiShamba, which uses animal manure). See www.simgas.com for details.

microSD card, which is electronically tagged to the specific stove, and can be collected by an untrained field worker.
186
      For an overview of new PATS technologies, see Pillarisetti et al. (2014).
  BioLite holds significant IP globally and in Africa on the core heat-to-electricity TEG technology within cookstoves (see
187

   Biomass is exchanged at the rate of 5 kg of wood branches for 1 kg of fuel pellets, which the company reports is more
than sufficient to meet most rural household cooking requirements. Households report that this system reduces the amount
of fuelwood collected, and the time required to collect it, by about half from before signing the contract. The company




                                                                     166
                                     Clean and Improved Cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Landscape Report
reported that rural household adoption rates are in the 70–99% range in the pilot area, and that retention rates are likewise
high.
191
   It is important to note that a number of the bigger Africa cooking-sector stakeholders—such as the Global Alliance,
the World Bank, USAID, and GiZ—simultaneously play multiple roles across the landscape as coordination bodies, donors,
research and learning providers, implementers (through local partners), and social impact investors.
192
    USAID research on Africa cookstoves is channeled through several different programs, including WashPlus and Translating
Research into Action (TRAction).
193
    Major public health institutions with ongoing cookstove RCTs in Africa include the University of Liverpool, Columbia
University Mailman School of Public Health, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

    SUMs have been adopted in many quality cookstove program and project evaluations in the past 2–3 years; see, e.g., Ruiz-
Mercado et al. (2011) and Bensch et al. (2013).
196
    See, e.g., the Biomass Energy Strategy for Rwanda (2009); a new biomass policy in progress in Tanzania in 2013–14; and
new biomass and charcoal policies in Kenya 2012–13.
197
   One example is the recent zero rating of stove importation tariffs in Rwanda. Discussions are in progress for similar steps
in other geographies, but aside from ad hoc exceptions, in most cases, tariffs and taxes on imported stoves and stove
components are a major obstacle.

   In 2010, IEA estimated total global spending of US$70 million annually on improved biomass stoves and up to US$1 billion
annually on clean and improved cooking, once LPG, biogas, and other renewable and modern fuels were included. The
proportion of these investments focused on Africa is unclear. Dalberg (2013) has separately assessed SSA investments into
clean and improved cooking at US$100–200 million annually for SSA, using bottom-up reported program data from donors,
such as GIZ, DFID, WB/IFC, and USAID; CDM data; and publicly available data on private-sector investments, including the
latest data on carbon finance streams.
