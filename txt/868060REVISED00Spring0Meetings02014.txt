Agriculture is a vital source of growth, employment
and subsistence. But three decades of conflict have
destroyed much farming infrastructure, limiting the
sector’s capacity to lift output and contributing to
severe food insecurity. Transportation, heavily
dependent on the road network, is similarly frayed.
Despite major efforts in the last 10 years, 85 per-
cent of national roads are in poor shape and most
cannot be used by motor vehicles. Rapid urbaniza-

also help boost growth over time through the eco-

   Project Background:
   Limited access to quality inputs at affordable prices is a key constraint to higher agricultural productivity in Afghanistan.
   In Afghanistan the agricultural inputs delivery network remains underdeveloped, weakly regulated, and distorted.
   The project will build the institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MAIL) required for overseeing input
   quality control, safety and reliability, and availability.
   It will improve the technical and economic efficiency of the certified wheat seed value-chain, develop the necessary accredited facilities for
   plant quarantine and quality control of agro-chemicals.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The project objective is to strengthen institutional capacity for the safety and reliability of agricultural inputs and the sustainable production
   of certified wheat seed.
   Component A (Improved Wheat Seed Production) will support (a) varietal selection and production of breeder seed; (b) production of foun-
   dation and registered seed; and (c) coordination of the seed sector.
   Component B (Plant Quarantine Networks and Quality Control of Agro-chemicals) will support enhancement of MAIL capacity to implement
   the quality control of agro-chemicals, including: (i) establishment of an office for pesticides registration; (ii) construction of various laborato-
   ries; (iii) provision of pesticide bio-efficacy trial equipment; and (iv) strengthening the fertilizer quality control inspection system.
   Component C (Input Delivery Systems) will support the analysis of the recipient’s current agricultural input delivery syste ms and assist in the
   development of an action plan for investment activities in inputs delivery systems.
   Component D (Project Management and Monitoring) will support management and monitoring of the project.

   Results Achieved:
   The project has delivered in-kind assistance to Agriculture Research Institute of Afghanistan (ARIA), improved Seeds Enterprise (ISE), and
   MAIL’s Plant Protection and Quarantine Department to support their seed production -related activities.
   The implementation of seed production activities in ARIA and ISE has already started in Kabul and four other regions.
   Meanwhile, English language training of the first batch of approximately 38 MSc and 2 PhD candidates of the aforementioned agricultural de-
   partments is about to be completed.

   Project Background:
   Despite impressive strides, Afghanistan remains at a critical stage in its transition, facing numerous challenges in the social sector including
   persistent poverty, a poorly skilled labor force, and non-responsiveness of the skill and capacity-building infrastructure to market demands.
   As a key step in responding to these challenges, the government of Afghanistan had requested the World Bank’s assistance in t he area of
   Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET).
   A Bank policy note in 2006 entitled “Skills Development in Afghanistan’ responded to the government’s request, around which Afghanistan’s
   Skills Development Project was designed.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The goal is to increase the number of immediately employable graduates produced by building, in stages, a high quality TVET system that is
   equitable, market responsive, and cost-effective.
   Component 1 (Develop regulatory and quality assurance framework for TVET) aims at establishing a Committee on Education Skills and Poli-
   cy under the chairmanship of the First Vice President, and developing a national qualifications framework for TVET and the related legalities,
   which the Committee was to guide through the legislature.
   Component 2 (Improve relevance, quality and efficiency of TVET) is to establish a National Institute of Management and Administration, pro-
   vide support for reforms at the Afghan Institute of Technology, and introduce reforms in the Deputy Ministry of Technical and Vocational Ed-
   ucation and Training.
   Component 3 (Skills development program and market links with a rural focus) will provide skills training for chronically poor women, mar-
   ginalized farmers, unskilled and semi-skilled youth, disabled persons, and injecting drug users.
   Component 4 (Research, Monitoring and Evaluation)

   Results Achieved:
   Developed the basic roadmap of activities for (a) a Draft National Qualifications Framework (TVET), and (b) a Draft Legislation for the Afghan
   National Qualification Authority.
   140 National Occupational Skills Standards developed under the National Skills Development Program and Deputy Ministry of Technical Vo-
   cation Education and Training is in the process of aligning its curricula with them.
   In the National Skills Development Program part of the project, training continues of chronically poor women, youth, and injecting drug users,
   and reaches 10,000 trainees.
   The international implementation partner for the National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA) is in place and done a prelim-
   inary evaluation of curricula and faculty.

   Project Background:
   Two decades of civil war has severely damaged Afghan road network at all levels: regional and national highways, provincial roads and local
   access roads.
   Prolonged conflict had denied most of the rural population access to essential social services including markets, health centers, schools and
   government offices.
   Formulated in 2002, the National Emergency Employment Program funded short-term employment through restoration of the dilapidated
   rural infrastructure.
   This initiative evolved into the National Rural Access Program from 2005, with a strong focus on the provision of year-round rural access to
   basic social services.
   More than 10,000 km of rural roads and related drainage structures have been upgraded or rehabilitated under these programs through four
   projects financed through IDA, ARTF, and other funds.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of the Afghanistan Rural Access Project is to enable rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services
   and facilities.
   Component 1 (Improvement and maintenance of secondary roads) is to support rehabilitation of about 1,000 km roads; 250 km of upgrading
   existing pavement to bituminous standard; about 1,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved secondary roads; and
   construction of about 1,000 linear meters of bridges.
   Component 2 (Improvement and maintenance of tertiary roads) will support about 1,300 km of rehabilitation and 2,000 km of routine and
   periodic maintenance of tertiary roads; and construction of about 1,600 linear m of bridges.
   Component 3 (Program Planning and Development, Institutional Strengthening, and Program Coordination Support) will support human re-
   source and institutional capacity building, program monitoring and evaluation, and program development activities.

   Results Achieved:
   Reduction in travel time to essential services.
   Increased frequency of such trips.
   Increased percentage of rural population living within 2 km of all season roads

                                  (9.77 cancelled)
   Project Background:
   Over 75 percent of the Afghan population live in rural areas where agriculture is the primary activity and contributes about one-third of GDP.
   But poor governance, weak factor markets, inadequate marketing infrastructure, ineffective business development services, and poor post-
   harvest practices limit the development potential of this sector.
   The Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project aims to ensure the social, economic, and political well-being of rural communities, es-
   pecially the poor and the most vulnerable, while stimulating the integration of rural communities within the economy.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The overall development objective of the project is to improve employment opportunities and income of rural men and women, and the sus-
   tainability of targeted local enterprises.
   Component A (Community-led enterprise development) creates savings groups, enterprise groups and village savings and loans associations.
   These institutions are assisted in building their own capacities, increasing the value of trade; ensuring production is oriented towards identi-
   fied market opportunities, and creating access to credit through internal lending.
   Component B (Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development) supports the emergence of a stronger SME sector with improved
   trading linkages with the rural economy and adequate access to financial services. The project finances a sequenced approach for SME sup-
   port, i.e. identifying key value chains in each province, working with the stakeholders to identify choke points constricting growth, identifying
   opportunities for value chain linkages and defining skill gaps.
   Component C (Project implementation support: Project management and monitoring and evaluation)

   Results Achieved:
   The project has so far established 4,551 saving groups, 143 Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs), 990 Enterprise Groups, and has
   supported 242 Small Medium Enterprises.
    A total of 6 Provincial Situations Analysis (PSA) are completed and ten PSAs are underway.

   Project Background:
   A coordinated funding mechanism to support Afghan reconstruction is essential to help the country return to normalcy.
   Such an instrument needs to be aligned with national priorities, should promote transparency and accountability of reconstruction assis-
   tance, and reinforce the national budget as the primary policy instrument.
   The international community and the Afghan government have recognized that the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) should be
   used to fund the essential recurrent costs required for the government to function effectively.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of the recurrent cost component of the ARTF is to provide a coordinated financing mechanism enabling the Afghan government
   to make predictable, timely, and accurate payments for approved recurrent costs related to salaries and wages of civil servants, and non- se-
   curity related government operating and maintenance expenditures.
   Component 1 (The reimbursements of civil servant salaries) and Component 2 (Reimbursement of operating and maintenance costs) estab-
   lish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of a third party monitoring agent, the gov-
   ernment submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.
   Component 3 (The incentive program), introduced in 2009, refers to a series of policy actions and revenue benchmarks agreed to between
   the World Bank and the government that align with development priorities and which, if attained, entitle the government to an agreed
   amount of additional funding for the first two components.

   Results Achieved:
   Over 11 years, the project disbursed nearly US$3 billion against legitimate recurrent costs in a timely fashion.
   This represents 20 percent of civilian costs in the period, and the process provided an opportunity for donors to conduct monitoring of all ci-
   vilian costs for adherence to financial and eligibility standards.
   The incentive component led to significant reforms in revenue generation, public sector governance, and private sector development.

   Key Partners:
   Government of Afghanistan, all the ARTF donors (33 countries) are considered partners.

   Project Background:
   The Capacity Building for Results Facility (CBR) is a key ARTF investment that supports government in developing its internal human capaci-
   ty over the medium term to improve service delivery to the population. It is demand driven with ministries required to meet criteria to par-
   ticipate.
   A CBR ministry must develop a comprehensive reform plan (to be implemented with existing donor and government resources) with a re-
   sults framework to which it is held accountable.
   CBR enables a ministry to hire skilled Afghans into civil service positions at more competitive rates.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The project's development objective is to assist the government in improving the capacity and performance of select line ministries
   in carrying out their mandates and delivering services to the Afghan people.
   Component 1 (Technical Assistance Facility for Preparation and Implementation of Capacity Building Programs) provides technical assistance
   to the participating ministries both for preparation and implementation of Capacity Building for Results Programs.
   Component 2 (Developing human resources) supports the continued implementation of broad civil service reform efforts and placement of
   critical managerial and professional staff resources in participating line ministries.
   Component 3 (Civil service training) intends to create partnerships between the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute and reputable interna-
   tional institutions to: (i) develop custom-made public administration management training programs for civil servants in managerial posi-
   tions and management interns; (ii) deliver the training programs; and (iii) develop faculty capacity at the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute.
   Component 4 (Project management, monitoring and evaluation) focuses on overall project management, monitoring and reporting; and con-
   sultancy services for appraisal and review of implementation progress and results of Capacity Building for Results programs.

   Results Achieved:
   The Ministry of Agriculture has been approved as the first top tier ministry, enabling it to recruit a substantial number of skilled civil servants
   to implement its CBR reform program.
   The Ministry of Communication’s proposal is expected to soon be ap proved, and several others are at various stages of proposal development.
   Recruitment of senior level civil servants funded through CBR is progressing; a total of 92 active senior management group positions are cur-
   rently funded with six additional appointments awaiting presidential approval.
   CBR is also encouraging salary harmonization for donor funded consultants led by the Bank.

   Project Background:
   The Irrigation and Restoration and Development Project (IRDP) is designed as a follow-up initiative to the IDA-funded Emergency Irrigation
   Rehabilitation Project (EIRP).
   While various bilateral and multilateral donors supported the reconstruction or development of specific dams or river basins, the EIRP was
   instrumental to the government’s launch of a national irrigation rehabilitation program in 2004. The EIRP had a national coverage and was
   designed to respond to requests and demands of local communities.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of the IRDP is to increase agriculture productivity and output in the project areas.
   Component 1: Rehabilitation of irrigation systems: supports the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes covering total irrigated area of about
   300,000 hectares.
    Component 2: Small dam development: supports the design and construction of about three multi-purpose small dams and appurtenances,
   and associated irrigation conveyance and distribution systems.
   Component 3: Establishment of hydro-meteorological facilities and services: sets out to build upon the work done under EIRP and establish
   an efficient and effective hydro-meteorological service.
   Component 4: Project management and capacity building: includes the following sub-components: (i) project management and construction
   supervision; (ii) support for capacity building; (iii) incremental contract staff.

   Project Background:
   The National Solidarity Program (NSP) is a flagship program of the government of Afghanistan and is currently operating in all 34 provinces.
   The Afghan government launched NSP to lay the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and
   poverty alleviation.
   It is identified in Afghanistan’s National Development Strategy as the government’s principal com munity development program. This multi-
   billion dollar community development and local governance program is managed by the Afghan Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Devel-
   opment.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of the project is to build, strengthen, and maintain community development councils (CDCs) as effective institutions for local
   governance and socioeconomic development.
   Component 1: Capacity building of CDCs to establish CDCs and build their capacity to: (a) function as a village level governance body for con-
   tinued empowerment of village communities; and (b) facilitate communities’ participation in the various sector programs operating in rural
   areas.
   Component 2: Community grants for economic and social development, providing block grants to communities to fund priority investment
   schemes (sub-projects) for rural and social development.
   Component 3: Project implementation support to cover expenditures associated with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development’s
   overall management and oversight of NSP.

   Results Achieved:
   Over US$1.85 billion has been disbursed out of which about US$1.4 billion has gone to communities through block grants to finance over
   77,000 sub-projects, having an average economic rate of return of about 30 percent.
   To date, some 32,000 villages have elected CDCs, and about 31,000 communities in 398 districts have received at least their first block grants.
   Sub-projects financed to date are in the areas of water supply and sanitation (24 percent), rural roads (26 percent), irrigation (19 percent),
   power (12 percent) and education (10 percent).
   Over 22 million people have benefited from NSP sub-projects out of Afghanistan’s total population of 36 million. NSP has created tem porary
   rural employment by generating over 26 million labor days over the past ten years.

   Project Background:
   Most irrigation schemes in Afghanistan are operating at 25 percent efficiency, as compared to the norm of 40-60 percent elsewhere in South
   Asia.
   Water loss occurs at farm level because the absence of proper farm-level irrigation systems (basins, furrows) leads to wastage of water sup-
   plied from the watercourses.
   Under the Agriculture Production and Productivity Program, the first step is to improve agricultural productivity by reducing water loss in
   tertiary canals and proper on-farm water management practices.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The development objective of the project is to improve agricultural productivity in project areas by enhancing the efficiency of water used.
   Component A: carries out social mobilization for the establishment of irrigation associations (IAs) in the project areas, including the provision
   of: (a) training to communities in organization and management of IAs; (b) facilitation services for communities to develop the IAs’ internal
   legal rules and regulations; (c) assistance to IAs to be registered under the Water Law; (d) technical training to IAs; (e) carrying out engineer-
   ing surveys and infrastructure improvements to small irrigation schemes, or tertiary canals, covering approximately 10,000 hectares in the
   project areas.
   Component B: develops institutional capacity at the ministry to plan, design, implement, and monitor on-farm water management programs,
   and supports the construction of five office buildings to accommodate the ministry’s irrigation directorate and staff at five regional centers in
   Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Baghlan and Jalalabad.
   Component C: strengthens institutional capacity at the ministry for project implementation, monitoring and evaluation, by establishing and
   maintaining a project implementation unit comprised of a Kabul-based core team, five project area teams, and internationally recruited ex-
   perts.

   Results Achieved:
   Land productivity of wheat and other crops has increased by 15 percent, water productivity of wheat and other crops by 10 percent, and the
   irrigated area by 10 percent.
   Surveys of 126 schemes have been completed, from which designs for 94 schemes have been prepared, and contracts for construction of 71
   schemes have been awarded.
   About 38 schemes covering an area of about 6,403 ha have been completed.
   A total of 130 staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) and provincial Department of Agriculture, Irriga-
   tion and Livestock (DAIL) have been trained overseas.
   A total of 225 of ministry staff have been trained in topics ranging from on-farm water management, modern irrigation practices, system of
   rice intensification quality control and quality assurance construction, and social mobilization.

   Project Background:
   The Afghan formal social protection system consists largely of a pension scheme for public sector employees, military and police, as well as
   social safety nets encompassing a number of government and donor schemes that transfer cash and in-kind benefits to various groups.
   Existing government interventions, however, remain small, both in terms of beneficiaries and spending. In pensions, the gover nment’s objec-
   tive is to ensure fiscal sustainability and mitigate fiscal impact of the civil service reform on the pension program, making it consistent with
   the broader public sector reform agenda.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The project’s goals are to improve the administration of the public pension schemes, and develop administrative systems for safety net inter-
   ventions, with a focus on targeting and benefit payment delivery systems, while delivering cash benefits to the poorest families in specific pi-
   lot districts.
   Component 1: Pensions: supports the design of new administrative arrangements for the public pension system and modernization of the ex-
   isting pension systems, including the Martyrs and Disabled Pension.
   Component 2: Safety nets: supports the design and piloting of targeting and delivery systems to establish a poverty-targeted cash transfer
   system; this includes capacity development at the ministry to deliver and coordinate social protection programs.

   Results Achieved:
   Financed key elements of a reformed and modernized Public Sector Pension System, which includes a revised institutional and human re-
   sources structure of the Pension Department, a comprehensive new Management Information System, a set of business processes, fiscal fore-
   casting models for revenues and expenditures, and a new chart of accounts of the pension system.
   A multi-phased safety net cash transfer pilot has been designed, implemented and evaluated. A targeting and benefit delivery mechanism has
   been tested and is now being further improved, together with computerized registration.
   The pilot program over the past two years has provided support in cash transfers to over 16,000 poor and vulnerable families (around 80,000
   individuals) in eight selected districts in five provinces.

   Project Background:
   The Afghanistan Credit Registry project is part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the MENA region. At the outset of the project, Af-
   ghanistan did not have credit reporting infrastructure in either a public credit registry or a private credit bureau.
   This inhibited expansion of access to finance in Afghanistan as lenders lacked necessary information for underwriting and risk management
   processes, limiting their willingness to broaden lending practices.
   Access to finance is viewed as a key constraint on micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) growth in Afghanistan, and a credit registry
   will improve financing opportunities and help economic growth.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of the project is to establish a credit registry, hosted and operated by the Central Bank of Afghanistan, which is in line with best
   practice standards.
   Help the banking sector adopt better risk management practices through access to credit information, while helping the central bank
   strengthen its supervisory capability.
   The project includes the following components: a) legislative reform to draft and enact credit information sharing laws/regulations; b) crea-
   tion of a functioning credit registry hosted and operated by the Afghan central bank; and c) awareness raising and capacity building to in-
   crease knowledge among stakeholders.

   Results Achieved:
   A comprehensive credit information-sharing regulation enacted by the central bank which establishes the foundations for credit reporting in
   Afghanistan. In the short term, this caters for a credit registry at the central bank. Longer term, it will establish a private credit reporting
   model when the market is ready.
   Selected international vendor to develop credit registry system at central bank.
   Implemented and launched the first phase of the credit registry in December 2013, with 16 banks participating.
   Conducted eight capacity building and awareness events for 118 participants from the public and private sector.

   Project Background:
   The Afghanistan Secured lending project is part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the MENA region. IFC’s access to f inance advisory
   services in the MENA region, through its Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries Team, assists government clients in developing the
   appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to allow and encourage the use of movable assets as collateral for loans.
   At inception of the project, the results from the Doing Business ranking on the Ease of Getting Credit, a measure of credit information sharing
   and legal rights of borrowers and lenders, showed that the financial sector in Afghanistan was not able to meet the needs of small firms or in-
   dividuals – Afghanistan ranked 179th out of 181 countries in 2009.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The overall objective of the project is to achieve sustained development of the financial sector by increasing private sector access to finance,
   particularly credit, in the MENA region, by strengthening lender rights in movable assets.
   In Afghanistan, the project operates under 3 components: a) legislative reform resulting in enactment or amendment of laws and regulations
   to enhance rights of creditors of movable assets; b) creation of a functioning movable asset registry to enable lenders to effectively file a no-
   tice related to their proprietary rights, and c) awareness raising and capacity building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholders
   about the benefits of well-functioning secured financing systems.

   Results Achieved:
   Two new acts on secured transactions in movable property adopted in Afghanistan
   Improvements in the ranking of Afghanistan from ‘0’ to ’7 ’on the “Ease of Getting Credit” ranking of Doing Business in 2013.
   Establishment of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance in November 2010.

   Project Background:
   Lack of investment, conflict and drought during the decades before 2005, plus rapid urban growth in recent years, contributed to very poor
   quality water supply service in Afghan cities.
   Piped water coverage in 2005 was among the lowest in the world at around 18 percent, and because of poor operation and maintenance, the
   water service was reaching an even smaller share of the population.
   Sewerage coverage presented a dismal picture, with less than 2 percent of Kabul’s population having access, and wastewater was only being
   partially treated before discharge into the Kabul River.
   Under efforts to meet Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the government envisaged that 50 percent of households in Kabul and 30 per-
   cent households in other major urban centers would have access to piped water by 2010.
   To achieve this target, the government took major steps on the policy and institutional fronts, with the announcement of the Afghanistan Ur-
   ban Water Supply and Sewerage (AUWSSC) Sector Policy, Urban WSS Sector Institutional Development Plan, and the Presidential Decree to
   corporatize CAWSS to: (i) improve sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in accordance with the MDGs; (ii) ensure
   improved operation and maintenance of the WSS infrastructure; and (iii) place emphasis on full cost recovery and financial sustainability of
   service providers.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The Urban Water Sector Project for Afghanistan aims to assist the government in developing the capacity of the Afghanistan Urban Water
   Supply and Sewerage Corporation for operational management and investment planning and implementation.
   Component 1: institutional development of Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation.
   Component 2: financial support to Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation operations.
   Component 3: extension of the Kabul water supply system.

   Results Achieved:
   AUWSSC has assumed the country's urban water supply and sewerage responsibility and expanded operations from 16 to 42 towns.
   AUWSSC achieved: (i) expansion of operations from 16 to 42 towns (162 percent increase); (ii) reduction in water production and distribu-
   tion costs by 25 percent; (iii) reduction in system water losses from 60 percent to 35 percent; (iv) reduction in staff per water connection
   from 8.6 to 5.9; (v) increase in total operational revenues by 3rd quarter 2013 over end 2011 by 67 percent; and (vi) increase in the number
   of water connections by 2nd quarter 2013 by 8 percent.
   A system of internal monitoring and monthly reporting between the AUWSSC HQ and Strategic Business Unties (SBUs) is in place providing
   both physical and financial data.

   Project Background:
   The private sector in Afghanistan still lacks a sufficient level of capacity and understanding of good business skills and practices.
   This lack of knowledge affects the ability of the private sector to grow or to export which in turn affects economic growth. The business de-
   velopment services (BDS)/management skills training market, while having improved its capacity to deliver high quality training using mate-
   rial customized to the local business environment, is still underdeveloped and requires further assistance to enable it to orient itself towards
   the private sector and its training needs.
   IFC has been contributing to the development of management capacity in both the public and private sector with its Business Edge (DFID
   funded) management training program for the past 4 years (September 2008 to March 2013).
   The program, since inception to December 31, 21013, has delivered training to 5,313 people including 2,554 (48%) women and reached 353
   MSMEs. The impact assessment indicated that 91 percent of the private sector respondents expressed a positive impact of the BE training on
   company performance.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenue of micro, small and medium enterprises
   (MSMEs) by developing their managerial capacities using IFC's Business Edge (BE) product.
   The project will build the capacity of local training providers to deliver BE management training to 5,200 individuals (of which 1,820 are
   women) reaching 520 MSMEs.
   Approximately 77 percent of the targets (4,000 individuals trained) will be reached by project completion (June 30, 2016) and 23 percent of
   targets (1,200) will be reached within three years of post-project completion (by June 30, 2019).

   Results Achieved:
   From Sept 2008 to Dec 2013, the program delivered training to 5,313 people including 2,554 (48 percent) women and reached 353 MSMEs.
   Under the new project alone (April 2013 to Dec 2013) the program has delivered training to 1,857 people including 1,341 (72 percent) wom-
   en and reached 63 MSMEs.

   Project Background:
   According to the Doing Business Report 2013, Afghanistan ranks 164th among 183 economies on the “ease of dealing with construction pe r-
   mits” indicator.
   Currently, investors must wait for at least 334 days in order to get a construction permit. Alternatively, they pay bribes to speed up the pro-
   cess, discouraging local and foreign investors and giving way to corruption.
   There is a pressing need to eliminate unnecessary delays and curb corruption in the process, while increasing investor interest in the con-
   struction sector through the reform and simplification of construction permitting within Kabul Municipality.
   By establishing a streamlined permit process, Afghanistan seeks to reduce corruption and improve transparency in this priority area.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective construction permit system and regulatory framework that will improve
   the government’s efficiency and capacity to issue construction permits. By doing so, the pri vate sector will benefit from reduced costs by eas-
   ing permitting bottlenecks, which hampers the ability of the growing housing sector in Afghanistan to meet demand.
   The new framework will also allow the government to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims to reduce the time it
   takes to obtain construction permits from the current 334 days to 180 days; reduce the number of procedures from 15 to 9; and improve the
   capacity of civil servants operating the process.
   Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits and, hence, increase
   applications under the reformed permits system by 40 percent.

   Results Achieved:
   Implement and monitor the new, simplified construction permit processes in Kabul to ensure smooth operations and make necessary ad-
   justments based on early implementation results.
   Provide the necessary legal expertise to support the client in drafting framework changes in light of best practices.
   Support the Afghan government in the implementation of the capacity building/training plan. The training plan will comprise two levels to
   address operational level staff and management (decision making) level officials. Run the Private Public Dialogue (PPD) as per the design
   stage.

  Project Background:
  Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) is the national power utility of Afghanistan. DABS is a limited liability company that is wholly owned
  by the government of Afghanistan and has the authority to operate and manage electric power generation, import, transmission, and distribu-
  tion throughout Afghanistan on a commercial basis.
  Kandahar province in Afghanistan has a population of around 1,080,000. The city of Kandahar is one of the six largest cities in Afghanistan
  with a population of around 500,000. There are a total of 75,000 registered electricity customers across Kandahar, with about 50,000 of them
  based in Kandahar City.
  An estimated 20 percent of additional customers are either not registered or are illegal. Installed capacity in Kandahar does not meet current
  demand and is further reduced by the inability to source fuel, leading to significant amounts of load shedding (around 20 hours a day).
  Reliable supply, in the form of hydropower, accounts for approximately 15MW. The average cost of electricity is estimated at 33 ¢/kWh due to
  the high cost of imported diesel.
  IFC is supporting DABS to develop, negotiate and execute a management support contract to improve the operational and financial efficiency
  of the Kandahar Operating Centre, DABS’ regional department responsible for operations in Kandahar.
  It is expected that the contract will be awarded by mid-2014.

  Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
  The objective of the project is to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the Kandahar Operating Centre. To do this, the private
  contractor would provide the following support to the Kandahar Operating Centre: a) capacity building, b) management support, c) customer
  care, d) implementation and integration with the Electricity Commercialization Program, e) community engagement; and f) reducing aggre-
  gated technical and commercial losses.
  By reducing financial and technical losses, it will be possible to increase supply to existing customers, improve reliability for industrial cus-
  tomers, and make the provision of power in the Southern region of Afghanistan more sustainable.

  Results Expected:
  By introducing private sector participation for this Project, IFC expects to increase the number of people with access to improved electricity
  services by 300,000 (by April 2018).

   Project Background:
   Founded in 2003, Roshan is the leading local mobile operator in Afghanistan with an estimated 27 percent mobile market share and 5.6 mil-
   lion subscribers as of March 2013.
   The company currently reaches 230 cities and towns in all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces and covers approximately 62 percent of the popula-
   tion.
   In mid-2012, Roshan approached IFC to finance: (i) the acquisition of its 3G license; (ii) the capital expenditures to roll-out the 3G network
   and improve the 2G network; and (iii) consolidation of its existing loans into a single loan and extending its maturity.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   IFC provided Roshan with long-term financing not available from local commercial banks or capital markets to finance its 3G expansion plan.
   Given an internet penetration rate of only 4 percent and a fixed line penetration of 1 penetration in the country, IFC’s inve stment is expected
   to create a competitive environment that motivates all operators to provide the best quality mobile data services at competitive prices to the
   Afghan population.
   In accordance with the 3G license obligations, Roshan will extend its mobile broadband services coverage to achieve a target of 80 percent
   population coverage in key cities within five years.
   Other development impacts include: (i) broadening economic opportunity to reach the unbanked population in Afghanistan throug h Roshan’s
   mobile banking services; (ii) financially supporting community social programs such as building schools and playgrounds and providing clean
   water wells; and (iii) reducing the gender gap by financially supporting the inclusion of women in society.

   Results Expected:
   Increase mobile banking customers to 0.9 million (against less than 0.1 million today)
   Increase mobile customers to 8.1 million (against 5.6 million today)
   Increase direct employment to 1,417 (against approximately 1,200 today)

   Project Background:
   This project builds on the success of a previous successful IFC intervention in the horticulture sector, Afghanistan Horticulture Exports De-
   velopment, which helped farmers to adopt best agriculture practices for two major export commodities (raisins and pomegranates).
   The project will focus on improving farmers’ skills and expanding market opportunities for Afghan agriculture commodities thr ough improv-
   ing access to export markets, and strengthening the overall value chain, including processing opportunities for grade B fruits.
   The project will reach out to farmers located in remote locations, leveraging the skills of the extension workers association established and
   trained in the previous project. These farmers will be integrated into the supply chain of large fruit exporting and processing firms in Afghan-
   istan. Meanwhile, these lead agribusinesses will be supported in becoming compliant with global standards required for access to high-end
   markets for food products.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   The overall objective of the project is to increase the supply of fresh and dried fruits, through improved compliance with market standards,
   and integration of farmers into the value chain of lead agribusiness firms, giving them access to wider market opportunities.
   The project will initially start its activities in Kandahar province, building on the success of the previous project, while assessing the potential
   of expanding to other provinces in Afghanistan.

   Results Achieved:
   Support 1,000 farmers in adopting best agriculture practices for fruits, and comply with market standards. The outreach to farmers will be
   ensured through the already established network of extension workers in Kandahar.
   Improve the operations of 1-2 lead Afghan agribusiness firms, through the integration of farmers that were able to implement best practices
   in their supply chains.
   Increase the sales value of Afghan fresh and processed fruits by US$2 million, through at least four export contracts, as a result of supporting
   one to two leading Afghan agribusiness firms in accessing wider market opportunities.

   Project Background:
   Dairy products are a major source of protein in Afghanistan. However, the dairy sector was largely destroyed during the Afghan civil war and
   has yet to fully recovered. Imported dairy products have gained the majority of the market share in large metropolitan areas including Kabul.
   Supporting the livestock and local dairy industries has been a priority for the Afghan government as well as international development organ-
   izations. However, domestic producers continue to find it difficult to compete with imported products in terms of both quality and quantity.

   Project Background:
   Afghanistan is the third largest producer of raw (greasy) cashmere in the world, after China and Mongolia. Cashmere is harvested only in lim-
   ited areas of Afghanistan, mostly in the western provinces of Herat, Farah, Ghor, and Badghis.
   Currently Afghanistan exports around 1,000 metric tons (MT) of cashmere on an annual basis. The main trade center is Herat, where a hand-
   ful of exporters gather to purchase the cashmere from farmers.
   The project was initially supported by the Afghanistan Small and Medium Enterprise Development program, funded by USAID. In 2011, this
   program provided funding to Traitex Belgium and Cashmere Fibres International (“CFI”), the largest de -hairer of Afghan cashmere, to set up
   operations in Afghanistan in order to increase the value-added within the country and to promote the development of the sector.
   Traitex Belgium is an independent processing company that scours and carbonizes wool and cashmere. It is based in Verviers, Belgium. In
   June 2013 MIGA issued a guarantee of US$1.3 million to Traitex to cover direct equity against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation,
   and war and civil disturbance.

   Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:
   From both the country and sector perspectives, MIGA is playing an important role in facilitating private investment to promote the technical
   know-how and investment needed to develop this sector in a conflict-affected country.

   Results Achieved:
   Generation of 35 permanent jobs directly, as well as supporting many hundreds of cashmere farmers indirectly;
   US$35,000 in taxes and fees annually;
   20.6 percent economic rate of return.
