Background and Context
Corridors of Shared Prosperity is the collaborative effort of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group and Intellecap to accelerate
the transfer of inclusive business models across developing countries. It consists of knowledge and information around ‘what
works’ in successful transfer. Eleven inclusive businesses, which expanded from India to other developing countries, and over 44
industry practitioners interested in the issue of transfer were consulted to gather empirical evidence.

The insights resulting from this analysis have been used to create a framework and roadmap to inform systematic inclusive
business transfer with a specific focus on India-Africa transfer. Additional knowledge resources that use the framework as
a foundation have also been created. These include a deep-dive report, a companion guide with detailed case studies and a
downloadable toolkit comprising of a self-diagnostic tool and checklists.

Transfer Journeys of Indian Inclusive Business Models is a compilation of eleven case studies that have been used to bring the
framework to life. Each case brings out different nuances of transfer, and illuminates how resource constrained inclusive busi-
nesses succeeded in taking their models and their impact to new markets.

Acknowledgements
This report is the product of a study carried out by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a part of the World
Bank Group, and Intellecap. It seeks to inform systematic transfer of Indian inclusive business models to other
developing countries, with a specific focus on African countries.

We are deeply indebted to Indian inclusive businesses that shared their successes and failures in transferring to
new markets, as well as to private and public sector organizations in India and Africa that shared their insights and
perspectives on this issue.

Limitations
The Inclusive Business Transfer Framework is specifically designed for small and medium inclusive businesses and is less
relevant for other types of business models. It is intended to be an early guide for businesses that are considering transfer to
Africa, but given the wide variety of business contexts in India and Africa – this report should only be treated as a broad
guide. It is recommended that inclusive businesses validate all insights garnered from this report through their own research
and efforts as well. Finally, owning to the lack of reliable and granular data in many of the African countries considered in
this report, it relies on qualitative insights from industry experts and inclusive businesses, and hence the insights and recom-
mendations should be treated as broad indicators.

                                          Agriculture contributes 32 percent of GDP across the African
                                          continent, providing jobs and livelihoods to over 65 percent of
                                          the labor force1. The International Food Policy Research Insti-
                                          tute has stated that, “In most African countries, agriculture is

Securing grants and financial incentives played a key role in
DG’s choices of countries and formats for transfer. DG’s senior
management believes it is important to identify remunerative
services to create long-term sustainability. It charges $0.03 to
0.07 per farmer per screening to cover operating costs and
plans to augment revenue through advertisements by input
providers. DG also plans to roll out its franchising model
targeting government agencies, corporates, and civil society
organizations in new geographies. The franchising model is
likely to support scale and contribute significantly towards
gradually reducing DG’s dependence on grant funding and
make it financially sustainable.

In addition to funding, local government support helps inclu-
sive businesses scale their models cost-effectively. In Ethiopia,
building relationships with government agencies resulted in
access to existing government extension structures to deliver
the program and import duty exemption on hardware devices,
which helped reduce program costs.

partners to enter new markets

  Ecosystem: Low awareness and limited purchasing power among farmers
  Sector: High variations in crops and agricultural practices that necessitate customization
  Business: Difficulty in on-boarding export houses and processing companies for access to smallholder farmers

                                                            key transfer insights

  ■■    GEWP and Impetus Africa identify and work with mission-aligned distribution partners to improve transparency and
        reduce supplier switching costs
  ■■    Impetus works with agro processors and export houses who have buy back agreements with small farmers for specific
        crops. Since the farmers supplying to them follow a defined package of agricultural practices and crop spacing, it is easy to
        customize the drip irrigation systems for them
  ■■    Impetus partners with agro processors and export houses that can extend small loans to farmers to purchase the kits. As
        these export houses and processors have a buy back agreement with the farmers, they are easily able to recover the loan
        instalments from the farmers

product affordability. Impetus works with agro-processors
and large export houses that can extend micro-loans to small
farmers to purchase kits against payments for their produce. In
addition, Impetus plans to build relationships with MFIs and
NGOs to bundle similar products for small farmers. Once the
irrigation kits demonstrate their efficacy to farmers, Impetus
believes that uptake will improve.

Targeting agro processors and export houses to reduce
customization of products

Inclusive businesses in the low-cost irrigation sub-sector must
consider key parameters such as size of land holdings, type
of cultivated crops, water availability, crop cycles, and average
incomes of farmers to ensure successful adoption of their
products. In Kenya, seasonal variations in crop cultivation are
high. Customization of irrigation kits based on type of crops
is a challenge and will involve substantial cost additions. Im-
petus, therefore, works with agro-processors and export houses
to distribute standard irrigation kits as they decide the crops
in advance with the farmers. Since specifications are fixed, this
arrangement reduces customization levels of the kits and helps
GEWP achieve volumes efficiently.

Focusing on core competency

In under-developed agricultural markets with poor supply-
chain linkages, inclusive businesses need to focus on core
competencies and leverage local partners to manage functions
such as logistics that need local knowledge. Manasa transports
inputs and commodities from Dar-es-Salaam port in Tanzania,
which is almost 1600 km away from Malawi. It realized that
logistics was best left to local players for speed and efficiency.
Hence, while Manasa focused on cultivation of pigeon pea,
maize, and soybean, it left the logistics to be handled by the
partners.

                                                       key challenges in transfer

  Ecosystem: Inadequate infrastructure in Africa and Asia, particularly roads and established distribution channels
  created challenges for outreach
  Sector: Poor basic health infrastructure and limited presence of healthcare workers can restrict the model’s success
  Business: Novartis depends on local partnerships (NGOs or Government) to establish connection and trust within the
  community, and the low population density in the focus areas in Kenya and Vietnam increases the distribution cost

   treatment and health services to the poor globally. It is
   the world’s third largest NGO in tuberculosis treatment
   and prevention (in terms of number of patients), providing
   services to 6.1 million people. Operation ASHA operates 194

According to WHO (2012) estimates, 8.6 million39 people are
diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) annually across the world. In
2012, about 80 percent of reported TB cases were concentrated
in 22 countries, most of which are low-income economies.40
There is also a significant rise in the number of patients with
multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Globally, over 450,000
people have developed MDR-TB. Treatable TB develops into
MDR-TB when the course of antibiotics is interrupted or
missed or taken in wrong dosage.

EXPANSION OF OPERATION ASHA"S BUSI-

Cambodia is one of the 22 high TB-burden nations worldwide,
with an incidence of 442 cases per 100,000 people.44 Cambo-
dia’s national TB program is well-positioned to meet and sus-
tain its goals. However, it faces inherent challenges, especially
in delivering treatment in rural areas. Having established the
model in India, Operation ASHA expanded the program to
Cambodia in 2010. Since its launch, the program has scaled
to over 51 centers in two provinces, Phnom Penh and Takeo.
The current patient outreach is around 280 to 300 patients per                                                        Credit: Operation ASHA

  ■■    Astonfield analyzed African countries based on business dependencies to find the right markets for expansion
  ■■    It invested in building market share and relationships with banks for project financing for the first few years, reducing its
        margins for this purpose
  ■■    It refined business model for the African context from being margin-focused to volume-focused
  ■■    It took a lean approach to building management capacity for expansion
  ■■    It built a local identity and invested time in building customer trust

 ■■    It took a lean approach to expansion by keeping overheads very low in Africa and hiring only business development staff
       until it had built enough knowledge and insights around the local market to determine how to invest in a longer-term
       organizational structure
 ■■    It forged successful partnerships with distributors and retailers for reaching last mile rural households, and in the process,
       learnt about the opportunities and challenges in the off-grid solar lighting market through these partners
 ■■    It invested in hiring and training local talent for long term sustainability

                                                         key challenges in transfer

  Ecosystem: Ability to pay among rural African households is very low; high construction and labor costs in Africa
  Sector: Lack of skilled field staff; limited availability of raw material
  Business: Limited access to external capital; limited access to feed-in biomass in rural Africa

  ■■    SKG Sangha diversified its funding strategies to include sustainable sources of funding for the Indian operations. Thus, it
        could create management bandwidth for raising capital specifically for its African expansion
  ■■    It employed a mix of Indian staff and a local team in Africa to serve as an effective mechanism for operational knowledge
        transfer and for accelerating expansion
  ■■    It developed its technical prowess to address the need for long-term after-sales service, which most biogas companies
        struggle to address. As a result, it developed a strong value proposition in international markets

World Bank Group
The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.
It consists of five institutions: the World Bank, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Devel-
opment (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA); the International Finance Corporation
(IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID). Working together in more than 100 countries, these institutions provide financing,
advice, and other solutions that enable countries to address the most urgent challenges of development.



International Finance Corporation
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the
private sector in developing countries. Established in 1956, IFC is owned by 184 member countries, a group that
collectively determines our policies. Our work allows companies and financial institutions in emerging mar-
kets to create jobs, generate tax revenues, improve corporate governance and environmental performance, and
contribute to their local communities. IFC’s vision is that people should have the opportunity to escape poverty
and improve their lives.
