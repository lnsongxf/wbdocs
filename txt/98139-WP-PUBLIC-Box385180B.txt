    Overview
    Global Economic Prospects

    The global economic recovery continues at a subdued pace, still subject to a multitude
    of downside risks. Global growth is broadly on track to reach an expected 2.8 percent in 2015,
    underpinned by a stronger recovery in high income countries on account of low commodity
    prices and still accommodative monetary policies in the U.S., EU, and Japan. In contrast, a
    broad-based slowdown appears to be underway in developing countries driven by the weaker
    outlook in commodity exporters and several large middle-income economies. Risks to the
    global outlook remain tilted to the downside. In particular, tighter global financial conditions
    could combine with deteriorating growth prospects, especially in commodity-exporting
    countries, to raise the possibility of greater financial stress. The strengthening dollar could also
    slow the U.S. economy more than expected earlier, leading to some global strain.1

    Recent Economic Developments in Vietnam

    Economic activity continued to firm up in 2015, driven by domestic demand. After coming
    in at 6 percent in 2014, GDP growth accelerated to 6.28 percent during the first half of 2015,
    the fastest first-half-of-the-year growth rate in the past five years. The recovery was driven by
    strong activity in manufacturing and construction, which together contributed nearly half of
    overall GDP growth. Retail sales also performed strongly, posting 8.3 percent (in real terms)
    in the first six months of 2015, up from 6.3 percent in 2014. However, despite the pickup in
    retail activity, overall services (which account for nearly 40 percent of GDP) rose modestly at
    5.9 percent in the first half of 2015. In part, this reflected a struggling tourism sector, with
    tourist visits in the first six months down by 11 percent year-on-year. On the demand side,
    stronger growth was driven by investment (spurred by strong FDI inflows) and stronger private
    consumption boosted by low inflation. The contribution of net exports turned negative as
    sluggish external demand weighed on export growth while strengthened domestic activity
    continued to fuel import growth.

    A low inflation environment has enabled the State Bank of Vietnam to maintain an
    expansionary monetary policy stance. The consumer price index rose only 1 percent year-on-
    year in June 2015, down from 5 percent a year earlier. The SBV cut its refinancing and discount
    rates by 50 basis points in 2014, and has thus far held the line on interest rates in 2015. Interest
    rate cuts were aided by macro-prudential measures, including relaxation of limits on short-

term deposits and risk weights for certain lending activities. This allowed banks to maintain
lower lending rates (typically in the range of 7-13 percent p.a. depending on lending terms)
than in the past, thereby stimulating credit growth to an estimated 2.65 percent in Q1-2015,
consistent with the SBV’s target range. In response to a universally firmer US dollar and to keep
pace with exchange rate movements in Vietnam’s main trading partners, the SBV devalued the
dong twice, in January and May 2015 by a cumulative 2 percent, in order to promote foreign
exchange market stability and preserve external competitiveness.

Persistent fiscal imbalances are a concern against the backdrop of rising public debt.
The fiscal deficit stayed at 5.3 percent of GDP in 2014, reflecting weak revenue outturn and
increased capital spending. Budget outturns thus far in 2015 reflect persistent fiscal pressures,
with a deficit of nearly 75 trillion dong (US$ 3.5 billion) in the first five months or a third of
the annual target of 2015. Total public and publicly guaranteed debt increased further to
estimated 59.6 percent in 2014 (up from 54.5 percent in 2013). While public debt levels are still
within the bounds of sustainability, debt servicing costs are beginning to cut into fiscal space
and risk crowding out more productive spending.

Weakening external trade balance caused the current account to move into deficit in
Q1/2015. A trade deficit of over US$ 3 billion was recorded in the first five months of 2015
(compared to a surplus of US$ 2.1 billion in 2014). The outturn reflected slow-down in export
growth and stronger growth in imports. Export growth slowed to 7.7 percent (year-on-year)
in the first five months of 2015 (down from 15.3 percent over the same period in 2014) mainly
due to a sharp fall in export prices as well as declining volumes in key commodities such as
crude oil, coal, rice, coffee and rubber. Meanwhile, a surge in capital goods led to a pick-up in
import growth. However, robust private remittances (5.8 percent of GDP in 2010-14 average)
are expected to keep the current account in surplus in 2015, albeit at a much lower level than
last year.

External financing risks remain tempered by Vietnam’s relatively low (and mostly
concessional) external debt and the structure of capital inflows that comprises mostly
FDI. In 2015, FDI disbursements were up 9.6 percent to US$ 6.3 billion in the first half of 2015,
even though new commitments have declined to US$ 5.5 billion, down by nearly 20 percent
compared to the same period last year. External debt rollover rates also remained solid aided
by stable official inflows and by credit rating upgrades as both Moody’s and Fitch upgraded
Vietnam’s sovereign rating by one notch with a stable outlook.2 Overall balance of payments
slightly improved allowing for gradual build-up of international reserves to about about 2.8
months of imports by the end of Q1-2015.

Progress on structural reforms has been mixed, especially with regard to SOE and banking
sector reforms. An acceleration of these reforms is deemed necessary—by policymakers and
private analysts alike—to carry growth closer to the 7 percent mark and meet Vietnam’s longer
term aspirations to become a modern, industrialized nation. Progress on SOE equitization
(divestiture of state assets) has slowed down in 2015, with only 29 SOEs having been equitized

      grade by the three major rating agencies.

    in the first quarter, putting in question feasibility of the 2015 target of equitizing 289 SOEs.
    Consolidation of the banking sector accelerated during the first half of 2015, but resolution of
    bad debts remains a concern. Lack of legal ownership of bad assets by the VAMC, the absence
    of an adequate enabling legal framework for insolvency, asset titling, and seizure of collaterals
    and for protecting VAMC staffs personal liability continues to hamper efforts to resolve the bad
    debt on VAMC’s books.

    The medium term outlook for Vietnam is positive on balance but subject to significant
    downside risks. Growth is expected to come in at just over 6 percent in 2015 underpinned by
    further recovery in domestic demand, in turn reflecting more robust private consumption and
    investment growth. Despite the expansionary monetary policy stance, inflation would remain
    low due to subdued global conditions and low global energy and food prices. The fiscal deficit
    is expected to start adjusting through consolidation efforts to avoid further increases in public
    debt. The trade balance is projected to narrow significantly in 2015 due to softer export growth
    and sustained strong import growth stoked by stronger domestic economic activity. However,
    robust remittances will keep the current account in surplus, albeit at a much lower level than
    last year. This baseline assessment is subject to downside risks, both external and domestic.
    On the external front, as described, global growth remains sluggish and subject to much
    uncertainty, with important implications for Vietnam through its significant trade linkages.
    Furthermore, weak global prices of rice and other agricultural products may adversely affect
    rural household income and consumption. On the domestic side, a credible medium-term
    fiscal consolidation plan together with an equally credible plan to strengthen the finances
    of the SOEs and state-owned banking sector would remain crucial to ward off pressures on
    public debt and boost private sector confidence.


    SPECIAL FOCUS ON LABOR MARKET

    Building Modern Labor Market Regulations and Institutions in
    Vietnam
    	
    The landscape of jobs in Vietnam has shifted dramatically over the last 25 years. While
    jobs in Vietnam were once characterized entirely by family farming, collectives, and state-
    owned enterprises (SOEs), over time work has shifted towards manufacturing and services,
    household enterprises outside agriculture, and private domestic and foreign-owned firms. In
    1989, 71 percent of employed Vietnamese worked primarily in agriculture, fishing, or forestry,
    and private employment was almost non-existent. Today agriculture, fishing, and forestry
    accounted for 46 percent of jobs, and 1 in 10 Vietnamese workers - about 5 million - hold a
    wage job with a private firm. 3

          on analysis of the 2014 Labor Force Survey.

The expansion of private-sector wage jobs is fundamental to the improvement of living
standards in Vietnam. Family farms, household enterprises, SOEs, and the government will
continue to be a source of livelihoods for many workers, but private sector wage jobs have
the greatest potential for the rapid productivity gains needed to boost large numbers of
Vietnamese workers into the ranks of the global middle class.

Private-sector job growth is determined by many factors. The primary driver is the business
environment, which includes strong, efficient market institutions, stable macroeconomic
environment, and adequate infrastructure. Enterprises also need a well-educated and skilled
workforce for growth. Policies regarding these “fundamentals” are the most important policy
levers for job growth.

Labor regulations and institutions can also be an important determinant of private
sector wage growth. Labor market policies have the potential to help people grasp economic
opportunities in a risky world but need to be well calibrated to help households and society
manage the risks. Labor market policies can mitigate the effects of earnings and employment
losses, provide voice to workers, and facilitate the movement of labor and human capital
to where they are most efficiently deployed. At the same time, inappropriate policies may
increase individual and societal labor market risks. At the individual level, risks of jobs losses
or sustained informality may be increased, while at a societal level they may result in slow
formalization of employment, mismatches between earnings and productivity growth, or
labor unrest. Poorly calibrated policies may also inhibit structural transformation by reducing
movement of workers across geography, sectors, and types of work.

Vietnam’s labor market policies may be an emerging constraint to private wage job
growth. In the most recent data from 2009, just 1 percent of firms identified labor regulations
as the chief constraint to firm growth. However, an additional 28 percent identified labor
regulations as a minor or moderate constraint (World Bank, 2014a). Vietnam faces the danger
that overly strict regulations today could be a future barrier to wage job growth. Regulations
often benefit “insiders”—those workers who currently hold wage jobs—while smothering the
creation of new jobs that would generate opportunity for “outsiders”—those who do not yet
hold wage jobs. As the ranks of wage workers increase, insiders will become an increasingly
powerful voice in favor of maintaining policies that are to their advantage. This could make it
difficult to change overly strict policies in the future.

 Recent Economic Developments

I.1. External Economic Environment
1.	 Global growth remains broadly on track to reach about 2.8 percent in 2015 and
is expected to pick up to 3.3 percent in 2016-17. Global growth is supported by low
commodity prices and accommodative monetary policies in major economies although
financial conditions are expected to tighten gradually over the year with the anticipated
monetary policy tightening in the US. Important shifts are emerging. The recovery in high-
income countries has gathered momentum. The United States should continue to expand
at a robust pace while growth is also gradually accelerating in the Euro Area and Japan. In
contrast, a broad-based slowdown appears to be underway in developing countries driven
by the weaker outlook in commodity exporters and several large middle-income economies.
Among major emerging economies, only India’s economy is expected to strengthen further
while China, Russia, Brazil and South Africa are all expected to slow down during 2015.

     2.	 Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) is expected to further ease to
     6.7 percent in 2015 mainly due to the continued, gradual slow-down in China. Growth
     in China is expected to continue to soften amidst efforts by the authorities to address
     vulnerabilities associated with recent rapid credit and investment growth. This should
     be offset by a pickup in the rest of the region, which is benefitting from lower fuel prices
     and the strengthening recovery in advanced countries although export growth will be
     constrained by broad based real appreciations of currencies in the region. Low fuel prices
     will benefit developing EAP as a whole, but the impact will vary across countries, reflecting
     the magnitude of net fuel imports, energy intensity in production, and the share of oil and
     gas in total energy consumption.

3.	 On balance the global economic environment is expected to provide modest
tailwind to Vietnam’s economy in 2015. The strengthening recovery in high-income
economies and especially the US – the largest export market for Vietnam- should lift external
demand. However, the slow pace of global trade growth suggests that Vietnam’s exports will
accelerate only moderately, especially since less favorable terms of trade could become a drag
on export growth. As a net importer of petroleum products Vietnam is generally benefitting
from the drop in the oil price which has improved the terms of trade, eased inflationary
pressures, boosted household real incomes and lowered input costs for businesses.4 Fuel
tax reforms have contained the decline in oil related fiscal revenue. Meanwhile, the gradual
tightening of US monetary policy is expected to moderate global capital flows and tighten
overall financial conditions for developing countries, including Vietnam. However, despite
low foreign reserve coverage (about 2.8 months of imports), external financing risks are
tempered by Vietnam’s relatively low external debt and the structure of capital inflows with
relatively limited portfolio investment and significant and generally less volatile FDI.

4.	 Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside. The global recovery
remains fragile and risks of stagnation and deflation in advanced economies are still
present. Increasingly divergent monetary policies across major economies could
heighten risks of increased exchange rate and financial market volatility. Sharply
tightening financing conditions, abrupt realignments of asset prices and large
exchange rate movements could in turn dampen global trade, investment and growth.
Further broad-based appreciation of the US dollar could trigger financial instability,
especially in emerging markets with large exposures to dollar-denominated assets.
A weaker-than-expected recovery in high-income countries, especially in the United
States, the Euro Area, Japan, and more sluggish growth in large emerging economies
would weaken global and regional trade and impair external demand. Although the
probability is low, the risk of a hard landing in China remains. Given its large trade
exposure, Vietnam would be particularly vulnerable to trading partner slowdowns and
large exchange rate shifts which could result in erosion of competitiveness.

     I.2 RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN VIETNAM
     Growth continues to improve gradually

     5.	 Economic activity has continued to firm up in 2015 led by rising industrial output
     and a rebound in the construction sector. After coming in at 6 percent in 2014, GDP
     growth continued to accelerate to 6.28 percent during the first half of 2015, the fastest first-
     half-of-the-year growth rate in the past five years. The recovery is driven by strong activity in
     manufacturing and construction, which grew by 9.9 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively,
     together contributing nearly half of overall GDP growth during the first six months of the
     year. Retail sales and services also performed strongly, posting 8.3 percent (in real terms) in
     the first six months of 2015, up from 6.3 percent in 2014 and 5.6 percent in 2013. However,
     the rebound of economic activities remains uneven. Despite healthy growth in retail trade,
     overall services which account for nearly 40 percent of GDP, rose only modestly at 5.9 percent
     in the first half 2015 reflecting mainly the struggling tourism sector with tourist visits in the
     first six months down by 11.3 percent year-on-year. Following strong performance last year,
     agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector grew by a meager 2.4 percent amidst falling prices
     of key agriculture products and unfavorable weather.

     6.	 On the demand side, domestic demand remained the main driver of economic
     growth in first months of the year. Private consumption is picking up strongly reflecting
     improved consumer sentiment which is boosted by low inflation and buoyant real wages.
     Final consumption accelerated by 8.7 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2015.
     Investment also strengthened with gross capital formation rising by 6.9 percent, spurred
     by an estimated 9.6 percent increase in FDI disbursements and lower interest rates. Overall
     growth was tempered by a negative contribution of net exports. While imports continued to
     rise rapidly stoked up by strengthening domestic activity, export growth was held back by
     falling export prices and sluggish external demand.

     7.	 While the strengthening recovery combined with stable macroeconomic
     conditions is expected to help sustain positive poverty trends, slower agricultural
     growth may dampen rural income growth. Poverty in Vietnam is still largely a rural
www.worldbank.org.vn                       TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS               15


phenomenon as about 95% of the poor live in rural areas. Given the dependence of the
rural population, including the poor on agricultural production the recent slow-down in
agricultural growth may dampen rural incomes and consumption and widen the rural-urban
income gap.

Monetary policy stays accommodative amidst easing inflation

8.	 Against a backdrop of weak international commodity prices inflationary pressures
remained low during the first half of 2015. The consumer price index rose only 1 percent
year-on-year in June 2015, down from 4.7 percent a year earlier and a peak of 23 percent in
August 2011. The strong decline in energy prices since July of 2014 and stable food prices
through the year have been key drivers of the disinflation process. In addition, core inflation
is also coming down as inflation expectations have receded.

9.	 The State Bank of Vietnam gradually loosened monetary policy to spur grow. With
inflation falling to lower single digits The Central Bank cut its refinancing rate by 50 basis
points in 2014 from 7 percent to 6.5 percent and its discount rate from 5 percent to 4.5 percent.
Interest rate cuts were underpinned by relaxation of macro-prudential measures. Circular 36
(issued in November 2014) relaxed the limit on short-term deposits for medium and long-
term lending significantly (60 percent from previously 30 percent) and lowered risk weights
for certain lending activities. This allowed banks to maintain low lending rates (typically in
the range of 7-13 percent p.a. depending on lending terms) which helped to stimulate credit
growth to an estimated 14.2 percent, meeting the central bank’s 12–14 percent target for
2014. By the end of March, credit expanded by 2.65 percent (year-to-date) about 16 percent
(year-on-year), broadly in line with SBV’s target for credit growth at 13-15 percent.

     10.	 Amidst rising volatility in international currency markets, the exchange rate has
     remained relatively stable. Vietnam continues to operate a crawling peg system, aimed at
     helping exports and promoting foreign exchange market stability. Weakening trade balance
     and rising expectations of higher interest rates in the United States have exerted downward
     pressure on the Vietnamese dong in 2015. In response to a firmer US dollar and increased
     devaluation pressure, the State Bank of Vietnam devalued its currency twice, in January and
     May 2015 by a cumulative 2 percent. After the SBV reaffirmed that there would be no further
     dong/dollar exchange rate adjustment this year, the dollar exchange rate continued to
     fluctuate, traded at the lower end of the +/- 1 percent band.

     The fiscal accounts remain a source of concern

     11.	 State budget outturns continue to show persistent fiscal pressure in the first
     months of 2015. In nominal terms, total revenue is projected to have increased 7.9
     percent in the first five months compared with the same period the previous year. While
     oil revenue continued to decline substantially by 34 percent this was offset by growth in
     most other taxes. Revenue growth was outpaced by total expenditures which increased
     8.9 percent leading to the deficit of nearly 75 trillion dong (US$ 3.5 billion) or a third of
     the annual target approved by the National Assembly. Expansionary policy to avert a
     sharper down-turn, led to the fiscal deficit widening significantly from 1.1 percent of GDP
     in 2011 to 5.3 percent in 2014. Various pro-growth countercyclical measures (i.e. tax and
     tariff reductions and exemptions and stimulus spending) were launched over the past
     years to revive the economy.

12.	 Vietnam’s debt has risen rapidly in recent years. As at the end of 2014, Vietnam’s
total outstanding public debt (government, government-guaranteed and local government)
was estimated at 2,347 trillion dong (approximately US$110 billion)5 . As a share of GDP, total
public debt rose quickly from 50 percent in 2011 to an estimated 59.6 percent in 2014. 79.6
percent of this was government debt, 19 percent government-guaranteed debt, and around
1.4 percent local government debt. The Ministry of Finance projects that total outstanding
public debt stock could peak at about 65 percent of GDP by the end of 2017. Following that,
the debt/GDP ratio would gradually decline as a result of fiscal consolidation.

     13.	 With rising debt came a change in the composition of debt. Since budget financing needs
     have grown at a faster pace than the growth of external concessional financing, Government
     mainly relied on domestic debt to meet its financing needs. While government external debt
     has remained steady at around 27-28 percent of GDP for 2010-2014, domestic debt has risen
     quickly from 23.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 31.7 percent of GDP in 2014. Most of the domestic
     financing has been through issuance of government bonds with annual weighted- average
     coupon rate of 7.9 percent in 2013 and 6.6 percent in 2014. The average time-to-maturity of
     government bonds is relatively short – 3.1 years in 2013 and 4.8 years in 2014. This can pose
     rollover and maturity mismatch risks, particularly given the gestation period of debt financed
     infrastructure investments. Taking advantage of benign global financing conditions and recent
     upgrades in its sovereign credit ratings, Vietnam issued a US$ 1 billion 10-year international
     bond (yield of 4.8 percent) in November 2014 – its first international issuance in 5 years. Some
     of the proceeds were used to buy back outstanding debt.

     14.	 Debt servicing costs pose an increasing burden on the budget. Public debt
     services obligation (the sum of payment of government, government- guaranteed and local
     government debt) have risen from 22 percent in 2010 to about 26 percent of total budget
     revenues in 2014. Interest payments alone now account for estimated 7.2 percent of total
     budget spending, crowding out other more productive spending.

     15.	 In addition, contingent liabilities from SOEs and the banking sector pose risks to
     public debt sustainability. While explicit guarantees are captured in the discussion above,
     it is the implicit guarantees which are not yet properly measured but can be significant in size
     and threaten fiscal stability. Although the government recognizes these risks, it maintains
     that State Budget resources will not be used to recapitalize banks or restructure SOE debt.

     Vietnam’s external position weakens in the first half of 2015

     16.	 Vietnam’s external position weakened in the first months of 2015, reflecting slow-
     down in exports and strong growth in imports. Export growth is estimated to have slowed
www.worldbank.org.vn                        TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS                        19


to 7.7 percent (year-on-year) in the first five months of 2015 (down from 13.8 percent in 2014
and 15.3 percent in 2013) mainly due to a sharp fall in export prices as well as declining volumes
in key commodities such as crude oil, coal, rice, coffee and rubber. Manufacturing exports grew
only moderately reflecting lackluster demand as global trade remains subdued despite the
recent strengthening of growth in key export markets. Meanwhile, imports, especially of capital
goods continued to surge resulting in an emerging trade deficit of more than US$ 3 billion in
the first five months (compared to a surplus of US$ 2.1 billion in entire 2014).

     especially in the FDI sector. Imports grew by 12 percent in 2014 and accelerated further to
     16.4 during the first five months, driven by expanding activities in the FDI sector which heavily
     relies on imports of intermediate and capital goods. Due to several large investment projects,
     such as Samsung Electronics, Formosa Steel complex, and the Nghi Son refinery, imports of
     capital goods surged. Imports of raw materials and intermediate inputs for manufacturing
     exports, such as phone accessories, computer and electronic parts, cotton, fabrics, garment
     and footwear accessories have also recorded high growth rates. This recent hike of imports
     of capital goods indicates ongoing capacity extension in the FDI sector which should lift
     Vietnam’s medium terms export and growth potential.

     18.	 Due to the deterioration of the trade position, Vietnam’s current account is estimated
     to have moved into deficit during the first quarter of 2015. After posting a healthy current
     account surplus of about 4.8 percent of GDP in 2014, the current account moved into deficit
     during the first quarter of the year. An emerging trade deficit (for goods and services) and
     transfer payments related to the repatriation of profits in the FDI sector were only partially
     offset by remittance inflows which remained robust during the year.

19.	 Strong and diversified FDI inflows and external loans bolstered the financial
account and allowed for further build-up of reserves. FDI disbursement rose 9.6 percent
to about US$ 6.3 billion in the fist half of 2015. External debt rollover rates also remained
solid aided by stable official inflows and by credit rating upgrades as both Moody’s and Fitch
upgraded Vietnam’s sovereign rating by one notch with a stable outlook.6 Meanwhile, deposit
outflows which were a major drag on the financial account last year, subsided. This allowed for
continued gradual build-up of international reserves which increased to about 2.8 months of
imports by the and Q1-2015.

    Short-term economic outlook and risks
    20.	 The medium term outlook for Vietnam is positive on balance. Forward looking
    indicators suggest that the recovery will remain on track. The Purchasing Managers’ Index
    (PMI) computed by HSBC has remained above 50 for 22 continuous months while the
    consumer confidence index stayed at 140.2 in May, well above its long-term average of 135.
    We expect growth to stay at around 6.0 - 6.2 percent in 2015 underpinned by further recovery
    in domestic demand, in turn reflecting robust private consumption and investment growth.
    Despite recent loosening of monetary policy, we expect inflation to remain low on account
    of low global energy and food prices. The fiscal deficit is expected to start adjusting through
    consolidation efforts to avoid further increases in public debt. We expect the trade surplus
    to narrow significantly this year due to a combination of weakening exports and sustained
    import growth stoked by stronger domestic economic activity. However, robust remittances
    will keep the current account in surplus, albeit at much lower level than last year.

     21.	 This baseline assessment is subject to downside risks, both external and domestic.
     On the external front, global growth remains sluggish and subject to much uncertainty, with
     important implications for Vietnam through its significant trade linkages. Furthermore, weak
     global prices of rice and other agricultural products may adversely affect rural household
     income and consumption and widen the urban-rural gap. On the domestic side, a credible
     medium-term fiscal consolidation plan together with an equally credible plan to strengthen
     the finances of the SOEs and state-owned banking sector would remain crucial to ward off
     pressures on public debt sustainability and to boost the fragile private sector confidence. On
     the upside, emerging trade agreements provide opportunity for Vietnamese enterprises to
     attract more foreign investment, diversify and promote trade though reaching out to much
     bigger and richer markets.

     22.	 Going forward, achieving a higher and sustainable rate of economic growth
     depends on Vietnam’s ability on sustain macroeconomic stability and accelerate
     structural reforms. On the macroeconomic front, a gradual, growth-friendly fiscal
     consolidation would help contain emerging public debt pressures and fiscal risks. Lower
     government financing requirement would also reduce risks of government bonds crowding
www.worldbank.org.vn              TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS   23


out private sector credit thereby enhancing the impact of accommodative monetary
policies on private sector activity. The gradual reduction of fiscal deficit could be facilitated
by reigning in government consumption and improving efficiency of public investment.
Collecting reliable and up-to-date information on contingent liabilities (mostly in the SOE
sector) and assessing their fiscal risks should remain a priority. In addition, while not a a
short term concern, in the medium term the combination of declining FDI commitments,
subsiding ODA inflow and generally tighter global financing conditions could raise external
financing risks. While the recent increase in international reserves has raised available
buffers, greater exchange rate flexibility may be required to help absorb external shocks.
On the structural reform front, key steps include further efforts to modernize the SOE sector
and to address banking sector weaknesses, including resolution of non-performing loans.
A more detailed update of recent progress and the remaining structural reform agenda is
presented in the following section.


1.3.	 AN UPDATE OF STRUCTURAL REFORM PROGRESS AND
CHALLENGES
Restructuring of state-owned enterprises

23.	 State owned enterprises remain important players in the economy. State owned
enterprises account for about one-third of all business assets, one quarter of output, and
one-eight of employment in enterprise sector. As such their performance matters for
the overall growth potential of the economy. Currently, at least some of the SOE enjoy
preferential access to capital and may also benefit from favorable regulatory frameworks
and enforcement which in turn prevents private firms from market entry or growth. At the
same time, fragmented and sometimes overlapping responsibilities in the management
of SOEs and weak corporate governance may undermine efficient use of resources at the
firm level. Recognizing the potential for improved efficiency, the government has initiated
comprehensive reforms to restructure the SOE sector.

24.	 Reforms of state owned enterprises continue to progress but at gradual pace.
The government adopted plans in 2012 to restructure the roughly 1,200 remaining, fully
state-owned SOEs. To avoid the need to provide budget financing to SOEs, the government
intends to use dedicated enterprise restructuring funds which accumulates proceeds
of asset sales to be used to finance the cost of restructuring, including capitalization and
investment in restructured SOEs. Progress on equitization (divesture of state assets) picked
up in 2014, although with equitization of 143 SOEs implementation fell slightly short of the
government’s ambitious annual target of 200 SOEs. Progress slowed down somewhat during
2015 and only 29 SOEs were equitized in the first quarter, suggesting that the annual target
of 289 SOEs may not be feasible this year. In addition to complex procedural requirements,
implementation of equitization is also hampered by subdued demand for some of the assets,
especially for non-controlling shares in SOEs.
24   TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS                         www.worldbank.org.vn




     25.	 During 2014, the Government continued to enhance the legal and regulatory
     framework for SOE management and corporate governance.7 Progress has also
     been made in implementing provisions related to Decree 61 which stipulates financial
     reporting and disclosure standards for SOE. Most SOEs now publish both financial and
     non-financial information on their own website and on the MPI portal. However, further
     efforts are needed to ensure full compliance as technical and human resource constrains
     impede implementation of financial management and timely reporting. These problems at
     the enterprise level are compounded by sometimes weak cooperation between agencies
     involved in the monitoring and supervision of SOE.

     26.	 Following further improvements in the legal framework for corporate governance,
     implementation remains the key priority. Sustained implementation of SOE restructuring,
     further improvement of corporate governance practices and steps to level the playing field
     and create hard budget constraints could all help enhance SOE performance and overall
     growth prospects. While further improvement in the legal and regulatory framework are
     important, particular focus should be paid to ensuring consistent implementation. Further
     efforts are needed with regard to equitization of remaining SOEs, continued divestment from
     non-core assets and elimination of any preferential treatment of SOEs including access to
     bank capital and other sources of financing, tax treatment, public procurement preferences
     and other advantages.

     Banking sector reform

     27.	 After slow progress last year, banking sector reforms accelerated during the first
     half of 2015, especially with regard to consolidation of the banking sector. Unlike previous
     years, when consolidation was driven mostly by mergers of smaller (and weaker) banks, this
     year saw a number acquisitions by major State Owned Commercial Bank (SOCBs) of smaller
     banks, e.g. BIDV and MHB, Vietinbank and PG Bank, and the forthcoming Vietcombank and
     SaigonBank. Moreover, rather than allowing weak banks to declare bankruptcy, the SBV also
     took over a number of smaller banks and placed experienced SOCBs management in key
     positions to facilitate a turn-around of their operations e.g. VNBC in February, OceanBank in
     April, and possibly another bank in coming months. There were also a few mergers among
     healthier joint-stock commercial banks place (e.g. Sacombank and Southern Bank, Maritime
     Bank and MDB). Most, if not all, of the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are facilitated by the
     regulators with the aim to consolidate the banking system and address cross-ownership
     between banks, hence reduce some systemic risks. Despite the increasing number of M&As,
     the target of reducing the total number of commercial banks to 15 -17 by 2017 remains a
     challenging task.


     7
         	In 2014, the GOV issued Resolution 15/NQ-CP (March) to accelerate SOE reform (including stepping up
           divestment) and several other SOE reform related legislations. In November 2014, the GOV has further
           issued Law 67/2014/QH13 on investment and Law 68/2014/QH13 on enterprises, which do not relate
           to SOEs directly but are a step towards leveling the playing field between different types of firms and
           increasing market competition. The Public Investment Law is a further step towards optimizing public
           investment (going beyond Directive 1792/CT-TTg from October 2011). This highlights considerable
           ownership of the program by the GOV and buy-in to the SOE reform agenda by the central government.

28.	 Despite recent legal revisions that allow for exceptions to the foreign ownership
cap, there was no direct participation of foreign banks in any of the recent M&As.
While some of banks involved in recent deals have had foreign investments, none of the
transactions directly involved foreign banks. This is likely the result of a number of factors,
including lack of attractive banks and supportive regulatory framework. While the cap
for total foreign holdings remains unchanged at 30 percent (consistent with Vietnam’s
WTO commitments), Decree 01, issued in January 2014 allows for higher foreign equity
participation in special cases (i.e. weak banks) subject to Prime Ministerial approval. Aside
of bringing additional capital, foreign investment participation in M&A activities could also
help strengthen corporate governance, management and transparency in the institutions
involved. However, thus far, it appears that no foreign investors have been interested in the
weak banks in Vietnam.

29	 The question on the actual size of NPLs by international best practices remains
unanswered although recent regulatory changes are steps in the right direction.
Circular 02 and Circular 09 on loan loss classification and provisioning, respectively, were
important regulatory changes to improve the reporting and management of NPLs. Full
enforcement of Circular 02 started in April 2015, but thus far, there have been no official
reported figures for NPLs under the new scheme. In addition to stricter classification with
the combination of both quantitative and qualitative approaches, and cross rating through
Credit Information Center’s system, the Circular extends the provisioning for (i) loans via
credit card; (ii) off-balance sheet items; (iii) investments in unlisted corporate bonds, (iv)
trust investment and (v) deposits at other credit institutions. Among these, off-balance sheet
items (L/Cs, guarantees) and corporate bond investments can be under significant impact
as these assets account for noticeable portions (two-digit numbers) of the total assets for
many banks. It may take a while to identify and quantify all the impacts these important
regulations may have on the operation of the commercial banks, but it is believed that the
banks have been able to alleviate these impacts to a large extent thanks to the long lead
time for the final adjustment to the new system, as seen in the increases in provisioning, and
resultant decreases in profitability across the bank balance sheets over the last two years.

30.	 While there has been some progress, resolution of bad debts remains a key issue
of concern. Since its establishment in July 2013, the Vietnam Asset Management Company
(VAMC) has absorbed a growing share of bad assets. By the end of 2014 about 123 trillion
dong in assets had been transferred to the VAMC of which it claimed to have resolved 4.8
trillion dong. Since the beginning of this year to the end of May, VAMC reported to have
increased cumulative assets to 152 trillion dong and have resolved an additional 3 trillion
dong. However, the majority of these assets were transferred in exchange for bonds, risks
have not been fully removed from the banking system, as some unresolved assets may
return as bonds mature. Moreover, efforts to resolve bad debts have been hampered by
the absence of an enabling legal framework for insolvency, asset titling, and seizure of
collaterals and for protecting VAMC staffs against possible lawsuits arising from potential
losses to the State in case a fair market price mechanism cannot be established. In a bid
to address the weaknesses, the Government issued Decree 34 in March 2015 replacing
Decree 53 (issued in 2013) giving more authority to VAMC in dealing with the bad debts and
underlying assets. However, most of the structural regulatory obstacles remain, and require
more comprehensive changes in the legal framework, and more importantly, in the mindset
26   TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS                           www.worldbank.org.vn




     and business practices in the claim enforcement process, non-court workouts of distressed
     debts, etc. VAMC’s capital base is too small for actually resolving the bad debt.

     31.	 For the time being, confidence in the system seems to be improved, as shown in
     stable deposit base and hence ample liquidity in the system to support credit activities.
     Rising confidence is also reflected in solid increases in listed bank share prices in the first half
     of the year (e.g. 25 percent in Vietcombank shares and 26 percent in Vietinbank shares in Q2,
     2015). The real estate market also shows initial recovery and macro conditions have improved?.
     However, rapid monetary loosening in the context of prevailing administrative interventions in
     credit allocation may undermine the quality of the banking sector assets. Finance matters, both
     when it functions well and when it functions poorly.

     Reforming public investment

     32.	 Public investment has played an important role in Vietnam’s development. The state
     budget remains the most important source of funding for both physical and social infrastructure.
     During 2004-12, Vietnam spent on average about one third of the state budget or 8.4 percent
     of GDP for state capital spending. This is a relatively high level compared to the majority of
     developing countries.

     33.	 A combination of various factors, including sharp decline in revenue, concerns about
     rapidly rising public debt and the phasing out of stimulus spending has led to a significant
     dip in public investment since 2012. Reported investment in QI/2015 only accounted for about
     15.6 percent of total government expenditure. This is only half of the average level for 2004-12
     and the lowest level recorded in the last 20 years. As share in the GDP, state capital spending
     was around 5 percent in 2014 and the first Quarter of 2015, or half of the 2009 level when public
     investment picked up as a result of the implementation of the economic stimulus package.

34.	 Important changes in the sectoral composition of capital spending as well as
the degree of decentralization in the management of public investment have taken
place over the last 15 years In the last Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), capital
spending for social sectors, sciences and technology increased notably at the expense of
the transport sector. At the same time, nearly 80 percent of state capital spending is now
managed at the subnational levels, a rapid increase from the period 2000-05. Compared to
the average level of 38.4 percent for 2001-2010 for developing countries, Vietnam’s level of
decentralization of capital spending is among the highest in the developing world and put
Vietnam in the spectrum of federal and highly decentralized countries.

35.	 The government adopted a detailed reform program for public investment
management with the issuance of the Prime Minister Decision 339 in 2013. In the short
term, this program aims to consolidate public investment and eliminate expenditure arrears
on capital projects. In the longer term, priorities have been given to the improvement of
the regulatory framework, strengthening the prioritization of spending as well as increased
private participation in infrastructure projects. In addition, PM Directives 1792/2011,
27/2012 and 14/2013 enhanced public investment management. With these Directives, the
first priority in capital spending allocation has been given to the timely completion of the
on-going projects and for repayment of arrears and implementing new projects only if there
are residual resources. As a result, Vietnam achieved good progress in 2012 in dealing with
arrears to construction companies. The total value of arrears dropped to less than 47 trillion
28   TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS              www.worldbank.org.vn




     dong (US$ 2.1 billion) in December 2012 from about 91 trillion dong in 2011. However, the
     value of arrears did not change much during 2013-14, reported at nearly 45 trillion dong as of
     June 2014, or more than one quarter of capital spending in 2014. The Prime Minister already
     issued another Directive at the end of April 2015 (Directive 07) requesting line ministries and
     provinces to report their current status and progress in addressing arrears. Given the current
     progress, it is unlikely that all arrears will be eliminated by the end of 2015 as planned. Given
     the current high level of decentralization and the fact that provincial arrears accounted for
     almost 95 percent of total arrears, a complete elimination of the arrears and prevention of its
     reoccurrence would require fundamental overhaul of the public investment management
     (PIM) system and hence goes beyond the scope of recent PM Directives.

     36.	 Major improvement in the regulatory framework for the management of public
     investment include the promulgation of the Public Investment Law and the amendment
     of the Construction Law. The Public Investment Law institutionalizes several improvements
     introduced in Directive 1792 such as medium-term investment planning, improvement
     in accountability, and strengthening prioritization of public investment projects at the
     concept stage. The Construction Law 2014 aims to improve the quality of construction
     master plans and project implementation, through measures such as professionalize the
     PMUs, or improvement of transparency in the issuance of construction permits, or improved
     accountability in construction management. Both laws are in effect from January 2015. Since
     these two laws regulate different aspects of the public investment management cycles it is
     critical to ensure consistency between them. The appraisal of project concept notes and
     the M&E will be managed by the Public Investment Law whereas the other steps of project
     preparation and project implementation will fall under the Construction Law. There are also
     some changes in law that potentially weaken the overall framework such as the elimination
     of independent review of project appraisals. Technical departments such as Departments
     of Construction or Departments of Agriculture and Rural development will now lead the
     appraisal of projects under their technical expertise rather than being led by Department of
     Planning and Investment as under past regulations. At the same time, they also propose and
     lead the preparation of the projects so potential conflicts of interests may arise.

     37.	 Despite these legal changes, the consideration of economic benefits continues to
     receive inadequate attention in public investment management. While there are some
     specific requirements to estimate the economic benefits during the concept note stage (or
     initiation of the investment projects as in Vietnamese term), the amended Construction Law
     almost exclusively focuses on technical (as opposed to economic and financial) appraisal,
     even at the feasibility study stage.

     38.	 While raising private sector participation in infrastructure investment and
     operation is an explicit policy objective, progress in this area is relatively slow. Some
     progress has been made in the regulatory environment with the issuance of Decree 15 on
     PPP in February 2015. The Decree facilitates a result-based approach and extends sectors
     for private participation to public utilities and basic social services, hence is expected to
     boost private participation in projects usually wholly funded by state budgets. However, it
     is important to note that private participation can help mobilize financing for infrastructure
www.worldbank.org.vn              TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS   29


investment, but the underlying funding for this infrastructure will ultimately fall to (i)
taxpayers, (ii) consumers, or (iii) some combination of the two. As a result, accompanying
reforms are needed to ensure quality of public services delivered by private sector and
adequate consumer protection.

39.	 Medium term investment planning (MTIF) was introduced with Directive 1792, and
then institutionalized with the Public Investment Law as an effort to introduce hard
budget constraints on spending agencies. The medium-term investment plan 2016-20 is
being prepared by the MPI and is expected to cover investment of all levels of the government,
including both budget and off-budget investment. As such, the MTIF has the potential
to contribute to improved efficiency by better linking it to the SEDP priorities and reduce
fragmentation. However, planning for recurrent expenditures, including those associated with
capital assets, such as operations and maintenance continues to follow the annual budget
cycle. As a result, there can be inconsistencies between medium-term approach to investment
planning and short-term approach to recurrent expenditure planning which could potentially
undermine the appropriate mix of recurrent and investment spending. Unlike international
practice, the approach to investment planning in Vietnam as specified in the Public Investment
Law is also not a rolling one that is updated and revised annually, but a fixed term plan linked
to the SEDP. While aiming to establish a firm budget constraint, this approach may be too rigid
to accommodate changing circumstances during the planning period.

40.	 The preparation of the MTIF and hence the SEDP 2016-20 is moving ahead slowly.
This is the first time provinces and line ministries have to prepare an MTIF so capacity is
obviously one of the main causes of the delay. Majority of spending agencies have been
struggling with the formulation of a credible five-year fiscal framework. In addition, the
Public Investment Law requires spending agencies to prioritize the investment projects to
be submitted to the MPI but the formulation of well-defined criteria for prioritization of
projects within and across sectors requires long time to be completed. The formulation of
allocation criteria for equalization transfer of capital spending from central government to
provinces has also been slower than planned.

 Section ii
 SPECIAL FOCUS ON LABOR MARKET - Building Modern Labor
 Market Regulations and Institutions in Vietnam


1.	 The landscape of jobs in Vietnam has shifted dramatically over the last 25 years.
While jobs in Vietnam were once characterized entirely by family farming, collectives, and
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), over time employment has shifted towards manufacturing
and services, household enterprises outside agriculture, and private domestic and foreign-
owned firms. In 1989, 71 percent of employed Vietnamese worked primarily in agriculture,
fishing, or forestry, and private employment was almost non-existent. Today agriculture,
fishing, and forestry accounts for 46 percent of jobs, and 1 in 10 Vietnamese workers—about
5 million—hold a wage job with a private firm. 8

2.	 The expansion of private-sector wage jobs is fundamental to the improvement
of living standards in Vietnam. Family farms, household enterprises, SOEs, and the
government will continue to be a source of livelihoods for many workers, but only private
sector wage jobs promise the potential for the rapid productivity gains needed to boost
large numbers of Vietnamese workers into the ranks of the global middle class.

3.	 Private-sector job growth is determined by many factors. The primary driver is
the business environment, which includes strong, efficient market institutions, stable
macroeconomic environment, and adequate infrastructure. Enterprises also need a well-
educated and skilled workforce for growth. Policies regarding these “fundamentals” are the
most important policy levers for job growth.




8
    	1989 figures are based on analysis of the Population and Housing Census. Figures for “today” are based
      on analysis of the 2014 Labor Force Survey.
32   TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS              www.worldbank.org.vn




     4.	 Labor regulations and institutions can also be an important determinant of
     private sector wage growth. Labor market policies have the potential to help people grasp
     economic opportunities in a risky world but need to be well calibrated to help households
     and society manage the risks. Labor market policies can mitigate the effects of earnings
     and employment losses, provide voice to workers, and facilitate the movement of labor and
     human capital to where they are most efficiently deployed. At the same time, inappropriate
     policies may increase individual and societal labor market risks. At the individual level, risks
     of jobs losses or sustained informality may be increased, while at a societal level they may
     result in slow formalization of employment, mismatches between earnings and productivity
     growth, or labor unrest. Poorly calibrated policies may also inhibit structural transformation
     by reducing movement of workers across geography, sectors, and types of work.

     5.	 Vietnam’s labor market policies may be an emerging constraint to private wage
     job growth. In the most recent data from 2009, just 1 percent of firms identified labor
     regulations as the chief constraint to firm growth. However, an additional 28 percent
     identified labor regulations as a minor or moderate constraint (World Bank, 2014a). Vietnam
     faces the danger that overly strict regulations today could be a future barrier to wage job
     growth. Regulations often benefit “insiders”—those workers who currently hold wage
     jobs—while smothering the creation of new jobs that would generate opportunity for
     “outsiders”—those who do not yet hold wage jobs. As the ranks of wage workers increase,
     insiders will become an increasingly powerful voice in favor of maintain policies that are to
     their advantage. This could make it difficult to change overly strict policies in the future.

     6.	 This special focus profiles key labor market issues in Vietnam. The common theme
     is how to balance labor market flexibility and sustained productivity growth with policies
     and institutions to manage social risks in a more market-oriented economy. It begins with an
     outline of the structure of the labor market and continues with a look at two types of labor
     market regulations—the minimum wage and employment protection legislation—and
     then discusses the industrial relations system. It concludes with considerations for policy.

     The Structure of Vietnam’s Labor Market

     7.	 Despite the rapid changes that have taken place in the last quarter-century, nearly
     half of Vietnamese workers still work primarily in family farming (including fishing
     and forestry). Figure 1 shows a breakdown of workers in Vietnam by employer and broad
     type of job. Twenty-one percent of the workforce (11 million) consists of the self-employed
     and family workers in non-farm household enterprises. Wage workers number 18.7 million
     overall, but of those 7.4 million are in jobs without contracts, which would generally be
     classified as “informal.” Another 5.4 million wage workers work for the government or SOEs.
     The remaining group work in private sector wage jobs with contracts. These include 2 million
     in foreign-owned firms and 3.9 million in domestic private sector firms. Taking these two
     groups together, those working in private sector wage jobs with contracts constitute 11.3
     percent of workers.

farms or non-farm household enterprises are classified under “wage worker.” Nearly all such workers
are without contract.


8.	 Vietnam is amidst a vast transformation of its labor structure. Figure 2 shows the
long-run trends by major job category. The share of the labor force working chiefly in
agriculture has dropped steadily since the start of the new millennium, at a rate of 1.6 percent
point per year. At the current size of the workforce, this corresponds to a net movement of
approximately 800,000 workers per year out of agriculture. These workers move into non-
farm household enterprise and wage work, which have both seen their ranks swell over
time. Household enterprises have generated a large boost in living standards for millions of
Vietnamese but are limited in their potential for productivity growth. The future growth of
Vietnam’s middle class will depend principally on the growth of wage jobs.

9.	 Although the speed of the shift out of agriculture will be determined by other
forces, the growth of wage jobs is influenced by labor regulations and institutions. The
following section considers three aspects of regulations and institutions in Vietnam.

       Key Labor Market Regulations

       a.	 Minimum Wage

       10.	 Vietnam’s minimum wage regime has evolved over time. The country first set a
       statutory minimum wage in 1992 that applied exclusively to foreign companies. The country’s
       current minimum wage system was introduced in 2006. Under this system, minimum wages
       vary according to location and sector of employment. Prior to 2012, separate rates were set
       for government employees, domestic firms (including state-owned enterprises), and foreign
       companies. Since 2012, minimum wages have been aligned between foreign-owned and
       domestic firms. Minimum wages now vary by district; each district now has a minimum wage
       at one of four levels established nationally. As of January 2015, the minimum wage ranges from
       2,150,000 dong to 3,100,000 dong per month. A separate and lower minimum wage-- known
       as the “reference wage” or “basic wage”—still applies to government workers: 1,150,000 dong.

11.	 The minimum wage in Vietnam is envisioned by the law as a tool to guarantee
basic living standards for workers. The 2012 Labor Code says, “The minimum wage is the
lowest payment for an employee who performs the simplest job in normal working conditions
and must ensure the employee’s minimum living needs and his/her family.” Minimum wage
legislation has direct implications for the 22 percent of Vietnamese workers who hold “formal”
wage jobs—those with the job contract required by the Labor Code. The minimum wage also
forms the basis for calculating (a) wage scales for government staff/public sector workers; (b)
wage scales for the payment of social insurance, unemployment insurance and health insurance
for workers of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (c) allowances for redundant workers due to the
restructuring of SOEs; and (d) pensions, allowances for veterans, and some social transfers.

12.	 The theoretical impact of changes in the minimum wage on employment is
uncertain. In the absence of strict enforcement, if the minimum wage exceeds worker
productivity, employers may hire workers informally without contract to evade the minimum
wage restrictions. Economic theory shows that in a perfectly competitive labor market with
both a formal sector covered by the minimum wage laws and an uncovered informal sector,
the effect of an increase in the minimum wage will be to shift employment from the formal to
the informal sector. In the real world, labor markets are not perfectly competitive—large firms
in particular can exert some market power—and thus the impact of the minimum wage is
less clear cut. Theories of “efficiency wages” suggest that paying workers more induces higher
effort, makes them more productive due to higher morale, and/or reduces worker turnover. In
the presence of market power or efficiency wages, small changes in the minimum wage at low
levels can have little or no effect on employment.

13.	 Nonetheless it is likely that an extremely high minimum wage, if enforced, will
reduce formal employment. Increases in the minimum wage can also increase wages higher
up the wage scale—and possibly reduce employment—through the “lighthouse effect” if some
workers are paid multiples of the minimum wage. Given that Vietnam has attracted foreign direct
investment (FDI) in part because of its low wages, there is a risk that a very high minimum wages
will discourage further FDI and jobs it creates. Rising minimum wage levels have contributed
to decreasing the country’s cost advantage relative to countries like Bangladesh or Cambodia
where wages are still low relative to Vietnam (McKinsey Global Institute, 2012).

14.	 Outside the government sector, Vietnam’s minimum wages have risen rapidly in
recent years, outstripping productivity growth. Figure 3 presents the growth of Vietnam’s
minimum wages. By way of comparison, the growth of real labor productivity in the state,
non-state domestic and FDI sectors are also depicted. The minimum wage increased most
dramatically in 2012, when minimum wages in the domestic and foreign sectors were aligned.
In real terms, the minimum wage has more than doubled since 2006, while productivity growth
has been far less. It has been the Government’s stated ambition to raise minimum wages to a
level that allows households to reach the “minimum monthly living standard” by 2018.9 This
would imply further large increases.

     15.	 By simple measures—the ratios of the minimum to mean and median wages--
     Vietnam’s private sector minimum wage is somewhat high relative to other countries. A
     key benchmark of minimum wages is the relationship to median wages, and for Vietnam the
     picture differs sharply between the government and private sectors. Figure 3 depicts the ratios
     of minimum to average and median wages in Vietnam and selected countries in the OECD and
     EAP. The private sector minimum wage and the government sector reference wage are shown
     separately. Vietnam’s reference wage is low by global and regional standards at around the 30
     percent of the median wage, while the private sector minimum wage is high, with the average
     ratio of minimum to median wage around 58 percent.

16.	 Studies that have examined the effects of recent changes in the minimum wage
in Vietnam suggest that past minimum wage increases may have slightly depressed
formal employment growth. One study using 2006-2010 data found that minimum wage
changes over that period were associated with slower private sector employment growth in
the domestic private sector (Del Carpio, Nguyen, Nguyen and Wang, 2012). Another found that
increases in the minimum wage over 2001-2012 increased average wages and moderately
lowered firm employment in both private firms and state-owned enterprises (Hansen, Rand,
and Torm 2015a). A third study, of the sharp increases in the minimum wage 2011-13, found
that the changes substantially boosted wages at the low end of the distribution, but only in
state enterprises and foreign-invested private firms, suggesting that the minimum wage is not
fully enforced in the domestic private sector (Hansen, Rand, and Torm 2015b).

     Note: Figures shown are for employees in their primary job, working at least 35 hours per week. Minimum

     17.	 The minimum wage is imperfectly enforced, particularly for workers without contracts.
     Overall, 8 percent of full-time workers are paid less than the minimum wage (see Figure 5).
     In government, SOEs, and private foreign-owned firms, almost all workers have employment
     contracts, and very few are paid less than the minimum wage. In private domestic firms, 11
     percent of those without contract are paid less than the minimum wage. The number receiving
     less than the minimum wage is highest among those working for household enterprises without
     contracts (17 percent.) A 2012 audit across manufacturing firms found that 20 percent of firms
     falsified their records, and 33 percent had violations related to wages and benefits. Manufacturing
     firms that violate labor regulations (typically export-oriented firms) report fewer hours in order
     to appear to stay compliant with international labor standards regarding hours and to boost
     their reported productivity rates (Level Works, 2012). A report of garment firms participating in
     the Better Work Vietnam program found that 7 percent did not pay at least the minimum wage
     for ordinary hours of work (International Labour Organization 2014).

     b.	 Employment Protection Legislation

     18.	 Employment protection legislation (EPL) establishes terms for dismissal of
     workers by employers. The intent of EPL is to provide some level of job security to those
     who are currently employed. Because overly restrictive EPL makes it more difficult to dismiss
     unproductive employees and to reduce employment during times of reduced demand, it may
     discourage firms from hiring workers in the first place, reducing both the overall level of formal
     sector employment and productivity.

     19.	 The OECD calculates an EPL index that compares some of the most critical EPL
     components and the costs they impart on employers. The index is determined by three
     components: 1) protections of permanent workers against individual dismissal, 2) additional
www.worldbank.org.vn                    TAKING STOCK AN UPDATE ON VIETNAM’S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS   39


requirements for collective dismissal, and 3) regulations and restrictions on temporary forms
of employment. The value of the index ranges from zero to six, with zero being the least
restrictive and six the most restrictive legislation. Figure 6 shows values of the EPL index for
countries in the OECD and East Asia and the Pacific, including Vietnam’s values in both 2010
and 2014.

20.	 Changes to the Vietnam Labor Code in 2012 have made Vietnam’s employment
protection legislation highly restrictive by global standards. In 2010, Vietnam’s level of EPL
was relatively moderate by comparison to OECD and other EAP countries. With the passage
of the new Labor Code and Trade Union Law in 2012, rules on hiring and dismissals became
more stringent in all three areas covered by the EPL index and, pushing Vietnam to a level of
restrictiveness above that of France and Portugal.

     21.	 The most dramatic changes in 2012 were with respect to fixed term contract regulations.
     The index became more stringent as a consequence of new regulations regarding outsourcing
     contracts and labor leasing enterprises. Under the new regulation, labor leasing enterprises have
     more restrictions, and outsourcing contracts are limited to a maximum cumulative duration
     of 12 months. These reforms moved Vietnam from being a country with moderately stringent
     restrictions on temporary forms of employment to one that is very restrictive.

     22.	 Evidence from other countries shows that restrictive EPL is often associated with
     lower formal sector employment, especially of young workers, women, new entrants to
     the labor market, and unskilled workers (OECD 2004; Heckman and Pages 2004; Perry et al.
     2007; Packard, Koettl, and Montenegro 2012; World Bank, 2014a). These groups tend to be among
     the first to be laid off when labor costs rise or to be blocked from entry altogether. Evidence
     suggests that more restrictive EPL raises the share of self-employment and decreases dependent
     employment in low- and middle-income countries (Betcherman, Luinstra, and Ogawa, 2001;
     Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, and Vodopivec, 2003).

     23.	 An important complement to more flexible EPL is active and passive labor market
     interventions, but both remain under-developed in Vietnam currently. Protecting workers
     in flexible labor markets requires both “active” labor market programs like training and job search
     assistance, and “passive” benefits such as severance pay and unemployment insurance. Together
     with Thailand and China, Vietnam is one of only three developing countries in the EAP with a
     national unemployment insurance scheme, but coverage remains modest. Vietnam’s scheme
     was introduced in 2009, and is summarized in Table 2 in comparison with Thailand and China.
     Unemployment benefits in Vietnam are relatively generous. At 60 percent of average monthly
     earnings in the six months before unemployment, the replacement rate (the portion of income
     replaced by benefits) is higher than those of Thailand or China, and relatively high by global
     standards for middle income countries.

Industrial Relations
24.	 Vietnam’s industrial relations system exhibits the legacy of a planned economy and
faces growing challenges to adapt to its central function in a market economy. A central
shortcoming is the lack of clear demarcation of the functions of unions, employers, and the state
in the system, which limits the force of industrial relations as an economic and social mediator in
Vietnam’s economy, placing undue pressure on regulatory measures in the labor market.

25.	 Vietnam has a relatively high unionization rate relative to countries in EAP, though
there is a large gap between union membership in the public and private sectors. Figure
7 shows union density rates among wage workers for Vietnam and a selection of EAP countries.
For Vietnam, the figure further distinguishes between the public and the private sector. At 76
percent of wage employment, Vietnam’s unionization rate in the public sector is almost on
par with China’s overall rate of 79 percent. Vietnam’s unionization rate in the private sector is
substantially lower at 33 percent. Despite this gap, even in the private sector the unionization
rate in Vietnam is significantly higher than rates in most EAP countries.

26.	 Many observers have highlighted profound weaknesses in Vietnam’s industrial
relations system (e.g. Clarke, Lee and Chi, 2007; Chi and van den Broek, 2013; Schweisshelm,
2014). In Vietnam all trade unions fall under the umbrella of the VGCL, which operates under
the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The VGCL and its affiliated unions are
tasked to fulfill a number of different roles which are not well aligned and result in conflicts of
interest. First, enterprise-level unions have traditionally been close to management. Even in the
foreign-owned sector, senior executives and managers are often union members and hold top
union positions (Van Gramberg, Teicher and Nguyen, 2013). Second, unions act as “a transmission
belt” between the CPV and working people and are supposed to represent these people in
government decision making. Third, unions are tasked with representing workers’ interests’ vis-
à-vis firm management and providing welfare services to workers. This last function is at times
subsidiary to other duties of union representatives. The roles for employers’ associations are
similarly complex.

     27.	 A symptom of the weaknesses in Vietnam’s system of industrial relations is the
     country’s high number of “wildcat” strikes. While Vietnam’s Labor Code explicitly regulates
     strikes, official procedures are so cumbersome and the role of trade unions is so unclear that
     apparently no strike has ever taken place that was strictly in accordance with the Labor Code.
     Instead, strikes have been “wildcat” strikes that have involved spontaneous work stoppages
     by employees and bypassed official procedures (Schweisshelm, 2014). Wildcat strikes have
     increased notably since the mid-2000s in Vietnam, though with considerable volatility from
     year to year and with the bulk of strikes in the FDI sector (Figure 8). The number of strikes has
     increased significantly in the 2000s, reaching a peak of over 900 in 2011, though almost no
     strikes occurred in SOEs (ILO, 2011). The increase in strikes is indicative of the under-developed
     nature of other mechanisms to resolve labor disputes. For example, the capacity of mediators
     and arbitrators appears particularly weak. Many of them work part-time, are overburdened
     with multiple and sometimes conflicting tasks or have insufficient training in collective
     bargaining and dispute resolution.

     28.	The 2012 legislative reforms attempted to address long-recognized problems with
     Vietnam’s industrial relations system. First, formal procedures for settling industrial relations
     disputes were introduced. Second, the government was given a more active role in facilitating
     collective bargaining. Third, a National Wage Council was created as a tripartite institution
     involved in setting of minimum wages. Despite these measures, more fundamental issues with
     regard to the basic roles of trade unions and employers’ associations have not been resolved. As
     a result, there continues to be a lack of well-functioning institutions for collective bargaining and
     dispute resolution.

     29.	 Vietnam’s Labor Code appears to bear the weight of weak industrial relations
     institutions. Minimum wages adjustments and more stringent EPL have been used to address
     insufficient power of workers to negotiate adequate wages and assure decent conditions of
     work. This has resulted in a “one size fits all” set of regulatory parameters that fail to respond
     to the varying interests and demands of workers and employers and are not necessarily
     adequate across all sectors or geographies or types of work. Some of the symptoms caused by
     the dysfunction of the industrial relations system have been treated, but real cure will only be
     possible if the underlying causes are addressed.

Policy Considerations
30.	 Many policies can influence job creation. The 2013 World Development Report on Jobs
identified three broad areas of policy relevant to employment, which it labels fundamentals,
labor policies, and priorities. “Fundamentals” include macroeconomic stability, an enabling
business environment, human capital accumulation, and the rule of law. “Labor policies” include
those regarding regulations and industrial relations. “Priorities” refers to initiatives to promote
particular types of job creation. As noted at the beginning of this Special Focus, fundamentals
are the most important determinants of job creation, with priorities and labor policies like those
discussed here playing supporting roles.

31.	 Nonetheless, whether Vietnam can realize the further transformation of its labor
market will in part depend on the labor market policies that it pursues. More specifically,
it will depend on whether the country uses the current window of opportunity to address
weaknesses that are already apparent before they transition from farms to factories and firms.
One concept which characterizes the policy goals which Vietnam might aim for in its labor market
policies is “flexicurity”. This involves striking a balance between flexible labor regulation which
maximizes productivity growth and “creative destruction”, and the needs of workers for decent
employment which is fairly compensated. Put another way, Vietnam should aim to “protect
workers rather than jobs” as it deepens its structural transformation. The following paragraphs
discuss the policy directions which could help to achieve such a balance in LM policies.

32.	 The minimum wage will be most effective if it is determined primarily with reference
to productivity and competitiveness factors. To date, Vietnam has taken a “living wage”
approach to minimum wage setting, with a primary focus on cost of living. As Vietnam matures
as a market economy, shifting to a “wage floor” approach which puts a primary emphasis
on productivity and competitiveness as the drivers of minimum wage adjustments should
be considered. Factors such as price growth and relative earnings could remain factors but
productivity would become a more crucial factor in minimum wage determination. Other policy
instruments are more effective – possibly in combination with the minimum wage – for assuring
that people who work are able to live above the poverty line. To achieve this shift in approach,
in the short run, Vietnam’s private sector would benefit from moderating the rate of minimum
wage adjustments. In the medium term, existing plans to anchor minimum wage adjustments
to real productivity growth should be put into place. Examples of factors that are taken into
account in setting minimum wages in other countries are provided in Table 2, and indicate the
potential factors for Vietnam to incorporate in a minimum wage setting mechanism aligned with
the practice of upper middle and high income economies.

     33.	 Vietnam could also benefit from streamlining existing EPL regulations to promote
     greater flexibility in its labor market. First, Vietnam would benefit from loosening regulation
     of labor leasing enterprises and temporary and outsourcing contracts. Such reforms are likely
     to help foster mobility and efficient allocation of workers and make the regulated part of the
     labor market more attractive for firms and workers. In addition, Vietnam could look more closely
     at the interaction between employer-provided severance and unemployment insurance.
     Generally speaking, unemployment insurance schemes are more efficient than severance pay
     arrangements in pooling risks related to job loss. The potential substitutability of severance and
     unemployment insurance is apparently already recognized in Vietnam’s Labor Code.

34.	 To ensure that increased flexibility in the regulated labor market is accompanied
by adequate security for workers, Vietnam should gradually expand coverage of
unemployment insurance and active labor market programs. Well-designed and
implemented UI and ALMP such as public employment services can play a useful role in
enhancing labor market efficiency and worker welfare (World Bank, 2012b).

35.	 Improving Vietnam’s industrial relations system will be key to addressing a number
of fundamental challenges in the labor market. In the short term, Vietnam should continue
to strengthen efforts to increase the capacity of unions and employers’ federations through
awareness campaigns, training in collective bargaining, etc. In recent years, the VGCL has begun
attempts to form enterprise unions independent from management, to increase the capacity
of such grassroots unions, and to assure that unions actually represent workers’ interests. These
efforts should be supported and strengthened.

36.	 In the medium term, Vietnam needs to consider more proactive measures to strengthen
its industrial relations system and promote harmony in the labor market. First, the VGCL
and its affiliated unions could bar company executives and managers from key union positions
(like being head of an enterprise union). This would follow the example of other countries –
for instance Singapore – where company managers cannot hold principal union positions or
sometimes even union membership. Second, Vietnam should continue to simplify regulations
for resolving industrial relations disputes. Third, institutional reforms that allow the creation of
firm-level works councils or labor-management councils as found in many European countries
and South Korea could also be considered. Labor-management councils that bring together
employer and employee representatives might help facilitate information sharing, promote
employees’ participation in decision-making processes, and build trust between employers and
employees. Fourth, it will be beneficial to be more proactive in developing labor mediation and
arbitration systems which provide channels beyond the court system for resolution of labor
disputes when workplace institutions are unable to resolve matters amicably.

37.	 In the long term, Vietnam needs to consider fundamental institutional reforms
that could create an industrial relations system suited to the needs of a mature market
economy. One goal should be development of collective bargaining where the interests of
workers, employer and the state are more properly represented in a true bargaining process.
This is a process which China for example has accelerated in recent years, starting from an
institutional set-up not dissimilar to Vietnam. In the long run, unions would become independent
of government and the CPV and concentrate solely on representing the interests of workers. The
example of Singapore is one where a single national federation of trades unions has over recent
decades focused strongly on its worker presentation role independent of government, but in a
non-adversarial manner which has resulted in almost no strikes or lock-outs (Box 1).

       Box 1: Industrial Relations Systems in China and Singapore

       During the last two decades China has experienced an increasing number of labor disputes. This led
       to a revised industrial relations strategy which sees trade unions as a key pillar of social management
       that should be able to function as a “protector” of workers and not just as a subordinate partner of the
       government. The institutionalization of industrial relations practices such as collective bargaining and
       tripartite consultation has also gained renewed importance.

       Under the revised strategy, China has many initiatives by the government and social partners – the
       All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) and the China Enterprise Confederation (CEC) – with
       a view to improving the legal framework for industrial relations and to building new institutions of
       industrial relations such as tripartite consultation mechanisms and collective bargaining at various
       levels. In 2015, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council issued a policy document
       on building harmonious industrial relations with the objective of strengthening management of
       industrial relations, easing labor unrest by securing labor rights, implementing labor contracts and
       collective bargaining, and strengthening labor inspections.

       As a result, China today has one of the highest trade union densities in the world, and collective
       bargaining coverage has also expanded at an unusually rapid pace. Nevertheless, the incidence of
       strikes continues to rise. Some observers argue that this is because of deficiencies in the collective
       bargaining system in terms of the quality of the agreements and the bargaining process itself. Trades
       unions are often still seen as ineffective, with enterprise-level trade unions often led by either a
       senior Party official or by a manager of the enterprise. Finally, some see China’s legal framework for
       industrial relations as problematic, as it recognizes neither the freedom of association nor the right
       to strike. In the absence of those rights, the government needs to intervene frequently to achieve
       its social policy goals.

       In the 1950s and 1960s, Singapore also experienced a period of labor turmoil. But over the last five
       decades the incidence of strikes has declined practically to zero. Observers have acknowledged the
       critical role of Singapore’s industrial relations system in this process. The country’s main industrial
       relations actors are the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore National Employers Federation
       (SNEF) as the main employers association and the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (SNTUC)
       as the only national federation of trade unions. Affiliation to NTUC is voluntary but the vast majority
       of unions are affiliated.

       The work of the NTUC and the Singaporean labor movement focuses on three elements: First,
       workplace representation and protection of workers including collective bargaining and grievance
       handling. Second, improvements to workers’ quality of life through provision of a range of services
       such as access to recreational facilities. And third, political advocacy on behalf of workers. The NTUC’s
       leadership of the labor movement has been marked by pragmatism. For example, in 1969 it agreed to
       abandon an adversarial approach to industrial relations so as to make Singapore attractive for foreign
       investors. Since 1981 the NTUC has pushed for skills upgrading and productivity improvements, and
       has even supported wage freezes and wage cuts during periods of recession.

       In terms of Singapore’s practices of industrial relations and collective bargaining, private sector collective
       bargaining usually takes place at the enterprise level. Generally speaking, collective bargaining covers
       two broad categories: matters related to salary and to other conditions of employment. Unions tend
       to conduct collective bargaining in a coordinated manner to achieve uniform results across different
       enterprises and categories of workers. Singapore’s Industrial Relations Act forbids “rank and file” unions
       from engaging in collective bargaining on behalf of executive and managerial staff.
