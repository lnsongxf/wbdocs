                             I.        GENERAL CONTEXT OF THE ESMAP – FWC PROJECT
                  The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), a global knowledge and technical
                  assistance program administered by the World Bank and supported by 11 bilateral donors, has
                  launched, in January 2013, an initiative that will support country-driven efforts to improve RE
                  resource awareness, put in place appropriate policy frameworks for RE development, and provide
                  ‘open access’ to resource and geospatial mapping data. It will also support the IRENA Solar and
                  Wind Atlas by improving the data availability and quality that can be accessed through the atlas on
                  a modular basis.

                  This "Renewable Energy Mapping: Small Hydro Tanzania" study, is part of a technical assistance
                  project, ESMAP funded, being implemented by Africa Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1) of the World Bank
                  in Tanzania (the ‘Client’) which aims at supporting resource mapping and geospatial planning for
                  small hydro. It is being undertaken in close coordination with the Rural Energy Agency (REA) of
                  Tanzania, the World Bank’s primary Client country counterpart for this study.

                  The "Provision of Small Hydropower Resource Data and Mapping Services" IDA 8004801
                  Framework contract was signed 29th May 2013, while the specific contract " Renewable Energy
                  Mapping: Small Hydro Tanzania", n. 7169139, is dated 4th November 2013.




                       II.        FRAMEWORK OF THE SITE VISITS REPORT IN TANZANIA
                  The Site visits Report is the result of the consolidation of the primary and secondary data collected
                  and processed during the site visits. This report comes with the Hydro Mapping report provided at
                  the end of Phase 1 which established an inventory of existing and potential hydropower sites put
                  into perspective in their socio-economic and natural environment.

                  The fact sheets, presented in this report, for the 78 hydropower potential visited sites, contain
                  some preliminary information that must be verified during further detailed investigations before
                  any project development. Amongst these potential sites, 75 sites with an interest have been
                  considered in the Small Hydro Mapping report.

                  In addition, it has been agreed upon with the Client (during the Workshop held in Dar-es-Salaam in
                  March 2015) that the Consultant will undertake during Phase 2 the review of the 36 potential sites
                  to select a subset of 7 sites matching the selection criteria for promising small hydropower sites as
                  defined by this study (out of protected area, no detailed studies available, in the power range of
                  this study, etc...).The Consultant has conducted site visits of those 7 selected sites to further
                  evaluate their interest for private investment at short-term. The results of the site visits are
                  presented in the section IV of this report. In total, the report presents the fact sheets of 85 visited
                  sites.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Daily reservoir
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
The river is dry during the dry season and flooding problem occur during the rainy season (November to May). To mitigate
this, the scheme is designed with a seasonly operated reservoir that will release water during the dry season. This reservoir
will also provide regulation for the downstream Bubu II site (SF-091). The scheme is designed with the powerhouse at the
foot of the dam.
Sediment issue is complex for this site and must be analized in details in the next study stages and this scheme sould be
analysed as a multi-purpose reservoir (irrigation, reservoir for livestock, hydropower).
Given the topography, it is probable that the reservoir will not have enough capacity to provide storage for the whole dry
season. Hence, it is probable that this scheme will only be operated part of the year. Moreover, the size of this scheme falls
out of the scope of private investors. It should be studied at a national level and included in a master plan if cost effective.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
This scheme is designed as a run-of-the-river scheme with canal, forebay, penstock and powerhouse on the left riverbank. A
small weir will divert water into the canal. The scheme could benefit from regulation and storage provided by the upstream
Bubu I scheme (SF-092). This scheme sould be analysed as a multi-purpose reservoir (irrigation, reservoir for livestock,
hydropower)

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The Chulu river falls on the escarpment of a height over 800m. Altough agriculture is intense on the watershed, the water
quality seems still acceptable for a high weir or a dam, giving more options for the intake position. Penstock liying might be
challenging given the head and the challenging terrain.

 Canal length [m]                          0
 Tunnel length [m]                       1,150
 Penstock length [m]                     1 x2,942
 Dam type                                Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           10
 Dam width [m]                            50
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                 40
 Comments on solid transport             At the time of visit, solid transport was very limited. However, the soils on the
                                         watershed are exposed due to agriculture.
 Desilting basin size                    A medium sand trap is required
 Surge tank                              A surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                    0.44 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           40.0
 Total road length to create [km]        19.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]       1.0
 Potential impact of the scheme          Limited
 Comments on accessibility               Weir access: Difficult: 2km from a dirt road. Existing dirt road on 17km (from
                                         Milundikwa)
                                         Powerhouse access: Good: near the road
 Other comments                          Connection to Sumbawanga minigrid.
                                         A 1.150m long tunnel will allow to cross the hill on the right riverbank.
                                         No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                         The intake is not located at the dam position in order to reduce the tunnel
                                         length. Future studies should also consider a "canal option" and a "high weir" or
                                         "reservoir" option in order to locate the intake at a position which will allow to
                                         reduce the tunnel length.
                                         Site to be compared with Kilida, Lwiche, Muze and Nyembe sites in a
                                         prefeasibility study in order to define which one should be further developped to
                                         connect to Sumbawanga minigrid.

 Dam height [m]                           5
 Dam width [m]                           35
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                30
 Comments on solid transport            Limited quantities of sand on the river shores.
 Desilting basin size                   A medium sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             A surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   1.52 (1 penstock(s))

                                        No canal possible. Tunnel for 410m on the right river bank.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        Future studies could analyze a reservoir option, but storage capacity is limited by
                                        the topography.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Right bank canal following the river towards forebay and penstock descending to the powerhouse.

 Canal length [m]                      2,365
 Tunnel length [m]                       0
 Penstock length [m]                   1 x 287
 Dam type                              Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                          7
 Dam width [m]                          25
 Measured turbidity [NTU]               150
 Comments on solid transport           Sand and small stones (< 5cm).
 Desilting basin size                  A medium sand trap is required
 Surge tank                            No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                  0.70 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]          3.0
 Total road length to create [km]      1.8
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     3.0
 Potential impact of the scheme        Upstream: several houses and many fields flooded. Downstream: none.
 Comments on accessibility             Powerhouse accessible by 3km road next to power canal along hillside.
 Other comments                        To supply Ludewa mini-grid
                                       Canal on right river side, with several small thalwegs. Left river side impassable.
                                       No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                       In the light of the field observations, the design output calculated in the former
                                       study seems unrealistic.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme with canal, penstock and powerhouse on the right riverbank. The powerhouse is located close to
the beginning of the irrigation scheme so that water can directly be reinjected in that scheme.

 Canal length [m]                      1,018
 Tunnel length [m]                       0
 Penstock length [m]                   1 x1,381
 Dam type                              Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                          4
 Dam width [m]                           35
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                20
 Comments on solid transport           None
 Desilting basin size                  No sand trap is required
 Surge tank                            No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                  0.46 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]          3.0
 Total road length to create [km]      2.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     0.5
 Potential impact of the scheme        The irraigation scheme will be affected each time that no water is flowing
                                       through the powerhouse (e.g. for maintenance purposes). This could be
                                       mitigated if a by-pass is foreseen in the hydropower scheme.
 Comments on accessibility             Difficult access to the intake area as a forest needs to be crossed and no trail
                                       exists.
 Other comments                        -
                                       Canal at the right side of the river.
                                       No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                       An irrigation scheme exists downstream of the project area. The powerhouse
                                       location must be such that water is reinjected in the irrigation scheme.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Site probably less economicaly interresting given the hard access conditions and a small watershed leading to a limited
flow. A reservoir is not recommended given the solid transport. A long tailrace canal is foreseen so as to reduce the total
penstock length.

 Canal length [m]                         0
 Tunnel length [m]                      1,020
 Penstock length [m]                    1 x1,753
 Dam type                               Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           5
 Dam width [m]                           30
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                150
 Comments on solid transport            Heavy solid transport
 Desilting basin size                   A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             A surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   0.47 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]          60.0
 Total road length to create [km]       44.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      2.0
 Potential impact of the scheme         Limited
 Comments on accessibility              Weir access: Difficult: 4km from the road accros difficult terrain and heavy slopes
                                        Powerhouse access: Average: 2km from the road
 Other comments                         Connection to Sumbawanga minigrid.
                                        No canal possible, rather a tunnel on the right bank seems the only option.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        A reservoir option is not recommanded given the observed solid transport.
                                        Site to be compared with Chulu, Lwiche, Muze and Nyembe sites in a
                                        prefeasibility study in order to define which one should be further developped to
                                        connect to Sumbawanga minigrid.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
A reservoir scheme is not appropriate given the size of the site, hence the scheme is designed as a run of the river scheme.
A waterfall on a reduced stretch creates the head necessary for power production. Part of the riverflow is currently
diverted through a canal to feed an existing artisanal hydromill. The projected scheme consist in a traditional run of the
river scheme with canal, penstock and powerhouse on the right riverbank.

 Canal length [m]                         847
 Tunnel length [m]                         0
 Penstock length [m]                     1 x 255
 Dam type                                Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                            5
 Dam width [m]                             25
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                 150
 Comments on solid transport             Presence of sand in the water
 Desilting basin size                    A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                              No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                    0.85 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           10.0
 Total road length to create [km]        1.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]       1.0
 Potential impact of the scheme          Artisanal hydro mill on the site
 Comments on accessibility               Weir access: Good: 1km from the road
                                         Powerhouse access: Good: 1km from the road
 Other comments                          The transmission line for this scheme could be developped together with that for
                                         the Lumeme scheme and power the Mbinga mini-grid.
                                         -
                                         No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                         Lumeme scheme is located about 4km upstream of this site.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
This site is designed with a dam and a long canal going around the left hill bank towards the forebay. A short penstock goes
down to the powerhouse.
Although this site will be connected to Ludewa mini-grid, it is recommended to design it, in a first stage for and operating
discharge at Q_90% (instead of Q_50%) because the demand is currently too low.
Hence, the infrastructure (canal, forebay, penstock and powerhouse) should be designed at the maximum capacity but the
electromechanical equipments should be designed for Q_90% only. In a second time, when the demand will increase, the
site capacity could be increased by adding turbines in the powerhouse and using a larger part of the flow duration curve.

 Canal length [m]                        3,743
 Tunnel length [m]                         0

 Dam type                                Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                            6
 Dam width [m]                            25
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                200
 Comments on solid transport             Sand and small stones (< 5cm). Very high quantities of sand deposits.
 Desilting basin size                    A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                              No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   2.15 (4 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           30.0
 Total road length to create [km]        17.5
 Total road length to upgrade [km]       3.0
 Potential impact of the scheme          Upstream: small village flooded (<50 persons). Downstream: none.
 Comments on accessibility               Flat roads from Lifua village (for dam) and from Hiugai village (for powerhouse).
                                         A bridge will be necessary to ensure access to the powerhouse and dam areas.
 Other comments                          To supply Ludewa powered by thermal plant.
                                         Canal on the left river bank.
                                         Grid extension between Ludewa and Luifa is planned within 3 years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme that could benefit from Kitogota I regulation. A short canal and the penstock are located on the
right riverbank. The site is located close to a large waterfall (20m).
As crossing of the river is required (approximately at the dam location), future studies should analyze to possibility to create
a long masonery-faced earthfilled weir that would replace the existing bridge.

Type of scheme foreseen: Daily reservoir
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Daily reservoir that could serve to produce peak energy for the Bukoba minigrid. Water is diverted from the reservoir by a
low pressure pipe placed on support blocs on the right riverside. Then a surge chamber is provided and afterwards a high
pressure pipe will bring the water to the powerhouse. The daily regulation could also supply Kitogota Falls scheme which is
located further downstream.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
Very good site opportunity with one fall and several rapids on a short distance. The proposed layout is to construct a dam
at main water fall and to convey water to power house direct using a penstock pipe. However, the accurate location of
facilities must be carefully studied in order to find the best locations.The site is good opportunity for power generation,
though currently the river is dry but it has water for up to eigtht months of the year. An option with a storage dam should
be studied in the next stages but the sediment issue must be carrefully studied.

                                        No canal will be constructructed. The proposed design is to connect the
                                        penstock pipe directly to the dam to convey water to the turbines from the
                                        dam located on the right riverbank.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme with a low weir. Canal penstock and powerhouse are located on the left riverbank. If crossing of
the river is required, future studies should analyze the possibility to create a long masonery-faced earthfilled weir that
would serve both as crossing and as river diversion for the hydropower scheme.

 Canal length [m]                        947
 Tunnel length [m]                        0

                                        Canal at left side of the river then penstock.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        No large waterfalls were found, but many cascades.
                                        In the light of the field observations, the design discharge calculated in the
                                        former study seems unrealistic.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
This site is not favorable for hydropower production since no natural head is available. Altough the average river slope is
important inducing significant water velocities in the river, this slope would be difficult to use for hydropower purpose and
the only way to generate power is to create an artificial head with a weir.
However, given the existing solid transport, such a scheme might not be a good option.

                                         Site not favorable because only a dam might create the head, which is not
                                         recommended due to the important solid transport.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Site with an existing mechanical mill turbine that uses only part of the site potential. A new scheme consiting of a small
concrete dam and canal, penstock and powerhouse on the left bank (deep tributary on the right bank) can be created.
A daily reservoir could be considered but requests a impact analysis on upstream on irrigated area.

 Canal length [m]                       3,130
 Tunnel length [m]                        0
 Penstock length [m]                    1 x 526
 Dam type                               Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           3
 Dam width [m]                            10
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                 30
 Comments on solid transport            Low sediment load observed
 Desilting basin size                   A medium sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   0.56 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           3.0
 Total road length to create [km]       0.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      0.5
 Potential impact of the scheme         No or few environmental impact exept that an existing mill turbine is located at
                                        the dam site. A solution could be to foresee a dedicated flow for the mill turbine
                                        in the new scheme.
 Comments on accessibility              Access for both powerhouse and dam is very easy. The site is located 3.5 km
                                        from the A19.
 Other comments                         Line is supposed to be connected to the Mbinga/Songea mini-grid
                                        The feasibility study must analyse the option of trapezoidal earth or concrete
                                        lined canal strech (cheaper) in some part of the canal trace.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        Future studies should give a particular attention to the current use of the mill
                                        turbine and should make sure sufficient water is dedicated fot its use.

                                        Canal at left side of the river.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        In the light of the field observations and preliminary hydrological model, the
                                        design discharge calculated in the former study seems unrealistic.

                                        only). Powerhouse easily accessible from Lupingu. Weir access is extremely
                                        difficult: from powerhouse in Lupingu village, no road but accessible through
                                        mountain trail on foot, 2
 Other comments                         33kV to supply Ludewa mini-grid powered by Thermal plant. Or to supply
                                        Lupingo mission isolated grid (1.5 km)
                                        Tunnel on the right riverbank.
                                        Grid extension between Ludewa and Lupingu is planned within 3 years.
                                        In the light of the field observations, the design discharge calculated in the
                                        former study seems unrealistic.

                                        Canal at the left side of the river.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        Future studies should analyze the possibility to make use of lined channel with
                                        natural stones, plates or bricks with cement pointing instead of concrete canal.
                                        Although the sediment load in the river appears to be low, futur studies should,
                                        among others, focus on river basin protection measures and on sediment
                                        control.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
The river is part of an important drainage area. It goes 80m down on an escarpment before leaving it.

 Canal length [m]                       1,213
 Tunnel length [m]                        0
 Penstock length [m]                    3 x 166
 Dam type                               Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           7
 Dam width [m]                            50
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                200
 Comments on solid transport            Presence of sand, gravel and small stones, showing a high sediment activity. The
                                        watershed seems to be intensively cultivated and bare earth is visible.
 Desilting basin size                   A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   1.79 (3 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]          55.0
 Total road length to create [km]       3.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      22.0
 Potential impact of the scheme         Limited, since no reservoir is foreseen.
 Comments on accessibility              Weir access: Difficult: long unpaved road and then 4km offroad. A river to be
                                        crossed.
                                        Powerhouse access: Difficult: long unpaved road and then 4km offroad. A river to
                                        be crossed.
 Other comments                         -
                                        Canal at the right side of the river.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        A reservoir option is not recommanded given the topography of the site (too flat
                                        on top).

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Medium dam with canal and penstock along the right river bank to the powerhouse site.
Unfaforable site due to high level of sediment in the river.

 Canal length [m]                      1,636
 Tunnel length [m]                       0
 Penstock length [m]                   11 x 102
 Dam type                              Concrete dam
 Dam height [m]                         20
 Dam width [m]                          100
 Measured turbidity [NTU]               250
 Comments on solid transport           Sand only, high quantities.

 Total road length to upgrade [km]     1.5
 Potential impact of the scheme        None
 Comments on accessibility             Access road lenghts from Lupapilo village. Access from the south (Songea-Manda
                                       road) is probably easier but a bridge is required.
 Other comments                        To supply Mbinga and Songea mini-grids.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme with canal, penstock and powerhouse on the left river bank. It constitues the upstream site of a
cascade scheme with Luwika II.

 Canal length [m]                      1,730
 Tunnel length [m]                       0
 Penstock length [m]                   1 x 382
 Dam type                              Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                          6
 Dam width [m]                          50
 Measured turbidity [NTU]               200
 Comments on solid transport           Important solid transport
 Desilting basin size                  A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                            No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                  0.60 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]         45.0
 Total road length to create [km]      2.8
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     1.8
 Potential impact of the scheme        No or few environmental impact if no reservoir.
 Comments on accessibility             Moderate : 3.5 km walk from a correct trail (12 km from the A19) to be
                                       rehabilitated on certain parts. New access road of 2.8 km.
 Other comments                        Line is supposed to be connected to the Mbinga mini-grid.
                                       A tunnel alternative should be analyzed in further studies, especially if a large
                                       dam, intending for a regulation reservoir, is foreseen.
                                       An extension of the local grid (Songea) is under progress.
                                       A daily reservoir option (with a 8090m high dam) should be analyzed in furture
                                       studies.
                                       In the light of the field observations and preliminary hydrological model, the
                                       design discharge calculated in the former study seems unrealistic.

                                        As a cascade scheme, Luwika II requires Luwika I to be errected in a first time.
                                        As for Luwika I, the design discharge calculated in the former study seems
                                        unrealistic.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Daily reservoir
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
The river being dry during the dry season at the site, it has been designed as a seasonly reservoir to provide water at least
during part of the dry season. Downstream of this site is the Maparengi site (SF-069) which will benefits of the flow
regulation created by Luwila dam. In further studies, those two sites should be developped as a cascade scheme. The
scheme consists in a high dam with storage. The intake is located on the right riverbank and diverts water to a canal. The
forebay and penstock lead the water to the powerhouse located downstream.
Sediment issue is complex for this site and must be analized in details in the next study stages and this scheme sould be
analysed as a multi-purpose reservoir (irrigation, reservoir for livestock, hydropower).
Given the topography, it is probable that the reservoir will not have enough capacity to provide storage for the whole dry
season. Hence, it is probable that this scheme will only be operated part of the year. Moreover, the size of this scheme falls
out of the scope of private investors. It should be studied at a national level and included in a master plan if cost effective.

                                       of 450m to be the most optimal.
                                       No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Off-grid
Scheme description :
Many options are possible at this stage. In particular, the intake might be positionned at a different level, optimizing the
scheme with the topographical conditions and balancing with available head and discharge. The current scheme is
composed of both canal and tunnel on the right riverbank because of the high lateral slopes.

 Canal length [m]                        1,100
 Tunnel length [m]                       2,790
 Penstock length [m]                     1 x1,973
 Dam type                                Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                            10
 Dam width [m]                             40
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                 600
 Comments on solid transport             Significant solid transport and small stones are carried away.
 Desilting basin size                    A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                              A surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                    0.35 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           45.0
 Total road length to create [km]        22.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]       26.0
 Potential impact of the scheme          Water deviation on a long stretch
 Comments on accessibility               Weir access: Difficult: depending of the weir final position, its access might be
                                         very difficult because of the site topography.
                                         Powerhouse access: Difficult: the easiest way to access the powerhouse location
                                         is from the plain below.
 Other comments                          To supply Liuli and Mbamba Bay.
                                         Given the high lateral slopes, a canal seems difficult if the whole head is to be
                                         used. In that case, a tunnel is probably required.
                                         No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                         Given the high slope of the river, a dam would have a reduced impact, but the
                                         storage volume might be reduced as well. This must be further analyzed in the
                                         future studies.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Off-grid
Scheme description :
The river has no falls in the proposed location. The area surveyed is in the same level but one location is found to be
suitable but the head is very low. The site is designed as a run-of-the-river scheme with canal, penstock and powerhouse on
the left river bank. It must be noted that, as shown on the site layout representation, the river trace has changed since the
topographical maps were established. This site has a low potential for hydropower.
However, 2km upstream of the current site, the river passes through a very narrow valley. This shape is ideal for the
development of a large scheme with a storage reservoir (for daily or even seasonly operation). The dam could reach from
50m to 70m and the capacity would range from 5 MW to 25 MW (or even more, depending on the use). This is out of the
scope of the present atlas and should be analyzed in a detailed study.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river

                                         If Mfizi I, II and III were to be developped, it could be economically interesting to
                                         develop a 100km long transmission line to feed Mpanda minigrid and/or to
                                         connect Mpanda and Sumbawanga minigrids together.

                                         Powerhouse access: Difficult: 7km from the road
 Other comments                          Connection to Mpanda mini-grid and supply of the Katavi facilities. A 90 kV line
                                         should be foreseen.
                                         Canal on the left embankment, hard rock to be expected.
                                         No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                         If Mfizi I, II and III were to be developped, it could be economically interesting to
                                         develop a 100km long transmission line to feed Mpanda minigrid and/or to

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The river drops 30m in altitude falling down from the escarpment on the Lake Rukwa plains. It goes through a narrow gorge
making it impossible for a canal to be built.

 Canal length [m]                          0

 Measured turbidity [NTU]                500
 Comments on solid transport            Heavy solid transport including stones over 40cm.
 Desilting basin size                   A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             A surge tank is foreseen

                                        Powerhouse access: Average: 3km from the road
 Other comments                         Connection to Mpanda mini-grid and supply of the Katavi facilities. A 90 kV line
                                        should be foreseen.
                                        No canal possible, rather a tunnel on the left river side seems the only option.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The site is not extroardinary but easy to access and to construct. It could be interesting if made with economical technics
like concrete faced trapezoidal canal and masonery infrastructure. A masonery dam is suitable. The availability of rocks of
good quality must be verified. The scheme is developped on the right riverbank.

 Canal length [m]                       2,318
 Tunnel length [m]                        0

 Dam type                               Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           5
 Dam width [m]                            75

 Surge tank                             No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   2.07 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]          35.0
 Total road length to create [km]       3.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      2.3
 Potential impact of the scheme         No or few environmental impact
 Comments on accessibility              The dam access is only at a few meters from a relatively good trail that must be
                                        rehabilitated on certain streches.
                                        A track (2300 m) bording the canal trace should be easy to implement.
 Other comments                         The scheme could be connected to the local mini-grid Mbinga.
                                        An economy of scale concerning the trasmission line, construction costs and
                                        operation costs is foreseen if Mgaka I and Mgaka II are considered together.
                                        Future studies should consider the option of least cost canal streches in earth or
                                        lined channel with natural stones or concrete lining.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
Good site opportunity with one fall and several rapids on a short distance. The scheme requires a sand trap. The power
canal is located on the right bank and must cross a deep tributary (solution : bridge/canal). The accurate dam location and
height must be carefully studied in order to find the best locations for the canal and sand trap. If Mgaka II is considered to
work simultanously with Mgaka I, then a smaller sand trap could be considered (medium sand trap).

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Off-grid
Scheme description :
The site has enough head for power generation the only problem is water, the river is intermittent water is available during
rain season and most of the time the river is dry. The site has two small falls and there is existing weir in the falls for
supplying water in the village. The second falls is suitable for power generation when water is available.

 Comments on accessibility               The site is located at Mkalamo Village in Msangazi River. Mkalamo village is
                                         located about 52 kilometers from Mkata along Mkata –Pangani road. The site
                                         can easily be accessed but improvement in the access road to reach the site is
                                         necessary.The site is lo
 Other comments                          This site could supply the off-grid load center of Mkalamo.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme in a narrow site with rocky steep slopes but close to a truck road. Canal, penstock and powerhouse
on the left riverbank.

 Canal length [m]                       2,221
 Tunnel length [m]                        0
 Penstock length [m]                    1 x 641
 Dam type                               Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                           2
 Dam width [m]                            25
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                500
 Comments on solid transport            Sand and pebbles
 Desilting basin size                   A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                             No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                   1.28 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]           0.7
 Total road length to create [km]       0.5
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      0.5
 Potential impact of the scheme         None
 Comments on accessibility              Even if the intake is located close to the asphalted road, its access is difficult due
                                        to the steep slope.
 Other comments                         -
                                        Canal at the left side of the river (not easy with steep slope).
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        Special attention should be given to solid transport. The impact of such
                                        important solid transport can be mitigated by the use of both a gravel trap
                                        (before the intake) and desilting basin (just behing the intake). The dimensions of
                                        these should be defined based on the conclusion of a detailed solid transport
                                        analysis.

                                        Canal at right side of the river.
                                        No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                        Further studies should analyze the possibility of using an earthfill dam instead of
                                        a masonery dam. The weir could then be lined with stones and serve as crossing
                                        for vehicules.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Daily reservoir
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
A small head is found at the site, but the main advantage of this site is the topography that enables the creation of a
reservoir for seasonly purpose. This scheme sould be analysed as a multi-purpose reservoir (irrigation, reservoir for
livestock, hydropower). This site could be developped in cascade with Mponde II site (SF-067). Mponde I being designed as
a seasonly reservoir, it will create storage for both sites and enable water release even during the dry season and thus
enable power production during most time of the year.
Moreover, sediment issue is complex for this site and must be analized in details in the next study stages.
Given the topography, it is probable that the reservoir will not have enough capacity to provide storage for the whole dry
season. Hence, it is probable that this scheme will only be operated part of the year. Moreover, the size of this scheme falls
out of the scope of private investors. It should be studied at a national level and included in a master plan if cost effective.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The Muze river drops on the escarpment allowing a head of 420m. The river slope ahead of the weir position is too steep
for a reservoir to have enough volume, moreover a heavy solid transport is observed. Hence, a run of the river scheme is
designed on the right riverbank with a long canal followed by a penstock.

 Canal length [m]                      3,256
 Tunnel length [m]                       0
 Penstock length [m]                   1 x1,397
 Dam type                              Masonery dam
 Dam height [m]                          5
 Dam width [m]                          30
 Measured turbidity [NTU]               150
 Comments on solid transport           Significant sand transport
 Desilting basin size                  A large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                            No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                  0.76 (1 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]         34.0
 Total road length to create [km]      3.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     1.0
 Potential impact of the scheme        Limited
 Comments on accessibility             Weir access: Average: 2.5km to the road
                                       Powerhouse access: Good: 500m to the road
 Other comments                        Connection to Sumbawanga minigrid.
                                       Canal 3km long on the right riverbank, with some difficult stretches (feasibility to
                                       be assessed).
                                       No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                       This site could be connected to both national grid (34 km) or to the Sumbawanga
                                       minigrid (25 km). It should be compared with Chulu, Kilida, Lwiche and Nyembe
                                       sites in a prefeasibility study in order to define which one should be further
                                       developped to connect to Sumbawanga minigrid.

                                       Grid extension between Njombe and Songea, passing through Lilondo, planned
                                       within 3 years.
                                       This site is designed, in a first stage, as an offgrid site. In a second stage, when
                                       the demand of Mahanje will increase, the site could be adapted to use a larger
                                       part of the flow duration curve.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The Ngongi river runs along the road from Mbinga to Mbamba Bay, making this site accessible. The total water drop in
elevation from the weir position to the plain downstream is around 460m. However, given the difficult topography, this
height is difficult to use in a single scheme. Moreover, a 2-schemes option allows to increase the flow for the second intake
significantly (the capted watershed increases by 60%). The canal feasibility needs to be properly assessed, given the difficult
topographical conditions, and the final layout choosen accordingly.
Ngongi I is the most upstream scheme. It is a traditionnal run of the river scheme with the canal running on the right
riverbank and a small penstock feeding the powerhouse.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to a mini-grid
Scheme description :
The Ngongi river runs along the road from Mbinga to Mbamba Bay, making this site accessible. The total water drop in
elevation from the weir position to the plain downstream is around 460m. However, given the difficult topography, this
height is difficult to use in a single scheme. Moreover, a 2-schemes option allows to increase the flow for the second intake
significantly (the capted watershed increases by 60%). The canal feasibility needs to be properly assessed, given the difficult
topographical conditions, and the final layout choosen accordingly.
Ngongi II is the most downstream scheme. Canal, penstock and powerhouse are also placed on the right riverbank. The
powerhouse location is defined so as to limitate the penstock length. Hence a long tailrace canal is required.

 Canal length [m]                         1,820
 Tunnel length [m]                          0

 Measured turbidity [NTU]                  150
 Comments on solid transport              Significant solid transport
 Desilting basin size                     A large sand trap is required

                                          The canal alignment passes through parts of steep slopes and the possiblity of
                                          building a canal must be verified in further studies.
                                          No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.
                                          A reservoir alternative is topographically possible, but the transport solid is

 Other comments                        To supply Mbinga, Ludewa and Songea powered by thermal plant.
                                       No canal nor tunnel is required as the powerhouse is located at the toe of the
                                       dam.
                                       Grid extension between Ludewa and Luifa is planned within 3 years.

Scheme description :
The Samvya river drops on the escarpment, allowing a 85m gross head. A second waterfall lies below, with a head of 20m in
soft soils. The river flow is monitored and locals say it is in the pipe of REA project. this site is not favorable for a reservoir
because of the large valley.

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
This scheme is designed as a run-of-the-river scheme with canal, forebay, penstock and powerhouse on the right riverbank.
A small weir will divert water into the canal. Next studies should analyse the possibility of developping this scheme in
cascade with Sasimo II, which dam and intake are located some 300m downstream. The feasibility of a reservoir could be
analysed in further studies.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the main grid
Scheme description :
This site is located at Wami area about 2kms western of Wami Bridge along Arusha-Dar main road and Wami-Chalinze
water supply Station. The river has huge volume and is very wide. They are only very small falls in the river. Exact location
for the facilities need to be carefull studied in the future. Implementation of this site at the identified location will require
direct pipe with no canal due to the nature of the terrain.

 Canal length [m]                          659
 Tunnel length [m]                          0

 Dam width [m]                             40
 Measured turbidity [NTU]                 100
 Comments on solid transport              No sand deposites
 Desilting basin size                     A medium sand trap is required
 Surge tank                               No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter [m]                     3.5 (5 penstock(s))
 Transmission line length [km]             2.0
 Total road length to create [km]         2.0
 Total road length to upgrade [km]        2.0
 Potential impact of the scheme           Very minimal environmental impacts
 Comments on accessibility                The distances are calculated from the closest road, which is Dar-Arusha main
                                          road
 Other comments                           The site is located very close to national grid about 2 kilometers from the
                                          proposed power house location. The power can easily be connected to the
                                          National grid. The closest village is located about 6 kilometers from the site.
                                          Canal at left side of the river
                                          No future infractructure is foreseen in the coming years.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the grid
Scheme description :
Run of the river scheme, located in the vicinity of a medium waterfall, designed with a small concrete weir on a
unpopulated site. Canal, penstock and powerhouse are located on the right riverbank.

 Canal length [m]                      1,050
 Tunnel length [m]                     -

 Dam type                              Concrete dam
 Dam height [m]                        4
 Dam width [m]                         95
 Measured turbidity [NTU]              200
 Comments on solid transport           Important
 Desilting basin size                  Large sand trap is required
 Surge tank                            No surge tank is foreseen
 Penstock diameter Q95 [m]             1.4 (1 penstock)
 Penstock diameter Q50 [m]             1.6 (3 penstocks)
 Transmission line length [km]         2.0
 Total road length to create [km]      0.7
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     1.0
 Potential impact of the scheme        There are two intakes for irrigation purposes located in the River stretch capted
                                       by the hydropower scheme. A part of the water must be left in the River for the
                                       irrigation.
 Comments on accessibility             The access to the site is easy.
 Other comments                        The left side of the dam location is very flat. To avoid extra construction costs,
                                       the dam must be designed to let the water flows in the plain located on the left
                                       bank during high flood (return period >25 years). The intake site is located close
                                       to an Island which should simplify the construction of the dam with the
                                       possibility to easily divert the water.
                                       The intake and desilting basin must be carefully design. We recommend that the
                                       feasibility study includes a solid transport study.

5. Hydrological data

A flow duration curve is given in the IED’s prefeasibility study of this site but cannot be used. Indeed, the catchment area of
the site used to the statistical analysis is twice as small as the actual area (checked with topographical data and satellite
imagery). Consequently, a flow duration curve was recalculated.

These parameters were defined by regionalization. These preliminary values are only indicative. They might in no case be
used for detailed design.

 Potential impact of the scheme         There are no observed impact of the scheme.
 Comments on accessibility              The access to the site is easy both for the powerhouse and the weir.
 Other comments                         The weir and intake will be at Mlalo wher the drop starts. The penstock
                                        contruction might be uneasy. The feasibility study must carefully locate the weir
                                        elevation in order to localize the canal under the existing road.
                                        There is a risk of very low flow (or no flow) during dry season because of the
                                        upstream irrigation levy.
                                        The intake and desilting basin must be carefully design. We recommend that the

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the grid
Scheme description :
The existing study proposes to connect the Mpwampwa village with the proposed hydropower scheme. However, given the
limited demand for power and energy in the village and the potential of the proposed hydropower scheme, it appears more
relevant to connect it to the main grid.
The layout recommended in the context of this study is similar to the one proposed in the existing study. The intake would
be positioned slightly upstream compared to originally foreseen in the existing study. Also, given the steep slopes on both
banks of the river (the right bank being slightly gentler), it is recommended that the waterway from the intake starts
directly with a penstock to continue down to the powerhouse.

 Comments on solid transport            Although the low population density, parts of the watershed seem to be exposed
                                        to erosion given the hilly areas where the cultivation takes place, especially near
                                        the river. At the scheme site, a homemade canal was observed to irrigate some
                                        fields along the river.
                                        The water itself is not clear, even though at the time visit, the water level was
                                        historically low according to local people (October 2016, el nino effects were
                                        systematically reported during this mission).
                                        Heavy solid transport is suspected during rainy season.

 Total road length to create [km]       7.5

 Potential impact of the scheme         No major impact has been noticed at this stage, as long as the ecological issues
                                        are being dealt with (fish ladder, ecological flow during dry season).
 Comments on accessibility              Access is quiet difficult due to the long distance between Mwpampwa and the
                                        main road (Mbeya – Dar Es Salaam), and the distance between Mpwampwa and
                                        the site. Morever, we need to walk more than 4km to reach the site and the
                                        intake site is located in a narrow and hilly valley.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the grid
Scheme description :
The existing study proposes to connect the Ilula village with the proposed hydropower scheme. However, given the limited
demand for power and energy in the village and the potential of the proposed hydropower scheme, it appears more
relevant to connect it to the main grid.
It worth mentioning that the river was dry at the time of visit (October 2016). A detailed hydrological study should be
carried out to better understand the hydrological behavior of the river and hence the reasons why the river was dry (El-
Niño climatic event, upstream water abstractions). Without such a detailed hydrological study that would confirm the
availability of water throughout the year, this site is not recommended for hydropower development.
The following technical description is therefore given for indicative purpose only should a detailed hydrological study
confirms the favorable availability of water resources.
The layout recommended in the context of this study differs from the one originally presented in the existing study: Instead
of using a penstock from the intake to the powerhouse, a canal to the forebay is recommended. One of the main challenge
will be to deal with the TanZam road which lies along the canal for over 600m, and eventually crosses the penstock.
Another site, the SF-083 is located just downstream of the M-232

 Dam width [m]                           30
 Comments on solid transport             The river was dry at the time of visit, but it is suspected that solid transport is
                                         significant given the agriculture activities on steep slopes along the river
                                         upstream of the site.

 Potential impact of the scheme          Moderate. Hydrological issues are already being reported (see above).
 Comments on accessibility               The accessibility is excellent. The site crosses the major road.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the grid
Scheme description :
The existing study proposes to connect the Mahenge village with the proposed hydropower scheme. However, given the
limited demand for power and energy in the village and the potential of the proposed hydropower scheme, it appears more
relevant to connect it to the main grid.
The intake would be positioned upstream of a little gorge at the beginning of the waterfall. The intake would there be
founded on hard rock. It will divert the water directly to the tunnel.
Given the steep slopes on both sides of the river, we considered a tunnel to bypass the cliffs. However, an alternative
layout featuring a canal/penstock could be considered if the design flow is low enough. The powerhouse would be located
at the bottom of the cliffs.

 Canal length [m]                      0
 Tunnel length [m]                     1,750
 Penstock length [m]                   1,125
 Dam type                              Masonery
 Dam height [m]                        2
 Dam width [m]                         15
 Comments on solid transport           Although agricultural activities are scarce upstream of the site, and population
                                       density low, bush fires appear to occur regularly, exposing the soils to erosion.
                                       The water was not quite clear, despite the low flow (very low due to el nino
                                       effect and the dry season, October 2016)
 Desilting basin size                  Large

 Transmission line length [km]         8
 Total road length to create [km]      8.7
 Total road length to upgrade [km]     6
 Potential impact of the scheme        No major impact has been noticed at this stage, as long as the ecological issues
                                       are later verified and considered (fish ladder, ecological flow during dry season).
 Comments on accessibility             The accessibility is good, the site being located 6km away from the main Tanzam
                                       road.

                                       and given the head (around 7m) of the site, impacts on wears should be reduced
                                       with some precaution on desilting basin and flow control during floods.

3. Technical data

Type of scheme foreseen: Run of the river
Type of connection: Connected to the grid
Scheme description :
The existing study proposes to connect the Tawa village with the proposed hydropower scheme. However, given the
limited demand for power and energy in the village and the potential of the proposed hydropower scheme, it appears more
relevant to connect it to the main grid.
Compared to the existing study, the scheme considered here would maximize the available head. It is not considered that a
second intake on the Mfisigo tributary would be a major added value due to its relatively low flow as compared to the
additional works and costs required.
The proposed scheme would feature a 2.5km long canal that would carry the water to a 250m long tunnel followed by a
710m long penstock.

 Canal length [m]                       2,500
 Tunnel length [m]                      250
 Penstock length [m]                    755
 Dam type                               Masonery
 Dam height [m]                         2
 Dam width [m]                          25
 Comments on solid transport            Sediment transport is an issue given the fact that a significant part of the
                                        watershed is densely cultivated on steep slopes.
 Desilting basin size                   Large
 Surge tank                             -
 Penstock diameter Q95 [m]              0.2 (1 penstock)
 Penstock diameter Q50 [m]              0.4 (1 penstock)
 Transmission line length [km]          12
 Total road length to create [km]       4
 Total road length to upgrade [km]      21
 Potential impact of the scheme         No major impact has been noticed at this stage, as long as the ecological issues
                                        are being dealt with (fish ladder, ecological flow during dry season).
 Comments on accessibility              Accessibility is an issue. Once we leave Morogoro, the road becomes quite rough.
                                        At the time of visit, road works were being conducted on the road. The road
                                        becomes worse once we take the rural road towards Tawa.
 Other comments                         An automated flow measuring gauge has been found on the site, but no relevant
                                        information was available from the local people.
