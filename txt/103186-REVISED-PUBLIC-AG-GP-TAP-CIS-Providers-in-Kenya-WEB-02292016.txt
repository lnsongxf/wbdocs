EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Agriculture is a major driver of the Kenyan economy, contributing 54 percent to the
national gross domestic product (GDP) and accounting for 65 percent of total export
earnings. Kenya’s GDP growth is highly correlated with the sector’s performance,
and its performance is highly volatile. The frequency and intensity of severe weather
events has increased, and will be further exacerbated as a result of climate change.
The country’s overwhelming reliance on rain-fed agricultural production systems ren-
ders it highly vulnerable to food supply disruptions and shortages.

Climate information services (CIS) include immediate and short-term weather fore-
casts and advisories and longer-term information about new seeds and technologies
and market developments. CIS is especially useful in helping farmers to manage risks
in what is already an exceptionally risky sector in which to operate, and in oﬀsetting
much of the uncertainty that so often constrains decision making and innovation. CIS
is a relatively new area in extension service delivery. Case studies reported on in this
report reveal that only a small number of Kenyan farmers currently access CIS.

The World Bank, in partnership with the Finance Innovation for Climate Change
Fund (FICCF) of the Department for International Development (DFID) and the
Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD), collaborated in mapping the CIS provid-
ers in Kenya. The overall goal was to review the current capabilities for providing user-
centered climate information and related services, and to make recommendations for
improvement accordingly. The mapping exercise was carried out in ﬁve steps:
     1. Review concepts and framework, and deﬁnitions of terminologies.
     2. Conduct initial stakeholder analysis to develop a preliminary list of possible
        climate service providers and purveyors.
     3. Administer questionnaires and interview service providers to obtain further
        data and validate information on the nature of CIS institutions, data process-
        ing techniques, service portfolios, information delivery mechanisms, and busi-
        ness approaches.
     4. Host knowledge- and information-sharing workshop to further deliberate sur-
        vey ﬁndings and share expertise and experience in CIS provision.
     5. Prepare a report with recommendations for scaling up CIS services in Kenya.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is a major driver of the Kenyan economy, contributing 27 percent to the
national GDP directly, a further 27 percent through manufacturing, distribution, and
service sectors. It accounts for 65 percent of Kenya’s total export earnings and gener-
ates roughly 60 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings. The sector employs
more than 75 percent of Kenya’s workforce and generates most of the country’s food
requirements, playing a key role in poverty reduction. Smallholder farms account for
85 percent of employment and 75 percent of total agricultural output.

Kenya’s GDP growth is highly correlated with the agricultural sector’s performance,
which is highly volatile (ﬁgure 1.1). Extreme weather events, largely droughts and to a
lesser extent ﬂoods, have been the principal driver of agricultural volatility in Kenya.
The frequency and intensity of severe weather events has increased, and will be fur-
ther worsened in the future as temperatures increase with climate change. Recurring
drought has profound eﬀects on the agricultural sector, particularly in maize and live-
stock production systems. Frequent drought events result in precipitous crop losses,
livestock deaths, spikes in food prices, increased food insecurity and malnutrition for
the poor, and rural population displacement (World Bank, 2014).

Kenya’s strong reliance on rain-fed agricultural production systems has rendered
the country increasingly vulnerable to food supply disruptions and shortages. Amid
declining yields, productivity gains have come largely through land expansion into
marginal areas that receive lower and more variable rainfall. This has contributed to a
growing structural deﬁcit in food production. Extensive livestock systems and pastoral-
ism in Kenya’s northern rangelands are also particularly vulnerable to the eﬀects of
drought. Emergency food aid and other ex post responses have helped fuel growing
dependency and declining resilience, particularly among the poorest and especially in
arid and semi-arid lands.

Meeting the challenges of the agriculture sector will require both investments in build-
ing resilience to near-term shocks and in adapting to long-term climate change. In this
context, providing farmers with timely and highly practical information will be crucial.

Climate1 is usually deﬁned as the average weather condition, or more rigorously, as
the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities
over a period of time ranging from months to thousands of years. The World Meteo-
rological Organization (WMO) often deﬁnes a period of 30 years. The inﬂuence of
temporal and spatial scales on the state of the atmosphere has implications for observ-
ability and predictability of weather and climate, and for the design of climate infor-
mation services (CIS) (ﬁgure 2.1).

Weather is the atmospheric condition in a given place, including variables such as
temperature, rainfall, wind, or humidity.

Climate change refers to a statistically signiﬁcant variation in either the mean state
of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades
or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forces,
or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in
land use. However, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) emphasizes the anthropogenic forcing and deﬁnes climate change as a
change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters
the composition of the global atmosphere and that occurs in addition to natural cli-
mate variability observed over comparable time periods.

Climate prediction or forecast is the result of an attempt to produce a most likely
description or estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future, for exam-
ple, at seasonal, inter-annual, or long-term time scales.

Climate projection is the response of the climate system to emission or concentra-
tion scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing scenarios, often

BOX 2.2. AGRO-WEATHER TOOLS FOR ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE FOR EMBU
    The initial project-scoping mission involved substantial consultations with stakeholders and potential collaborators. A total of 63
    farming institution representatives were consulted through side meetings and workshop. The smallholder farming community was
    also involved in a participatory process with a mission team validation meeting held in Embu County. This was aimed at assessing
    the institutional capacity, community needs and readiness to try diﬀerent climate change adaptation strategies in their farming
    operations. Development of the Agroweather Decision Support followed a systematic process as outlined in ﬁgure B2.2.1. The
    consultative approach involving both the public and private sector ensures that the right climate information is delivered to the
    farmers.

    CIS eﬀectively enabled farmers to make appropriate decisions in their choice of varieties. It was highly useful in mak-
    ing and complementing recommendations about which farm inputs to use. It was used to good advantage by extension
    services and farmer organizations, resulting in higher rates of adoption of new varieties and practices. Because of the
    marked diﬀerence between project participants and nonparticipants, the interest that CIS stimulated among other
    producers generated beneﬁts that spilled over into the entire local farming community.

    The impacts of a failed season in which there was insuﬃcient water to meet crop requirements, leading to lower yields
    despite increased labor inputs, were more pronounced on nonbeneﬁciaries, who were markedly less prepared to adapt
    to weather variability. CIS has a remarkable impact on crop yields and income. In Embu, farmers with access to agro-
    weather information (beneﬁciaries) recorded an average maize yield of 970 kilograms (kg) per hectare compared with
    210 kg per hectare for nonbeneﬁciaries. The average income from maize for the beneﬁciaries was 9,402 Kenya shil-
    lings (K Sh) compared with K Sh 3,918 for nonbeneﬁciaries (Braimoh et al. 2015).

CHAPTER THREE
FINDINGS FROM THE SURVEYS
The results reported in this chapter are for 29 climate information services (CIS) pro-
viders that completed the questionnaire and provided information through phone
interviews or follow-up face-to-face meetings.

NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATION
OF CIS PROVIDERS
Most respondents that completed the questionnaires were from private sector organi-
zations, accounting for 27 percent of the service providers. Government agencies and
NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs) each accounted for 21 percent of the
total; research and academia constituted 17 percent whereas international organiza-
tions constituted 14 percent, as shown in the ﬁgure 3.1.

CIS providers relate their organizational structure, functions, and services to a guiding
mandate, vision, or mission and related goals and objectives. Apparent in the mission
statements are motivations such as safety of citizens, protection of property, support
for economic growth and eﬃciency, and core activities within climate services such
as adaptation and disaster risk reduction. These objectives guide the production and
delivery components of CIS, which are apparently guided by the priorities and bound-
aries of the communities they are required and intended to serve.

Climate information is primarily an international public good and governments have a
central role in its management (Lúcio and Head 2012). Consequently, the Kenya Mete-
orological Department (KMD) is the national meteorological agency mandated to col-
lect and store climate data in the country. KMD is also charged with coordinating and
managing the climate information provision framework. Currently, KMD undertakes
data collection through its own climate observing stations and also through collabora-
tion with other institutions and volunteer observers. However, in the context of CIS
there are other producers, for example, the Intergovernmental Authority on Develop-
ment Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC) and the African Centre of
Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD). Some other organizations
are producers and as well as users: the Food and Agriculture Organization (of the UN)

BOX 3.1. WEATHER DATA COLLECTION IN KENYA
   KMD has the largest weather infrastructure operation and maintains 36 synoptic stations countrywide that provide data on rain-
   fall, minimum and maximum temperatures, wind speed and direction, air pressure, soil temperature, solar radiation, sunshine
   duration, relative humidity, evaporation, and cloud cover. It also has four marine tidal gauges with automatic meteorological
   sensors to monitor ocean tides and waves, including tsunamis. The data collected can also be used to study sea level rise associ-
   ated with global warming. These data are crucial in providing information to support decision making in adaptation planning for
   coastal zone management.

   There are other specialized observing stations operated by KMD that include 24 automatic weather stations (AWSs) that auto-
   matically record climate data and transmit them to receiving stations at KMD; 3 airport weather observing systems (AWOSs) at
   Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Wilson Airport, and Mombasa International Airport that are able to detect and monitor
   hazards associated with extreme weather events; 17 hydro-meteorological automatic weather stations that have been installed in
   water catchments; 4 lightning and thunderstorm detection systems at Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret to provide severe
   weather warnings, especially for aviation safety. KMD in collaboration with other international climate centers also operates 3
   satellite receiving stations, 2 for Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and 1 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
   tration (NOAA) satellites, that receive global data on large-scale systems such as sea surface temperatures and wind ﬁelds. Every
   day, massive amounts of data are collected and stored at Kenya Meteorological Department. Unfortunately, the general public for
   whose beneﬁt the weather services are oﬀered have generally remained unaware of the services.

   KMD has been the only national institution that has provided climate information for a long period but new initiatives have been
   established within the past few years owing to Kenya’s relative advantage in establishing robust and dynamic private sector–driven
   climate information services. This is also supported by the existence of a stable national metrological agency rich in historical
   climate and weather data and the presence of regional meteorological agencies whose headquarters are in Nairobi, such as the
   Intergovernmental Authority of Development Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) and Regional Centre for
   Mapping of Resources for Development.

   Apart from KMD, there are observers (individuals or institutions) who make climate notations voluntarily and transmit the data to
   KMD for use and storage. The majority of these observers collect rainfall data only because of the simplicity of doing so. A few
   also take temperature measurements. At present, there are about 3,000 volunteer observers registered by KMD who are located in
   various parts of the country, although not all of them collect and transmit the data to KMD on a regular basis as required. These
   data form a very useful supplement to the normal climate observation network because they increase the coverage of rainfall data
   that is critical for assessment of climate risks, especially for the agriculture and water sectors.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study highlights development in the climate information services (CIS) ﬁeld in
Kenya in the past few years. There is a preponderance of private sector entities in the
ﬁeld relative to public institutions. The market is well diﬀerentiated with products and
services targeting speciﬁc users. The diversity of data, services, and service delivery
through diﬀerent channels further provides evidence of a reasonable level of aware-
ness of the importance of CIS for climate adaptation, not only in the agricultural
sector but also in other sectors serving agriculture. It also suggests some understanding
of the elements of the design and delivery of CIS products and delivery. However,
an outstanding challenge is the absence of a framework to properly downscale CIS,
evaluate the quality of the services, eﬀectively deliver the downscaled services, and
elicit relevant feedback from end users. There is also limited coordination in the CIS
ﬁeld with the implication that the much needed collaboration to enhance CIS design
and delivery is missing. Sustainably scaling up CIS based on good science, improved
governance, and appropriate business models is urgently required. Over the past few
years since climate-smart agriculture (CSA) became a priority among development
community, we are starting to see solutions emerge to each of these challenges, which
taken together suggest a program for change. For the desired changes to take place
there is an urgent need to address the policy, legal, and regulatory constraints that
hinder innovation in CIS provision.

Given the ﬁndings from the study, ﬁve recommendations are made:


Recommendation 1: Improve technical and institutional capacity
There is a need for institutional reform to enable the Kenya Meteorological Depart-
ment (KMD) to adjust to the new demands that climate change is placing on its ser-
vices. There is a need to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for KMD
operations, including extending expertise within its management to include business
development capabilities. New business models will need to be introduced and public-
private partnerships enhanced (see Recommendation 5). As KMD is the main pro-
vider of CIS, its institutional performance can be enhanced through staﬀ training,
introducing business development experts, retraining, and professional development.
