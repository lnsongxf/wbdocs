   Box 1.1. Some research caveats

   The case selection and research methodology do not claim to be representative: further
   research is required. This work can be considered a starting point. Research is based on a restricted
   number of projects and sectors. The case studies and research questions were developed inductively
   and aimed to address important gaps in the current understanding of how service delivery progress
   happens in the case study contexts (see chapter 2). The ultimate goal was to begin addressing these
   gaps and to identify patterns for further investigation and corroboration (see chapter 8). That said, the
   findings are triangulated with the national and global evidence base in order to increase the generaliz-
   ability of the claims made. Indeed, generating a statistically representative (so-called âlarge Nâ) sample
   in such contexts, given the security and financial implications, is a perennial challenge.

   The report does not claim to offer an exhaustive view of all the factors that affect progress
   in service delivery in violent contexts. The focus on forms of settlement, violence, bargains, and
   service delivery does not mean that other factors (such as beneficiary participation, service provider
   incentives, and the technical quality of services, among others) are unimportant. These four dimensions
   emerged as important for filling the gaps and inadequacies in the global and country literature. This
   offers a different perspective on why things work, or do not. As noted above, this should stimulate
   further debate.

   The study does not explore the impact of SSD on peace- or state-building, or on the causes
   of fragility. The focus of this research is the âhow toâ of delivering services in the presence of vio-
   lence, and it explores the delivery of services as a goal in its own right. It does not address the question
   of whether or how service delivery may contribute to, or undermine, state-building, peace-building,
   or conditions of fragility. As an aside, we think that the link between SSD and state legitimacy is too
   indirect and broad to provide granular, day-to-day guidance for policy makers and practitioners on the
   ground. The assumption that delivering basic services contributes to state-building outcomes appears
   with a striking degree of regularity in the literature even though on-the-ground empirical evidence
   supporting or undermining this link is very thin (Carpenter, Slater, and Mallett 2012; Haar and Ruben-
   stein 2012).

   The report does not endorse the studied armed elites nor does it necessarily condone the
   observed collusion between these groups and service providers. Whatever views about armed
   groups are presented in the report come from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and
   related literature. What the report does point to, however, is the need to accept that local âunsavoryâ
   bargains are sometimes necessary to deliver humanitarian and development assistance in these contexts.

   Box 3.1. Nepalâs shift toward inclusion shapes social service delivery

   An increasingly inclusive form of political settlement emerged during and after the Maoist insurgency. The war
   and political violence appear to have influenced the motivations of decision makers within the ruling coalition to
   address inequalities in the polity. This shift created space and mechanisms at the national and local levels for more
   inclusive service delivery. In this instance, political violenceâalthough it created many negative impactsâcannot
   be characterized as simply âdevelopment in reverse.â

   The forging of this new, fluid, and unstable political settlement was punctuated by measures and agreements rein-
   forcing inclusiveness. A series of agreements culminated in declarations in the Comprehensive Peace Accord from
   both sides of their âdetermination for a progressive restructuring of the state to resolve existing problems in the
   country, based on class, caste, region, and sexâa and in the 2007 interim constitution, which recognizes women,
   Dalits, Janajatis, and Madhesisâin addition to peasants and laborersâas groups that require special attention.b

   These shifts filtered down into various measures. In 1991, the health ministry introduced the National Health
   Policy, which focused on outreach to vulnerable groups, women, children, rural populations, the poor, and the
   marginalized.c There were impacts to local operational mechanisms for public goods delivery that were focused on
   increasing the involvement of local bodies and communities in the planning, implementation, and management of
   local-level development activities, such as the 1999 Local Self-Governance Act.d

   The shift at the center did not solve all of the countryâs issues around inclusion but did translate into more inclusive
   service delivery structures, which then impacted service delivery. A short survey of groups typically excluded from
   health services, conducted for this study, points to a longer-term shift on the ground (World Bank and SSB 2016):

   â¢	 Seventy-five percent of respondents reported using services provided by the local health-care post and/or pri-
      mary health-care center;

   â¢	 Ninety-four percent said they used government facilities more often than they had 10 years back;

   â¢	 Fifty-six percent felt health services had improved; and

   â¢	 Fifty-five percent of Dalit respondents felt that the behavior of the health personnel had changed for the better.e

   b. See Article 11(3) of the 1990 constitution and 13(3) of the 2007 interim constitution.
   c. The National Health Policy extended the modern health-care system to the rural population by making the sector more decentralized and
   regionalized (MoHP 1991). Successive government health plans and policies that focused on outreach to vulnerable groups, the poor, and the
   marginalized included the Second Long Term Health Plan (1997â2017), Health Sector Strategy: An Agenda for Reform (2003), the Tenth
   Five-Year Plan (2002â07) and the Three-Year Interim Plan (2007/08â2009/10).
   d. Other local operational mechanisms included increased emphasis on bringing the poor and marginalized groups into the development
   mainstream as well as various measures adopted by the government to support more inclusive government, most notably by reserving 45
   percent of all government jobs for excluded groups.

   Box 3.2. Political settlements in Afghanistanâs education and health sectors

   The elite balance of power, interests, and incentives in Afghanistanâs education sector, combined with blurred po-
   litical and bureaucratic boundaries, influences the selection of school locations, the number of schools built in each
   province or district, and the hiring of staff. Key findings include the following.

   Vote bank. Even though the Ministry of Education is the âlargest single civilian employer in the country,â it is
   sometimes treated as a âvote bank.â As one informant expresses it:

      âEducation in particular . . . is very interesting, as it is one of the largest employers in the country. For instance,
      in election campaigns, it is an extremely useful ministry to have. If you want, you can instruct all teachers to
      campaign for certain candidates; you can instruct them to tell students to tell their parents . . .â (KL: KIIâ44)

   Recruitment. Although the Ministry of Education in general and the Education Quality Improvement Project
   (EQUIP) in particular are supposed to abide by certain criteria in terms of recruitment,Â cases of nepotistic recruit-
   ments are reported (KL: KIIâ37 and 43). Another national program implementer admits that while hiring people
   without adequate qualifications compromises the quality of education service delivery, it is nonetheless necessary
   (KL: KIIâ37).

   Patronage pyramids. The existence of patronage pyramids is alleged, where each bureaucratic layer sells positions
   to the layer below, and the bottom layer regularly demands payments from the beneficiaries (teachers, students, and
   even parents). According to an international researcher:

      âEverything is the same everywhere; if you want the job of provincial director of education, youâll have to
      pay someone, thatâs for sure. You will not get the job without paying . . . How do they get reimbursed? Well,
      they will make sure that all the people who work for them collect money for them. Through this, they get
      reimbursed for the investment that they made to get the position of provincial director [of education]. How
      do these people get money [referring to those below the level of the provincial director]? From the students,
      from the parents, from the teachers . . .â (KL: KIIâ45)

   Diversion to certain areas. Local political elites such as Members of Parliament (MPs) and power brokers play a
   role in shaping how education services are distributed. One national program implementer, referring to some MPs,
   remarked, âThey have facilitated [the delivery of education services] in the sense that there are now more education
   service deliveries in their respective areas. They did not equally distribute the education services; more are found in
   their areasâ (KL: KIIâ37; also, KL: KIIâ34 to 37). The leverage of politicians and local power brokers is enhanced
   by the fact that, historically, the Afghan government had difficulties with communities not previously exposed to
   state education (Giustozzi 2010).Â 

                                                                                                                     (continued)

Box 3.2. Continued

Creating rent opportunities. Interviews with key study participants suggest that the emphasis on school con-
struction is driven, at least in part, by the need to maintain and expand patronage networks: construction projects
provide greater opportunities for rents than soft investments (KL: KIIâ45 and 50). EQUIP Iâs implementation
review hints at this, but does not allude to the political drivers: it notes that infrastructure grants are an area where
âfinancial overcommitmentsâ were made (World Bank 2009: 4).

Patronage politics. Similarly, the health sector is not immune to the impact of patronage politics.Â Actors well con-
nected to the ruling elite manipulate the allocation of resources to favor their power bases, resulting in the unequal
distribution of health resources between provinces and districts because better-connected politicians and power
brokers can lobby more effectively (KL: KIIâ53; KL: KIIâ47). One study participant puts it this way:

   âIf you go to some provinces, you will see two clinics in one village, but another village does not have one.
   In [so-and-soâs, naming a particular Member of Parliament] district, there are many clinics, but in the other
   districts of the same province, which do not have a good connection with a powerholder, there is not a single
   clinic.â (KL: KIIâ53)



          believes this is why some are skeptical of the      the âfailure to devolve sufficient authority, ex-

   Box 3.3. Relationships between elites shapes delivery of polio services

   Delivering polio eradication services is more challenging in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) than
   in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, partly due to the different relationships each region has with the central state. FATA has
   long had a tenuous relationship with the state, and following a 2002 military intervention, its governance structures
   were dissolved. A series of central government military operations to destroy local militia and insurgent groups were
   only partially successful. This in turn has further isolated the region from the rest of Pakistan.

   Khyber Pakhtunkhwaâs links to the central government are comparatively stronger. The public participates in the
   local, provincial, and central legislature through elections. There is state patronage, particularly in the roads and
   electricity sectors, whereas it is virtually nonexistent in FATA. Interviewees suggest that the delivery structures are
   more contested and complex in FATA because of these differences, which makes it much more challenging to strike
   or to maintain service delivery bargains.

   Another difference between the two regions is in the forms of violence and objectives of violent actors (see chapter 4).

Box 3.4. Central-subnational linkages and service delivery in Afghanistan

Diverse networks
The diversity among the linkages and relationships between provincial elites and those in Kabul is significant. Each
province has a unique set of formal and informal relationships with the central government, which appears to sig-
nificantly impact social service delivery.

Balkh. This province is characterized by a stable provincial settlement centered on a charismatic and resourceful
strongman: Provincial Governor General Atta Mohammed Noor. The general has established an influential power
base and positive linkages with the capital, giving the province more privileged access to Kabul-based ministers and
senior civil servants.

Wardak. Some Wardak elites have obtained prestigious appointments in Kabul, and the main provincial-level
networks have been nationally integrated, at least to a degree. The networks operate as quasi-political parties, and
they are relatively well organized. They run the province through their local associates who control the machinery
of government at the provincial and district levels.

Badghis. Widely seen as strategically unimportant, Badghis is economically underdeveloped andÂ subject to
fluidÂ secondaryÂ political settlements because of the unstable relationships between its various strongmen. As a result,
the province is unable to effectively lobby Kabul or form strong alliances with actors who are part of the primary
elite bargain.

   Impact on service delivery
   A background country report (World Bank and AREU 2016) illustrates how the relationship between the subna-
   tional and central actors in each of the three provinces shapes the quality and quantity of its social services. The
   weak relationship between the provincial settlement in Badghis and the primary (central) one, in addition to its
   under representation in Kabul, negatively affects its opportunities for social service delivery. Badghis is not consid-
   ered strategic by the Kabul-based elite. In the words of one key informant:

   âIf you look at it, it is far from Kabul, and unlike Herat and Faryab, it is not in a position to create problems for those
   in the center. So yes, it is left out. Also, it is not significant in terms of border relations, and there are no connecting
   roads leading to Kabul ... It is not that politically significant.â (KL: KIIâ49)

   Another informant noted that the lack of powerful provincial warlords left them at a disadvantage: âIf we had those
   kinds of powerful warlords, then the central government would have feared them and our province would have
   received attentionâ (BS: IDIâ33).

   Interviewees noted that Kabulâs perceived lack of interest in Badghis is one explanation for the poor level of ser-
   vices in the province, including a higher student-teacher ratio and a shortage of school buildings compared with
   Wardak. The reported sense of neglect spills into the health sector as well, with some interviewees noting a lack of
   qualified personnel, insufficient supplies, and poor quality of medicine (BS: IDIâ31). Balkh, however, has managed
   to secure a more significant share of resources and linkages with Kabul, compared to Badghis.

   Wardak also suffers from a lack of local resources, but because it is closer to Kabul, the province enjoys privileged
   access to higher education and career opportunities in the capital and elsewhere.

Box 3.5. Subnational settlements in Nepal help explain SSD outcomes

Our research suggests that a combination of organizational and programmatic factors explain why in the postcon-
flict period in Nepal, the health and roads sectors in the Tarai performed more poorly than those in the hill and
mountain regions. The Maoist hill and mountain areas are very different than the Tarai in terms of the nature of
their subnational political settlements, political organizations, and agendas of political party elites (see map 2.3 for
ecological zones).

Hill and mountain regions
The postconflict settlement in the hill and mountain regions is relatively stable, and organized around the program-
matic party of the Maoists, who are electorally dominant there. The partyâs appeal is its programmatic push for
socioeconomic change and pro-poor social service delivery and its capacity to deliver local results better than most
political parties can (Bevan 2010). This makes it easier to deliver services and to organize bargains around service
delivery.

The TaraiÂ­
         a


Compared with the hill and mountain regions, the postconflict settlement in the Tarai is unstable and contested; it is
characterized by highly disorganized and mobile roving armed groups (often with criminal motives); and there is limited
state penetration in many parts of the region. Groups that emerged as a result of the Madhesi movement in 2007 included
political parties linked to criminal gangs engaged in cross-border crime and extortion. This predatory behavior flourished
in the region due to a weak state presence, and there was a higher incidence of criminal activity. Post-2007, the dominant
motivations of the political leadership in the Tarai have centered on greater political representation of Madhesi leaders in
Kathmandu rather than on forging a social service delivery agenda. Weaker links and less political influence in government
has made brokering deals with central government ministries more difficult, resulting in the targeting of service delivery
for appropriation and much riskier and more challenging service delivery.

a. Historically, the Tarai has experienced far less state extension and a far higher incidence of criminality as local groups have taken advantage
of the stateâs absence to engage in criminal enterprises and appropriate valuable assets such as land. The absence of state penetration was a
central condition to the rise of mafia-like organizations elsewhere (Gambetta 1993). The political landscape in the Tarai is therefore much
more predatory and less oriented toward programmatic political projects that advance social welfare than in the hill and mountain regions,

   âMany of the interviewees [working on service delivery in Afghanistan] did not see violence
   as a problem in itself for the delivery of services so long as it was possible to identify the
   key players and negotiate access to the services. It became much more difficult when local
   strongmen competed against each other or âcriminal gangsâ were involved without any clear

Box 4.1. Organization of violence in Badghis and Wardak

Badghis Province
Delivering services in Badghis Province, Afghanistan, is particularly challenging, mainly due to the disjointed and
unstable nature of the political settlement (see chapter 3) and the fragmented, divided, and contested forms of vio-
lence, which makes it extremely difficult to identify leaders with whom to bargain, predict the behaviors of violent
actors, and reach bargains that enable the service delivery.

Violent conflict in Badghis is characterized by regular armed clashes between insurgents and government forces and
periodic conflicts between rival warlords. The dominant form of violence is therefore characterized within our ty-
pology as highly disorganized and fragmented, with roving (and sometimes competing) armed groups. Dominating
Badghis is an expensive enterprise that brings few rewards. Unlike Wardak, Badghis has a history of numerous in-
fluential warlords trying to assert control over it, both before and after the Talibanâs Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Abdul Malik, Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Ismail Khan each had influence over the province at different times, but
none could assert full control (see Giustozzi 2009). This form of violence in Badghis affects service delivery in a
number of ways, as outlined below.

Weak incentives and coordination. Many informants note that the competitive and fragmented scenario results
in poor coordination between power holders and weak incentives for social service delivery, with a focus on pred-
atory behavior. As one informant puts it:

âThere is no doubt that the biggest suffering of Badghis comes from these unauthorized armed groups; they will
be a big problem in the future. You know that a wrong policy was previously welcomedâto support militias. But
this was happily decided by the central government to prevent a build-up of militia groups, since their existence can
be a very big threat. But look at Ab Kamari, for example. It used to be the district of peace; now â¦ unauthorized
armed groups create problems that the Taliban doesnât.â (BS: IDIâ32)

Another informant expresses it this way:

   ââ¦ We can see the security situation and some conflicts inside the center or in the districts of Badghis. This
   is a sign of powerholders not having good relationships. However, they portray themselves as honest and
   friends with each other to show the community that they are not against each other and that they are just
   working for the province. They are not honest; they are not supporting each other. Everyone looks out for
   his own position and power. If they show themselves to be allies, it is just to keep their own positions. We
   all know that they are against each other and that they are in different political parties â¦ When there are
   contracts for some projects or other sources of money that they can benefit from, they compete to gain a
   greater share than the others â¦â (BS: IDIâ23)

                                                                                                             (continued)

   Box 4.1. Continued

   Challenges to bargaining. Many interviewees do not think violence is itself an obstacle to service delivery as
   long as it is possible to identify key players with whom to negotiate access. The situation is much more difficult
   when local strongmen compete against each other or when there is criminal gang activity and an absence of clear
   incentives for ensuring that services are sustained over the long term, which is largely the case in Badghis.

   Unstable climate. Many leaders and service providers complain that they cannot understand or predict the behav-
   ior of the strongmen and warlords, and this creates an uncertain and unstable climate. One interviewee exemplifies
   this point by saying: âI donât understand how they interact with each other. They are sometimes at war with each
   other and sometimes at peaceâ (BS: IDIâ22). Another notes:

      âThey [Badghis warlords and strongmen] have their own agreements with each other in terms of what to do.
      Sometimes, they fight with each other â¦ sometimes, they make deals, especially during the pistachio har-
      vest â¦ It is good that they come to an agreement on how to share it, so then there is no argument between
      them.â (BS: KIIâ15)

   In this context, even when bargains were struck (see chapter 5), they were particularly difficult to forge and keep.
   Many local actors hoped for the arrival of a strong leader who could serve as a catalyst for the formation of a more
   stable provincial settlement. Some, including elders and activists, suggested that the emergence of a strong warlord
   such as General Atta Mohammed Noor in Balkh could be the best possible outcome for Badghis.

   Wardak Province
   Wardak, like Badghis, is often characterized as insecure and violent. Still, many interviewees perceive Wardak as
   a place where it is easier to deliver services than it is in Badghis, and its outcomes also tend to be notably better,
   particularly until 2008. Why is that? Insights from the research include the following:

   â¢	 Violence is, to a degree, more organized and less mobile (compared to Baghdis). In the absence of
      a strong leader to act as a catalyst for collective action, provincial elites did not develop a strong vision of
      the future or become more organized and centralized in their monopoly over violence, as they did in Balkh.
      Nevertheless, the more organized form of violence in Wardak enables bargaining, as the local elite is relatively
      strong (see chapter 3) and supports health and education, and the Taliban are relatively reliant on local support,
      which contributed to cases of forging bargains around social service delivery between service providers and
      insurgents (see chapter 5).

   â¢	 The provincial settlement in Wardak requires less rapacious behavior from the provincial elites and is
      more cohesive. The main power broker is linked to anti-Taliban factions, which later incorporated Hezb-e Islami
      networks. The strong Hezb-e Islami and Hizb-i Wahdat networks in the Pashtun and Hazara areas, respectively,
      may have helped bring service delivery to these constituencies, but there is a lack of conclusive evidence.

   Box 4.2. Ideology matters? Education in Balochistan versus polio eradication in KP and FATA

   A comparative analysis of education in Balochistan and polio eradication in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas
   (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) stresses the role of ideology, as well as other dimensions of violence, to
   explain the disparate social service delivery risks and performance.

   Balochistan and education. Armed elites and allied insurgents sometimes did not overtly oppose the Balochistan
   Education Support Project (BESP). In fact, on various occasions, insurgents let the project take its course without
   any direct interference or threat, which helps to explain why BESP registered progress (see chapter 2). As one in-
   dividual from Turbat explains:

      âExtra judicial killing, abduction, and the like are observable everywhere but as far as this school and educa-
      tional activities are concerned, Sarmachar [a local term for Baloch militants] never interrupted our activities.
      Rather, they encouraged us to get education.â (FGDâ01)

   Much depended on the case, but why could this be?

   â¢	 Ideology. There was some degree of alignment between the goal of delivering education and the goals of the
      Baloch insurgency. First, some Baloch armed elites and allied insurgents viewed education as a means to achiev-
      ing their goals. They viewed a lack of education as an obstacle for the province and therefore believed some
      forms of education could promote local empowerment. Second, certain militants relied, in part, on local support,
      which incentivized them to support services that the local communities wanted. Finally, locally influential na-
      tionalist elites viewed education as a means to pursue their nationalist objectives.a

   â¢	 Organization of violence. In addition, the Baloch insurgency is relatively well organized and disciplined at
      the local level, making it easier to identify leaders with whom to bargain and negotiate to ensure that social
      service delivery was protected.

   â¢	 Bargains and compromises. Baloch armed elites and allied insurgents were further incentivized to support
      local education by modifying and co-opting the education services (see chapter 5); moreover it was a nonstate,
      as opposed to a state-led, project.

   Polio eradication in FATA
   In contrast to the example of education in Balochistan, the history of the Polio Eradication Project (PEP) in FATA
   is more rife with violent attacks, with some vaccination workers being abducted or killed. In both regions, the in-
   surgency is resisting the state, but has different motivations. In Balochistan the insurgency is driven by nationalist
   sentiment; in FATA it is linked to global Jihadi networks keen on imposing their vision of Sharia law on the state.
   The FATA insurgency has been increasingly radicalized and its relations with the state further antagonized by re-
   peated drone attacks. Moreover, attacks against PEP workers increased after it came to light that the U.S. Central
   Intelligence Agency had used a vaccination drive in Abbotabad to gather intelligence against Osama Bin Laden.
   Resistance to polio became a proxy for resistance to the state as well as a bargaining tool.

                                                                                                              (continued)
Box 4.2. Continued

Further, in Balochistan, education is viewed as a vehicle for provincial empowerment, and its localized mode of
delivery gives insurgents some control over how the services are delivered. In FATA, however, the polio eradication
program is seen as a Trojan horse for external intelligence gathering. It is not considered a priority due to the lack
of other basic health-care services and due to local demand for other services, such as electricity. Repetitive polio
campaigns and poor communication with insurgents have exacerbated these problems (see chapter 6).

Polio eradication: FATA versus Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
The role of the ideology and organization of violence is further demonstrated by the comparison of polio eradica-
tion delivery in KP and FATA. PEP was more problematic to implement, at greater risk of violent attacks, and made
less progress toward achieving its outcomes in FATA than in KP for a number of reasons, including:

â¢	 Ideology. FATA-based armed elites and allied insurgents have a more radicalized ideology and antagonistic
   view of the state than those in KP, partly due to the drone attacks in the region. Many focus group participants
   argue that the drone attacks also fueled the widespread perception in FATA that polio campaigns are a cover for
   U.S. intelligence gathering prior to pinpointing targets for drone attacks. Association with the state can automat-
   ically make one a target in FATA.

â¢	 State penetration and organization of violence. In FATA, state penetration and control is deemed to be
   relatively weaker than it is in KP (see chapter 3), which has led to more fragmented and autonomous forms of
   violence there. It also means there are fewer opportunities for political and administrative cooperation and co-
   ordination to deliver services on the ground.

a. The president of the Pashtunkhwa Mili Awami Party, the leading Pashtun Nationalist Party of Balochistan, perhaps representing a more
radical, nationalist view, claims: âOur children are being kept out of schools intentionally. This policy dates back to British rule of this region.
The British had a clear policy for our children that they must not get education. This state, mostly represented by Punjab, is continuing the
same policyâ¦ they fear that if we get education and awareness, we will demand our rights.â (KIIâ14)

                 In the 1980s and 1990s, the main jihadi party in Wardak was the Islamist Hezb-e Is-
                 lami, which favored scientific and technical education, albeit within an Islamic framework
                 (WK: KIIâ05 and 06). Some jihadi commanders wanted schooling for their own children
                 and the support of locals. This is why even during armed clashes, many schools were
                 actively kept open. Interviewees told some interesting stories about this:

                 âThe main factors that kept the schools open were the jihadi commanders, village elders,
                 ulema, mullah, imams, and maliks. People gave land for school buildings and they main-
                 tained the security of the schools, because on the one hand, their own children were at-
                 tending these schools, and on the other hand, it was a service for their villagers. Although
                 there were conflicts among the jihadi parties, they tried to support schools and they did
                 not plan to close them.â (WK: KIIâ01)

                    âTribal and party competition were the highest in this area. This means that each
                    party and commander had his own government in his area. But most of the people
                    agreed with the delivery of education services and supported education. I can give
                    you an example of their support to education. In Chak District, there was a govern-
                    ment school building in the Shir Khana area. In this area, there were different par-
                    ties. The members of each of these parties occupied a room of this school building;
                    they were living there. When the people of the community asked the commanders
                    to leave the school building so that it could be used for teaching and studying, they
                    also ordered their personnel to leave the school buildings. Finally, all of them left
                    the school building and classes started again.â (WK: KIIâ02)

Box 4.4. Localized armed elites and allied insurgents and social service delivery bargains

Across the studied cases, the ethnographic evidence suggests that the more localized the armed elites and allied
insurgents, the easier it is to negotiate for and deliver services. Following is a summary of findings.

Afghanistan
A range of interviewees note that mobile insurgents, usually deployed from neighboring countries during the fight-
ing season, do not have links to local communities and do not stay long enough to establish smooth communication
channels with local elders. They note that these armed elites and allied insurgents are much less bound by local
needs or bargains, and they cite numerous instances of insurgents from outside the province disrupting service de-
livery. Some local representatives claim that âthose Taliban who are not independentâ (out-of-area Taliban coming
from Pakistani territory) and the security forces are equally responsible for school attendance disruptions in some
areas (WK: IDIâ18).

A range of informants claim that it is easier to negotiate service delivery with the help of local elders if the Taliban
are locally connected. One informant describes an example of local Taliban being so amenable to service delivery
bargains that they allowed unofficial schools to be established:

   âUntil last year, girls in grade six did not have any problems. But due to some concerns, for girls in higher
   grades, between grade six and ten, the Taliban and the local people advised renting a specific house where
   these girls could attend school until the 10th grade.â (WK: IDIâ14)

In Wardak, the rise of external violent actors, who are less respectful of local bargains and elders, more ideologi-
cally opposed to education, and less dependent on local support, helps explain the weakening sectoral bargains and
overall decline of school attendance (particularly among girls).

Nepal
Evidence suggests that local village Maoists were more understanding of community needs than those from outside
the village. The village of Taratal in Bardiya, for example, was relatively unaffected by the conflict because the
Maoists in charge understood local needs. It was indeed Maoists from outside the village who obstructed develop-
ment work (H16âKIIâBAR). And nonlocal Maoists in the village of Madanpokhara in Palpa were reportedly more
âforceful,â while local Maoists were more understanding (H22âKIIâPAL).

Pakistan
The comparison between the Polio Eradication Project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) underlines similar findings. Roving forms of violence, fostered by FATAâs porous borders with
neighboring Afghanistan, made organizing negotiation focal points difficult. Indeed, when international forces
engage in a military offensive against the Taliban in Afghanistan, militants move to Pakistani FATA. If there is an
offensive by the Pakistani military, militants move to adjoining areas in Afghanistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa com-
munities, however, do not offer such a safe haven to militants as those in FATA tend to do.
             5. Elite Bargaining Matters

                 âI see less harm in hiring a person who is corrupt but is capable of doing something â¦
                 and is doing something.â (KL: KIIâ42)

Box 5.1. Enlisting the support of local elites in Wardak, Afghanistan

Education
Local elites in Wardak were enlisted on multiple occasions to ensure that education services were sustained during
the insurgency:

   âWhen the Taliban closed schools, the Ministry of Education asked the tribal elders [in Wardak] to talk to the
   Taliban. Then there were discussions between the tribal elders and the Taliban, and some of their requests
   were accepted. Actually, only the tribal elders could convince the Taliban to keep the schools open.â (WK:
   IDIâ16)

   âLast year, a girlsâ school was blocked â¦ by the Taliban [in Wardak]. They [pointing to the elders in the
   room] went to some Taliban members and mediated for the opening of the girlsâ school. Those problems are
   not resolved by the government; those issues are solved by these elders.â (WK: IDIâ14)

Health
Local elites and health shuras (consultative councils) in Wardak also enabled health service delivery:

   âThere were security checkpoints near the clinic, which were attacked by [the Taliban]. Due to the fighting
   between opposite groups and security checkpoints, it was difficult for patients to come for treatment to the
   clinic â¦ This problem was shared with health shura members, and to some extent, the problem was solved.
   The health shura and elders talked to the group of insurgents about not disturbing them during the day when
   women, men, and children go to the clinic for treatment, which they accepted.â (WK: IDIâ07)

   âThe â¦ problem was the presence of insurgent groups against the government; that is a threat to everyoneâs
   life. Through the establishment and communication of the health shuras, this problem was solved â¦ The
   shura talked to insurgent groups about the need for health services â¦ With that, [the insurgents] agreed to
   service delivery and that they will not interfere with the health sector staff.â (WK: KIIâ13)

   âAbout the interaction of these power holders [local elites] with the insurgents, they agreed to the delivery of
   health and education services in the area, because of the involvement of the elders â¦ They verbally agreed
   that they would do no harm to health and education service delivery.â (WK: KIIâ09; WK: KIIâ12)

   Box 5.2. Religious elites, fatwas, and polio delivery in Pakistan

   The example of Pakistan illustrates the important role religious elites can play in social service delivery. According
   to some practitioners, fatwas from respected clerics helped convince skeptical local religious leaders to accept the
   vaccination program, and they in turn convinced insurgents and locals (R20âKIIâPSH; R15âFGDâPSH). One
   donor agency official, noting how fatwas helped tackle cases of refusals, cites an instance of a fatwa issued by a
   madrasa in Multan persuading the religious elite to cooperate:

      âWe had to face refusal from the whole village once, when the imam of the mosque announced to boycott
      polio drops in a village named âSadri Jadeedâ in Dagi, Swabi. In the year 2012â13, we brought a fatwa from
      a madrasa in Multan to convince reluctant religious persons.â (R10âKIIâPSH)

   In the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), internally displaced female community members from North
   Waziristan engaged with religious and political elites to convince the Taliban of the benefits of polio vaccination
   (R19âFGDâPSH). However, while fatwas were necessary, they could not ensure effective polio eradication delivery,
   especially in FATA.

   Even though numerous respected clerics supported polio immunization, the Pakistani Taliban have consistently
   refused to allow polio teams into their areas, especially in FATA. The background country report notes that in some
   cases, ensuring the support of religious leaders was not enough to broker deals around the Polio Eradication Proj-
   ect. A focus group discussion participant with the FATA polio program technical staff argues:

      âDue to lack of education, religious guidelines take heavy precedent over everything elseâbut having a
      fatwa issued is not enough, you need to convince local imams as well or they will oppose you despite the
      fatwa from higher level imams.â (Râ24âGIâPSH)

Box 5.3. Bargaining with the Maoists in Palpa, Nepal

K.C., a health care assistant at the Tahu primary health care center in the district of Palpa in Nepal, discussed several
strategies that were used to keep health services functioning during the Maoist insurgency in Palpa:

Rents. In addition to paying a levy of a dayâs salary every month to the Maoists, providing supplies to them was
crucial to remaining operational. K.C. gave the insurgents anything they requested, though he could not ask them
to submit a medicine demand form, as the procedure dictated. On one occasion, insurgents asked for a sphygmo-
manometer (a tool that measures blood pressure), but the center did not have one, so K.C. put in a request for two.
The district health officer who sent the equipment knew without asking any questions. K.C. believed that the officer
understood the sensitive and difficult nature of the conditions under which health centers located in remote areas
were operating, and therefore promptly responded to their requests. Supplies were continually replenished, and the
district officer never demanded any kind of accounting for them.

Discretion. An important survival strategy was to never provide any information about the security forces to the
Maoists and vice versa. For example, government forces would often arrive at the primary health care center a few
days after a battle and question the staff as to whether injured combatants had been brought in for treatment. The
standard response from the staff was to suggest that they had perhaps been taken to Rampurâa nearby market
town.

Treat on request. Wounded Maoist fighters were discreetly treated on request in a room separate from other pa-
tients. Some of the Maoist insurgents visited K.C. at his home as well because he had a private pharmacy. When this
happened, K.C. had to provide both health services and accommodation.

                 Box 5.4. Bargains and skewed health provision in Wardak, Afghanistan

                 The experience of the health sector in Wardak demonstrates how bargaining between
                 provincial and more powerful elites can contribute to a skewed provision of services. For
                 example, provincial council members from the two Hazara-dominated districts in Wardak
                 authorized several local clinics, despite these not being in accordance with Ministry of
                 Health guidance. As one interviewee notes about two related events:

                    âThey have many recommendations for upgrading a health facility, for downgrad-
                    ing a health facility, for establishing a new health facility. In the two Behsud areas,
                    this is very common. Therefore, we have an extensive number of health facilities in
                    Behsud, because every time they go to the minister, he is not brave enough to face
                    these Members of Parliament (MPs). The minister refers the case to the Grants and
                    Service Contracts Management Unit in the Ministry of Health and then to us. What
                    began as a small clinic eventually became a well-established clinic. We now have 23
                    clinics in the two Behsud areas; 40 percent of our clinics in Wardak are in Behsud.

                    He [senior health official] forced us to accept what he thought was right in terms
                    of the staff in one of the clinics, where he had some personal interest. That clinic
                    was previously supported by the government and was later taken over by a nongov-
                    ernmental organization. He still had links in the clinic. He wanted to be involved
                    in all of the recruitment and everything that was happening in the clinic. He was
                    frequently supervising it. He forced us to upgrade it from a Comprehensive Health
                    Centre (CHC) to a CHC+, and he succeeded. But he did not stop with the CHC+,
                    as he said that it should be a special CHC+. So he went to the new minister and
                    gained special approval to hire people.â (KL: KIIâ47)

Box 6.1. Engaging local elites in the Balochistan Education Support Project: Challenges to
scaling up

A politically savvy approach
One reason that the Balochistan Education Support Project (BESP) made progress was that it was able to work
through local-level elites, which was arguably politically savvy in a number of ways, as outlined below.

â¢	 Direct links to local elite. The project was able to work directly with local elites who had greater incentives
   and interest in furthering education than higher-level elites (see chapter 3). For example, by only permitting
   parents whose children were enrolled in BESP schools to be members of the parent education committees, the
   project design reduced the direct influence of higher-level elites who would typically send their own children to
   private schools.

â¢	 Reduced scope for interference. By working more at the local level, with smaller contracts and protected by
   the Balochistan Education Foundation model, there was less scope and interests for elites (especially ones linked
   with the Department of Education) that dominated the sectoral political settlement to interfere with or capture
   the project.

â¢	 Space for local bargains. Working at the local level also provided space for bargains between local elites and
   armed elites and allied insurgents (see chapter 5).

â¢	 Demonstration effect. Although at a small scale, interviewees suggest that the local-level approach created an
   important political demonstration effect by showing how projects can work in a context of violence. It further
   contributed to local demand and education which could eventually create new coalitions of elites and pressure
   higher-level elites to be more responsive.

                                                                                                             (continued)

   Trade-offs
   There are, however, political and developmental trade-offs that accompany this model, as summarized below.

   â¢	 Prospects for scaling up. Evidence suggests that attempts at scaling up would be challenging because doing
      so would likely challenge the incumbent sectoral political settlement (World Bank 2006).a Issues include:

     â	 The Ministry of Education is already thought to be overstaffed, with more than 60,000 school teachers on
        the government payroll. Many of these teachers are ostensibly recruited on a political basis, and teacher ab-
        senteeism is high at 15 percentâamong the highest rates in Pakistan. Integrating BESP teachers could put
        additional pressure on the payroll.

     â	 The new provincial coalition government is planning to reform its teacher recruitment method by outsourcing
        it to the National Testing Service, an independent recruiting and testing agency. Because BESP teachers were

        agenda, explains:

            âAs the nearly 800 BESP teachers existed outside the teacher union, many political economy aspects
            connected to the role of regularized teachers in the system did not apply to them. This included for in-

   Box 6.2. Lack of bundling undermined elite bargains on polio eradication in Pakistan

   Limited incentives
   Evidence from interviews suggests that a singular focus and a lack of service bundling undermined the Polio Erad-
   ication Projectâs ability to buy off local insurgents and elites, incentivize local cooperation, and forge local bar-
   gains. Armed elites and allied insurgents were more interested in other potential services, such as infrastructure and
   electricity, as well as other forms of bargaining, such as reducing drone attacks. Local elites and their constituents
   considered polio eradication a low priority, especially when compared with other health and nonhealth services.
   As a result, in many cases, local elites had limited incentives to protect or promote polio eradication delivery. One
   donor notes:

      âBecause there have been significant gains in polio reduction throughout the rest of the country, because
      there are very few polio cases in a population of 180 million, and because 140,000 children die annually in
      Pakistan from other causes, it is not hard to see why polio is down the list of priorities.â (Râ04âKIIâPSH)

   Potential for bundling
   Clear political economy incentives for allowing social service delivery and bargaining around polio eradication
   delivery were lacking. Several interviewees suggest that this problem could be solved through bundling. They argue
   that local elites and households would be more responsive to polio vaccination efforts if they were offered as part
   of a wider package of healthâand otherâservices. Polio program technical staff describe it like this:

      âFree medical camps should be used as mediums to encourage polio vaccination rather than relying on door
      to door visits that ferment resistance and suspicion of [the] polio-specific eradication program â¦ Provision
      of âcomplete health packagesâ (including polio immunization) and facilities can bolster trust of local people.
      Such activities, moreover, are supported by political, religious and local elites.â (R11âKIIâPSH)

   This again demonstrates how seemingly technical changes in service delivery can have notable implications to the
   broader acceptance of a particular intervention.

   Challenges to bundling
   There are also challenges to putting bundling into practice. One donor official notes that it may be costly to pro-
   vide other services in tandem with the Polio Eradication Project (R05âKIIâPSH), but program designers should
   nonetheless weigh the costs against the risk of polio eradication efforts being rejected or targeted by violence. In
   addition, bundling would require coordination within the health ministry and across other ministries, and this
   would likely be more difficult in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas than in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, because
   administrative structures are much weaker there (see chapter 3).

   Box 6.3. Female volunteers deliver health services in violent contexts in Nepal

   Background
   The use of female community health volunteers (FCHV) in Nepal can be seen as an approach that is sensitive to
   context-specific politics and violence. Itâs particularly politically savvy because it bypasses some of the entrenched
   human resource patronage in the health sector, which revolves around close linkages between political parties, el-
   ements of the Ministry of Health, and trade unions (see chapter 3). The strategy was also sensitive to the violent
   context.

   Nepalâs Female Community Health Volunteer Program, a partnership between Nepalâs Ministry of Health and Popula-
   tion and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), began in 1988 and by 1995 covered all 75
   districts.a The programâs goals were to âimprove community participation and outreach of health promotion through
   local women working voluntarilyâ (Bhandari, Gordon, and Shakya 2011). By 2012 there were around 52,000 female
   volunteers in Nepal serving as the primary contact between health facilities and communities.b From providing door-
   to-door services disseminating health information to supplying necessary medications and advice to pregnant women
   and new mothers, FCHVs guide people to the health facilities and educate them on the services available.

   Impact of FCHVs
   One health worker described the volunteers as the âmedical officersâ of their communities, claiming that without
   them health information would not have been distributed and the services would not have been as effective (H8â
   KIIâSRH). A World Bank assessment notes that:

      âContinuation, improvement and strengthening of the FCHV program therefore appear as a key strategic
      priority for HSS [Health Sector Strategy]. Regarding the importance of first line health workers in rural and
      remote areas a strengthened FCHV program will act as a powerful booster for the social impact of HSS not
      least according to gender, indigenous peoples and Dalit communities.â (World Bank 2004)

   And in a 2004 statement, the minister of health, acknowledges that the then over 49,000 FCHVs served as the
   main link between the village and the countryâs health infrastructure (Nepal Ministry of Health 2004).

   Trusted providers
   Even at the peak of the conflict, the volunteers managed to sustain service delivery, largely because they were non-
   governmental workers and locally based and recruited and so therefore trusted by the Maoist leadership as well as by
   the local communities. FCHVs tend to remain in their roles for a long timeâthe program has a very low turnover
   rate, enabling them to build longer-term relationships and bonds of trust with insurgents, local elites, and community
   members.c A health worker in Rolpa emphasizes the key role the volunteers play in violence-affected and remote areas:

                                                                                                              (continued)

    âFCHVs were not harassed by the state nor by the Maoists, and so they were able to carry out their work. Would
    you think that without the FCHVs family planning measures in their wards and village development committees
    would have been successful? Would the locals consume medications if there had been no FCHVs? Itâs easy to
    make policies but the crux is its implementation. Even we have not been able to go and raise awareness in the
    nooks and crannies of each and every VDC. I have worked here for 20 years but I have been able to go to only
    five of the 22 VDCs under my charge. Do you think that by going to five VDCs there would be changes at the
    local level in terms of health awareness? The local Maoists have also benefitted from the activities of the FCHVs.
    If they had a headache, they were able to get paracetamol [acetaminophen] from the FCHVs.â (H25âKIIâROL)

Not a panacea
FCHVs were not, however, a cure-all for health delivery. They did help drive progress in basic health care, but they
were unable to deliver more complex, staff-intensive, curative health care that requires a more skilled workforce,
which for political economy reasons cannot be easily deployed in rural areas (see chapter 3). According to one es-
timate, there is only one doctor available for every 150,000 people in rural areas, compared with the urban area of
Kathmandu where the ratio is one doctor for 850 people. The government relied on lower-skilled staff to deliver
preventative health services, enabling it to remain on track in meeting its Millennium Development Goals. For ex-
ample, apart from occasional and always brief stints by medical doctors, one primary health-care center in Rolpa
had effectively been run by an auxiliary health worker for 20 years.d

a. At least one woman serves as a volunteer per ward (the smallest subdivision of local governance). An estimated 40,000 FCHVs were en-
gaged by mid-1997 (Fielder 2000), and even during the most intense fighting period (2001â06), their numbers grew by 14 percent.
b. Facing a severe shortage of health workers, the World Health Organization promoted the idea of âtask-shifting,â that is the âreview and
subsequent delegation of tasks to the âlowestâ category that can perform them successfullyâ (Lehmann and Sanders 2007: 1). This idea has
received renewed interest among community health worker programs. FCHVs are chosen by local mothersâ groups from the community to
support activities conducted by local health facilities. Following an 18-day basic training, they can provide an array of services, including
distributing vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets to children under five years old, providing health education in terms of family plan-
ning, distributing condoms and birth control pills, providing community-based treatment of pneumonia, treating diarrhea, referring out sick
newborn babies, providing antenatal counseling to pregnant women, and distributing medication to mothers for improved neonatal cord
stump care and to pregnant women to prevent postpartum hemorrhages. Despite these varied responsibilities and the fact that the volunteers
do not get paid, the program has a low attrition rate of less than 4 percent per year.
c. A focus group discussion participant explains:
âDuring the construction of the Sub-Health Post at Tarataal in Bardiya district, the Maoists had been obstructing the work asking about the
source of the funds. Finally, they allowed the construction to proceed provided that the monitoring was done by no one else but an FCHV.
Hence, each of the 21 FCHVs active at the time took turns to oversee and monitor the construction work every day, and they were even on
duty during important holidays. It was this kind of trust that allowed FCHVs to move around unhindered during the time of the conflict.â
(H16âKIIâBAR)
Even during the Madhesi uprising in 2008 and the subsequent armed activity in the Tarai, during which it became quite perilous for people
from the hill region to work there, the fact that the FCHVs were themselves Madhesis allowed them to operate freely (H6âKIIâSRH). âThere
was a time when health officials would come in their vehicles to provide family planning services but the locals would not trust them. But
now as FCHVs have been recruited from the local level the people trust usâ (H4âFGDâSRH). As members of the community, they could
convince others of the benefits of getting vaccinated, as an example (H6âFGDâBAR).

Box 6.4. The impact of socioeconomic factors outside a sector

Rising wealth contributed to improved social service delivery (SSD) in Balkh, Afghanistan. Political
stability, developmental leadership, and strong linkages with Kabul contributed to significant economic investment
and growth in Balkh, which in turn impacted SSD. The net effect was faster development in and around Mazar-
i-Sharif, one of the largest commercial centers of Afghanistan. As a result, its poverty rate more than halved from
2007 to 2012 (from 60 to 22 percent). In Wardak, poverty rates dropped by only one-quarter (54 to 40 percent);
and in Badghis, the poverty rate barely improved (40 to 39 percent).a Much of the improvements in SSD outcomes
in Balkh Province is due the progress made in and around Mazar-i-Sharif, the provincial capital. Neither Badghis
nor Wardak had a comparable urban population nor could they match Balkh in terms of its overall wealth. Further,
several wealthy businessmen connected to Balkhâs strongman, General Atta Mohammed Noor, invested in the build-
ing of schools and clinics in the province.

Increased income levels and expanded road networks contributed to health delivery in Nepal. Data sug-
gest that factors outside of the health sector contributed to progress in health outcomes over the past two decades,
including rising average per capita income levels (there was a 20 percent increase in the 1980s, a 21 percent increase
in the 1990s, and a 16 percent increase in the 2000s); a decline in one-dollar-a-day poverty from 68 percent of
the population in 1996 to just 25 percent in 2011; increases in household incomes owing to a rise in remittances
to Nepal; and improvements in education and advances in empowerment for women. This progress contributed to
improvements in health knowledge, access, and outcomes. Furthermore, 33 percent expansion of the road network
between 1999 and 2008 improved access of people in remote villages to medical help.

Differences in land rights and distribution as well as income equality contributed to varying SSD dy-
namics and outcomes in the Tarai versus the hill region of Nepal. There is evidence that the Tarai performed
worse than the hill region in terms of SSD, which can be traced back to differences in land and income distribution.
The hill and mountain regions, which generally have a lower per capita income than the Tarai, distribute land and
income in a more egalitarian way. While a small degree of landlessness still exists in the hill region, 33 percent of
eastern and central Tarai households are landless compared with 13 percent in western Tarai. Tarai dalits form a
major part of these landless groups, who are the subject of quasi-feudal relations with landlords, especially in the
eastern Tarai. These differences have had varied effects on local politics and violence, which in turn impact SSD
(see chapters 3 and 4).

This chapter attempts to extract the five over-    potentially significant. Scant research has
arching and overlapping policy implications        been conducted to date that systematically
of the above findings. As box 7.1 outlines, the    takes into account and addresses the issues
implications are preliminary, but nevertheless     identified in this study.40



   Box 7.1. Clarifying expectations:
   What this study tells policy makers and practitioners

   Further research is needed. The policy implications are nuanced and powerful, but also partial for
   three reasons:

   1.	 The research findings need to be further tested and replicated in other contexts;

   2.	 Given the high level of contextual variation in violence-affected settings, it is not possible to pro-
       vide an off-the-shelf road map for action; and

   3.	 The extent to which development actors adopt (or interpret) the study implications will depend on
       a given organizationâs objectives, available instruments, and appetite for risk, among other factors.

   The focus is on the âhow toâ of delivering services.. The implications focus on the delivery of
   services and progress toward achieving service delivery objectives over the short-to-medium term in
   violence-affected contexts. Issues such as the relationship between social service delivery (SSD) and
   drivers of violence or whether external actors should be supporting SSD in such contexts are import-
   ant, but not the subject of this research.

   The report touches on sensitive issues.. The findings highlight the prevalence of corruption,
   rent-sharing, and collaboration with armed elites in the âreal worldâ of SSDâand the following policy
   implications do not endorse, but do not also side-step, these thorny issues. Recognizing the role of
   such unpalatable elements in the cases is a reflection of what the field evidence revealed, but this does
   not mean that the authors of this report condone these practices. The study does, however, recognize
   that these issues require systematic and realistic treatment in policy making and program design.

                 Box 8.1. What the proposed diagnostic toolkit can and cannot do

                 The proposed diagnostic seeks to complement, not replace, existing diagnostics.
                 The suggested questions can be adapted and included in existing analytical tools that
                 support the strategic planning of development actors. This diagnostic offers tools in the
                 form of modules and questions for actors specifically concerned with supporting social
                 service delivery in contexts affected by active violence.

                 The diagnostic does not need to be extensive but does require careful applica-
                 tion. Its scope can be tailored to available resources and urgency. Information can be
                 gathered through one-hour conversations with experts; one-day workshops and consul-
                 tations; rapid desk reviews; or the commissioning of a report. Care should be taken that
                 the tools be implemented by people who are in tune with the political dynamics of the
                 relevant country and who have a solid understanding of the specific context.

                 The diagnostic is not a one-time exercise. Given the fluid nature of fragile, conflict,
                 and violence-affected contexts, the diagnostic needs to be regularly updated. Perhaps
                 more important than the rigor of the diagnostic is the process of ensuring organizational
                 uptake of its findings. Adequate resources and incentives must be dedicated to discussing
                 and following up on the findings.a

                 There are unlikely to be magic bullet solutions. The diagnostic is unlikely to offer
                 unambiguous solutions; it should, however, provide the basis for better planning and
                 more informed risk taking.

Box 8.3. Making delivery more politically astute: Key practical lessons

1. Semiautonomous delivery mechanisms can reduce the power of sectoral clientelist networks,
but sustainability and creation of parallel delivery systems is a challenge

Examples
The establishment of semiautonomous management and oversight institutions, such as the Balochistan Education
Foundation (BEF) in Balochistan.

Using alternative human resource approaches or bypassing existing systems to staff service delivery, such as the case
of health service volunteers in Nepal.

Why is this politically savvy?
The BEF experience demonstrates that a semiautonomous agency can reduce the impact of clientelist networks on
a sector by setting up new procedures that are to some degree ring-fenced from interference. Moreover, the semiau-
tonomous institution may, if designed correctly, have credibility with and the backing of reform-minded elites. In
other words, ânewâ institutions must be built on new elite pacts.

Using volunteers or alternative human resources systems can help sustain or expand service delivery by reducing
the influence of patronage-based appointments and the power of incumbents, such as unions or political parties, in
civil service transfers and postings.

What are the trade-offs?
The creation of a semiautonomous institution generates risks: (1) it could become a donor-driven entity with lim-
ited social and political legitimacy; (2) it could perpetuate dual public sectors and create parallel structures; and
(3) it could be subverted by the old elites or used by the new elite grouping for unintended purposes. Checks and
balances are crucial. Indeed, various interviewees argued that the Balochistan Education Foundation became less
effective over time and was subject to capture.

                                                                                                            (continued)




                                                                     Part III. Implications for Policy and Operations | 115
   Box 8.3. Continued

   The trade-offs for using volunteers or alternative human resources systems include: (1) volunteers might be able to
   fulfill simple short-term functions but not deliver the more complex services (and over the medium term, human re-
   sources systems would have to be reformed); (2) the role of unions and political parties would need to be addressed
   on a case-by-case basis: these actors might be more or less supportive of SSD depending on the context. The global
   evidence suggests that their relevance to the development process should not be taken lightly.

   2. Small-scale interventions can circumvent sectoral elite networks and spark a slow-burning
   political demonstration effect, but efforts to scale up can be elusive

   Examples
   Implementation of smaller-scale and localized interventions, such as the Balochistan Education Support Project
   (BESP) in Pakistan, road user committees in Nepal, and local health shuras in Afghanistan.

   Why is this politically savvy?
   BESPâs small-scale and localized model reduced appropriation by higher-level elites. Central- and provincial-level
   rent opportunities were reduced, and local elitesâwho had greater incentives for local education deliveryâhad
   more control over resource allocation and implementation.

   What are the trade-offs?
   Small-scale or localized successes can spur incremental and indirect political demonstration effects; that is, they can
   increase political pressure by constituents on higher-level elites and open up reform spaces by demonstrating what
   is possible, potentially bolstering reform-minded actors and shifting the mind-set and incentives of elites.

   However, local successes can be difficult to scale up, and new forms of local elite subversion can emerge. Rather than
   aiming for a province-wide rollout, programs should seek to deepen local successes, harness reform-minded impulses,
   and broadly disseminate communication about achievements to strengthen the demonstration effect. Further, efforts
   should be scaled up incrementally and have built-in strategies for compensating losers and antagonists to reform.

   3. Bundling delivery into a suite of services can increase the political feasibility of success,
   but implementation logistics are challenging

   Examples
   Bundling services into a suite of selected services, such as providing a range of health services in Nepal or combin-
   ing polio with other services in Pakistan.

   Why is this politically savvy?
   While multisectoral delivery is often framed as a technical and capacity challenge, this research suggests that this
   approach can help address some of the political barriers to delivery. For example, as the case of Pakistan illustrates,

                                                                                                               (continued)

Box 8.3. Continued

combining pro-poor servicesâsuch as basic vaccinationsâwith other services that powerful opponents and/or
local constituents really wantâsuch as other health services or electricityâcan reduce resistance and impact the
incentives of power brokers to support or block the smooth implementation of SSD. Combining basic SSD with
measures to address income or land inequalities and/or infrastructure investments, such as road connectivity, can
increase user demand, and can thus have spillover effects on the sector, as the Nepal case illustrates.

What are the trade-offs?
Before putting together a suite of services, a strong understanding is needed of what local elites want to ensure that the
plan is technically feasible and politically palatable. Bundling requires strong multisectoral coordination and logistics
and includes associated costs.

4. A decentralized, multistakeholder approach can facilitate more inclusive delivery bargains, but serious
mitigation mechanisms are necessary

Examples
Decentralized, multistakeholder approaches to delivery that set up local structures for decision making around
service delivery, such as the road user committees in Nepal and the local school and community development com-
mittees in Afghanistan.

Why is this politically savvy?
This approach can create space for local bargaining; absorb the transaction costs of enabling local collective action; and
create opportunities for previously excluded groups to increase their bargaining power with local elites, thus securing
a better resource allocation deal for themselves at the local level. In short, it can shift the local balance of power.

What are the trade-offs?
While a decentralized, multistakeholder approach can create bargaining space, it can also enable local elite capture
because local structures are invariably dominated by powerful local elitesâpolitical, social, and religious. The focus
should be on how to make these structures improve SSD rather than expecting to instantly eliminate their role. In
addition, it is difficult for the excluded to bargain effectively with powerful local elites, and their inclusion could be
met with backlash and even increased violence. On-going political risk management in project management teams
will be needed to manage these trade-offs.

               The findings were generated and triangulated using the following methods:

               â¢	 Systematic metareview of global evidence. The review included existing knowl-
                  edge on social service delivery (SSD) in violence-affected contexts, political economy
                  and violence conceptual frameworks, existing policy guidance on low-income and vi-

                  contexts.

               â¢	 Review of country-, sector-, and intervention-related evidence. The review

                  ers at various levels.

               â¢	 Field visits and focus group discusssion (FGDs). These visits and discussions were
                  conducted to triangulate and validate the findings, observe the on-the-ground power
                  dynamics, enrich the findings through rolling group discussions, and ensure represen-
                  tation from users of the services.

               â¢	 Systematic interview transcript analysis. Based on transcript analysis methodolo-
                  gies, the key informant interviews and focus group discussions were coded, clustered,
                  and analyzed to draw out common findings and issues.

               â¢	 Expert input and consultations. Sectoral, country-specific, and global experts pro-
                  vided comments and input at various points in the process.

Module 1: Guiding Questions

Basic features at the center of power
â¢	 Who are the key power holders in the ruling coalition? What is the relationship between the
   ruling elites and violent actors?

â¢	 What mechanisms help sustain the settlement? To what degree can elites act collectively to
   deliver goods?

â¢	 To what extent is the settlement clientelistic/developmental, exclusionary/inclusive, or
   stable/unstable?

â¢	 How do these features affect the space for delivery in the given sector?

Sectoral dimensions
â¢	 What is the balance of power and nature of rent-sharing agreements in the sector? What are
   the interests, incentives, and ideas of eliteswith regard to the focal sector?

â¢	 What are the opportunities for rents in the sector, and how does this influence the way ser-
   vice delivery resources are allocated? What are the dominant modes of delivery in the sector,
   and how does this impact on rent-sharing (for example, state-led versus contracting out,
   preventative versus curative health care delivery)?

Relationship between central and local elites
â¢	 What is the nature of the relationship between ruling elites at the center (often in the capital)
   and powerful elites in relevant subnational areas?

â¢	 What is the degree of state penetration over the subnational territory?

â¢	 How does the above shape the amount of, and channels for, service delivery resources to the
   area? How does it shape the degree of autonomy of subnational elites to deliver/manage/
   allocate resources?




                                                                                                Appendixes | 143
            Subnational dimensions
            â¢	 Who are the powerful elites (armed and unarmed) in the subnational area?

            â¢	 What is the nature of the subnational settlement, and how is it sustained and reproduced?

            â¢	 What is the relationship and relative balance of power between subnational elites and armed
               elites?

            â¢	 To what extent do key elites have ideas, interests, and incentives in favor of broader-based
               service delivery?



            Module 2: Guiding Questions

            Drivers
            â¢	 What are the key drivers of violence?

            â¢	 How does this relate to the dynamics associated with the forms of political settlements?

            Organization
            â¢	 To what degree is violence organized so that leaders for bargaining are identifiable?

            â¢	 To what degree are violent actors disciplined and homogenous so that bargains can be struck
               and upheld?

            Ideology, objectives, and incentives
            â¢	 What are the objectives and ideology of the armed elites? To what degree does the logic,
               scope, and mode of delivery align with such objectives?

            â¢	 Do armed elites have a âpolicyâ toward the services in question? Does this cascade through
               their ranks?

            â¢	 Do armed elites have incentives to enable the service (for example, rents, need to use service,
               helps them achieve goals)?

            â¢	 Are different modes of delivery likely to be more acceptable to armed elites? For example,
               which actors would they trust to deliver the services? Would they be more comfortable with
               decentralized delivery?




144 | Appendixes
Localization and mobility
â¢	 To what degree are the armed elites locally anchored as opposed to more mobile/roving
   across borders?

â¢	 Do armed elites need/want local support and do locals want the service?

â¢	 Do local elites have relative power to bargain with/constrain local insurgents?



Module 3: Guiding Questions

Experience and strategies for delivery bargaining
â¢	 What are the prior lessons of front-line service delivery and bargaining in the violence-af-
   fected area? Has dialogue been established with insurgents and bargains struck? Was this
   formalized?

â¢	 Are there opportunities for bargaining? If not, how could services be delivered in those
   areas?

â¢	 Given steps 1, 2, and 3, which types of bargains might be feasible? What are the likely
   trade-offs?

Service delivery strategies
â¢	 How are services currently being delivered in the sector? What are the institutional channels
   for delivery and political economy challenges for implementation?

â¢	 Do the sectors have certain policies/strategies for delivering services in violence-affected
   areas? How well are they working, and have any lessons been learned?

â¢	 What is the feasibility and opportunities for making delivery more sensitive to local politics
   and violence?

Developments outside the sector
â¢	 What is the nature of income and land distribution in the area? How might this affect service
   delivery, citizen demand, and forms of political organization?

â¢	 What other projects are in the focal region (for example, roads and livelihoods)? Are there
   opportunities for multisectoral approaches?
