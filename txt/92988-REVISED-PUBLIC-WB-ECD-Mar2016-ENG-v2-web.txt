Preface
Investing in young children is not only the right thing to do from an ethical point of view, but it is also the smart
thing to do from an economic point of view for the children, as well as for their families, their communities, and
society at large.

Early Childhood Development (ECD) interventions are essential for a child’s growth and development. The returns to
those interventions also tend to be higher than the returns to investments in human capital taking place later in life.

Today ECD is increasingly recognized as one of the most important investments that countries and families can
make to prosper and help all children lead productive lives.

In recognition of the strong evidence on the positive impact of ECD interventions on young children, investments
in ECD projects at the World Bank (grants and loans) as well as in analytical and capacity building work related to
ECD have increased considerably in the last few years. But more can and has to be done to convince policy makers
and practitioners to truly place ECD policies and programs at the core of their national development strategies.

This document provides a simple guide for policy makers and practitioners about how to invest in young children.
It identifies 25 essential ECD interventions that can be delivered through five integrated packages at different
stages in a child’s life, spanning the education, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and social protection sectors.
These five packages of interventions are: (i) the family support package, (ii) the pregnancy package, (iii) the birth
package, (iv) the child health and development package, and (v) the preschool package.

The document also lays out four simple principles that countries can follow to design and implement successful
ECD strategies: (i) prepare an ECD diagnostic and strategy; (ii) implement widely through coordination; (iii) create
synergies and cost savings through integrated interventions; and (iv) monitor, evaluate, and scale up successful
interventions.

We hope this document will prove to be a valuable reference to policy makers and practitioners in our client
countries as well as for all those interested in giving every child the opportunity to fulfill their full potential.

  UNESCO defines the quality of the ECCE learning environment as well as the broader regulatory system. Quality in the
  learning environment includes various aspects such as the tone and content of teacher–child interactions, the range of
  play materials available, the safety and atmosphere of the physical space, the attention paid to health and nutrition, the
  child-centered approaches to learning, and the level of parental engagement. In addition to the learning environment
  itself, policies and regulations related to child-adult ratios, class or group size, teacher qualifications and training, inclusive
  education, and ECCE funding also are linked to ECCE quality.

      BOX 2: SABER-ECD

      ECD Policy Diagnostic Tool
      The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) was launched to help countries systematically examine
      their education policies. One of the domains within this initiative is SABER-Early Childhood Development (SABER-ECD),
      which is designed to present countries with a holistic multi-sectoral assessment of programs and policies which affect
      young children’s development. SABER-ECD presents three core policy goals: Establishing an Enabling Environment,
      Implementing Widely, and Monitoring and Assuring Quality. For each policy goal, based on evidence from impact
      evaluations and a benchmarking exercise of top-performing systems, a set of policy levers are presented that decision-
      makers can act upon in order to strengthen ECD. These policy goals and levers address the range of issues that generally
      constrain ECD outcomes and form a coherent package that all countries should address to improve ECD outcomes and
      services. Since SABER-ECD was launched in 2010, more than 35 countries have participated in the initiative. SABER-
      ECD has allowed Bank staff and policymakers in each of these countries to view the respective ECD system through a
      comparative lens and discern policy options to strengthen ECD at the national and sub-national level. In some cases,
      SABER-ECD analysis has led to new Bank and government investments in a country’s ECD system.

   BOX 3: Multiple Entry Points to Reach ECD Beneficiaries

   Multiple entry points to reach pregnant women, children, and their families
   A diverse range of entry points exist to influence young children’s development. Policies and programs in a variety of
   sectors and areas affect early childhood outcomes in nutrition, health care and hygiene, education, child protection,
   social protection, and poverty alleviation. These policies and programs can be aimed at the pregnant woman, the
   beneficiary child, the caregiver, or the family as a whole. Multiple stakeholders and service providers are involved
   in providing the 25 key interventions listed previously. In addition, early childhood interventions can take place
   in a variety of environments, including: the home, a preschool or child care center, a health post or hospital, or a
   community center.
   While each country may have its own multi-sector approach and established institutional arrangements and
   coordination mechanisms, it is important to strategically identify existing service delivery entry points to
   synergistically address young children’s development needs. Typically, young children can be reached through
   different channels and, depending on the context and age group, ECD interventions can be provided in a range of
   environments: center-based programs mostly focus on children ages 4 and 5 (just before their entry into primary
   school) and can be provided in classrooms, community centers, religious establishments, private homes, or even under
   a tree. Home-based ECD interventions focus on services delivered to mothers and young children to promote behavior
   change in health, nutrition, and parenting within the home environment. Communication campaigns targeting
   families with young children can also be effective strategies to influence behavior change for parents and caregivers to
   enhance children’s growth and development.
                                                                                                Adapted from Nadeau et al. (2011).

       BOX 4: Early Childhood Coordination in Jamaica

       Multisectoral institutional arrangements for ECD
       In 2003, the government of Jamaica established the Early Childhood Commission (ECC) as an official agency to govern
       the administration of ECD programs and policies. Operating under the Ministry of Education, the ECC assists in the
       preparation, monitoring, and evaluation of ECD plans and programs. It acts as a coordinating agency to streamline
       ECD activities, manages the national ECD budget, and supervises and regulates early childhood institutions . The ECC
       is supervised by a Board of Commissioners, and it operates with seven subcommittees representing governmental and
       non-governmental organizations. All relevant sectors, including education, health, local government and community
       development, labor, finance, protection, and planning are represented on the Board of Commissioners. The seven
       subcommittees that provide technical support to the ECC board are comprised of 50 governmental and non-
       governmental agencies.




       BOX 5: Coordination of Targeted Interventions in Peru

       The catalyzing role of the social protection sector in ECD
       Social protection agencies can help coordinate targeted interventions for vulnerable children and families. In Peru, the
       Juntos (“together”) program launched in 2005 now reaches more than half a million disadvantaged families. The program
       provides conditional cash transfers worth US$38 per month (15 percent of household consumption) to mothers to help
       them access health, nutrition, and education services. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are expected to attend
       antenatal and postnatal check-ups (tetanus vaccination, folic acid, iron supplementation, and anti-parasite checks) and
       have a medically-assisted delivery. Families with under-five children must have regular check-ups for growth monitoring,
       receipt of fortified complementary food and vitamin supplements, vaccinations, and deworming. An evaluation suggests
       that the program has improved the nutritional status of children.70 Part of Juntos’ success has been credited to Grupo
       Apurimac, a multisectoral inter-agency working group that coordinates the delivery of transfers and packages of health
       and nutrition services.

  BOX 6: Care for Child Development Approach

  Coordinated efforts to address health, education, and nutrition
  The Care for Child Development (CCD) approach considers health care encounters with young children and women as
  opportunities to strengthen families’ efforts to help their children grow. The CCD package provides guidance to health
  workers, other counselors, and community service providers on how they can help parents and other caregivers in
  caring for their children at home. The CCD package provides simple recommendations that health workers can share
  with families, for example on: 1) how to improve play, communication, and responsive feeding activities that stimulate
  learning of their children; and 2) how to be sensitive to the needs of children and respond appropriately. Advice is also
  given on how to provide targeted social support to vulnerable families to help them solve problems related to the care
  of young children. Advocacy materials and guidance on monitoring and evaluation are also available. An assessment
  of the implementation of the CCD module of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness in Central Asia led to higher
  developmental scores for children in intervention districts as compared to control. Improvements were also noted in
  parental activities with children and in health worker recommendations. In addition, two studies assessed the CCD
  module and identified substantial effects on home stimulation and child development. The most effective parenting
  programs had a well-developed curriculum, adequate training of workers, a balance of health, nutrition, and early child
  development components, and they benefitted from community and governmental (local or national) support.2

       developmental outcomes. It allows service providers and policymakers to monitor the delivery of benefits and assess
       program impacts. Tracking starts during the mother’s initial prenatal check-up, at which point an individual scorecard
       is created for the child. Each of the primary actors within the CCC service network – including the family support unit,
       public health system, public education system, and other social services – have access to the child’s file and are required
       to update it as the child progresses through the different ECD services. If there is a risk of vulnerability, such as inadequate
       nutrition, the system identifies the required service to address the risk. Through the integrated approach to service
       delivery and information management, services are delivered efficiently and in time in function of each child’s needs.

  BOX 8: ECD in the World Bank’s Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund

  The Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF), launched with funding from the UK’s Department for International
  Development, invests in impact evaluations of innovative human development programs, and works with governments
  to use the findings for more effective policymaking. The fund focuses on four areas critical to healthy human
  development, including early childhood development programs affecting the nutritional status and cognitive, physical,
  and socio-emotional development of children aged 0-2 in low income countries. Supporting more than a dozen early
  childhood development impact evaluations across Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, the SIEF portfolio emphasizes
  integrated at-scale programs that package nutrition and stimulation interventions, as well as multi-sectoral programs
  that combine ECD interventions with existing health, social protection, and sanitation programs.

    Conclusion

                             represent a unique window              for children. Unfortunately, most countries today fall far
