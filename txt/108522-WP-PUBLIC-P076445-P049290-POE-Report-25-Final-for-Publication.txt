                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
       Introduction
        This report responds to a request from the Government of Lao PDR (GoL) to
comment on an Action Plan (AP) to close the Resettlement Implementation Period (RIP) as
defined in the Concession Agreement for the Nam Theun 2 Hydro Project (CA) by December
2017. The report records our detailed comments on the objectives, indicators and key actions
in the draft AP. Our suggestions are summarised under each pillar of the AP in terms of
overall outcomes and indicators and specific important actions both by December 2017 and
the longer term. We also comment on the institutional responsibilities and required
capabilities for the period to the end of 2017 and the longer-term arrangements for
governance and management of the development of the Nakai plateau and on.
        The achievements of the AP will form a substantial part of the evidence for the POE’s
advice to the GoL in December 2017 on closure of the RIP.
       Agriculture and livestock
        There has been a significant further increase in cropping in the last year, in the form
of cassava grown on contract, some agro-forestry, and rice, both upland and paddy. The
number of gully dams and irrigated plots has increased and the company will respond to
demand for repair of irrigation systems. Barbed wire fencing is extensive, protecting crops
from wandering livestock. Numbers of buffalo and cattle have also increased, possibly
beyond the carrying capacity of the plateau, but there is an increase in pasture and fodder
crops as well, which may support more large animals than earlier expected.
        The main risks to the project are identifying a suitable replacement for cassava, which
significantly degrades the soil over 3-4 years, weaning farmers off the subsidies provided by
the company without affecting production significantly, and finding more land for
agriculture, probably from degraded community forest land.
         We suggested setting targets for further plots in permanent agriculture and irrigated
dry season cropping, increases in paddy rice yields, a shift of cassava to intercropping or
rotational cropped with legumes, and progressively phasing out cassava. We proposed
stabilising the Nakai herd at a (probably lower) number supported by the increase in available
feed, further increasing pasture and fodder production, further increasing the large animal
vaccination rate, improving market opportunities for livestock and a significant increase in
farming small livestock (chicken and pigs) as a business.
       Forestry
        The forest sector has contributed virtually nothing to resettler incomes for several
years now. The Village Forest Development Company (VFDC) is currently unable to make a
profit and can process only a fraction of the timber quota allocated to it. The villagers have
mostly given up on their Village Forestry Association (VFA) and the VFDC. Yet the
community forests could yield much more: one expert estimate is that profits could be
substantially increased – even doubled - without increasing the size of the annual log cut,
while maintaining good forest stocks and protecting biodiversity.
        A turn round in the fortunes of the sector will require first the GoL, with additional
expertise from the World Bank and the NTPC, setting up a truly communal forestry operation
and devising a strategy to achieve it, including a longer-term management plan, full forest
inventory, improved forest management, and a VFDC upskilled management. The plan
should cover all community forest use and not just timber harvesting. The GoL needs to back

                                                    v
this with technical support and a commitment to protecting the community forests from
depredation. The Prime Minister’s Order No 15 on timber exports and forest management is a
welcome development.
         We suggested indicators based on firm commitments from GoL and other
stakeholders to legal and management backing and funding and technical resources and full
support from villagers of the main elements of the strategy; effective protection against
illegal removal of trees or other valuable forest products; and a return to efficient operations
and profitability by the VFDC in 2017.
       Community land use
        The pressure on land on the plateau continues, with land grabbing widespread,
encroachments and illegal use present in almost every hamlet, and unresolved disputes
growing in number. Progress has been made with allocating additional land for larger
households and second generation families but the allocation needs to be completed as a
matter of priority. Community land use rights are poorly understood by villagers and
sometimes by District officials as well. This lack of understanding contributes to land
disputes and poorer households and minority ethnic groups missing out on additional
agricultural land.
        Decisions will need to be made on repurposing some community forest land for
agriculture, within existing community land use regulations. District and villages need to
have a common understanding of these regulations and plan for land use on that basis. Both
District and Village Land Management Committees (DLMCs and VLMCs) need training in
disputes resolution and outstanding major disputes ought to be settled before further land
allocations proceed.
        We suggested for indicators for 2017 that all major disputes are resolved, the
allocation of additional lands is completed, a very high percentage of natural growth
households have received their entitlements, and hamlets have plans in preparation for future
use of community forest lands.
       Fisheries
        The Fisheries Pillar is the most successful of the livelihood pillars for the resettlers,
and at the present level of fishing effort it appears to be sustainable. But there are risks. There
is evidence of a lot of outsiders poaching fish, particularly north of the Thalang Bridge.
Villagers on the Thalang Peninsula have limited fishing grounds because of the current
protected zone. Villages in the southern zone also complain of incursions in their fishing
zones by others.: probably 75% or more of fish although legally caught by resettlers do not
pass through the legal landing sites, and patrolling of the reservoir is still not frequent or
focused enough. The results are evident in the further declines in boat registration and fisher
licensing.
    For 2017 our suggested indicators are: fish protection areas are established, species
diversity and fish stocks are maintained, legal fishing opportunities for northern cluster villages
are improved, a new northern zone outpost is established (preferably at Old Sophia hamlet)
and existing checkpoints are re-established, 80% each of individual boats, commercial boats
and fishers are licensed, Village Fishery Group (VFG) and combined Watershed Management
Protection Authority (WMPA) - VFG patrols are increased to several times a week, focused on
areas of highest risk and randomly timed. Overall there should be a significant reduction in
illegal fishing and trading based on patrol, checkpoint and other reports. For fish processing
and marketing indicators we suggest that a market place is operating with upgraded facilities

                                                    vi
in four villages and that there is a further increase in households involved in fish processing
activities.
       These objectives need to be supported by more effective cooperation on fisheries
management between DAFO, WMPA and VFGs, an upgrade to DAFO’s fisheries expertise,
and resolution of the split jurisdiction problem at the north end of the reservoir.
       Off-farm activities
        Projects for developing employment and business opportunities outside the land (and
reservoir) based occupations focus on skills training, marketing and business support, and
finance for productive activities. Short-course skills training, continued at a lower rate in
2015, needs boosting but 13 longer-term scholarships were awarded to younger resettlers, a
welcome development. The Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) embarked on a new
participatory process to identify off-farm opportunities, piloted in one village. There are also
signs of a response in the villages to the emerging opportunities for eco-tourism on the
plateau, which should grow with the completed sealing of the “loop” road through Laksao.
        Lending by Village Development Funds (VDFs) continues to grow and there has been
a further modest increase in the share of broadly "productive" lending (small business,
fishing, farming). The rate of loans significantly in arrears also rose somewhat but overall the
funds remain creditworthy.
       The draft AP usefully emphasized villager participation and engagement in planning
new activities but could be more clearly focused on generating a broader range of income-
earning opportunities. The training effort of the past has had a fairly low conversion rate into
income generation. Business development should begin with identifying market opportunities
before proceeding to specific business plans and helping villagers acquire the skills to
implement them.
        We suggested that the indicators for 2017 should focus on income generation and, in
particular, that training is converted into income-generating employment and business, young
people are gainfully employed following education, finance is available to meet demand for
all viable small business requirements, new businesses are established, and income from
village businesses increases.
       Cross-Cutting Pillars
        Poor and vulnerable households: the Action Plan contains a clear statement of
measurable objectives consistent with the requirements of the CA and has a well-reasoned set
of activities for ensuring they are achieved by the end of 2017. We underlined some
important points: accurate identification of individual households in poverty requires
continuing detailed monitoring during RIP by NTPC and appropriate similar means of
monitoring by the district authorities after closure; support should be extended to subsequent
growth households on the same basis as original and natural growth households; NTPC will
backstop the District’s proposed kinship support system with a guarantee of cash support,
until 2035; support to equip poor and lagging households with livelihood options should
continue beyond RIP and support may need to be tailored to ethnicity (perhaps at hamlet
level), gender composition, or status as new natural growth households; people will continue
to move in and out of poverty and guarantees of support should therefore extend to
households who become “vulnerable” during the concession period.
        Ethnic minorities: The draft AP addressing cross-cutting issues for ethnic minorities
sets out a more positive and comprehensive program for taking care of the basic needs of
ethnic minorities, improving their socio-economic status and fostering self-reliance. It is

                                                   vii
important that ethnic minorities’ voice is not lost in the larger village unit (in some cases a
reality now); some important rights of ethnic minorities (for example, decision-making on
land use) are better secured at the level of the hamlet (where legal land use rights also lie).
Many development opportunities can also be usefully focused on the hamlet.
        The AP acknowledges that NTPC and GoL staff need to be able to communicate
effectively with ethnic minorities; the proposal for hiring a local ethnic minorities facilitator
to undertake the livelihoods and expectations review is welcome and the position could
usefully be longer term.
        We draw specific attention again to the special circumstances of the Ahoe and
recommend that families be allowed to remain in Old Sophia if they wish, perhaps to help
police illegal fishing and fish marketing and wildlife poaching in the northern part of the
reservoir.
         Gender: The Action Plan for Gender sets some high level objectives for women in
terms of education and health, economic opportunity and decision-making power and
develops a rigorous and comprehensive approach to ensuring that a gender dimension is
threaded throughout the Action Plan. The pillar is mostly about process and actual results of
benefit to women should be embedded in the livelihood pillars. We suggested some ways of
strengthening that perspective: more attention to the relative preferences of women for
activities which suit their other commitments would be useful: e.g. to small livestock or home
gardens; further development of fish processing; more focus on harvesting non-timber forest
products (NTFPs); and a stronger relative focus on small business opportunities and training
which fit women’s other commitments. While women are better represented in the District
and on village institutions, there is room for further improvement in achieving the gender
balance targets. We suggest considering a specific survey of women in resettler households
identifying their views on each of the major objectives of the gender strategy.
       Medium-term development
        Closure of the RIP is an arbitrary milestone imposed by the CA and does not spell the
end of the development project on the plateau. The AP looks beyond RIP closure to a
medium-term development plan. The NTPC will hand over responsibility for most
development programs to the GoL but will remain as a major development funder until the
end of the Concession period. There is a specific proposal from the Agence Française de
Développement (AFD) for medium-term agriculture and livestock development and IFIs and
other donors can also be expected to contribute.
        The GoL’s future role can be thought of in terms of its Sam Sang principles: villages
as the development unit, districts as the integration unit, and provinces as the strategic unit.
Focusing development on the Village and District, will enable proper coordination of the
various inputs into the development project.
        To meet these requirements, the District needs not only in-house technical skills in
advising on cropping, animal husbandry, fisheries and forest planning and management but
also in facilitation of participatory planning, business development and marketing and
disputes resolution (particularly with respect to land). The GoL must support this by
resourcing a staffing plan and overall budget for the District. Staff need to stay in place
longer to become fully useful. The planning and administrative capabilities of the Village
Authority and Village Development Committees (VDCs) also need to be strengthened. In the
period up to closure, NTPC also needs to maintain its capability for implementing the AP.



                                                   viii
        We suggested that the AP in the medium term should cover: Village Plans based on
participatory processes, covering all livelihood development including sector plans for
agriculture and livestock, forestry, fishing, off-farm activity and hamlet land use decisions,
and integrated into the Nakai District Plan; an overall development Steering Committee
responsible for plans and project approvals, based in the District but including Provincial
government and Ministries and with representation of funders or their agents as appropriate;
and implementation by District Project Teams for each major livelihood pillar, consisting of
relevant District staff together with TA agents as required.
        Shifting primary responsibility for development to District and Villages will require
strengthening the relevant District Offices, recruiting qualified District staff and retaining
them for a minimum of five years; training naibans and hamlet associations for their role and
providing Village Development Committees with the necessary administrative and technical
support.
       Major challenges for the Action Plan
        Some major challenges of the Action Plan include the GoL authorizing the changes in
law enforcement practices required to protect forests and fisheries; the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and district offices helping to manage the revitalisation of
community forestry; NTPC strengthening its Nakai team in the period to handover;
substantial staff and budget increases for DAFO to meet its expanded role; motivating and
empowering VDCs to take on their foundation role in development planning; resettlers
becoming less dependent on outside agencies for development, contributing more of their
own resources to activities, and fully including women and young people in hamlet and
village management and in income producing activities; World Bank and NTPC support for
the forestry pillar; and NTPC allocating a high proportion of the Nam Theun 2 Development
Fund (NT2DF) to the District for management after RIP closure with appropriate monitoring
and audit mechanisms in place.
       The Watershed Management Protection Authority
        Efforts to restructure and orient the WMPA in the last two years have failed. The
organisation is mostly ineffective in its role of assistance of villages and patrolling the NPA.
There should be an early and representative meeting of all stakeholders to discuss a new
strategy. The strategy must include a complete restructuring. All staff except the Director
should be required to reapply in a competitive process. WMPA Board of Directors should
conclude a MOU with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to serve as a partner
organization with the WMPA and be represented on the Board. The Board should appoint a
recognized and responsible auditor to assure that the Secretariat applies the funds in
accordance with an approved plan. if no substantial progress is made by November, 2016, the
World Bank and EPF will need to reassess their rationale for supporting the NNTNPA.

                              Interviewing, Nam Nien

1.1   Introduction: purpose and membership of the POE mission
        This 25th Report of the International Environmental and Social Panel of Experts for
the Nam Theun 2 Multipurpose Project in Lao PDR (POE) results from our visit to Laos in
May/June 2016. It is in two Parts. Part A, Chapters 1-9 of the report, responds to a request
from the Government of Lao PDR (GoL) for the POE to comment on a Comprehensive
Action Plan to “close the Resettlement Implementation Period (RIP) as defined in the
Concession Agreement (CA) by December 2017”. Part B of the report is Chapter 10,
assessing the progress of the reorganization and restructuring of the Watershed Management
Protection Authority (WMPA) and recommending further action.
        We adopted our usual practice of first bringing ourselves up to date with the
development situation by visiting the resettlement villages of the Nakai Plateau in central
Laos. Much of the rest of our time in Laos, apart from talks on the WMPA, was taken up
with discussions with the Joint Working Group (JWG) preparing the Action Plan both on
what still needs to be achieved if the RIP is to be closed by the extended deadline of 31
December 2017, and on action which follows thereafter.
        The POE team consisted of David McDowell (consultant, Otaki, New Zealand), Lee
Talbot (Professor, George Mason University, Virginia, USA), and, as successor to the long
time member Professor Emeritus Thayer (Ted) Scudder, Elizabeth Mann, a former consultant
to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) working on social safeguards, land use and allocation
and village planning issues in Laos, from the UK. They were again joined for the mission by
Rob Laking (consultant, Wellington, New Zealand), former member and convener of the
World Bank Independent Advisory Group (IAG) on the Nam Theun 2 project.
       Part A of the Report was prepared by all three members of the POE. Part B is the
work of David McDowell and Lee Talbot.

1.2   An Action Plan for RIP Closure
        In its previous Report 24 the POE, whilst acknowledging the vigorous efforts made
by the stakeholders to achieve the objectives of the project set out in its guiding document,
the Concession Agreement (CA), found that the Resettlement Objectives and Provisions had
not been fully met as yet, notably but not solely in terms of livelihood development and
sustainability. The Panel therefore recommended that the RIP be extended by two years to
December 2017. The Government, the Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) and the
International Financial Institutions (IFIs) associated with the project including the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, concurred in the recommendation.
        Action since this decision has focused on an inclusive process, led by the Lao
Department of Energy Business (DEB) supported by World Bank officials, to identify,
analyse and prioritize action called for in both the short term and beyond. A Joint Working
Group was formed by the GoL to develop an Action Plan (AP) designed “both to close the
RIP consistent with the Concession Agreement and to support resettlers beyond closure of the
RIP.” The purpose of the AP is to list specific issues and actions, with measurable indicators
and verification included to determine whether or not RIP closure can be called in December
2017, and to identify initiatives to support sustainability of Nakai Plateau livelihoods beyond
RIP closure as part of a Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP). The latter is to be funded
by NTPC through to 2035, a far-sighted move which goes beyond the Company’s formal
obligations set out in the CA.
        The GoL had invited us before we left for Laos to advise the JWG on whether the
Action Plan fully specified the actions needed by December 2017 to achieve the outcomes
required in the CA Objectives and Provisions, particularly on sustainable livelihoods, and
what evidence we would be looking for in December 2017 that the required outcomes had
been achieved. We met the JWG in Vientiane nine times between 26 May and 6 June and
provided detailed comments on the draft as requested. We suggested several redrafts of key
objectives and indicators in the existing texts and, as requested by the GoL, indicated what
actions we thought were particularly important in the remaining 18 months before the
extended RIP deadline. The sectoral APs are now being edited and consolidated by
stakeholders into one AP. This report records our response to objectives, indicators and key
actions that the JWG has identified in the draft AP.
        The POE supports the planning process underway and its methodology and was
impressed by the positive spirit of the talks. We were happy to offer our suggestions about
aspects of the drafts to give them greater specificity and relate the actions closely to desired
outcomes. We do not see the AP as another binding document like the CA but, like the GoL,
NTPC and IFIs, we will be guided by it in monitoring outcomes of various activities in the
months through to the end of 2017 and beyond. The stakeholders have acknowledged that
achievement of quantitative targets will not by itself produce an automatic closure
recommendation. We have to assess the overall outcome: the evidence that resettlers are on
the path to sustainable livelihoods. The achievements of the AP will form a substantial part of
the evidence for the POE’s advice to the GoL on closure of the RIP.
1.3   Constraints: time and capacity
       There are serious constraints to be overcome if RIP closure is to be recommended by
the POE at the end of 2017. The first is the time constraint: at time of writing there were only
eighteen months left to December 2017. The POE was surprised by the apparent lack of a
sense of urgency in some quarters over the time factor. An accelerated program of action is
demanded on all sides.

                                                   2
        There must be fast completion of the consolidated AP, rapid assessment of what
envisaged activities will require in added human and financial resources and provision of
these resources, a work program prepared and rapid endorsement of the AP by the
stakeholders. Many of the actions in the AP are based on existing work which should be
continued without waiting for formal agreement on the entire document. For its part, the POE
has used the redrafted sectoral AP texts as they stand amended as the basis for this report.
Others intend to use them similarly on an interim basis which is only realistic at this late
juncture.
        Additionally, the key agencies will need additional expertise and other human and
financial resources. Many commented in the JWG that achieving the ambitious, if
appropriate, AP targets will add considerably to the strain on the resources of already
stretched agencies, both public and private sector. In the case of both the NTPC’s NRO and
the Nakai District government, additional resources are needed if the deadlines of the Action
Plan are to be met. For the District Administration additional experienced capability is
required to meet both short and the longer-term challenges of supporting development on the
plateau. Village administrations also need strengthening, as do other organisations with a role
in development, such as the Village Forestry Development Company(VFDC).
        As noted above, there are resulting implications for the shape and intent of this report.
Previous POE reports have tended to be extensive assessments of the current status of each
sector, with advice and numerous recommendations on what might be done next. A different
approach is planned this time. Unusually for the POE, there are no formal recommendations.
As sought by stakeholders, the report instead records our suggestions to them on what
evidence on outcomes, outputs and actions would help us form a judgement on closure,
together with comments on who or what agency is responsible for which element of the work
program and on its capacity to undertake their tasks in the time envisaged.
1.4   Roles beyond the Company and GoL
        A good deal of the report is addressed to GoL agencies in the first instance because
they will be taking up an increasing part of the responsibility for further development.
Government Ministers are going to have to take some hard prior decisions before further
progress can be made. But we have also commented on the role that could be played by other
parties, particularly the donor community.
        The IFIs are beginning to make useful contributions. L’Agence Française de
Développement (AFD) has funded an assessment of the agriculture and livestock elements of
the project. The POE regards the basic thrust of the proposals for further action as sound.
Some minor points where we differ have been discussed with the authors in the JWG and are
addressed below. The program being put together will be jointly funded by AFD and the
NTPC. It will however still be in its assessment and planning phases by the end of 2017 and
there will be no concrete results on the ground by then relevant to RIP closure.
        As noted below ADB, along with NTPC, is helping foster the embryonic ecotourism
industry on the Plateau. The welcome sealing of the Thalang to Laksao road opens up new
opportunities which the resettlers are just starting to take up. We have always seen potential
in ecotourism, which could eventually provide numerous job openings for resettlers, notably
perhaps the younger generation and women.
        The World Bank is assessing how much it could do to help lift the ailing village
forestry operation back to its feet. Recent reports from World Bank specialists on the
condition and potential productivity of the village forests are very encouraging. This sector
could begin, after years of failure, to make a real contribution to lifting village incomes. The

                                                    3
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has an important role here but the Bank’s
substantial forestry expertise could make a big contribution. The POE strongly favours the
Bank supporting the rehabilitation of this non-producing pillar, starting soon. As we said last
year, achievement of RIP closure is heavily dependent on decisive action on forestry.
1.5       Post RIP closure
        Whatever the state of resettler livelihoods at the end of 2017, the development needs
of the plateau will not end there. NTPC has also committed itself beyond RIP closure to
continuing support for this development through to the end of the Concession Period in 2035.
We congratulate the company’s shareholders on taking this long view of NTPC’s role and
backing it with annual funding of the proposed Nam Theun 2 Development Fund (NT2DF).
This in itself provides some assurance that plans to move down the path to sustainable
livelihoods will be implemented post-RIP. That is a big step forward. How the additional
funds are to be administered is still under discussion. The old adage that the only way to learn
to govern is to govern is relevant here: the only way to learn to manage livelihood programs
is to manage them, including managing the funds. We discuss these issues in a concluding
section of this Report. Our view is that, post RIP, the Nakai District should have a central
role in managing the NT2DF funds and in managing the Medium Term Development
Program itself and that the Village Development Committees should be very closely involved
in both processes. This is consistent with the central role that they will play in the future
development of Nakai.
1.6       Organisation and approach of this report
       Our report is organized around the GoL’s request for comment on the Action Plan.
The GoL’s request was the basis on which we entered into the discussions with the JWG. The
GoL has since formalised – on behalf of the JWG - its request for our advice in a letter (20
June 2016) from the Director-General of the DEB. We have attached this letter as Annex A.
Specifically on the following aspects of the AP, the letter asked us for comment on:
          The high-level outcomes we would expect to end the RIP;
          The indicators, quantitative or qualitative, that would be evidence of the achievement
           of these outcomes;
          Whether there was a clear logic linking the actions proposed in the draft APs to the
           high-level outcomes;
          What were the strengths of the AP and what should be added to ensure closure;
          What else would be helpful to enable us to monitor and advise on progress over the
           remaining 18 months to the target closure date of 31 December 2017.
       We were also asked to consider some more general issues of funding and organisation
covering “participatory processes, funding sources …, requirements for handover
(capabilities required particularly of District and Villages).”
        We have organised this Report to answer these questions. The APs are divided into
four “livelihood” pillars – agriculture and livestock, fishing, forestry and off-farm activities -
and three “cross-cutting” pillars -poor and vulnerable households, ethnic groups, and gender
issues. We deal with the five questions about the APs in five chapters, one on each of the
livelihood pillars and one on the cross-cutting pillars. The two final chapters, respectively,
deal with the funding and organisational issues and summarise the main challenges for
stakeholders.



                                                     4
       The penultimate chapter on the funding and organisational issues takes into account
the medium term aspects of the Action Plan. We recognise that the institutional arrangements
for governance and management of development in the resettlement area, as addressed by the
second objective of the APs set out above, will underpin sustainable livelihoods in the longer-
term. The commitment of GoL, NTPC and to some extent the donor community to a medium
term plan will help underwrite development and promote sustainability. Our advice on the
medium term arrangements is also therefore relevant.
       The final concluding chapter summarizes what organisation should undertake the
most pressing challenges before the project implementers. It is designed to focus attention on
the most fundamental tasks and who might carry them out over the next vital year and a half.

       AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK




                 Land prepared for cassava planting near Nam Nien


2.1   The situation
       There has been a further visible increase in cultivation since our visit in April 2015.
The RO reports that the use of 0.66ha plots increased by 78% in 2015 and of 0.22ha plots by
20%. Fencing using company-supplied barbed wire is very evident and helps to protect crops
from the increasing number of large livestock which can no longer graze freely.
        The figures indicate that villagers are increasing their relative involvement in
agriculture. In the 2015 wet season survey 1051 households were engaged in some form of
cultivation, an increase of nearly 40% over 2014. Households engaged in agroforestry have
more than doubled to 333 in 2015. About 10% of villagers were preparing land for paddy,
mainly in the southern villages. However the biggest single source of growth in cropping
(now an estimated 40% by value) is of cassava, mostly mono-cropping. In 2015 about 390
households were growing cassava: the proportion varies widely across the plateau but in four
northern villages more than half of all households were contracted to grow cassava.
        The company reports an increase in the number of irrigated plots and growing
demand for repair of broken systems. Schemes repaired now total 101, on 499 plots.
Operational systems cover 44% of existing schemes and 41% of total irrigated area. The
company is planning to repair a further 75 based on demand from farmers. There has been a
big increase in the number of gully dams: 21 are operational although not always fully used
or in the right places. As noted previously by the Panel much smaller gully dams or ponds
located close to the owner’s house would be better utilized.


                                                  6
          Cattle numbers are increasing while buffalo numbers are declining



        As for livestock, there have been further increases in the numbers of cattle and buffalo
on the plateau to approximately 4,000 at December 2015, an increase of about 13% over June
2015. Vaccination rates continue to improve and are well above the Lao national average.
After two years where numbers increased significantly, there was a 8% decrease in the
number of small livestock in 2015.
2.2    Future risks
         The main risks to further development of agriculture are well set out in the Action
Plan. Evidence is from early adopters that after three or four years cassava will no longer be
viable. Finding more sustainable alternatives and publicizing them is a high priority for MAF
and NTPC researchers. Converting farming to methods which develop and protect soil
fertility is becoming urgent and ploughing of arable land should if practiced largely be
contour ploughing not up and downhill, since the latter facilitates leaching of the thin soils in
the wet season and reduces moisture retention in the dry1. The attention of the cassava
processing company should be drawn to this point.
       The current numbers of cattle and buffalo on the plateau are well above the estimated
carrying capacity of 3,500. The original estimate of capacity made several years ago was



1
  A small proportion of cassava cultivation is on additional lands, the drawdown zone and reservoir islands
where ploughing is prohibited by the CLT Regulations. Most cassava cultivation is taking place on the .66ha or
.22ha plots, where it is not expressly forbidden.

                                                           7
however a best guess in a wide range and might now be different. Since then there has been a
substantial increase in land used for pasture or fodder cropping, with or without the use of
barbed wire, so that feed intensity has also increased. A review of carrying capacity would be
in order.
        Up until now, agricultural development has been extensively subsidized by the project
in terms of access to materials and irrigation systems. There is a real question whether
villagers (especially less well-off households) will continue this development if they have to
incur these expenses themselves.
        Overarching all this development are strong demands to increase the area of available
agricultural and pastoral land to serve a growing population and to meet the demand created
by the turn to agriculture. This may require decisions on the use of community forest lands
for agriculture and pastoral activities, as permitted by Community Land Titling (CLT)
regulations. We discuss this topic and our suggestions for the Action Plan at greater length in
a separate chapter on land.
2.3   Our suggestions
        We suggested to the JWG setting objectives for further crop increases from cultivated
0.66ha and additional agricultural land (0.22ha), further agro-forestry, a net increase in
irrigated plots, and replacement of cassava by crops that do less long-term damage to the
land. The AP sets some objectives for promoting the further use of allocated agricultural plots
and increasing agriculture productivity through soil fertility improvement. We suggested that
the JWG review these targets to see that they were consistent with our suggested overall
outcome for increases in sustainable cropping.
        We also suggested reviewing the estimate of carrying capacity in relation to available
feed and setting an objective for the herd size for each hamlet accordingly. Farmers see large
animals as a store of wealth rather than a tradeable commodity but we also support the efforts
to create a market in livestock so that sales can contribute more regularly to household
income.
       We would also like to see more emphasis in the AP on developing small livestock -
especially chicken and pigs - as a business. This is likely to be of particular interest to
women, since it combines well with their other commitments.
        The AP covers repair of existing gully dams but not irrigation systems. The NTPC
plan for replacing systems on demand ought to be incorporated as a target. We discussed
setting a target of operational systems serving 65% of all irrigable plots – NTPC wished to
reserve its position on that figure.
2.4   The medium term
         The program up to the end of 2017 set out in the Action Plan is designed to dovetail
with a proposed five-year medium term project to be co-funded by AFD and NTPC. The
activities (with our suggested targets and additions) set out for RIP closure should fit well
with the medium-term project and should not be held up waiting for the detail of that project
to emerge. The project will continue with these trends to a wider variety of marketable crops.
It also recognises the continuing importance to Lao families of rice and includes both finding
more land for rice cultivation and improving yields, particularly of paddy.
2.5   Required capabilities
       Overall, the resettlers will need continuing support to help them make decisions about
the productive use of their land, particularly in their appraisal of the options available to them

                                                    8
for crops and livestock. The tasks are now mostly a shared responsibility of NTPC and the
District, particularly DAFO, but they will increasingly fall on DAFO. DAFO, possibly
working with a Lao Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) backed by a French NGO, may
also be the executing agency for the medium-term project.
        DAFO will need to maintain and develop its capacity for technical advice and for
working with villagers on land use for zoned community land. The Action Plan recognises
this with its objective to mobilise a long-term program for DAFO. We would emphasize that
this aspect of the handover needs to start without delay. DAFO is grossly over-committed,
understaffed, and has a policy of circulating staff between districts every two or three years.
This agency has not only to oversee and provide technical advice to the resettlers on the
whole range of livelihood activities but also has been handed responsibility under Decree 471
for fostering livelihood development across the 31 watershed villages with a population of
over 7,000 dwellers. DAFO will also be involved in helping implement the new
Government’s (very welcome) Prime Ministerial Order 15 banning the export of unprocessed
logs and timber.
        We would accordingly be looking for visible evidence by the end of 2017 that DAFO
does have this increased capacity. Key skills needed in the agriculture and livestock sector
include not only technical expertise in cropping and animal husbandry but also the human
relations skills to facilitate participatory planning in the hamlets and, where necessary, to
mediate in disputes. In the POE’s view, the District ought also to employ a business
development and marketing adviser who can assist villagers with developing the income-
earning potential of their agriculture and livestock.
2.6   Objectives and indicators
      Outcome objective 1: increased value of agricultural outputs per unit of land,
produced by methods which protect and enhance the fertility of the soil.

          Improve irrigation potential (gully dams, smaller local dams and ponds,
           refurbished irrigation systems) with specific target (possibly 65%) for
           percentage of irrigable plots covered by functioning systems – NTPC now
           handing over to DAFO with access to funds from the Social and Environmental
           Remediation Fund (SERF) for maintenance.
          Promote use of allocated agricultural plots (fencing, agro-forestry, paddy, wet
           season vegetables) – NTPC with staged handover to DAFO
          Further large livestock vaccination campaign – NTPC with handover to DAFO
          Establish enclosed grazing pasture, forage plots, fodder garden for large and
           small ruminants; areas in the current community forest lands can be identified
           for these uses – NTPC with staged hand over to DAFO
          Support for local small livestock raising (pigs, chickens) as a business – NTPC
           with handover to DAFO, possible District business and marketing adviser.
          Get the medium-term development programme to be co-funded by AFD and
           NTPC underway before December 2017 and into its assessment phase – project
           management working with DAFO and NGOs
          Deploy DAFO capability necessary for the handover from NTPC and its longer-
           term role in development including technical advice, extension services managed
           by an experienced field officer from MAF and support for planning and
           management of community forest lands – primarily DAFO directly but with
           support from MAF for staffing and budget requirements.

       NT2 COMMUNAL FORESTRY: INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES




                                        VFDC Sawmill

3.1   The situation
         The forestry sector was supposed to contribute up to one third of resettler incomes,
but so far has failed to live up to anything near that expectation and has been the least
successful of the five project pillars. There is a long history of mismanagement of the
resource and encroachments by outsiders and resettlers themselves. The VFDC has paid only
small dividends since 2012 and is unlikely to pay anything more this year. The villagers have
lost interest and any sense of ownership in the forests they were told were theirs. More than
one villager suggested that the forests should be locked up and left to grow and be at least a
source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs).
3.2   Action Plan
        It doesn’t have to be this way. We were heartened by the relatively upbeat tone of the
draft Action Plan for the pillar. From an effective production area of around 20,000 ha it
estimates that with better management, profits could be substantially increased – even
doubled - without increasing the size of the annual log cut, while maintaining good forest
stocks and protecting biodiversity. The natural regeneration characteristics of the species mix
in the community forest lands should mean that little or no reforestation or planting of trees
should be required for some time.
       At the same time the draft is realistic in listing and assessing the risks and challenges
ahead if the pillar is to be saved. It stresses the need for an “enabling environment” to be
created and is well aware of the challenge involved in re-engaging the villagers in all 16
hamlets.


                                                   11
3.3   Where from here?
        There is no chance of turning the sector around in the next 18 months to exploit this
resource efficiently and sustainably, but a start could be made. A consensus among the major
players – MAF and its Department of Forestry (DOF), NTPC, the District and Provincial
Governors and the IFIs - on setting up a truly communal forestry operation and devising a
strategy to achieve this is an essential first step. Nothing will change without this. The
strategy would have to provide for a longer-term management plan based on a full forest
inventory and with external support for forest development, improved forest management
techniques with a team of technically qualified people, and a VFDC restored to profitability
with upskilled management. The plan should cover all community forest use and not just
timber harvesting.
3.4   Required capabilities
         There would also, as stated in POE Report 24, have to be changes in the mandate of
the VFDC – now in essence restricted to a harvesting, processing and selling role - and in the
mobilization of hamlet support for the agreed changes across the sector. The District
Governor and DAFO would have a role in the latter exercise, moving to reactivate Hamlet
Forest Management Committees (HFMCs) in the 16 Hamlets as envisaged in the CA. Their
initial functions would be to take part in the forest inventory, set up forest patrolling and
oversee the collection of NTFPs.
        The VFDC would concentrate in future – if the villagers agree – on harvesting and
milling, large scale transport and marketing functions, and report through the mill manager to
a reconstituted Communal Forestry Management Board. This will require an upgrading of the
VFDC’s planning, management and financial skills achieved through the provision of
external technical assistance. Establishing a Management Board would involve the Nakai
District Governor consulting with the resettlers and MAF on whether the existing VFDC
Board might more appropriately be converted into a plateau-wide Communal Forestry Board
with a majority of HFMC members. This option is explored further in POE Report 24.
         To make all this work, all the stakeholders have to give their full support. Getting the
resettlers’ full participation in the decisions on options is crucial. So is the GoL’s role in
strengthening the enabling environment. The level of support in recent years for the NT2
forestry operation from national, provincial and district institutions has been minimal.
Effective support means ensuring that the forests are protected, giving professional forestry
advice and support at the Ministry, District and provincial level, and facilitating the
production and marketing efforts of the VFDC. The AP sets out the requirements on the
GoL’s side in relation to forest management decisions, seeks technical expertise from the
GoL in co-management and support for the VFDC (or other appropriate implementation
institution) and calls for expanded protection of the forests through more patrolling by the
Provincial Office of Forest Inspection (POFI).
       There are heartening signs of GoL commitment in the recent Prime Minister’s Order
No 15 on controls of timber exports and exploitation of existing forests and also in the
commitment of the MAF to community-based forestry. Top level MAF support, advice and
action will be vitally important. We trust that the MAF Department of Forestry, under the
guidance of Ministers, will give priority to restoring the viability of the communal forest
operation along the lines proposed in the AP. Specifically we hope that MAF can release
some of its own top staff to help jump start the new ways of operating and draw up a formal
request to the World Bank to assist it over the next five years or so by providing the range of


                                                   12
technical assistance specified in the AP. DAFO will also need at least a forestry focal point
for monitoring purposes and to keep PAFO and MAF in the picture.
        Other actors must play their part too. The draft AP is not able to spell out where the
financial resources for the technical assistance required might come from. As we said in
POE24, the IFIs, notably the World Bank, should give early and urgent consideration to
helping with technical assistance. It would be timely also for the NTPC to re-engage in this
work, by assigning a suitably qualified staff member to monitor progress and provide
technical assistance where called for.
        We also underline again that recruitment of those chosen to help implement the
options for the future decided upon, whether they be Government employees or international
technical specialists, is important. The forestry sector in particular needs people who not only
have the necessary technical qualifications but have experience in working in small and still
relatively remote rural villages often populated by a group of ethnic minorities. Well
motivated and trained specialists are called for.
        Finally, we note that the AP accepts that proposals in its Agriculture and Livestock
section may result in changes to existing land uses and that with the assent of a majority of
resettlers, some community forest land could well be converted to agricultural or pastoral use.
Although any redesignation is unlikely to have a direct impact on the old forests, it needs to
be coordinated with the forest inventory exercise so resettlers are fully aware of the value of
the old forests when they make their decisions. We also call attention to the point made that
development of forestry-related skills should be taken into account under the Off-farm AP
training program.
3.5   A re-commitment
         The stakes in restructuring the NT2 forestry sector along the lines set out above and in
the AP are high for both the resettlers and the stakeholders. The risk of not getting the sector
on a proper footing is great. The history of Lao forestry shows that if you do not use it you
lose it – to others. This is the time – quite possibly the last opportunity - for a recommitment
to a key element of the NT2 livelihoods restoration work.

3.7       Major tasks by December 2017 and accountabilities
          Reach a GoL consensus at a Ministerial level on a strategy to actively promote
           the communal forestry approach in the NT2 hamlets and to design a forest
           management plan accordingly, taking into account the Prime Minister’s Order
           No 15 on forest management: MAF to take the lead in initiating this process
          Complete technical studies including forest inventory and NTFP component and
           develop a work plan: should technical assistance be approved by GoL and World
           Bank, specialists from the latter to undertake these tasks, in consultation with
           MAF, NTPC and District
          Authorization by District Governor of the setting up of HFMCs in 16 hamlets,
           with access to equipment and supplies and regular briefings by VFDC and
           external specialists and participation in the forest inventory, patrolling of forests
           and oversight of NTFP collection: District Governor, the NTPC Nakai
           Resettlement Office (NRO), and the GoL Resettlement Management Unit (RMU)
           to undertake respective tasks.
          Support for upgrading of VFDC sawmilling and marketing operations with

          Consultations by District and Provincial Governors with HFMCs on converting
           existing VFDC Board into a Communal Forest Management Board with wider
           membership of resettlers and wider management mandate including conflict
           resolution between hamlets, approving a consolidated Nakai Forestry Plan and
           work plan and overseeing the management of collective assets such as the
           sawmill: Governors and District to address.

           hamlets in areas such as planting of valuable trees, Assisted Natural
           Regeneration and enhanced timber processing ventures: VFMCs and
           Community Forestry Management Board to assess options and make decisions
           accordingly.
          Accelerated training programs at all levels to ensure transfer of management
           and technical positions to Lao as soon as feasible.
          Decisions taken on best use of expanding revenues, with an emphasis on lifting
           dividends to resettlers and reinvestment where appropriate: HFMCs and

       COMMUNITY LAND USE




                         Second Generation housing, Nam Nien


4.1   The situation
        The pressure on land on the plateau continues. During this mission it became clear
that land grabbing was widespread, encroachments and illegal use present in almost every
hamlet, and unresolved disputes growing in number. Several of the hamlets we visited raised
land disputes as a major concern. The District has put a stop to encroachment on forest lands
for swidden and several villages reported that they had been levied heavy fines. Allocation of
additional lands is continuing but in some hamlets has run into problems with lack of suitable
land or land already occupied. The allocation of additional agricultural land to eligible
families was so delayed that resettler families did not wait and went ahead clearing land for
rice cultivation. When land was eventually formally allocated, many eligible families found
someone already cultivating the land and refusing to give it up.
        Community land use rights are poorly understood. There are several reasons for the
current state of confusion. First is the lack of follow-up after awarding tenure documents, to
strengthen community understanding of what can and cannot be done on community land in




                                                  15
line with the CA requirement to develop a "partnership between villages and the Government
Authorities for joint management of forests, agricultural land, [and] other lands"2.

                              Community Land Titling Rules and Regulations
           In 2012, participatory land use planning (PLUP) and land zoning as required by the
    CA3, was completed in the 16 Nakai resettlement hamlets. Community land use zones
    included the (i) additional agricultural land required for second generation households taken
    from degraded VFA land areas, and (ii) forest land zones still termed VFA land, but with
    use and management devolved to resettler households in each hamlet.4
            Community Land Titles (CLTs) were issued in 2013 for each hamlet 5, together with
    CLT Rules and Regulations (R&R) on user rights over the different land use zones. These
    R&R were developed through stakeholder consensus, and clearly define the legal unit of
    entitlement for community land use. Customary rights were also clarified and included.
    Hamlet Land Management Committees (HLMCs) were then supposed to be formed by the
    NRO with the assistance of the RMU, and training provided to enable preparation of land
    use and management plans for the two key community land use zones (additional
    agricultural and forest lands), as required by the CA6. These activities are limited by scope7.

        Another reason for the current confusion is the limited knowledge at District level in
DAFO and the District Office of Natural Resources and Environment (DoNRE) of the
approved R&R for community land use. This is partly because knowledge has been lost due
to rotation of trained staff, partly to outsider encroachments and illegal land use, and partly to
the low priority placed by the Project until now, on participatory village land management
planning. For example, applications to graze livestock in community forest, although
allowable under the agreed R&R, have been refused by the District. This has led to poor
knowledge about land rights and responsibilities within village land management committees
(LMCs), resulting in disputes between hamlets and between households, with poorer
households and minority ethnic groups becoming more marginalised through failure to have
additional agricultural land. Where hamlets and households are deadlocked, the LMCs appear
unable to resolve the problem and the District appears reluctant to become involved in
dispute resolution beyond levying fines on those clearing forest land.
       Last year the POE agreed with the GoL and NTPC on a list of 413 second (or
subsequent) generation households (headed by children of the original resettlers) who, among
other benefits, would be allocated land for houses and gardens together with 0.66ha and
0.22ha plots. Since then substantial progress has been made in 14 hamlets: 60% of the
required housing plots have been allocated and 58% of required agricultural land. The
process has run into some difficulties finding adequate land in some hamlets and accessing
land which has been illegally occupied by other villagers. The progress made is substantial

given the limited land available and merits recognition. But meeting these overdue
entitlements remains a priority.
4.2       The Action Plan
        The problems that land issues present are set out in Action Plans dependent on land
availability for various activities. More land is needed for agricultural and livestock
proposals. Degraded land within zoned forest areas can be used for these purposes provided
the hamlets follow the decision making process outlined in the R&R. Any reallocation of
forest land should also be undertaken in close coordination with a forest inventory which
needs to identify existing viable timber stands, areas for regeneration, and locations of
NTFPs.
         Before reallocating forest land, however, a key priority is for the RO and RMU,
together with the District, to reach a clear mutual understanding of what can and cannot be
done, and by whom, on community zoned land areas, and to transfer this knowledge to
hamlets. This requires both training and resources allocated to the District and hamlet
organisations to undertake land use and management planning processes and to ensure that
planning outcomes are compatible with statutory District and village planning processes. Part
of this training should include land dispute mediation and resolution procedures for LMCs
and for the District, who need to become more involved in settling hamlet and village land-
related conflicts. It is recommended that the project first explores with Khammouane
Provincial Office of Natural Resources and Environment (PONRE) whether dispute
resolution training is available that was developed under the World Bank's Land Titling
Project, or from the current GIZ8 land management and village planning programme.

      Any land use and management plans need to be harmonised with statutory
       government village planning processes and outcomes
      Gender differences need to be accounted for in community land use plans, as
       women may be interested in different NTFP and livestock initiatives
      The needs of poor and vulnerable households must be given priority
      Marginalised ethnic groups, such as the Ahoe, must be given equal opportunity
       to have additional agricultural land, if eligible

5.1       The situation
        To date the Fisheries Pillar is the most successful of the livelihood pillars for the
resettlers, and at the present level of fishing effort it appears to be sustainable, as noted in
POE Report #24. This is important since fishing is perhaps the key pillar in overall
sustainability terms. Catch as reported by households varies widely from one month to the
next but seems to have been roughly stable or even slightly increasing in the last four years.
Most fish is consumed or sold fresh but a small number of households are drying and
smoking fish or fermenting it for fish sauce.
        As we reported last year, there are however some risks to sustainability of the fishery.
For obvious reasons, reliable estimates of the overall extent of illegal fishing are hard to
come by; but surveillance indicates that poaching by outsiders, particularly north of the
Thalang Bridge, may amount to as much as 25% of the total catch. Villages in the southern
zone also complain of incursions in their fishing zones by others, particularly from the
direction of Oudoumsouk.
         In addition, possibly 75% of the fish caught don’t pass through the legal landing
      9
sites . This is not evidence of illegal catch. Most of these fish are probably caught legally; a

lot are either taken home for the family pot or sold to other villagers. Other fish will be sold
to traders outside the legal sites. It was suggested to us that the VFGs may deliberately
overlook some landings to encourage traders and increase villagers’ income-earning
opportunities; and that the regulations were “under review” on this point.
        In the meantime, unregulated sales to traders are depriving VFGs of revenue which
was intended to contribute to the costs of fisheries management; if this is going to be a
deliberate policy it needs attention in regulation: a system whereby some trading is levied and
other trading is deliberately overlooked seems inherently unstable..
5.2       The Action Plan
Objectives
        The AP on Fisheries is very forthright on the needs, tasks and risks and is in large part
supported by POE. The value of the fishery to the resettlers can and should be maintained and
even increased in an equitable way while maintaining the biological sustainability of the
resource. The AP’s objective is that the fishery is well-managed and protected – we have no
problems with this but the ultimate test of the quality of management is that the resettlers
benefit from it in terms of the fish they can catch.
        The AP’s actions generally flow logically from the overall objective of management
and protection. The AP emphasizes several key areas where action is needed by the RIP
closure. These include identifying and protecting fish breeding areas; ensuring that resettlers
retain (or regain) their exclusive access to the reservoir fishery; continuing research on fish
catch and fish stocks for better management; strengthening registration and licensing,
patrolling and enforcement; reviewing and if necessary revising the fisheries co-management
regime; and improving fish marketing. We made some specific suggestions for actions based
on our own assessment of risks to a biologically (and economically) sustainable fishery, with
its catch fairly distributed amongst the resettlers.
Future risks and priority actions
5.2.1 Illegal fishing and marketing
        The catch estimates quoted above indicate that this remains a major problem
threatening the stability of the fishery. There are several issues:
          Patrolling is still not frequent or focused enough to be an effective deterrent to illegal
           fishing or trading;
          This issue is particularly urgent in the reservoir area between the Thalang bridge and
           the dam where there is joint jurisdiction between the provinces, districts and WMPA
           units; at present there are only very occasional patrols and both fishers from outside
           and illegal traders appear to have almost total freedom to operate in the area;
          The poor level of enforcement is reflected in the continuing deterioration in
           compliance. In March 2015, about 70% of the 1,259 fishing boats on the reservoir
           were registered; only 112 fishing licenses were issued, compared with 398 the
           previous year.
       The AP has mostly appropriate actions and targets related to these issues. Particularly
important are:
          Effective cooperation on reservoir fisheries management, particularly by sharing
           information, patrolling including joint patrolling, identifying illegal fishing activity,
           and much more aggressive apprehension of those fishing or marketing illegally. This

                                                       20
       particularly requires both DAFO and WMPA to work closely with Village Fisheries
       Groups.
      Upgrading DAFO’s fisheries management capability: this is clearly required
       particularly for the improvement required in boat and fisher regulation; DAFO
       acknowledged to us that they need greater fisheries expertise – currently they have no
       fisheries specialist.
      Fixing up the split jurisdiction in the northern part of the reservoir area between the
       Thalang peninsula and bridge and the dam: this is a longstanding problem repeatedly
       addressed by the POE. Resolving it will require cooperation between the two
       provinces involved and the WMPA.
      Establishment of a northern outpost: WMPA, with the cooperation of the relevant
       district authorities, should establish a permanently manned northern outpost or patrol
       base at the site of the Old Sophia village or the dam site This is the only way to
       reduce the “wild west” of illegal fishing north of the Thalang bridge. The POE
       favours the Old Sophia site on the grounds that it enables a more comprehensive
       surveillance of fishing sites, would facilitate the provision of services to the remaining
       Ahoe families there and encourage the latter to switch from being poachers of both
       wildlife and fish to acting as conservators of both.
5.2.2 Ecological research and monitoring
        There is need to have good data on the locations and times of fish spawning, and of
other critical issues relating to the sustainability of the fish populations, including monitoring
to determine the impact of fishing effort on the various species of fish. Good data identifying
the locations and possibly timing of areas that should be protected from fishing are needed,
so that action can be then taken to establish the necessary protected areas. Good information
is being collected about the fish catches of a sample of the resettlers (quoted above – with a
coverage which is a multiple of the “official” recorded catch) and this should be continued
and consideration given to expanding it.
5.2.3 Establishment of Protected Areas
        As noted above, research by NTPC is needed to identify the areas that should be
protected because they are critical for the maintenance of the fish populations. The research
and protected area establishment should be completed well before the RIP is closed.
5.2.4 Fishing from the Thalang Peninsula
        The resettlers in the villages on the Thalang peninsula have very limited legal fishing
zones and it would be more equitable to provide them with additional fishing zones north of
the peninsula adjacent to their villages. At present, most of the adjacent area is a restricted
zone on the grounds that it is important for fish spawning. We hope that the fisheries research
data will enable a more finely-tuned protection zone to increase the fishing opportunities for
these villagers.
5.2.5 Improving fish processing and marketing
        Fisheries at present are a major component of the income generation for the resettlers.
Additional income could be obtained by improving access to markets and processing of low
value fish. These activities would also involve a large percentage of women. We have

       OFF-FARM ACTIVITIES




             PIZ villages like Pakataan have benefited from sealed road and
                                  electricity connections



6.1   The situation
       Off-farm activities concentrate on developing employment and business opportunities
outside the land (and reservoir) based occupations. NTPC activities focus on skills training,
marketing and business support, and finance for productive activities.
        Specific skills training continued in 2015 with 23 resettlers participating in cooking,
hairdressing, motorbike repair and tailoring courses. Total numbers engaged in these courses
fell from 43 in 2014. A continuing issue is the low rate of conversion into actual
employment. The AP reports that of the resettlers who completed training in 2013/2014 only
half are still applying their skills in income generation activities. The year 2015 also saw the
introduction of 13 longer-term scholarships at Khammouane Technical-Vocational College
and Savannakhet University – a welcome addition to the educational opportunities for
younger resettlers that should be maintained on an annual basis.
         Marketing and business support included “Happy Nakai” – a group of younger
volunteers established to support local business development (such as scarf weaving, wooden
crafts, leaf weaving, or painting.).
       There are also signs of a response in the villages to the emerging opportunities for
eco-tourism on the plateau. In Thalang we heard about boat tours to the watershed area and
the possibility of guided forest walks or overnight stays. With the completion of the “loop”

                                                   24
road through Laksao and the new bridge over the Mekong at Thakhek, and the advertising of
the Konglor cave as a major attraction, there should be more opportunities for services to
more adventurous tourists, particularly at the northern end of the resettlement area and into
the watershed .
6.2    Village Development Funds
        Village Development Funds (VDFs) finance a much wider range of activities than
off-farm business but they are covered in this pillar of the AP so we comment on them
generally here.
       There was a 28% increase in cumulative loan disbursements: from VDFs in 2015.
This represented a further modest increase in the share of broadly "productive" lending (small
business, fishing, farming) from 74% (2014) to 80% (2015). (The balance, broadly "non-
productive" lending – the distinction could probably be contested - covers mainly education,
medicine, and household expenses.) The off-farm category (“business plus micro-services”)
increased by 12% but the main factor was the big increase in demand for "agriculture" loans 10
which more than doubled from LAK (Lao Kip) 169m to LAK464m. The “at risk” rate (loans
more than 30 days in arrears) also rose from 5.7% of total lending in 2014 to 8.6% in 2015.
6.3    The Action Plan
        The draft off-farm Action Plan we saw strongly and usefully emphasized villager
participation and engagement in planning new activities but could be more clearly focused on
generating this broader range of income-earning opportunities.
        The section of the CA covering this pillar is designated “Training on other income
generating activities and technical support”. This gives focus to the pillar: the emphasis is on
income generating activities, which is the right emphasis for this phase of project
development. The test of success is that villagers have in fact increased the number and range
of their income-earning activities beyond those based on farming, fishing or forestry and that
these occupations can stand on their own feet, unsubsidised. So far, although the number of
new businesses has increased on the plateau, this pillar has yet to realise its full potential.
        A central issue is that the training effort of the past has had a fairly low conversion
rate into income generation. What is significant in terms of sustainability is not how many
villagers attended training courses but how many went on to establish income generation
ventures as a result. As indicated, the rate of conversion has not been spectacular.
         Part of the problem seems to us to be that the training is not embedded in a business
planning model with a clear focus on income generation. The social mapping pilot project
initiated in Nongbouakham last year, although by no means the first such effort at social
mapping in villages, seemed to engage villagers usefully and generated ideas which emerged
for community and infrastructure improvements were sound in general, gender sensitive and
realistic in their planning11. But the priorities produced for further development were more
socially oriented than directed at income generation.
        In responding to the draft AP, the POE has recommended some higher-level
objectives with a stronger business development approach, focused on income generation.


10
   A single category in 2015. We assume it is comparable with the 2014 classification of livestock plus
cultivation.
11
   Much of the section of the off-farm AP on planning activities could in fact form part of an overall village
participatory planning approach – we discuss this topic in Chapter 8 of this report.

                                                            25
The strategy starts with identifying market opportunities and then, with the active
participation of villagers, planning how to respond to them, certainly with focused training
but also with finance and advice on accessing markets. As an approach it may well be
applicable also to developing more resource-based businesses such as fish products, NTFPs,
small livestock or specific crops; it would certainly make sense for villagers to consider the
full range of these opportunities in their planning.
        An important part of a people development strategy for the resettlers is to consider the
different needs of different groups.
        First, there should be a focus in fostering off-farm activities among the better
educated young, the emphasis being on identifying job openings and linking them to training,
but also on the longer-term investment of further education which will equip the next
generation for leadership, innovation and further skills training, bringing young people into
the work force and preparing them to become agents for change. We liked the emphasis in
the AP on volunteer youth groups in surveying employment opportunities linked to market
openings and undertaking community development projects. They should be encouraged to
continue in these helpful roles.
       Second, to lift them out of impoverished or low status situations, women and minority
groups should be targeted, with informal village-based training initially given priority. The
AP usefully recognises in particular that women need training in the village to fit around their
other household commitments.
        The AP is stronger in listing general risks and “preconditions” for individual projects
than in defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The KPIs set out are more quantitative
than qualitative in character and thus amount to output measures rather than measures of the
more meaningful outcomes. It is the latter which will be important in relation to RIP closure
assessment.
        It should be noted finally that there is little attention paid to ecotourism development
in the AP apart from the listing of the opportunities opened up by the completion of the
“loop” road. Another paper on this, presumably involving ADB tourism development
expertise and an interested French NGO, is under preparation. The NTPC for its part has
begun playing an active part in this promising field of activity, working with both ADB and
the private sector. Our suggested objectives for this pillar make special mention of tourism.
        The POE accordingly suggested redrafts of the high level outcome, and sub-
objectives for 2017, set out in the Table below. It calls for a cohesive set of agreed activities
covering all livelihood sectors, including off-farm. This includes our attempt at some
appropriate KPIs. Where possible, we have suggested quantitative indicators which we think
should be measurable but we recognize that some outcomes are more qualitative in nature.
6.4       Capacity development
        The business development approach to off-farm income generation will place
additional requirements particularly on the District and the Villages. A lot of these have to do
with the social mapping approach adopted in the pillar AP, which we discuss as part of the
overall approach to village-level planning in Chapter 8. Specifically on business
development, though, we note the following:
          The Village Development Plan should include a village business development
           strategy covering market research, business planning, market development and
           training development. VDC members will need training in how to manage these
           processes, and some specialized facilitation will be required from the District.

                                                    26
          The District itself will need to consider how it can acquire expertise in market
           research and business planning to support village business planning.
6.5       Village Development Funds
        From the evidence available there appears to be sufficient capacity in the Village
Development Funds (VDFs) to meet demand for productive lending. The rise in the 30-day
arrears rate is a concern but repayment rates are still very good by the standards of micro-
credit institutions.
        The pillar contains an action to “Consult with Bank of Laos on converting village
funds into saving and credit union and implement the same.” This is at variance with the
recommendations of the consultant on VDFs12, which we supported in POE24, to maintain
village ownership of the funds but provide them with surveillance and support in the form of
a Network Support Organisation. The consultant argued that village ownership of the Funds
was one reason why the at-risk rates were kept low. We agree and continue to support his
recommendations.

income-earning activities.

7.1   Poor and vulnerable households
7.1.1 Introduction
        The Action Plan for Poor and Vulnerable households contains a clear statement of
measurable objectives consistent with the requirements of the CA and has a well-reasoned set
of activities for ensuring they are achieved by the end of 2017. The introductory sections to
the draft plan generally recognise and address the issues raised by the POE in its Report 24.
We would underline the importance of the following points.
7.1.2 Specific comments
        Accurate identification of households eligible for assistance: We agree that the two
main categories of “vulnerable” and “poor and lagging” have to be identified case by case.
We would draw a distinction between those lacking basic resources (the poor) and those
potentially or actually vulnerable to external events beyond their control, such as unusual
weather events or a drop in commodity prices (the vulnerable). The Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS) sample survey will identify only the likely incidence of
poverty amongst resettler households. Although we note that NTPC has identified 27
households in the “poor and lagging” category, there is some doubt that all such households
have been identified. Accurate identification of individual households in poverty requires
continuing detailed monitoring during RIP by NTPC and appropriate similar means of
monitoring by the district authorities after closure. The stakeholders should also consider how
households can self-identify or how hamlets and villages could help identify households in
these categories.


                                                  29
       Qualifying households: We note that natural growth households will all qualify for
the support available to both categories of supported households but that the eligibility of
subsequent growth households is under review. We would urge that the stakeholders consider
extending support to these households on the same basis as original and natural growth
households.
       Assistance for vulnerable households: The POE is pleased that, under the Social
Safety Net (SSN) for vulnerable households, NTPC will backstop the District’s proposed
kinship support system (the efficacy of which will, we note, be tested by a pilot) with a
guarantee of cash support, until 2035. We assume that the rate of NTPC cash assistance
would be based on raising vulnerable households to the official poverty threshold.
        Support for poor and lagging households: Support is, as we read it, to be based on
plans in place for each individual household to attain sustainable livelihoods by the end of the
RIP, through the support of the NTPC “special program” and the SSN. Apart from a
reference to access to land and to livelihood programs, the content of the special program is
not developed in the draft Action Plan and needs to be spelled out. We recognise that the
detail will largely be supplied in the plans for the livelihood pillars, specifically flagged for
these households. Although the objective is to have all households in this category supported
by the end of the RIP, continued support may be required beyond RIP, and it will be
important to see what commitments of staff and resources the District will be able to make to
this ongoing support.
        Design of support: We agree that the appropriate unit of support is the household.
However, specific programs for which poor and lagging households are eligible, to equip
them to develop sustainable livelihoods, may well need to be designed to reflect their
ethnicity, gender composition, or status as new natural growth households. For some of these
projects the appropriate focus may well be the hamlet.
        Households’ changing status: This is particularly important for households who,
over time, may move into “vulnerable” status. This guarantee should extend to households
who have the misfortune to become “vulnerable” during this period.
7.1.3 Objectives and indicators
       Overall outcome: Poor and vulnerable resettler households achieve, and can
sustain, incomes above the poverty line

        Objective                                        Indicators by 31.12.17

7.1.4 Major tasks by December 2017 and accountabilities
          Review and update method and criteria for identifying poor, lagging and
           vulnerable households particularly to take into account changes in household
           status – NTPC with support from District and Village administrations
          Determine eligibility of natural growth households for support – NTPC and
           GoL.
7.2       Ethnic minorities
       The draft AP addressing cross-cutting issues for ethnic minorities represents a
substantial advance in collective stakeholder thinking on ethnic minority issues. It sets out a
more positive and comprehensive program for achieving the objectives of the Social
Development Plan (SDP), the CA and the Safeguard Policies of the World Bank and the
Asian Development Banks than has hitherto been attempted by the NT2 project
implementers. This is encouraging.
7.2.1 Outcomes for ethnic minorities
           The high-level objectives in the draft Action Plan pillar are:
          Ensure that resettler ethnic minority households benefit, wherever eligible, from
           support under the SSN, the special program for poor households, free healthcare and
           other relevant programs, to take care of their basic needs. [We would add equal
           participation in all levels of education.]
          Improve the socio-economic status of ethnic minority households on a sustainable
           basis through tailored livelihood support.
          Foster self-reliance among ethnic minorities by facilitating their full and equal
           participation in political, economic and public life.
        These objectives are all highly relevant and focused on outcomes for minorities. We
support them. The challenge is to define them in terms of measurable objectives and KPIs
that can be achieved in the relevant time period.
7.2.2 Reaching ethnic minorities
       An important safeguard for ethnic minorities is the recognition in the CA and
elsewhere of the integrity of hamlets within consolidated villages. The draft AP commented
that:
           “There is a risk that the vulnerable groups will be unable to have their say in village
           decisions, particularly where their communities have been merged (even if only
           administratively) with communities where other ethnic groups are dominant. These
           groups could lose out in resource allocation, including in allocation of new resources
           available, for example through the NT2DF, and village decisions might not reflect
           their capacities and preferences, with feedback to the risks explained above. “
        We agree, and would go further to say that in cases coming to our attention, this loss
of ethnic identity and voice within the larger village unit is a reality. Both in terms of
securing minorities’ rights and focusing development programs specifically on minorities, the
hamlet is the relevant unit of organisation.
       Protecting the separate existence of hamlets within consolidated villages is an
important means of securing ethnic minorities’ rights. Some important rights of ethnic
minorities are better secured at the level of the hamlet. We would underline in particular the

                                                      31
legal right of the hamlets, acting collectively, to make decisions about land use. The
Community Land Titling (CLT) rules and regulations are very specific that decision making
about CLT land is vested in the hamlet, not the consolidated village. Many activities
benefiting ethnic minorities (such as training or livelihood development) are also better
directed to hamlets. This entitlement needs to be recognized in this AP in particular but
across the range of APs as well.
        Similarly, we endorse the AP’s recognition that livelihood programs and training
opportunities to benefit ethnic minorities need to be targeted at the hamlet level. There is
considerable evidence that the stated risk that poorer hamlets do not receive sufficient
benefits from livelihood activities and fall behind other groups is in fact a reality now.
7.2.3 The Ahoe
         The views of the POE on Ahoe issues are well known and covered in detail in POE
24. We would only note here that the case for a WMPA post in Old Sophia is based at least as
much on the need to monitor and regulate illegal fishing and fish marketing and wildlife
poaching in the northern part of the reservoir as it is, for example, on fostering development
activities among the Ahoe families there.
7.2.4 Future capabilities to address ethnic issues
        The AP pillar on ethnic minorities does illustrate the advantage of utilizing the
knowledge and skills of a professional ethnic minorities specialist for such work. The next
step, perhaps already contemplated, would be for NTPC to engage such a person on a more
permanent basis to oversee implementation of the AP. Implementation will not be an easy or
short-lived task, which is freely acknowledged by the AP’s authors.
        The draft identifies the need for NTPC and GoL staff to be able to communicate more
effectively with minority groups and envisages hiring a local facilitator with “… relevant
experience, and knowledge of not only Lao but also minority languages as well (if possible)."
The report notes that such a person has already been hired but what is unclear to the POE is
whether this consultant will simply undertake the livelihoods and expectations review or will
remain on the staff to oversee implementation. The latter seems highly desirable. An
alternative is to appoint as facilitator another suitably qualified person to carry the ambitious
program through to fruition.
7.2.5 Objectives and indicators
       Overall outcome: ethnic minorities can secure the same basic rights and enjoy
the same standards of well-being as other groups of resettlers, while maintaining their
cultural identity and autonomy.

 *Allowing for differences in mix of livelihoods appropriate for different ethnicities and
 locations.
        Measurement of the indicators in this table would generally be by identifying
ethnicity in the appropriate monitoring survey. The AP refers particularly to the use of the
QSEM and LSMS surveys for measuring performance on socio-economic indicators. The
survey methodology for QSEM9 on Ethnicity adopted an appropriate definition of ethnicity,
which we assume will be followed for further QSEM and LSMS surveys. There may be
specific requirements for oversampling for specific smaller ethnic groups to provide a
reasonable degree of statistical precision in reported statistics.
7.3   Gender
7.3.1 Introduction: process and outcomes for the pillar
         The Action Plan for Gender develops quite a complex approach to ensuring that a
gender dimension is embedded into all of the activities of the Action Plan. Each activity is
scored G1, G2 or G3 (highest) depending on their relative relevance to women, and most
activities are accompanied by a comment on how gender should be addressed in the activity.
Gender assessments are informed by three broad outcomes: endowments (women’s health,
nutrition and education), economic opportunity (women’s economic power and control of
assets in livelihood activities), and agency (women’s voice and influence in family, village
and wider society).
7.3.2 Moving from process to results
       This pillar is mostly about process and not results. This is appropriate in a program
which is based on mainstreaming gender priorities. But it does mean that not much will be
found in this Pillar Plan which actually directly delivers results of benefit to women – it is
necessary to look elsewhere for that. The whole of Objective 1, for example, is aimed at
developing a systematic approach to gender mainstreaming. Objective 2 is a general approach
to developing gender awareness in local government and holding it to account. Objective 3 is
about supporting women’s efforts to empower themselves and developing advocacy for
gender equality, although there are specific actions related to literacy and numeracy and

                                                  33
responding to domestic violence. These measures to support women’s priorities through
community action are of value: for example making district training more tailored to men’s
and women's different focuses in hamlets and (critical, as the AP notes) capacity building of
district and hamlet-level women's organisations. But – apart from the few specific actions
noted above - they are difficult to connect directly to improved outcomes for women.
7.3.3 Outcomes for women, their definition and measurement
        The NT2 Framework for the Pillar defines the outcomes – endowments, economic
opportunity, and agency – but in very broad terms. The gender project on Nakai ought to look
for specific results in each of these spheres. We would be looking for evidence of
improvement in the welfare and status of women under each of these headings; that there is
evidence of positive change in women’s lives in endowments, economic opportunity and
agency. We have not got as far as identifying KPIs for each of these but have some
suggestions below.
       Endowments:
        There are commonly accepted measures of improvement in women’s health and
nutrition and education.
       Economic Opportunity:
        Each of the four pillars will have specific activities which enable women to combine
income-earning with family commitments; success will be measured in the income they earn
and their own valuation of the satisfaction and independence it gives them. Although it is not
all about income, it would be helpful to have some idea of women's contribution, in cash and
in labour terms, to the household economy. A useful indicator would be the percent of
women's contribution to household income. This could be measured in terms of unpaid work
in household livelihood activities together with cash income derived from activities for which
they are primarily responsible.
        The treatment in the pillars of women’s role relevant to economic opportunity is
rather uneven. Specific comments on each of the pillars:
      Agriculture and livestock: there is no discussion of the relative roles of women and
       men in the pillar and the comments on the gender markets tend to be rather formulaic;
       e.g. “gaining additional experience is required for both men and women; ensure fair
       participation of women”. More attention to the relative preferences of women for
       activities which suit their other commitments would be useful: e.g. to small livestock
       (although chickens do rate a mention) or home gardens.
      Fishing: there is quite a good discussion of the effects of the inundation on women’s
       role in fishing and their dominant role in fish processing; also of their representation
       on sector institutions. There perhaps could be more attention therefore to actions to
       support the development of processing.
      Forestry: a gender perspective is yet to be developed. There is a discussion in the text
       of the proven value of NTFPs as a forest use which has not yet found its way into the
       action plan. Given women’s traditional role in harvesting NTFPs, it deserves
       treatment there.
      Off-Farm: the pillar plan specifically seeks to identify women as a target group for
       activities and sets a gender balance target for business activities led by women.
       Specific mention is made of the role of women in tourism. Separate women's off-farm
       plans could be developed, hamlet by hamlet, following a participatory planning

                                                  34
       approach. Indicators could be: 70% of women's off-farm plans completed and started
       implementation by June 2016; and percent of income derived from women-led off-
       farm businesses. This first needs to assess women's skills, needs and potential in each
       hamlet, including how to generate business ideas, what is the marketing potential of
       each idea, do women want to work as a village group, smaller group, individually, or
       a mix of these, and how to develop business plans.
       Agency:
        This can be measured in the conventional terms of women’s participation and
leadership roles in village institutions and in employment; also in evidence of access to legal
rights and protections. A direct approach might be simply to ask a sample of women each
year whether their lives had improved in these respects.
7.3.4 Objectives and Indicators
      Overall outcome: women’s health and well-being are secured and they move
progressively towards equal status with men in education, control of income and assets
and voice and influence in public life.
       Note: the indicators below are aspirational. In practice the POE would be looking for
evidence of significant improvements by 31.12.17 over a baseline.

         LOOKING BEYOND THE RIP: THE MEDIUM TERM DEVELOPMENT
PLAN




                             Village Committee, Khon Khaen


8.1     Introduction
        The POE’s advice on closure of the RIP in December 2017 will be based on the
evidence that the resettlers are, overall, on the path to sustainable livelihoods. As indicated in
the text, this depends primarily on evidence about performance in each of the pillars. But RIP
closure, as numerous people have pointed out, is an arbitrary milestone imposed by the CA. It
has significant contractual consequences in that the role of the company changes from
primary agent of the development project on the plateau, to manager of a hydro station and
sometime funder and monitor of that development. However, although there will be change
of responsibilities for carrying development forward, RIP does not spell the end of that
development. As advisers on the conditions for sustainable development, we have to look
beyond this putative date of closure. Therefore what the POE sees as the Medium Term
outcomes described below are those required to meet RIP closure. These link to what we see
as Longer Term outcomes, which will be pursued after RIP and over the continuing
development process supported by both NTPC and GoL during the subsequent two decades.
8.2     RIP and the Medium Term
         The following factors come into play:
Sustainable Institutions
      (1) The institutions of government should be in place to provide a robust institutional
          framework for among other things: (i) protection of the resettlers’ collective and

                                                    36
          individual use rights on land and in the reservoir; (ii) resolution of conflicts in and
          between hamlets and villages; (iii) maintenance of the public assets of the plateau;
          (iv) delivery of social services such as education and health, and; (v) support for the
          self-governing institutions of hamlets and villages.
      (2) The hamlets and villages themselves should be able to govern themselves within their
          sphere of planning and decision-making.
       The principles of the GoL’s Sam Sang philosophy apply here: villages as the
development unit, districts as the integration unit, and provinces as the strategic unit.
Sustained Development
        Assuming that the RIP were to close in December 2017, the development process will
continue to engage all the development partners: hamlets and villages, government, donors
and the company. The company will not go away on that date – the shareholders have
signalled their intention to stay engaged by the creation of the NT2 Development Fund and
retention of core staff. Donors have also signalled their intention to remain engaged with the
funding of major projects in farming and tourism – we hope that forestry will be included as
well. But there are two consequences:
      (1) Leadership of the development process clearly becomes the responsibility of the GoL.
          That is what a handover means. Many of the programmes currently being managed by
          the company will pass to hamlets, and to District officials and in some cases require
          direct support of Provinces and of Ministries in Vientiane, in each case working with
          Village Authorities and Village Development Committees or VDC sectoral sub-
          committees.
      (2) There will be important contributions required from all partners to the planning,
          funding and implementation of development projects; coordinating plans and
          harmonising systems will become a significant factor.
8.3      Building local capabilities
8.3.1 Role of the District
        The key to the success of both these objectives - sustainable institutions and sustained
development – is a well-endowed and capable District administration. Post-company, there is
no alternative: the District has to step up; the plateau cannot continue to be run as one big
company town – and the international development partners and their projects come and go –
they cannot take on the task either. There has been a lot of rhetoric about handover in the last
few years and some steps – such as co-location of District and NRO staff – to prepare for it.
But despite reports from independent reviews such as Dr Rita Gebert’s 2014 study13, together
with the regular monitoring reports of the POE and others, that the District was not ready to
take on the lead role in governance and development, there is still some way to go to resource
the District appropriately with budget and expertise.
         We have discussed some of the requirements for strengthening the District in the
pillar chapters of this report. To summarise: the District needs not only in-house technical
skills in advising on cropping, animal husbandry, fisheries and forest planning and
management but also in facilitation of participatory planning, business development and

                                                             37
marketing and disputes resolution (particularly with respect to land). The GoL must support
this by resourcing a staffing plan and overall budget for the District. Of particular importance
is keeping qualified staff in the District for longer; at present staff sometimes get moved on
just as they are gaining the experience to be really valuable to the District administration.
        We have made specific mention of the requirements for DAFO in other sections of
this report. The POE discussed the situation during the mission with the Deputy Minister of
MAF, Dr Phouangparisak Pravongviengkham, and received a sympathetic hearing. The
Ministry is beginning to recognize that substantial new District resources are going to be
needed to cover this extensive and demanding mandate, hopefully including secondment of
some of its experienced staff to Nakai DAFO in areas like fisheries expertise, forestry and the
all-important agricultural extension services, at present staffed by recent graduates who may
be keen but lack practical experience and are largely ”volunteers”. Movement towards
livelihood sustainability by the end of next year will not be attained without help in supplying
high quality people from MAF. At the same time the project must keep the Ministry fully
informed of its activities and plans. MAF feels somewhat out of the loop at the moment.
        The NTPC will also have to lift its game in some areas if the December 2017 deadline
is to be met. The POE has the impression that the NTPC operation in Nakai has been
weakened by the release of a number of key middle level managers in Vientiane and on the
Plateau. Continuity and institutional memory have been affected and new or reassigned staff
sometimes appear over-burdened by their responsibilities. Staff numbers and expertise in
Nakai and in Vientiane too need bolstering if the AP’s targets are to be met and continuity
maintained in the years ahead. Greater budgetary allocations over the next period and
recruitment of well-qualified new staff would appear to be called for as a consequence. The
POE awaits the Annual Implementation Plan, apparently now covering the next 18 months,
with interest.
        At the same time, NTPC has to prepare to give the lead to the District on the
development project. There is little doubt that company-led development has been a source of
some friction with the District. There are fears now that the District will be left out of
calculations in the period to closure, the transition and the medium and longer term. First:
that the District will be pushed aside in the rush to closure (including the possibility of some
expedient actions which are not good for the longer term) but also that the GoL is going to be
saddled with a lot of tasks in the AP’s List of Actions which will fall – because there is no
alternative - on the District administration. Second, that in the longer term, when closure
occurs, the District will be left with the responsibility for further action, but without any
effort having been made to equip them for it over the intervening 18 months. Third, that the
development plans post-closure seem also to push the District aside in favour of NGOs (there
has obviously been some annoyance in the District at the Meechai Viravaidya Foundation
experiment which officials see as cutting across and duplicating planning which is already
done by the District and villages) and development funding effectively run by the donors
(including NTPC).
        While these concerns may be a little mutually contradictory, they send a pretty clear
message with which the POE agrees: that in the longer term, the GoL has to be primarily
responsible for the well-being and development of the people of the plateau; that
responsibility will fall primarily on the District Administration; and that so far the District
has not been properly resourced to do the job nor sufficiently responsive to many of the
issues currently impeding progress.
        The vicious cycle has to be broken. The District Administration, working with the
villages, has to take primary responsibility for governance and development in Nakai; GoL
                                                   38
has to commit the resources to enable the District to do it; and transfer of responsibility and
appropriate resourcing has to start now.
8.3.2 Strengthening village planning and management
        As noted in the discussion of the requirements on villages in the pillars, improving the
skills of VDC members to take over the planning role is an urgent task. Lifting the planning
skills and capacity of the resettlers has been too long delayed and must now be accelerated.
This is also a national priority, and needs to go beyond preparing a 5-year shopping list for
incorporation into District plans. Much of the remaining programmes in the various sectors
will be planned and determined henceforth, as originally envisaged by the CA, by the VDCs
through participatory processes. Such processes at this stage of the Project need to focus
primarily on livelihoods development and existing community land use and management.
Participatory planning is a sensitive and time-consuming process to mount and successfully
implement, so must be well prepared and initiated quickly. It is important that the VDCs
become much more involved in the planning exercises which lead to the District, Provincial
and national plans. While the NTPC has committed to providing some funds right through to
2035 the task of maintaining successful livelihood programs will increasingly have to be
funded from GoL budgets and include more contribution in ideas, cash and kind from
resettlers themselves. The competition for scarce resources will become more intense. So it is
important that the Nakai District, backed by the VDCs, is able to present well prepared plans
for the future.
        A particular requirement is strengthening the administrative capabilities of the Village
Authority and Village Development Committees (VDCs). The POE held talks with VDC
members in nine of the sixteen hamlets. It was apparent that in most cases there is little
logistic or advisory support available to either the naibans (village chiefs) or the VDC.
Records of hamlet meetings are not readily to hand, basic texts like the Land Law and land
use regulations, and even the villagers’ contributions to the District Plan, are not available to
VDC members – or have been mislaid. Basic aids like the land use maps prepared for each
hamlet are missing. The standing of the VDCs, intended to be the linchpin of the village
planning and implementation processes in the years ahead, is weak. Naibans are paid
something for their time but there are few other inbuilt incentives for VDC members to
devote time and energy to this work, and many are tired of the years of meetings under the
Project. While excessive bureaucratization of the village participatory processes would not
necessarily be helpful, some basic facilities, equipment (including basic computers, allied
with training in their use for VDC members with aptitude for IT), supplies, information and
incentives to perform – including payment for work performed - are required.
8.4   Future Governance and Management of the Nakai Development Project
        The evolving Nakai development program after RIP will involve all the major
stakeholders. The pillar APs clearly identify who is accountable for each activity and also
identify linkages with other actors up to RIP but the arrangements for coordination and
harmonisation of activities in the medium term were not spelled out as clearly in the drafts
available to us. The relationships are many and various, and a lot of the activities can make
demands on the same players and may cover the same topics, for example in GoL, NTPC
(and potentially AFD-funded) interventions in agriculture and livestock. The important actors
and institutions include:
       (1)     GoL and its constituent organisations: staff and budget for (especially) District
               and Province and its developed Village-District-Province-National planning
               hierarchy and timetable;

                                                   39
       (2)     NTPC: NT2 Development Fund;
       (3)     SERF;
       (4)     AFD/NTPC: joint funding (and co-governance) of the proposed 5 year Ag and
               Livestock project;
       (5)     World Bank: possible support for community forestry;
       (6)     ADB: Khammouane Tourism Project;
       (7)     Villages: ideas, planning, labour, village-based finance (VDF).
        There are other potential projects in the wings. In addition, as well as the actors
identified in the AP, there are others who may well play a valuable part, such as NGOs.
There is potential for a range of (confusing and not necessarily consistent) sets of rules and
practices for consultation, funding and procurement, decision-making, monitoring and
auditing.
        Most activities require the resettlers to give not only their labour and other
implementation contributions to project activities but their time in VDC and other institutions
to planning and monitoring. Several initiatives are emphasizing community-based
participatory planning. The GoL planning system and the Sam Sang principle start with a
village plan decided by the village as a community. There are similar participatory
approaches suggested for forestry, agriculture and livestock (the AFD project), further land
use planning, off-farm activities and related training, and the validation of the Action Plan
itself.
         These various initiatives need to be harmonised: not only because of the risk of
meeting fatigue with participative processes competing for villagers’ attention but because of
the risk of confusing and conflicting messages to the villages about priorities. The social
planning process involving a Thai NGO trialled in Nongbouakham, for example, has caused
considerable irritation in District government because it not only replicates work done in the
past but also cuts across the established government planning cycle. On the other hand, it has
inspired considerable enthusiasm from villagers themselves, and some clarified
responsibilities and contributions for a wide variety of activities. Recognising that village
planning undoubtedly requires support and facilitation from outside, the Village Plan could
be the central node of these processes, but as already mentioned above this is going to require
direct involvement of District staff in the initial stages at least, as well as commitment from
all the parties involved and support in the form of trained advisors, equipment, supplies and
probably payment to VDC members for attendance at meetings.
        During the RIP, there have been reasonably clear means of coordination between the
NRO, the RMU and the District Working Group (DWG), supplemented by day to day
working relationships between NTPC and District staff. In transition and following RIP
closure, responsibility for social and environmental programs will be progressively handed
over from NTPC to District. Other development partners will have to be considered as well.
The two biggest potential funders at present are NTPC with the NT2DF (together with social
safety net and SERF) and the AFD (jointly funding the five-year farming project with
NTPC). Future partners may include the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In
addition, funders may well wish to see other agents involved in technical assistance and
support roles, such as local or international NGOs. A new model for coordination clearly
needs to be developed, and without delay if RIP closure is to be achieved.
       The Sam Sang principles also apply here. To quote a recent review of Sam Sang:
“Multiple planning increases transaction costs for villagers – donor projects delivered
through line ministries often require separate village planning work because donors and

                                                   40
NGOs rarely use existing village or district development plans. Uncertainty about the amount
or timing of government budget can result in duplication [and] priorities identified by
villagers can be over-ridden by donor programs. … District staff interviewed for the study
emphasised their capacity to act as the integrative unit – coordinating donor programs,
foreign direct investment and government programs in their location so long as partners and
investors consult with them.”14
        In our view, therefore – and in terms of the GoL’s own philosophy and governance
principles - the District Administration should be the primary “switchboard” between the
other actors and the resettlers. This is why we have consistently emphasized building the
capacity of the District as critical: not only to provide technical and institutional support for
the villages but also to play a central role in medium and long term planning.
        We can’t avoid recognising however that “coordination” is not value free – it involves
reconciling competing interests. The District wants to be clearly in charge, but other actors
have their own priorities and need to satisfy their stakeholders that their resources are being
properly utilised. The RMU by taking authority away from local government line
administration has been a source of friction, we suspect partly because it was in the middle of
a three-way relationship between District administration, Provincial government and NTPC.
The Provincial Governor needs to sort this out with the District Governor and administration,
but our view is that the Provincial and national interests will be best served if the primary
responsibility for development planning and management rests with the District, with
supervision and support as appropriate from Provincial offices and the national Ministries.
        Arrangements for project planning and execution in both cases are not yet finalised.
In the case of the NT2DF, we were advised that "the principle is an administration of the fund
by NTPC, with a co-management by the GoL (District and Village level)." It seems15 that the
Company has been thinking about an arrangement with a separate Advisory Board (“in
charge of endorsement of projects”), Steering Committee (“in charge of the approval, the
monitoring and assessment of projects”) and Project Team (perhaps involving an NGO)
although with representation of District and Villages on the Steering Committee. For the
medium term agriculture project, two options were presented for governance16, one with two
Steering Committees at District and Provincial level and the other with a single District-level
committee. Both options would involve GoL representation at national, provincial and district
levels together with villages together with the technical assistance (TA) agent. The AFD
representative commented (with qualifications regarding the TA component17) that
“Whatever the chosen option AFD funds will be put at the disposal of the GoL to be allocated
to the project and then will follow the GoL procedure for implementation.” Implementation
would be by a blended team of district staff and the TA agent.
       The agriculture project governance and execution model would be the POE's
preference for wider arrangements for the overall medium and longer term Nakai

Development Project, perhaps with the addition of a funders’ representative who would have
delegated responsibility for monitoring of project choice and execution. At the execution
level the model has the major advantage of coordinating the communications between district
(and implementing partners) and the villages and particularly ensuring that participatory
planning processes can be harmonised under the umbrella of the GoL’s village planning
process.
8.5       Suggested further action
       As indicated, we were asked by the Joint Working Group to consider specifically
what arrangements might be required for governing and managing the development project in
the medium term. We have couched these as suggestions for inclusion in the general
introduction to the Action Plan.
          Future development on the plateau should be based on a District Development
           Plan, which should be prepared by integrating Village Development Plans.
           Village Plans based on participatory processes should bring together all elements
           of plateau livelihood development including sector plans for agriculture and
           livestock, forestry, fishing, off-farm activity and hamlet land use decisions.
           Participatory processes do not imply that all the community involved have to
           take part directly in every discussion – VDC sub-committees such as in forestry
           would be participatory but not necessarily involve those more involved in other
           sector consultations.
          Consistent with the Sam Sang principle, the longer-term Nakai Development
           Program should be governed by a Steering Committee with substantial
           representation of VDCs and with effective participation by the relevant
           Ministries (particularly MAF and Ministry of Natural Resources and
           Environment (MONRE), and Provincial and District governments and with
           representation as required of funders or their agents; the Steering Committee to
           be responsible for approval of the District Development Plan and specific
           projects within it and monitoring and assessment of projects and outcomes.
          The District Administration should be accountable to the Steering Committee
           for the formation of District Project Teams for each major livelihood pillar,
           consisting of relevant District staff together with TA agents and resettler
           representation and responsible for the implementation of projects approved in
           the District Plan.
          In preparation for a handover of primary responsibility for development to
           Villages and the District Administration, the relevant District (Sectoral) Offices
           need to be strengthened with capabilities in cropping, animal husbandry,
           fisheries and forest planning and management but also in facilitation of
           participatory planning, business development and marketing and disputes
           resolution (particularly with respect to land);
          The District needs to make the commitment to retain qualified staff for the next
           five years at minimum, and GoL at Provincial and national levels to support this
           strategy by endorsing the budgets and staff appointments required;
          The administrative capabilities of villages and particularly Village Development
           Committees need to be strengthened by training naibans in their role and
           considering increasing their stipends in line with national Sam Sang policy,
           providing them with basic administrative facilities, supporting VDC training in

                                                   42
how to manage participatory development processes, refreshing training on
applicable planning regulations, particularly on community land use in different
hamlets.

       CONCLUSION: THE BIG CHALLENGES
        The POE is concerned at the risk that the big tasks to be undertaken over the next year
and a half will be lost in the detail of this report. We are therefore spelling out below the
biggest and most difficult challenges as we see them. At the same time readers should
appreciate that the details in the body of the report are also important. And as elsewhere in
the text we are concerned that the accountable institution or agency is fully aware of its
responsibilities for particular actions. Hence the focus on institutions/agencies in the listing
below.
       Assessing the big challenges over the eighteen months to December 2017, the Panel
has concluded that they are, by institution or agency:
      GoL Ministers/Ministries: authorizing the changes in law enforcement practices
       which would result in the NT2 reservoir fishery and forests (and watershed) being
       effectively protected from major depredations.
      MAF/DOF/DAFO: filling the gap in forest sector oversight (created by the restriction
       of the VFDC to timber harvesting and sales) by helping manage the conversion of the
       pillar to communal forestry in which the resettlers start down the road leading to
       assumption of key planning and decision-making roles and by helping upgrade the
       VFDC’s operations in the cause of greater profitability.
      NTPC: strengthening its Nakai team by, for example, adding an experienced and
       inclusive middle level manager, maintaining its fishery expertise and creating a
       forestry and tourism development monitoring capacity.
      MAF, Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO) and DAFO: DAFO’s staff
       and budget being very substantially expanded to enable it to handle its multiple and
       widened roles in relation to strengthening village management, forestry pillar
       oversight, fishery sustainability and WMPA development programs.
      VDCs: being motivated and empowered to assume wider powers, funded and
       equipped to handle the tasks this entails, upskilled in planning and management and
       recompensed more adequately for their work.
      Resettlers in general: adjusting to a less dependent phase, accepting the challenge of
       forging their own futures and advancing further their gender- and age-specific
       attitudes to wider participation by women and the young in hamlet and village
       management and in income producing activities.
      World Bank and NTPC: deciding to underpin the forestry pillar’s rehabilitation by
       providing expertise at several levels for up to five years.
      NTPC: allocating a high proportion of the NT2DF funds to the Nakai District for
       management after RIP closure with appropriate monitoring and audit mechanisms in
       place.

    RESTRUCTURING THE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PROTECTION
AUTHORITY
                                                          David K McDowell and Lee M Talbot
10.1 Introduction
        The WMPA was created in 2001 to manage the NT2 watershed, later the Nakai Nam
Theun National Protected Area (NNTNPA) to ensure sustainability of both the area’s truly
outstanding biological diversity and the welfare of the watershed inhabitants. The overall
goal of management for the watershed is to restore, maintain and enhance the biodiversity,
habitats, and conservation values, as well as the cultural values, of the NPA and guarantee
sufficient volume of water with low sediment loads flowing into the NT2 Reservoir. Funded
by the commitment of the NTPC to provide US$ one million a year (indexed for inflation) for
the duration of the concession, the WMPA was created as a special unit, not a regular GoL
agency. Unfortunately it soon became clear that the WMPA was not realizing its mandate. By
2013 the POE stated that “the WMPA has been totally ineffective in protecting the
watershed’s biodiversity,” and by the following year two outside reviews of WMPA had
documented that the situation had become critical. Consequently GoL initiated action in 2014
to restructure and reorient the WMPA and created a task force to carry this out. The World
Bank offered additional funds and assistance to help with the process.
        However, almost two years later virtually everyone that the POE has consulted has
emphasized that there have been no real results and that the restructuring, etc., must be
considered a failure. While there has been some minor reduction in staff, many of the original
staff remain, albeit often in different jobs. Funding was reduced somewhat to reduce the
grossly expensive leadership and administration costs while maintaining the assistance to
villagers and the essential anti poaching patrols. However, the WMPA reportedly removed
funds from the village and patrol accounts to maintain what the World Bank called the
“bloated administration.” As a result the effectiveness of assistance to villages and the patrols
was significantly reduced. There has been little if any follow up by WMPA on the World
Bank assistance to the reorganization through the Second Lao Environment and Social
Project (LENS2) project, including provision of support for study tours for key personnel.
        It is clear that if the WMPA is to avoid becoming a total failure there must be an
effective strategy that calls for – and provides indicators of – identifiable achievements of
action to reorganize and restructure the WMPA without delay.
       A more detailed background to the above conclusions may be found in POE Reports
21A, 22 and 24. In the POE ’s view the time has come for a discussion among all WMPA
stakeholders and monitors on the strategy to be followed to rehabilitate and restructure the
WMPA. The Panel would support an early and representative meeting to propose decisions
on the way forward. Elements of a strategy should include the following:
10.2 Staff
        The present director of the WMPA Secretariat may be kept in place, but all other
members of the staff to be separated with the provision that they may reapply for positions
later. There may need to be some sort of a "redundancy" payment from WMPA funds,
removal costs covered where applicable and interventions with Departments where
appropriate to try to help them get a job. All new staff should be based on a strategic staffing
plan which is prepared, shared, cleared and adopted . Such a procedure would require a
professional consultant to develop. A new organigram would be required and it should be
discussed with the World Bank, Independent Monitoring Agency (IMA) and POE. Staff

                                                   45
should only be taken on as is consistent with the strategic staffing plan and organigram. No
new hires should be made until this process is completed.
        Other than the director, a complete removal of present staff is required, given the
situation of the WMPA. There is an urgent need to change the institutional culture of the
Secretariat. Since the culture is determined by the staff and leadership, changing the culture
requires changing the staff and most leadership.
       New TORs should be prepared for each staff position and an independent selection
panel with substantial outside membership should be set up to review the qualifications and
experience of those who apply for positions, and to determine which ones are to be hired. In
considering re-applications of present staff, consideration should be given to the role,
dynamics and work ethic of the staff during their tenure with the Authority, remembering the
need to change the institutional culture.
       All new staff should be hired for a probationary period to assure that their
performance warrants a more permanent position.
        Study tours should be held for key personnel, to enable them to experience effective
protected area management. These were offered by the World Bank but the WMPA has never
acted upon them.
10.3 Partner Organization
         The POE believes that the WMPA Board of Directors should conclude an MOU with
the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to serve as a partner organization with the WMPA.
The POE and others involved with the reorganization of WMPA have all strongly
recommended that the WMPA needs a partner organization, to provide the experience and
expertise required to develop an effective organization to carry out the WMPA’s mandate.
The WCS has worked with the GoL in Laos for many years, and has some form of partner
arrangement with various protected areas. It has an outstanding record of often long term
accomplishment with working with protected areas in many countries. It could provide senior
staff to work with the WMPA leadership, backed up by an international organization. It
would have to have a fully collaborative position, not merely that of providing technical
assistance, and the relationship should be on a long term basis. The relationship should be
initiated without delay and if possible should be accomplished well before the end of this
year.
10.4 Board of Directors.
         The direct institutional responsibility for the WMPA is with the WMPA Board of
Directors. The new decree under consideration makes the Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry the chairman, and other Board members include representatives of the provinces,
districts and others potentially involved with WMPA. The decree (Article 5) states that “The
Authority reports directly to the Prime Minister.” The GoL Task Force established to guide
the reorientation, etc., of the WMPA also has a role in guiding the actions of the authority.
      The legal basis for establishing WCS as a full partner to WMPA could be through a
MOU between the Board and WCS. The MOU should spell out explicitly the relationships
between the WMPA and WCS, as noted above. If WCS is to be a full partner of WMPA it
would be most appropriate if they had a representative on the Board of Directors.
10.5 Senior Outside Fiduciary Advisor/Auditor
       The Board should appoint a recognized and responsible auditor to assure that the
Secretariat applies the funds in accordance with the approved plan. As noted above, the

                                                  46
Secretariat has shifted funds intended for patrolling and village work to the administration.
An outside auditor is required to see that this practice does not continue.
10.6 Conclusion
        The above elements of the strategy are required to achieve effective restructuring of
the WMPA. Failure to achieve the restructuring and reorientation, and consequent
continuation of the basically failed approach of WMPA, will probably result in the watershed
component of the NT2 project being determined to be unsatisfactory or in non-compliance,
and the World Bank and Environment Protection Fund (EPF) will need to reassess their
rationale for supporting the NNT NPA if no substantial progress is made by November, 2016.

ANNEX: LETTER FROM GOVERNMENT OF LAO PDF REQUESTING POE
ADVICE
20 June 2016
Ministry of Energy and Mines
Department of Energy Business
Nongbone Road, Vientiane, Lao PDR
PO Box 11694

Attention:
Mr. David McDowell
Mr. Lee Talbot
Dr. Elizabeth Mann
Dear POE members,
As the representative of Government of Laos under NT2 CA and on behalf of the Joint
Working Group (JWG), we would like to express our thanks to the NT2 Panel of Experts
(PoE) for their recent mission. In particular, we appreciate the productive discussion on the
draft Action Plans for closing the Resettlement Implementation Period (RIP), both the
challenges and positive observations.
As you know, the JWG has made seven Actions Plans grouped into a Comprehensive Action
Plan. Each of the Action Plans contains (i) a List Of Actions (LOA) to close the Resettlement
Implementation Period (ii) and actions related to the long-term involvement of stakeholders
in the support of the Resettlers' livelihood under the Medium Term Development Plan.
The collaborative process for closing the RIP by the extended deadline of 2017, through well-
defined actions and indicators, is intended to embed the insights and recommendations of the
POE. Hence, before the JWG finalizes the Comprehensive Action Plan, we request that the
PoE provide their comprehensive and consensus comments on each of the seven Action
Plans.
As discussed in the meetings, we would like to formally request that you provide your
detailed insights to the following questions:
       •       What high level outcomes are expected by the PoE to end the RIP in
accordance with the Concession Agreement (CA) requirements? Please identify (to the extent
possible) how those objectives are/are not identified in the Action Plans.
       •        What evidence/indicators of those outcomes are recommended in terms of
quantitative targets or, where not possible, criteria to describe the outcome objective?
        •        Do the actions identified in Annex 1 of each Action Plan (under LOA) provide
a clear logic flow to the higher level objectives) do you consider that these are consistent with
the CA requirements for closure of the RIP? Please identify gaps as well as unnecessary or
low priority or irrelevant actions.
       •       What are the strengths of the APs that the PoE considers particularly helpful
and high priority?
       •       Is there anything else missing, in your opinion, that should be added in order
to ensure closure of the RIP by 2017?


                                                   48
       •      Is there anything that need to be added to enable the PoE to use the Action
plan to monitor and inform on progress towards RIP over the next 18 months?
In addition, the JWG would appreciate any advice on cross-cutting issues that will help
consolidate the individual Action Plans into a Comprehensive Plan. For example: what are
key features for participatory processes; what funding sources (e.g. VDF, SERF) should be
linked or consolidated; what actions could help promote the hand-over process in the service
of transient to greater self-reliance?
We appreciate that these comments were verbally shared and, in most cases, informally
presented in the form of preliminary notes and track changes. A consolidation of those
comments into a formal document will help avoid misinterpretations and degradation of
understanding through time. This document will be used to update the Comprehensive Action
Plan, which clearly set out the actions to be taken by the parties in order to achieve the RIP
by 2017. An analysis of progress of the specific and measurable actions contained in it will
inform the PoE as it makes its decision to recommend the conclusion of the RIP in 2017. It
will also serve as an ongoing guide to the well-being of the villagers on the Plateau.
Many thanks for your critical contribution to an effective RIP closure in the interests of the
people of the Nakai Plateau.
Sincerely yours
Xaypaseuth PHOMSOUPHA
Director General
