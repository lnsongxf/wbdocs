      Executive Summary


              S
                      olomon Islands faces a range of challenges, from low-income and fragility to
                      a highly dispersed population, in delivering effective local governance and
                      services. In the wake of a period of conflict between 1998 and 2003, several
                      largely donor-funded programs emerged to compensate for depleted
           government capacity by providing small-scale investment and economic opportunities
           to rural communities. These programs, whether donor or state funded, continue to be
           one of the main instruments for addressing the logistical and capacity challenges of
           service delivery as well as a significant source of cash in rural areas. However, this
           funding is fragmented and often politicized, undermining the effectiveness of service
           delivery itself. As a consequence, the system is too multi-layered for effective
           coordination and policy direction. The result is a vicious cycle of weak government
           services, poor policy, and a continuing reliance on donors. While large amounts of
           funds are spent on small and medium-sized capital expenditures, there are limited
           systems of financing in place for recurrent costs and ongoing maintenance. Visits to
           rural communities often reveal generations of ‘projects’ very poorly maintained because
           they are viewed as ‘hand-outs’ and there has been no proper planning to sustain them.

              After roughly a decade of implementation, these programs have evolved
           independently and become institutionalized to varying degrees, but the lessons of
           experience across the various approaches have yet to be drawn together to inform the
           design of a new generation of improved rural service delivery programs. The World
           Bank has undertaken this analysis to assist policymakers, program sponsors and
           implementers to make better-informed decisions about the design, financing,
           governance, and overall relative advantages and disadvantages of these programs.

                                           Currently, the funds flowing to the sub-national level with a broad service delivery
                                      objective can be grouped into three main categories according to their geographic
                                      orientation and the levels at which decisions are made and funds managed –
                                      provincial, constituency, and community (village/ward) grants. The provincial scope is
                                      largest, then narrows down to the constituency and, finally, to the ward or even single-
                                      village level. While these may appear as layers of subnational governance
                                      institutionalized in the constitution, local government legislation or policy, only the
                                      province is a recognized local government structure with fiscal and administrative
                                      authority. By examining these programs as de facto with distinct fiscal, governance and
                                      administrative structures, we can better understand the unique roles they have come to
                                      play and how they may be better positioned in the future to improve rural development
                                      outcomes.

                                             Considering these categories, this study looked at the following programs:

                                                      Provincial Capacity Development Fund (PCDF), administered by the Ministry
                                                      of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening;

                                                      Rural Constituency Livelihood Fund (RCLF), administered by the Ministry of
                                                      Rural Development (MRD);

                                                      Rural Development Program (RDP), administered by the Ministry of
                                                      Development Planning and Aid Coordination; and

                                                      Rural Advancement Micro-projects Programme (RAMP), and its’
                                                      predecessors, Micro-projects Programme 1 (MPP1) and Micro-projects
                                                      Programme 2 (MPP2), administered by the Ministry of Development Planning
                                                      and Aid Coordination.

                                      The five main components of the study include the analysis of consolidated sub-project
                                      data; local development planning; efficiency and effectiveness; accountability,
                                      transparency and dispute management; and sustainability.

                                      Consolidated dataset
                                              During the period from 2008 to 2012, these four programs disbursed a total of
                                      $US 134,226,722. The bulk of these funds were channelled through the constituency
                                      fund modality (60 per cent). Across the four programs, the highest proportion of the
                                      overall provincial investment was found in Malaita Province (25 per cent), followed by
                                      Western (19.3 per cent). However, in per capita terms, the highest investment was in
                                      Temotu (SBD 466) and then Choiseul (SBD 415). The most highly funded sectors were
                                      housing and community amenities at 31 per cent (primarily water supply), education at

           28 per cent and health at 12 per cent. Detailed expenditure data for RCLF was only
           available for one year (2010), and some of that data could not be assigned to sectors
           as 30 per cent of the expenditures were unclassified and the bulk of the expenditures
           were for one-off small items for single households. There is often co-financing of
           individual sub-projects by the different programs, with constituency funds, in particular,
           being used to fill funding gaps or scale-up RDP or PCDF-funded sub-projects.

           Local development planning
                   A framework to integrate provincial, community-driven, and perhaps even
           constituency-based planning processes is needed, as is greater clarification, and
           perhaps institutionalization, of the village and ward-level (Ward Development
           Committee) governance and decision-making processes. Each of the four programs
           takes a different approach to identifying sub-projects to finance, to the use of planning
           processes, and to the engagement of stakeholders. PCDF is largely driven by the
           provincial administration and the preparation of standardized, periodic plans. RDP
           planning is oriented toward the village and ward levels. RAMP has no planning
           process, but identifies sub-projects via open competition. RCLF also has a minimal
           planning process, and allocations are largely at the discretion of members of
           parliament and Constituency Development Officers (CDOs).

                  The upward and downward linkages between PCDF and RDP processes,
           respectively, are insufficiently developed. While RDP utilizes a participatory planning
           process, which engages communities, the priorities identified are not used to inform
           provincial planning. The sector knowledge present in the provincial administration is
           also not well utilized to guide the identification of the best solutions to community-level
           problems.

                  The tokenistic representation of women in village and ward-level planning
           processes should be reconsidered as this constrains the potentially wider interest of
           women to participate in decision-making bodies and to establish more of a balance of
           male and female perspectives. Rather than identifying women as an interest group with
           one representative, a minimum percentage of female members of Ward Development
           Committees or village groups could be specified.

           Efficiency and effectiveness
                  There is a trade-off between the speed of disbursement and quality assurance
           processes, and each of the programs can benefit from improvements in different areas.
           With the lightest processes, RCLF delivers funds fastest. This is likely at the cost of
           value-for-money as there are no competitive procurement processes, as in the case of




xiv
                                      the other programs, or the use of cost data to check pricing. RCLF also does not
                                      monitor sub-projects, so benefits are not well known.

                                              On the whole, RCLF lacks procedural guidance for its activities, and while the
                                      CDF legislation and draft regulations provide some specifics, there will remain a need
                                      for a significant amount of detail in order to strengthen the performance of RCLF as an
                                      effective delivery mechanism for development assistance.

                                              RDP and RAMP are very process-heavy, and thus slower moving. The technical
                                      review process of these programs could be streamlined and perhaps even
                                      decentralized to province-level technical specialists, including sector staff working in
                                      the provincial administration. The administrative cost borne by RDP (for Community
                                      Helpers) and RCLF (for CDOs) could also be optimized through greater provincial
                                      integration as provincial staff are mostly financed under the recurrent budget of line
                                      ministries or through Provincial Service Grants.

                                               There is an overall lack of information available regarding rural investments and
                                      this is an impediment to assessing development results and planning future
                                      investments at the sub-national level.

                                      Accountability, transparency and dispute management
                                          Media coverage of the programs reviewed in this study is mostly ad hoc, with no
                                      systematic reporting of progress or the use of funds available to the public. On the
                                      whole, there is insufficient public information about each of the programs, and all
                                      programs could do better in providing more visual printed materials to
                                      affected/beneficiary communities so that they can develop a better understanding how
                                      these programs work.

                                          Accountability from the programs to national government is reasonably strong in
                                      the cases of PCDF and RDP, with each convening regular project committee meetings
                                      and sharing progress reports. RCLF has no means of reporting progress to
                                      government stakeholders except through ad hoc audits done by the Auditor General,
                                      which to-date have not been circulated even within government. There is very little
                                      information about how RCLF funds are used, at all levels of government and society.
                                      This lack of information and accountability stokes concern and criticism of waste, fraud
                                      and corruption, which occasionally make their way into the media and public discourse.
                                      A robust set of accountability and transparency measures for RCLF and all CDFs is
                                      needed, including: a realistic financial auditing approach which reflects capacity
                                      requirements; regular public reporting requirements including information on funding

           allocations, expenditures, types of activities funded and recipients; social accountability
           mechanisms to allow citizens to monitor the use of funds in their communities; etc.

               While there have been disputes regarding land, this has not escalated to violence.
           In this sense, it appears informal and/or traditional mechanisms for resolving disputes
           are working even if they are not able to uphold agreements made with respect to the
           sub-projects. None of the programs have functional grievance redress mechanisms for
           beneficiary/affected communities. Communities rely mainly on traditional dispute
           resolution systems, lacking channels of communication that would allow them to go
           outside of traditional systems if they needed or wanted to.

                There are limited-to-no accountability mechanisms in place between communities
           and service providers to monitor the quality of service delivery once the sub-project
           construction is complete. Piloting social accountability mechanisms such as community
           scorecards is recommended to enable community members/beneficiaries to hold
           service providers accountable for the quality of service delivery and not just the quality
           of infrastructure construction.

           Sustainability
                Overall, the quality of construction of rural infrastructure is sound and appropriate
           for the supply base available in country. The difficulty in accessing supplies as well as
           budget shortfalls pose a risk to the full completion of projects, which must be monitored
           to ensure that this does not affect the integrity of the structures. Per unit and per
           beneficiary costs vary by province, but are generally consistent with similar types of
           small-scale rule projects in other parts of the world.

               The likelihood of financial sustainability varies widely depending upon the type of
           infrastructure and the location. However, there is insufficient data on the extent
           maintenance funds flow from various sources including national government transfers
           for education and health, user fees for water and rural health services, etc. Projects
           focused on business/economic activity typically have little focus on sustainability.

              The current construction codes for the Pacific were developed 25 years ago, so it is
           necessary to review these codes to update seismic and cyclone design approaches
           and to build climate change adaptation approaches into project design. Guidance on
           how to budget for the maintenance of various types of infrastructure drawing on
           available O&M plans and accumulated experience in different sectors is needed. It
           would also be useful to compile a catalogue of standard designs and unit costs from
           across these and other programs to use as a resource to speed the process of design
           and to ensure quality design standards.

                                           The main overarching recommendations provided in the concluding section of this
                                           report, are to:

                                           1. Redefine the three main funding streams (provincial, constituency and
                                              community) so they are aligned to clarified and distinct mandates as well as
                                              appropriate capacities for implementation;

                                           2. Implement an integrated planning and budgeting process across the funding
                                              streams; and
                                           3. Redistribute CDF funds incrementally towards the other, well performing
                                              modalities.

                                           The other main recommendations described in greater detail at the conclusion of
                                           this report include to:

                                           4. Align and build capacity and institutional development across levels;

                                           5. Strengthen standards and technical support systems to improve quality and
                                              efficiency;

                                           6. Develop mechanisms for community/citizen accountability to ensure public
                                              benefit and quality service delivery;

                                           7. Build a robust database, which consolidates info for public viewing, feedback
                                              and review results; and

                        1.                    Introduction


                      olomon Islands faces a range of challenges, from low-income and fragility to highly dispersed
                      population, in delivering effective local governance and services. The country experienced a
                      period of conflict between 1998 and 2003, which entailed limited fatalities, but paralyzed the
                 functioning of the state and formal economy. While the country has recovered from this conflict, the
                 reach of formal state institutions is very limited. Provincial governments govern the nine provinces, but
                 have few resources and less capacity.

                        Geography and population dispersal pose absolute constraints to service delivery in the
                 Solomon Islands. Population density, at only 18 persons per square kilometer is among the lowest in
                 the world. Distances between islands are large and transport connections extremely limited,
                 exacerbating the country’s remoteness from major markets. Linking communities by road across
                 mountainous interiors is difficult, but linking scattered coastal communities by sea involves long,
                 expensive journeys around islands sometimes impossible during rough weather. Service delivery in this
                 geography is, therefore, extremely challenging.

                         In this context small infrastructure projects, whether donor or state funded, are one of the main
                 instruments for addressing the logistical and capacity challenges of service delivery as well as one of
                 largest source of cash in rural areas. However, this funding is fragmented and often politicized,
                 undermining the effectiveness of service delivery itself. With minimal resources for anything except
                 basic health and education, government becomes more a facilitator of transfers rather than a provider
                 of services.

                         The poor performance of government in delivering services has fueled the increase in
                 constituency funds. Proponents of the use of constituency funds argue that it is a fast and efficient
                 means of channeling resources to rural communities. At the same time, the lack of basic accountability
                 systems around constituency funds and the fact that while some are used for development purposes,

                                                                                                                             1

    means the system is often perceived as being used to “buy” political support has in turn prompted
    donors to establish parallel systems. The resulting system is too multi-layered for effective coordination
    and policy direction, with a vicious cycle of weak government services, poor policy, and an ever-
    expanding role for donors. It has also resulted in large amounts of funds for what are essentially small
    and medium-sized capital expenditures, for example, funds for building water systems, classrooms,
    clinics, or small bridges, but limited systems or financing for recurrent costs and ongoing maintenance.
    Visits to rural communities often reveal generations of ‘projects’ very poorly maintained because neither
    the state nor communities have the desire, funds or ability to sustain them.

            The problems created by the parallel and distortionary public funding systems relate to many of
    Solomon Islands’ core development challenges. Given the very minimal development of a non-
    agricultural, or even non-subsistence, private sector and weak market integration, the administration of
    public spending has a determinate role in how individuals view the state, center-local relationships, their
    leaders, and the functioning of communities. Control of resources at the local or central government
    level was among the factors contributing to the 1998 to 2003 tensions. Confidence in state functionality
    is an important element in post-conflict recovery, yet the weaknesses of the current system have if
    anything undermined confidence in the state, even as the amount of donor and constituency funds has
    increased significantly in the 2000s. As a result instead of development being experienced as a process
    involving the identification of, and collective action to address, common challenges, “development” is
    often perceived as arbitrary, fueling conflict, and driven by outside “others”.
        The purpose of this study is to identify ways to improve the current mechanisms of service delivery,
    particularly in rural areas, by examining the three most significant, yet parallel types of financing for
    small-scale infrastructure and livelihood activities. The findings are intended to strengthen the ability of
    SIG to align these stand-alone programs with national development priorities and to improve the
    effectiveness of inter-governmental systems to deliver quality, sustainable services in rural areas.

                        2. Methodology
                                  he study examined three different types of funding mechanisms:



                                     Constituency-oriented funds, allocated to all fifty Members of Parliament, in particular the
                                     largest such fund, the Rural Community Livelihoods Fund (RCLF), which draws mainly from
                                     national budget funds, while other constituency funds are also financed by Taiwan, China.
                                     Province-oriented development funds, namely the Provincial Capacity Development Fund
                                     (PCDF) grants which are both government and donor funded and allocated to each
                                     provincial government.
                                     Community-oriented grant funds, namely a series of European Union-funded micro-
                                     project programs, most recently the Rural Advancement Micro-projects Program (RAMP)
                                     and well as the World Bank’s Rural Development Program (RDP), each of which is
                                     predominantly donor funded and channel funds directly to communities.


                     The above modalities for investing in rural areas were individually assessed against four critical
                 areas of performance: i) local development planning, ii) efficiency and effectiveness, (iii) accountability,
                 transparency and dispute management, and iv) sustainability. Performance was assessed at the
                 program level and the sub-project, community level.

                                  budget, the first allocation was made to the RDP. Community contributions are expected in
                                  cash and/or in kind in both the RAMP and RDP projects but not for RCLF or PCDF.

           As Table 4 illustrates, the amount of funds for CDF greatly exceeds the amount of all other

                 3.2       SIG RURAL CONSTITUENCY LIVELIHOODS FUND DESCRIPTION AND
                           OBJECTIVES
            In 2012, RCLF was the main government-funded constituency development fund (CDF) and
    was the only such fund to explicitly appear under the Ministry of Rural Development’s (MRD)
    development budget line. RCLF represented 41 per cent of the MRD’s development budget for 2012
    and 29 per cent of the total CDF budget (including MRD, other Ministries and Taiwan, China
    contributions). The Constituency Development Fund Act, 2013 simply describes CDFs as “funds
    allocated to Constituencies”9. MRD describes RCLF as a rural development program funding social and
    economic infrastructure in each constituency of Solomon Islands.

           CDFs bypass the existing administrative structure (central and provincial governments) for
    service delivery and utilize the political structure (electoral constituencies) for disbursement of funds
    and service delivery outputs. This forces the two delivery mechanisms (administrative and political) to
    be competitors and results in additional layers of service delivery to a small country already burdened
    by capacity constraints sub-nationally.

            In most cases, the respective Member of Parliament (MP) operates the CDF account. Each
    constituency has a Constituency Development Officer (CDO) who assists in identifying possible uses of
    the funds and facilitates transactions. CDOs are appointed to MRD by the Public Service Commission
    and report to the Director of MRD. In practice, they report to their respective MP and can be dismissed
    by them as well. Some constituencies have Project Officers (POs) in addition to the CDO. The CDF has
    at least 50 staff (CDOs) as well as the staff of the MRD.

    6
      This is the total for all CDFs listed in budget documents under the heading of the Ministry of Rural Development
    from the years from 2008 to 2012, including those funded by Taiwan, China. RCLF represents approximately 50%
     of this total.
    7
      PGSP grants are those disbursed under the PCDF.
    8
      RDP grants are those disbursed under Component 1 of the program. RDP has four components including one
    on agricultural services and another on rural business development.
    9
      Constituency Development Funds Bill 2013, p. 4. Broadly speaking, constituency development funds
    are considered to be any funds, which are channeled through a constituency-based account. These may appear
    under the budget headings of ministries other than MRD including forestry, agriculture and livestock, health, etc.

                         CDFs are financed by the national budget and Taiwan, China. In 2012, the Taiwan, China
                 portion of CDF funding was only 20 per cent (SBD 50,000,000) of MRD’s total constituency fund budget
                 envelope. While the RCLF budget of SBD 75,000,000 was the only CDF explicitly listed under MRD’s
                 development budget line in 2012, there was another “blank” line budgeted for SBD 20,000,000, and
                 several other CDFs that eventually became the responsibility of MRD. In total, MRD was responsible
                 for SBD 232,800,000 of which SBD 182,800,000 was SIG resources. In addition, there was a further
                 SBD 28,913,451 from the SIG recurrent budget. In 2012 there was an increase in reassigning
                 constituency funds from other Ministries, to the MRD budget. For example, SBD 15M was reassigned
                 for water and sanitation, SBD 29 million for forestry, and SBD 19 million for cocoa and coconut
                 schemes. This shift of funds from some sectors equaled 41 per cent of the total SIG budget for
                 constituency funds in 2012.

                        The total budget for CDFs increased by 29 per cent from 2011 to 2012. This was a dramatic
                 increase in the development budget as from 2010 to 2011 there was only a 0.5 per cent increase. Table
                 5 demonstrates this significant increase from 2011. These figures shown are SIG and Taiwan, China
                 contributions combined.

                         Table 6 is taken from SIG budget papers and shows the actual expenditures from 2008 to 2012
                 of the total CDF development budget. The figures show that overall actual expenditure between 2008
                 and 2012 was, on average, 62 per cent of the appropriated budget and 2011 was an over spend and
                 2012 (with 2012 being an estimate) likely to be equal to the appropriated budget.

                    Provincial Service Grants are the main source of revenue for provincial governments. These funds are primarily used to finance recurrent
                 expenditures (staff and facilities), with modest funds available for development expenditure. Much of the amounts available for development
                 expenditure are divided equally amongst the Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs), who each representing a provincial ward, for small-
                 scale discretional spending in a similar to the way CDFs are managed at the national level.

    remains a year-to-year discretionary budget item, provincial service grants are the main source of
    financing for the operation of provincial administrations and for service delivery in the provinces. In
    total, provincial service grants only amount to approximately 18 per cent of the total CDF funds. By
    province, CDF funds are between three and seven times the size of provincial service grants. When
    looking at the per capita differences, the two provinces with the lowest populations – Rennel and
    Bellona and Temotu – have received the highest per capita allocations for both CDF and provincial
    service grants.

                                                                      13
         TABLE 7: MRD (CDF) BUDGET FROM 2012 (IN SBD)




           This high per capita bias towards these provinces is thought to adjust for their remoteness and
    the higher cost of service delivery, but this is not captured through a particular formula, but rather an
    equitable allocation per constituency regardless of its population. Please note the amount of CDF per
    MP is SBD 5,234,269. In 2012 the documented total amount to each MP was SBD 1,000,000 from
    China, Taiwan and approximately SBD 4,234,269 from the SIG budget - a total of SBD 5,234,269 per
    member.14 To appreciate how large the CDF budget is, it has been compared to the total provincial
    budget for Malaita Province in 2012 in the example in Table 8.

                        With fourteen MPs in Malaita Province each receiving SBD 5,234,269, this equates to a total of
                 SBD 73,279,766 or SBD 532 per capita, which is 2.8 times the per capita amount of PCDF, RDP and
                 MPP2 combined for the province. This means the total budget assigned to the Malaitan Provincial
                 Government is only 18 per cent of the total constituency program funds assigned to Malaita for 2012.
                 Table 9 provides a breakdown of the 2012 budget allocations through the SIG development budget, the

               3.3       PROVINCIAL CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUND DESCRIPTION AND
                         OBJECTIVES
         PCDF is a financing instrument under the Provincial Government Strengthening Program
 (PGSP). It is a performance-based grant mechanism for the delivery of capital development budget at
 the provincial level. The provincial governments use this fund for service delivery and local
 development based on priorities raised in their provincial development plan. It complements provincial
 service grants, which mostly only cover the operational cost of the provincial administration plus small
 grants to ward members. The Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening
 (MPGIS) and all nine provincial governments implement PCDF. In order to qualify for PCDF, the
 provincial governments undergo an external assessment annually, which determines if they meet
 minimum conditions of access to the funds as well as performance incentive measures. The fund
 allocation formula and weightings change annually as shown in Table 11.

                                     funds and to make the local planning and budgeting process meaningful, efficient and

                                     accordance with local priorities and in a sustainable manner;
                                     Improve the provincial capacity for public expenditure management, good governance and
                                     accountability through investment in capacity building and stronger incentives.


                          The planned and then actual releases of the PCDF from 2008 to 2013 are shown in Table 12.

                  deceased by about 20 per cent over the same time period. This is a very positive sign as it
                  demonstrates a firm commitment from government to provide predictable funding to provincial
                  governments for service delivery.

                  DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
      RAMP is the third phase of the EU-funded micro projects programs in Solomon Islands, preceded
 by MPP1 and MPP2. The overall aim of the program is to promote community self-reliance and
 inclusion and to contribute to improved access to social services and income of participating rural and
 urban communities. The program’s purpose is to increase community access to sustainable social-

                 infrastructure and enterprise development opportunities, supported by a competent network of non-
                 state actors.
                      RAMP is implemented by MDPAC and supervised by the National Authorizing Organization (NAO)
                 within MDPAC. The project supervisor is the Permanent Secretary of MDPAC. A steering committee
                 oversees and validates the overall direction and policy of the project. It meets on a quarterly basis and
                 comprises of representatives from the NAO, EU, RAMP, RDP, non-state actors, donors, the private
                 sector, and line ministries. RAMP has 25 staff as of December 2012. The total value of RAMP is EU
                 7,483,000.

                        RAMP is divided into three funding areas called ‘lots’:

                                     Lot 1 – Community-designed and managed social infrastructure (water supply, sanitation, health,
                                     education and markets) projects.
                                     Lot 2 – Income generating activities: value-adding and inclusive enterprise development initiatives
                                     Women's savings and credit union expansions or new creations.
                                     Lot 3 – Trials of appropriate technology (solar, water-harvesting, micro-hydro) projects.


                         RAMP requires all participating communities to contribute at least 25 per cent of total project
                 costs (either in cash or in-kind) to their projects. Contracts were signed with 100 community committees
                 (community-based organizations registered as funding recipients) in May 2012 and implementation
                 started in June/July 2012.

                         Table 14 shows the amount of approved funds for by lot, as of late 2012. This commitment is

                3.5      THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
         The objective of the RDP is to raise the living standards of rural households by establishing
 improved mechanisms for the delivery of priority economic and social infrastructure and services by the
 public and the private sector. RDP is a two-phase, 10-year program, which is implemented by the
 MDPAC and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL).18

             RDP has three main components:19

                  Community Infrastructure and service projects – improve mechanisms at community and provincial
                  level for the delivery of economic and social infrastructure and services.
                  Improving agricultural services – increase access of rural households to agricultural services to
                  support rural income growth.
                  Rural business development – provide financing, related training and technical assistance.

                         The PS of MDPAC is the Program Director and National Coordinator of the RDP. A Program
                 Coordination Unit (PCU) within MDPAC implements the program. The MAL PS coordinates the
                 agricultural component of RDP and is supported by the provincial CFOs in close coordination with the
                 provincial governments.
                         RDP has a Steering Committee, which is chaired by the MDPAC PS and consists of the MAL
                 PS, Infrastructure, MPGIS, MOFT, MHMS and PSs of the participating provinces. RDP has 126 staff, 85
                 of which are CHs based in the home villages and each covering two wards. The Provincial Secretary
                 provides general oversight of the RDP at the provincial level. Table 17 provides an overview of the
                 implementation of RDP.

     4. Expenditure analysis from consolidated dataset


 P
        roject data from PCDF, RDP, RAMP and MPP 1 and MPP 2 from 2006 to 2012 was
        consolidated into a single dataset. RCLF data is presented separately for the following reasons:
                        Data could only be collected for one year, 2010;
                RCLF expenditures do not follow the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG)
                categories;
                Many of the RCLF expenditures are for small, single purchases for a household and cannot be
                regarded as development initiatives with a tangible development output. Accordingly, it is not
                possible to compare the RCLF data with the data produced by other development projects;
                30 per cent of the RCLF expenditures have not been classified at all and these appear as a
                simple transfer of funds with no tangible output; and
                Of the 405 expenditures recorded for 2010, 82 per cent are one-off payments between SBD
                100,000 and 600,000.


        Using the consolidated dataset, the number of approved sub-projects from each program was:
                MPP1 and 2: 404 sub-projects between 2006 and 2007;
                RAMP: 100 sub-projects from late 2012;
                PCDF: 335 sub-projects from 2008 to 2012;
                RDP: 205 sub-projects from 2009 to 2012; and
                RCLF: 405 sub-projects/activities.

          4.1     FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
         The following tables present the geographic distribution of program resources by total amounts
 as well as per capita. For the period of analysis, PCDF approved the highest amount of funding,
 followed by RAMP and RDP. RDP recently approved a fourth cycle of grants, including grants to
 Guadalcanal and Central Islands provinces, but these have yet to be added to the dataset. If these
 amounts were to be added, the per capita amounts for these two provinces would go up considerably.
         As Malaita is the most populated province, it received the highest total funding yet was the third
 lowest in terms of per capita allocation with a total of SBD 247. Temotu Province received the highest
 per capita allocation of SBD 576. This is mainly due to the high amounts approved through RDP, as




16
                 Temotu was one of the four initial provinces for RDP rollout. The per capita amount for Rennell and
                 Bellona would likely have been the highest if RDP were to be active there. See Table 18.

                      TABLE 18: CONSOLIDATED DATA BY PROVINCE, MPP2, PCDF, RDP AND RAMP (IN
                      SBD)20




                     Table 19 shows the total amounts of the RCLF expenditures by province for 2010. The highest
                 amounts were spent in the two largest provinces, Malaita and Guadalcanal provinces, but per capita
                 spending was lowest in Guadalcanal, with the exception of Honiara. Rennell and Bellona is by far the
                 highest recipient on a per capita basis followed by Isabel.
                                                                                                            21
                      TABLE 19: RCLF 2010 DATA BY PROVINCE




                        Tables 20 and 21 summarize the sectors that receive the most funds from PCDF, RDP and
                 RAMP for 2012 and MPP2. The housing and community amenities sector derives the highest
                 percentage, driven largely by RDP spending on water supply and community halls. Education has the
                 second highest expenditure totals, with PCDF investing heavily in this sector.

        Reflective the focus of the ‘lots’ defined in the call for proposals, RAMP has perhaps the most
 balance across social (health and education) and economic activities. Health facilities receive the most
 funding followed by Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting, and then water supply. See Table 23.

                         As Table 24 clearly illustrates, most RCLF spending is on housing and communities, in
                 particular housing materials and water supply. Reflecting the ‘livelihood’ focus of RCLF, the second
                 highest funding sector is economic affairs with a wide range of activities financed including livestock,
                 agriculture, fishing, forestry, tourism, etc. A significant percentage of activities, about eight per cent, are
                 either ‘not specified’ or listed as ‘other’.

        5. Local development planning
                5.1      PLANNING AND BUDGETING FOR RURAL COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS
                he 1978 Provincial Government Act (PGA) does not specify a development planning
                function, an administrative structure for provincial governments with a section responsible
                for development planning or planning entities such as the Ward Development Committees
                utilized by RDP, and, to a certain extent, PCDF. Thus, a formal legal and policy framework
 for sub national development planning in the Solomon Islands is lacking.22
          In the absence of a legal framework for provincial development planning, PGSP has prepared
 procedures for provincial planning, budgeting, procurement and implementation. These include a three-
 year rolling development plan and an annual plan and budget. These procedures have been developed
 into a series of manuals and are endorsed and issued from the Ministry of Provincial Government and
 Institutional Strengthening (MPGIS) to all nine provinces. Furthermore, in 2012 MPGIS presented to
 Cabinet a policy paper on a conceptual framework for participatory planning and budgeting with a view
 to address this lack of public participation in the planning process.23 This paper also defines
 membership roles and responsibilities for a Ward Development Committee.
         The PGA envisaged a third tier of government, allowing Provincial Assemblies to create Area
 Councils for local administration. However, Area Councils were abolished in 1996/7 leaving a gap
 between the provincial administration and the village level/people. This gap has been further eroded by
 the closure of many provincial sub-stations due to financial cuts exacerbated by the tensions, although
 remnants remain in Malaita.
         There are a variety of means by which priorities for rural community investments are identified,
 including by the programs under review. These can include: national sector priorities, allocation per
 capita, local government planning process, political choice, ‘bottom-up’ from communities and
 competition by proposals. Each of these methods could have some element of ‘bottom-up demand’
 from communities. This demand may come in the form of one individual with significant influence or
 from a highly inclusive process including women and marginalized groups and structured consultation
 and planning process that leads to broad consensus on local development priorities. The more
 participatory and inclusive this process is for defining investment priorities, the more likely it will be that

                 the assets produced will be of broad benefit, be clearly definable public goods, be operational and well-
                 maintained. Public participation in the local development planning process should also be a safeguard
                 against ‘elite capture’ of the funds or the outputs from the investments. 24
                        The following sections will assess the extent to which the programs being examined have
                 developed clear, effective, inclusive and sustainable local development planning processes, as well as
                 the extent to which they are aligned with existing government processes and with each other. While
                 several individual program evaluations have pointed out the burden differing processes place on
                 communities, little has been done to streamline these approaches. The potential for streamlining
                 planning and prioritization processes will be assessed, including both the possibility of formalizing such
                 processes either within the legal framework for local governments or at least across the main program
                 administrators.

                                 While the CDF Act, 2013 specifies the need to create Constituency Development Plans
                         for each constituency; as of 2013 RCLF did not have a standardized planning or budgeting
                         process. Projects are mainly identified by CDOs and MPs in an ad hoc and on-demand basis
                         over the course of the year. There are no written procedures other than a proposal form, which
                         is not used for all funded activities. Proposals, when used, are prepared by CDOs, as directed
                         by the MP, and then sent to MRD for approval. Constituents submit project ideas in an ad-hoc
                         manner throughout the year and constituency fund themes such as tourism, water or forestry
                         are frequently seen. Some constituencies have Project Officers in addition to the CDO.
                                 Funds cannot be carried over from year-to-year so there is pressure on MPs to find a
                         use for all of the funds they are allocated. While RCLF funds are drawn from the SIG budget
                         they are disbursed and managed outside the SIG financial management systems established
                         for service delivery of line ministries and provincial governments.

                                                    5.2.2              PCDF planning and funds allocation process
                                 The PCDF provides discretionary, performance-based annual grants to each province
                         that meets clearly stated minimum conditions. Provincial governments use the grants to
                         finance priorities identified in their provincial development plans, including a three-year rolling
                         development plan, an annual plan and a budget. Planning procedures have been developed
                         into a series of manuals and are endorsed and issued by the MPGIS to all nine provinces.

                                The provincial planning process involves:

                                             Situation analysis;
                                             Setting vision, goals and objectives; and
                                             Resource-informed planning and budgeting.

                                  The Provincial Assembly approves the three-year development plan and budgets, then
                         reviews and monitors the implementation every six months. Technical Planning Committees
                         (TPC), consisting of the Provincial Secretary, Planner and Treasurer undertake the planning
                         work. The TPC facilitates the planning and budget process, compiles the Provincial Profile,
                         facilitates a Province-wide SWOT analysis, appraises project proposals, work plans and
                         budgets and compiles the three-year rolling Provincial Development Plan and presents it to the
                         Executive and Assembly. The Provincial Accounts Committee reviews and oversees the audit
                         reports, financial management and performance of the executive.

     traditional authorities.


                    5.2.3      RAMP planning and funds allocation process
             RAMP and its predecessors, MPP1 and MPP2, have utilized an open competition
     process in identifying sub-projects for financing. This process is not aligned to SIG planning
     procedures, but it has strong community participation in the development of project proposals.
     RAMP does not have a standard planning, prioritization or budgeting process as part of its
     implementation cycle for investments. Under the open and competitive ‘request for proposal’
     (RFP) system, interested community groups first lodge a concept note. This RFP process
     follows an established EU procedure and is reported by community groups to be cumbersome,
     time consuming and requiring specific expertise.

           There is engagement of national level sector Ministries as MDPAC is the NAO for
     RAMP. It establishes the Evaluation Committee, which evaluates and approves project
     concept notes and full proposals. The Evaluation Committee consists of line ministries, NAO,
     MDPAC, and the EU.


                    5.2.4      RDP planning and funds allocation process
             The RDP has a ‘bottom-up’, community-driven planning process facilitated mainly by
     project staff, namely Community Helpers (CHs). Project identification and ranking is inclusive
     of women, youth, and traditional and respected leaders. It is also participatory, demand-based
     and well regarded by most community members. Through the use of Ward Development
     Committees (WDCs), RDP is aligned to government systems to a certain extent, but the
     planning process sits outside provincial or sector plans. The development priorities identified
     by communities are not formally fed into the development of provincial or national plans, but
     rather used only to identify projects for RDP funding.

            The RDP planning and funding approval process includes:

                Awareness raising and needs identification at the village level;
                WDC formation, village priority appraisal and ranking; and
                Provincial Allocation and Resource Committee (PARC) approval and Provincial
                Assembly endorsement.

               CHs have a key role and facilitate the identification and selection of sub-projects by
     communities. CHs also assist the communities in establishing and strengthening WDCs and if
     a sub-project is approved, supporting the establishment of a SIC and then guiding the SIC in
     its role.

                                 WDC members are selected at an “open community meeting”. A WDC comprises of an
                         MPA, a representative of traditional authority, a Church representative, a female
                         representative and, male and female youth representatives. The community can also nominate
                         other representatives. MPAs may not participate in the nomination of WDC members. As
                         membership is meant to be annual, the process of member nomination and endorsement is
                         repeated before preparation of annual requests for financing.

                                      The WDC meets at the time of each grant cycle to:

                                             Review the sub-projects submitted by each village in the ward;
                                             Review village maps which show existing social and physical infrastructure;
                                             Record details of the requested subproject including the beneficiaries;
                                             Consider initial project cost estimates; and
                                             Determine if the community is willing to contribute at least 15 per cent of sub-
                                             project costs.

                                  The WDC acts in the name of the whole ward community. It considers projects that are
                         eligible according to the criteria established by RDP and validated by the PSU. To qualify, sub-
                         projects must:

                                             Have been validated by the community during open community meetings;
                                             Include active participation of women in the expression of needs;
                                             Allow for non-discriminatory access to the social and economic benefits of the sub-
                                             project; and
                                             Conform to sound environmental principles.

                                 A record of the WDC meeting is submitted to the PARC. PARC meetings are “open to
                         interested individuals and civil society organizations invited as observers” with one month’s
                         notice. Two members, selected by the WDC will act as the ward delegation to the PARC; one
                         of these must be a woman. The PARC sends nominated sub-projects, with financial
                         information, to the PA for endorsement.

                  utilized by RDP have become recognized as legitimate local planning processes, but
                  these not regularized and are only formalized in the RDP Project Manual.

            WDCs are not recognized in the PGA or any other official government planning
     process other than in the cabinet paper on Participatory Planning. As yet, the roles of the
     WDCs as envisioned in the Cabinet Paper has yet-to-be realized and the ward-level of
     development planning and support is still only legally formalized via the role of the MPA as a
     representative of the interests of the ward in the Provincial Assembly. MPAs are allocated
     varying amounts of funds in the form of ‘ward development grants’, but fund allocations are not
     governed by any particular planning process (as is the case for the national-level CDFs).
     Table 26 provides a list of total number of provincial wards in the country, each of which is
     represented by one MPA on the Provincial Assembly.
                                                                                                              25

                            5.3.2           Community-driven needs identification is not well linked to
                                            provincial planning.
             In addition to the lack of any formal recognition of the RDP-developed village and
     ward-level planning processes, with the information generated not being used as an input into
     constituency, provincial or national planning. These development priorities are only used for
     the purpose of identifying sub-projects to be funded by RDP. This is a missed opportunity as
     there is a rich body of information regarding the interests and aspirations of rural communities
     that are not sufficiently drawn upon as an input to development planning.

                                                                       allocation of RCLF and other constituency-based funding.
                                  The CDF Bill, 2013 describes the need for Constituency Development Plans as the
                         basis for identifying funding priorities in each constituency, but these plans have yet to be
                         prepared for any constituencies. Furthermore, the development of such plans is likely to
                         overlap significantly with the ward-level priorities as well as provincial plans as the information
                         and data required to prepare such plans are already generated and utilized for RDP ward-level
                         activities and provincial development plans.

                                                    5.3.4              Inclusion of women in local planning is currently insufficient.
                                  Women participate in village-level planning meetings for RDP, but women participants
                         account for only around one-third of the total village population. A woman in Choiseul provided
                         an explanation as to why these numbers are so low: “mifala woman no save attendim
                         community meeting because mifala busy waka lo garden, or cook for meeting or look aftarem
                         pikinini. Even time mifala attendim meeting mifala busy for keepim pikini stap quiet. 27”

                                 At the ward-level, there must be at least one woman on the Ward Development
                         Committee, but this is often the only woman on the Committee and more of a token
                         representation rather than an effort towards equal representation. In a women’s discussion
                         group at Babokuena Village in Choiseul Province, it was felt that having a woman
                         representative in various decision-making bodies did not necessarily translate to active female
                         participation. It was explained: “women’s participation in project discussions would only be
                         meaningful if they were given their own space to express or share their views, not by having
                         one or two women in committees who then don’t find the time to meet separately with other
                         women to discuss issues and pass on information.”
                                 The limited representation of women among the staff of rural development programs is
                         also a limiting factor. There are very few female CHs in RDP and all 50 CDOs within RCLF are
                         male.

                                                    5.3.5              Competitive grant making may be most applicable to income
                                                                       generation projects.
                                  Competitive grant-making, as used by RAMP, has proven cumbersome and may be
                         better suited to the financing of innovative solutions to local problems or of income-generating
                         activities where sustainability may be more easily measured based on the strength of the
                         business plan rather than the role of the community or government in operating and sustaining
                         the activities. Small-scale, income-generating projects have a high rate of failure so more
                         careful scrutiny of the viability of such proposals, as well as targeted support, would increase
                         their chances of success.


                         27
                           Translation: For us women it is difficult to attend meetings because we are either busy working in gardens, or cooking food for
                         meeting participants or looking after children. But even when we do attend meetings we are kept preoccupied by trying to keep
                         our children quiet.

             5.4       LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND BUDGETING -
                       RECOMMENDATIONS

                   1. Clarify ward-level governance and development participatory planning mechanisms
                      by reviewing, revising and formalizing the composition and role of Ward Development
                      Committees (WDCs), the roles of MPAs as facilitators of local development, and the
                      use of ward development grants. The cabinet paper on participatory planning offers
                      an entry point to further refine and institutionalize the roles of the WDCs.

                   2. Create an integrated village/ward/constituency/province/national planning
                      architecture. This integrated planning and budgeting process could then be utilized as
                      a guide for government-financed programs and other service providers in the
                      provinces. Strengthening bottom-up planning processes would likely require
                      additional resources at the provincial level as the RDP Community Helpers are
                      currently project funded, and are therefore no guarantee of ongoing, bottom-up
                      planning. See Annex 5 for a detailed outline of an Integrated Planning and Budget
                      Process.

                   3. Develop guidelines for enhancing the participation of women in all levels of planning
                      including the use of separate planning meetings for women as a means to strengthen
                      their collective voice.

                   4. Strengthen the role of sector/ministry staff in informing village and ward-level
                      planning. This will help to align sub-national planning with national and provincial
                      sector plans and to strengthen sector ministry ownership of community-level
                      investments. Plus, ensure that recurrent budgets are written into the provincial plans
                      and budgets.

                                6. What is efficiency and effectiveness?
                                          6.1          WHAT IS EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS?


                                            n simple words effectiveness relates to ‘doing the right things’, which means,
                                            making the most appropriate choices regarding allocation of scarce resource to
                                            optimize their use. Efficiency relates to ‘doing things right’, that is optimizing
                                          resource use once decisions regarding the desired output and impact are made;
                                          Making the right choice amongst various options in view of solving the problem, is
                                          about effectiveness. Once an option is chosen, the way it is implemented, ensuring
                                                                                                 28
                                          maximum output against costs, relates to efficiency.


                                One of the key comparisons often made in assessing service delivery programs is the
                         contrast between speed and quality. The comparative analysis framework presented below
                         provides a means of identifying where some programs are designed to move faster, and the
                         trade-offs that may come with the emphasis on speed.

                                          6.2          EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS SCORING
                                 While each of these topics is quite complex and could be studied in-depth on their own,
                         for the purpose of this study a simple, three-point comparative framework has been developed
                         to allow for a visual comparison between the programs under review. The information used to
                         assess each program against the criteria presented included both monitoring and evaluation
                         documents (for example, mid-term reviews), annual reports, and interviews with key
                         informants. See Annex 4 for a list of documents reviewed. Table 27 summarizes the criteria

                                 Overall, RDP and PCDF have the strongest processes using the indicators for
                         efficiency and effectiveness outlined in Figure 1. PCDF has strong fund disbursement, human
                         resource and procurement processes, whereas RCLF has strong fund utilization and fund
                         disbursement processes. RDP is consistently satisfactory in its efficiency and effectiveness
                         indicators and has particularly strong monitoring and links to log frame/results indicators.
                         RAMP does not have strong processes but is ranked satisfactory in half of the indicators
                         including monitoring, links to log frame, human resources, procurement and productivity.
                         However, outputs from RAMP, PCDF and RDP can be clearly expressed as contributing to
                         improvements in education, health or water supply.

                                RCLF scored the lowest rankings on both efficiency and effectiveness and no rankings
                         could be given for three of the indicators due to the difficulty in comparing RCLF outputs.
                         There was no evidence of a procurement process, a log frame or links to sector programs.
                         Unfortunately, there is actually evidence of sector programs retreating due to the presence of
                         CDFs. For example the accountability team of this assignment saw evidence that some

     sectors (for example, in agriculture) were advising provincial colleagues to seek out their CDO
     if they required sector assistance. The summary scores are provided in Figure 2.
            The RCLF has strong fund disbursement and fund utilization processes. These
     rankings were based on evidence that there is a relatively efficient two-week to three month
     time period for release of the funds from the MRD to the constituency accounts, to the funds
     being fully disbursed. The RCLF funds are on a 12-month fiscal year cycle through the SIG
     budget and the budgets were fully utilized in the 12 months between 2011 and 2012.


       FIGURE 2: RCLF EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS SCORES




             RCLF received a satisfactory human resource management ranking, as since around
     2010 its management to operational costs to capital investment ratio has been good.29 For
     example, aside from the fifty CDOs that are externally hired, a small number of MRD staff
     implements the RCLF program together with all of the other CDFs.

            RCLF received a weak ranking for productivity and unit cost indicators. There was no
     evidence that benchmarking of unit costs was taking place and there was no similar project
     types used for cost comparisons. However, there was some evidence that the value of the
     outputs was being optimized through timely delivery of goods.

           As three of the indicators are absent in Figure 2, it is difficult to determine if the outputs
     have any relationship to the overall objectives of the program. The 2013 Constituency
     Development Fund Bill makes no reference to contributing to national and provincial

                         development objectives, but rather constituency development plans, which currently do not
                         exist. Provincial government staff stated that they had no knowledge of how, when and where
                         the constituency funds were allocated and spent in their provinces.

                                RCLF received a weak monitoring ranking, as there is very little systematic monitoring.
                         The data provided for 2010 RCLF sub-projects has limitations due to the singularity of the
                         subject matter. In addition, from the 2010 data provided by MRD, it is difficult to determine
                         what sector the outputs relate to, which makes it impossible to quantify any tangible
                         development outcomes. No data could be made available for analysis for any year other than
                         2010.

                                  In terms of leverage, RCLF has national coverage using SIG funds through RCLF and
                         other constituency fund streams. However, the Government’s procedures for fund
                         management, disbursement and reporting are not being followed, which is why it received a
                         weak ranking. There was no evidence that any public accountability measures were being
                         utilized.

                                                    6.3.2              PCDF efficiency and effectiveness results

                                PCDF ranked the highest overall for the efficiency and effectiveness indicators. The
                         scores are provided in Figure 3.

     provincial government is also using the procurement procedures for other goods and services.
     Funds are released from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to respective provincial
     governments within four weeks of receiving the warrant for release of the funds. The
     accounting, reporting and auditing measures are assessed annually as part of the assessment
     of minimum conditions of access to the PCDF. External management costs have reduced and
     capacity development is being provided to SIG staff who implement the project. In addition, the
     management and other costs to capital investment ratio is reasonable given that this is a
     capacity development program31.

            PCDF productivity was satisfactory as there was considerable evidence that outputs
     were optimal and operational such as timely delivery of good quality teacher housing and
     schools. PCDF fund utilization was also satisfactory. Delays in funding were identified and
     addressed mainly by the PCDF provincial technical advisers. The funds were utilized in a
     reasonable amount of time once released and projects were completed within 12-to-18
     months.

            PCDF received a weak ranking for unit costs. There was no evidence of regular
     sourcing of market prices by the staff of the provincial public works department in order to
     determine a benchmark for unit costs. The unit costs were determined by the supplier’s price.
     However, there was a separation of roles between the engineer and the client (provincial
     government) in most cases. The design and bill of quantities and technical supervision during
     construction was performed by an external third-party engineer or, in some cases, the
     provincial engineers for the Ministry of Infrastructure.

             All four effectiveness indicators were ranked as satisfactory. The link to the outputs and
     the project’s log frame was mainly evidenced through the supporting documentation of the
     PGSP midterm review.32 This review stated that: “PGSP has successfully accomplished an
     early transition from a high risk start-up phase to the production of tangible and structuring
     interventions and the establishment of a functioning provincial governance model the viability
     of which is recognized by all stakeholders.”

             However, the midterm review also stated PCDF: “will need to consolidate its early
     achievements by continued capacity development in an attempt to better ground the program
     at the sub-provincial or sub-ward level, harmonize provincial and sub-provincial planning
     procedures, emphasize maintenance and internal control in budgeting, generation of provincial
     own source revenue.”




     31
      The ratio of grant funds to other costs for PCDF is 64:36 and in that order. Meaning in terms of the total annual budgets for
     PGSP, 64 per cent of the costs go towards funding PCDF and 36 per cent to fund operational, training and staffing costs.

                                 In terms of leverage and replication, PCDF was already providing full coverage to all
                         nine provinces and was able to leverage an increase in SIG allocations annually 33. However, it
                         could provide greater leverage in terms of SIG reforms on issues such as: review of high
                         yielding ‘own source’ revenues for provincial governments, revision of the PGA, piloting of
                         assigned sector functions to provincial governments and inclusion of fiscal decentralization in
                         the SIG Economic and Financial Reform Program.

                                PCDF undertakes basic monitoring through MPGIS as well as the PCDF technical
                         advisors located in the provincial administrations. The dataset for the PCDF investments is
                         working from an Excel spreadsheet and operates out of the MPGIS. It is recommended this
                         data be restructured into a management information system with data inputted in the provinces
                         and consolidated at the central level so that provinces can access, use and analyze the data.

                                 The RAMP scored the second lowest overall rankings with no strong rankings on any
                         indicator. The scores are provided in Figure 4.

                                  Procurement, human resources and productivity efficiency indicators were ranked as
                         satisfactory. RAMP procedure follows the EU procurement rules, which calls for three quotes
                         for all purchases submitted to the RAMP office for approval. The purchase will not be
                         approved unless it follows the EU procurement rules.
                                Government staff commitment for RAMP is through the roles of the National
                         Authorizing Office (NAO) in approvals, data entry into the Development Assistance Database
                         at MDPAC, and the evaluation committee. There is no role for provincial government staff. The

     ratio of administrative cost to capital investment is high, but reasonable given the geographic
     challenges of operating in rural areas34.
             Productivity cannot be easily assessed, as there was no evidence of comparisons of
     inputs and outputs across the program. However the evaluation committee has rejected
     proposals based on expense, which indicates that an attempt at comparing inputs was made
     at the project proposal stage.
             Fund utilization, unit costs and fund disbursement efficiency indicators were ranked as
     weak. This is because fund disbursement and utilization for the RAMP sub- projects has been
     very slow. The process from call for proposals to actual funds arriving in community accounts
     has taken three years. The initial call for proposals was in mid-2009, approvals were
     completed in November 2011 and beneficiaries notified in December 2011. Contracts were
     signed by May 2012 and funds were arriving into community accounts in September 2012.
             There is no facility for budget revision, which makes implementation difficult for
     community committees as prices have increased over three years. Training on procurement
     and financial management had not taken place before the communities received funds. With
     unit costs, there was no evidence that any benchmarking to determine value for money was
     taking place. Community committee members had to enlist considerable assistance in writing
     the proposals and they had no knowledge of how costing was determined35.
             The effectiveness indicators for monitoring and links to log frame received a
     satisfactory ranking, while the linkages to sectors and leverage indicators received a weak
     ranking. There is a lack of day-to-day monitoring, which may be because monitoring is left to
     the community committee who are responsible for implementing all the activities. The sub-
     project data should be entered into the DAD software at MDPAC but the data entry was
     incomplete. It is questionable whether the risks identified in the log frame are valid given the
     long delay between actual design and implementation.
              There is sector Ministry representation on the Evaluation Committee, responsible for
     reviewing community proposals. However, there was no evidence of alignment with sector
     priorities in communities that are choosing projects. Nor is there evidence of engagement with
     provincial sectors on matters such as design or building standards.

                                  RDP was ranked satisfactory for all six-efficiency indicators outlined above. It was
                         noted that fund disbursement from the project coordination unit to the community accounts has
                         been delayed on several occasions, delaying the entire project. Sub-projects take 12 to 18
                         months to complete while some have taken up to 24 months or more.
                                  RDP was following its community procurement procedures and manual. RDP staff
                         based in the Provincial Support Unit monitors procurement and other implementation
                         procedures. Despite well-defined and simple procedures, procurement can be very slow,
                         mostly due to the logistical challenge of communities, particularly in remote areas, procuring
                         their own materials.
                                  Concerning human resources, there was an intention to reduce external management
                         costs over time. The management and other costs to capital investment ratio is the highest
                         across the four projects36. In addition, the number of project staff was the highest with 126 of
                         whom 85 were CHs. Various ministries at the national level attend steering committee
                         meetings and the provincial authorizing officer is the PS.
                                  There is some evidence of benchmarking unit costs undertaken by water project
                         engineers, in particular, who often design or assess the sub-project community designs. For
                         the purchase of goods up to SBD 40,000, three quotations are recommended and, for
                         purchases over SBD 40,000, three quotations must be sourced. This practice assists with
                         improving knowledge about expected unit costs and seeking value for money.
                                  In terms of productivity, there was no evidence that across provinces for the exact
                         same bill of quantity and design within the RDP, that inputs are compared for costing.
                         However, there is some value of outputs being optimized through timely delivery and operation
                         of prior RDP projects.

             Under the effectiveness rankings, RDP has strong monitoring and links to the log frame
     processes and satisfactory leverage and links to sectors processes. There is evidence of
     regular monitoring and reporting from the provincial teams, CHs and from monitoring trips out
     of Honiara. A Management Information System is in place which tracks sub-project progress
     and allows for portfolio management.

              There is a clear link between the outputs and outcomes in the project log frame and
     documentary evidence that the actual beneficiaries are from the investments. RDP’s leverage
     attempts are weak as management costs are too high and greater alignment with provincial
     government processes and procedures is needed in areas such as planning and sector
     priorities. Closer alignment of line ministry programs, such as sectors plans with RDP sub-
     projects, is needed to increase the likelihood of support for operations and maintenance,
     particularly for education and health facilities.

              6.4       EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS - FINDINGS
                    1. Weak mechanisms for ensuring value for money, such as cost comparisons and
                       defined and observed procurement methods, yield better performance in terms of
                       fund utilization/speed of delivery, as is the case for RCLF. The RCLF funds appear to
                       move very quickly as there was little-to-no technical or financial review or processes
                       and the absence of such mechanisms significantly increases the risk funds will be
                       used ineffectively or inappropriately.
                    2. Making better use of provincial staff can bring down management costs and assist
                       with sector alignment. While provincial staff spend a significant amount of time
                       managing PCDF funds, these costs are a recurrent budget cost covered in the
                       national budget, and, therefore, not an additional cost to PCDF management. If RDP,
                       RAMP, and RCLF were to more fully utilize already paid provincial staff, their overall
                       program management costs would come down.
                    3. Expanding program presence at the sub-provincial/ward level, particularly in the case
                       of RCLF (via CDOs) and RDP (via CHs), increases monitoring capability but also
                       increases program costs. If these costs were absorbed or shared by provincial
                       government, it would bring costs down and enhance provincial monitoring and
                       outcome tracking capability.
                    4. While weak application of procurement procedures can speed fund disbursement, the
                       application of light, rural-friendly procedures can improve value for money without
                       slowing fund disbursement significantly. RDP’s community procurement procedures
                       and requirement of community contributions enhance the value of program
                       investment, but efficiency improvements and perhaps strengthening provincial supply
                       markets are needed to overcome logistical challenges.
                    5. Heavy technical review and proposal validation procedures can significantly slow the
                       project cycle and lead to disillusionment and loss of ownership for community

                                                       RDP, although fund flows have been the primary cause of delays for RDP.


                                      6.2          EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS - RECOMMENDATIONS
                                             1. Consider integrating RDP’s Provincial Support Unit (PSU) functions in the provincial
                                                government administration to bring down overall management cost and achieve greater
                                                provincial and sector alignment. For example, the provincial planner, project officer or a
                                                new position, could fill the RDP team leader role. The finance officer function could be
                                                allocated to the Provincial Treasurer.
                                             2. In addition to the core PSU functions, RDP CHs could also come under the
                                                management of provincial government. Their functions could be expanded to serve
                                                other provincial government needs, particularly in planning, monitoring, and community
                                                feedback and response. The cost of CHs could either be fully financed by provincial
                                                governments or cost-shared with RDP including incremental operating costs for CH
                                                travel on a per-sub-project or ward allocation basis.
                                             3. Leveraging RDP operational funds for travel to bring provincial sector officers/staff (i.e.
                                                health and education) to the field would better support sector facilities and services.
                                                Provincial sector staff are often starved of operational budget and unable to travel so
                                                they could piggyback on the RDP expenditures on fuel costs or for the hiring of boats.
                                                RDP operational funds could also be provided directly to provincial governments so that
                                                they could make the most efficient use of funds for both RDP-specific and other
                                                provincial travel needs.
                                             4. Work towards a consolidated, online, interactive database of small-to-medium scale
                                                rural investment projects. This database could be managed at the national level with the
                                                allowance of a decentralized data entry from provincial and all of the way down to the
                                                ward and community levels. Such a database would allow for easy generation of
                                                reports for planning and monitoring purposes.
                                             5. An implementation manual such as those used by PCDF, RDP and RAMP should be
                                                developed for RCLF and all CDFs so that procedures to enhance efficiency and
                                                effectiveness can be standardized and applied across the use of funds. The CDF Act
                                                and associated draft CDF regulations have provided some sorely needed clarity to the
                                                process, but there is still much detail in the operations of the CDFs that need to be
                                                captured to provide wider scope for interpretation and to identify potential abuse.
                                             6. As a part of the implementation manual for RCLF/CDFs, community procurement
                                                guidelines should be developed for RCLF to allow it to remain quick at disbursement,
                                                but to also strengthen the likelihood best prices for procured goods and services are
                                                secured. In Jamaica, constituency funds are channeled through the most appropriate
                                                government agency for the identified project need (for example, education, health, etc.).
                                                This facilitates both compliance with government financial management regulations and
                                                speed of service delivery. The RDP processes offer a light, community-friendly

                  approach, which could be considered. RDP and RCLF processes could even be unified
                  so that funding recipients only need to familiarize themselves with one set of
                  procedures.

                                 ccountability comprises the processes and rules whereby project implementers both at
                                 the local and provincial levels advise the public of their plans, justify their behavior and
                                 results, and take responsibility for their actions. Measures to enhance project
                                 accountability may include citizen participation in key project decisions; the publication
                         of project documentation and/or the announcement of key project decisions; and citizen
                         monitoring of project-related activities. The accountability relationships are multidirectional:
                         downwards from project staff to community beneficiaries, upwards from communities to project
                         staff as well as provincial to national entities, and vertically amongst community members
                         and/or provincial stakeholders.
                                 Transparency comprises the processes and rules whereby project implementers
                         communicate with project beneficiaries and the general public. Information regarding the
                         project including financial and budget data, updates, and the rules relating to contracting and
                         procurement is shared. Measures to enhance project transparency may include the display of
                         written sub-project information at sites, the holding of community or ‘town hall’ meetings,
                         publicizing procurement or contracting rules and issuing guidelines and policies around public
                         access to project and sub-project information.
                               Dispute Management comprises the systems utilized by project implementers to
                         manage or resolve disputes that arise around sub-projects and their implementation. Such

     community leaders, chiefs and church leaders, who resolve sub-project disputes.

                    7.2          ACCOUNTABILITY
                            7.2.1
                                       Accountability within the Rural Development Program37
             On paper, the RDP has the most robust accountability measures of all of the projects
     reviewed. However, there is a gap between prescribed rules and practice. At the community
     level this is not necessarily problematic as many communities are adept at dealing with
     accountability issues outside of project requirements.
          A key objective of the original project design was to improve Member of Provincial
     Assembly (MPA) accountabilities, as written in the Project Appraisal Document (2007):
                     Improved accountability and responsiveness of elected government to community
                     needs is at the heart of the governance objective of the RDP. Therefore the program
                     would include existing local representatives (the ward councilors) in the decision-
                                        38
                     making processes.



              However, improved MPA accountability has not occurred. This relates to what is
     perceived to be a minimal role for MPAs and provincial administrators around sub-project
     selection and implementation. An MPA in Choiseul Province expressed the view that RDP was
     undermining his role as an elected representative and creating parallel lines of accountability.
     The MPA voiced particular dissatisfaction with the CH role, believing that the potential for
     politicization was great. A Premier and Provincial Secretary expressed similar concerns in
     particular seeing the PARC process as a “rubber-stamping” exercise.
             The political economy of local-level politics has a bearing on the role that MPAs play in
     relation to the RDP. SIC members in Malaita Province indicated that there had been no
     involvement of their MPA in relation to their sub-projects. This was because of poor relations
     between the serving member and the host community. In one instance the member was said
     to have not attended the WDC meeting.39 This situation might arise in communities that are
     not politically aligned to their MPA (i.e. who did not support their member at the last provincial

                         election). By contrast, instances of MPAs making significant monetary contributions to RDP
                         projects from their ward grants were encountered, particularly in Western Province.40
                                 The nature of relationships determines communication between Provincial Secretary
                         and the RDP project. Accountability from the PSU of the RDP to members of the provincial
                         executive appears to be confined largely to prescribed project procedures (such as quarterly
                         reporting and the co-signing of cheques). In one province, the RDP Provincial Team Leader
                         had met with the Provincial Secretary once in six months. In another, the Provincial Secretary
                         had met with the RDP Team Leader on a daily basis.
                                  Despite the rarity of meetings, communities have a good understanding of the project.
                         Information sharing is strongest at the commencement of sub-projects when project selection
                         is carried out by CHs. Upon formation of the SIC, and during project implementation,
                         structured information sharing is less common. SICs do not appear to be sharing information
                         on project procurement as per the requirements. SIC community discussions during
                         implementation focus mainly on the need to garner community support, organize in-kind
                         contributions or to address monetary shortfalls.
                                The RDP team leaders answer questions from the general public and SIC members
                         about the sub-project. The PSUs have an open-door policy and SIC members often visit the
                         PSU to share information and obtain advice. In remote areas, SIC members were often able to
                         contact CHs by mobile phone or radio. This good communication helps to reduce issues at the
                         community level or have them resolved early in the project cycle. Much of this communication
                         occurs on an informal and ad hoc basis and is not detailed in project documentation.
                                 SICs that include existing trusted community leaders are likely to fair better in terms of
                         local-level accountability issues. This may be because community members in leadership
                         positions, such as chiefs, have additional expectations, and, in turn accountabilities, imposed
                         on them by community members. This situation is variable though and including chiefs in SICs
                         or any other sub-project related body is not a guarantee of improved accountability or sub-
                         project success. Some chiefs have been discredited in the eyes of their community, often for
                         inappropriate behavior.

                           Each MPA across Solomon Islands receives a base ward-touring grant of SBD 50,000 from the central government. This is
                         added to at the provincial-level using provincial revenue in the form of other discretionary spending streams. For example, for
                         Malaita Province each MPA receives SBD 50,000 (ward grant), Western Province, SBD 135,000 (SBD 100,000 ward grant and
                         SBD 35,000 micro-projects grants), and Choiseul Province, SBD 100,000 (SBD 60,000 ward grant and SBD 40,000 micro-projects
                         grant). It is not possible to say if MPA co-contributions to RDP sub-projects necessarily equate to improved accountabilities and
                         ownership, although in some villages MPAs who did not contribute to RDP projects were the subject of derision by SIC members
                         for failing to use public funds for what they considered was a public good.

                            7.2.2         Accountability within the Provincial Capacity Development
                                          Fund41
            The relevant rules and processes around the PCDF are very similar to SIG. The
     accountability measures documented relate to PCDF funding and not on the specifics of
     community infrastructure sub-projects. PCDF funded sub-projects have little community level
     ownership and do not establish vertical accountability between communities as might occur
     under the RDP. Likewise, this approach also means that upwards accountability from
     community to provincial/central government is absent.

            The PCDF has the strongest provincial level accountabilities out of all of the projects.
     Accountability measures relate to provincial level processes around planning, budgeting and
     procurement. It was observed that the relationship between PCDF provincial national staff and
     the provincial administration and executive is much stronger than that of the RDP and
     meetings occur more frequently.

            The exception to this provincial level focus is provision for ‘community monitoring
     groups’ (CMGs). These groups are established in remote locations and attempt to bring local
     accountability to sub-project contractors. Their stated role is to monitor: “the day-to-day
     implementation of the contract by the contractor, and to represent the interests of the project
     beneficiaries in ensuring that the project is implemented to a good standard.” CMGs are
     mainly a modification of existing community sectoral committees, such as school and health
     committees. They play a monitoring role over project contractors.42 Unfortunately, no
     examples of these groups functioning were witnessed.

             PCDF sub-project information is included in key provincial planning documents,
     including the provincial annual budget estimates and development plans, both are public
     documents enacted by provincial assemblies. For example, the Choiseul Province Draft
     Budget Estimates 2012/2013 details 12 PCDF sub-projects with past expenditure and
     budgeted costs listed.43 Similarly, the province’s medium-term development plan for 2012 to
     2014 details project profiles for all 2012 PCDF sub-projects including a work plan and
     budget.44

     contracts valued at more than SBD 10,000.

                                PCDF sub-projects are not subject to wide consultation although community
                         implementation takes place in remote locations. There is no formal requirement for any type of
                         community contribution in cash or kind. There is minimal community involvement in PCDF
                         funded sub-projects, which is questioned or met with resentment by community members.
                         Communities expressed a preference to be actively informed and engaged and also indicated
                         that PCDF projects were providing necessary infrastructure. Ward members were thought to
                         have an appreciation of what was required in their communities, so extensive community
                         consultation around project selection is not considered to be necessary.

                                 There is a risk of reliance on PGSP staff to implement PCDF funded sub-projects. In
                         one province there appeared to be a strong reliance on the PGSP adviser to assist with sub-
                         project implementation, to the extent that community members in sub-project sites referred to
                         the adviser by name, detailed his role and went to him instead of provincial staff when they
                         had project-related queries.45 Despite this being valued by provincial staff, this approach risks
                         running contrary to the PGSP core objective of building provincial capacity, raises
                         sustainability questions and has the potential to blur lines of accountability.

                                                                       Program46
                                Provincial and community-level accountability provisions of RAMP are difficult to
                         ascertain. This is because three-and-a-half years after signing the initial financing agreement,
                         implementation had not commenced. On reading project documentation, relevant
                         accountability measures appear to be heavily focused upwards from MDPAC to the EU.

                                The provinces did not think RAMP was aligned to provincial priorities, budgets or
                         processes. There was no communication between RAMP and provincial administration staff.
                         In 2012, there were two provincially based RAMP offices, one in Auki, Malaita Province and
                         another in Gizo, Western Province.

                                 The relationship between RAMP and national plans and priorities is not defined in
                         project documents. The RAMP Financing Agreement stipulates MDPAC must obtain EU
                         approval for some steps. Accordingly, there is minimal scope for SIG autonomy. At the
                         national level this undoubtedly affects issues of ownership and the accountability of SIG and
                         the donor.

                                Failure to communicate effectively is having a detrimental effect on local-level
                         accountability. Communication within RAMP was seen to be a challenge. In Choiseul
                         Province, one successful applicant was so hostile toward the RAMP project he had ceased

     communicating with project staff and, despite having access to project funds, was no longer
     checking the project bank account. He expressed a fear of an apparent project requirement
     that he would need to repay project funds if the project was not completed on time. This was
     following years of confusing, conflicting and delayed communications with project staff. The
     constant and long delay in the disbursement of funds was also a concern. This demonstrates
     how an absence or failure of downward accountability (from project implementers to
     beneficiaries) has a potential to create frustrations or lead to conflict. It also raises a risk of
     project failure.


                             7.2.4          Accountability within the Rural Constituency Livelihood Fund47
             There was no evidence of capacity development of MRD staff, the CDOs or MPs on
     procedures that deal with funds in an accountable and transparent manner. MPs have direct
     control over the bank account and payments and no accountability measures are observed.
     There are no public documents stipulating rules or guidelines in relation to CDFs including
     applicable accountability measures.

             RCLF is being used on a narrow range of personal household and relatively small
     items: metal roofing, solar panels, water tanks, outboard motors, chainsaws, portable milling
     equipment, farm tools and fuel.48 The most substantial RCLF expenditure is in North West
     Choiseul Constituency where the MP had used SBD $23,692 in 2010 on metal roofing for a
     church. This is in contrast to the majority of expenditure, which is on individual households for
     roofing, solar panels or lights. Not one output was linked to relevant provincial or national
     plans nor was any participatory planning process observed.

            Despite no documented procedures or rules, there are past initiatives that have
     attempted to improve accountabilities and transparency around the CDF including:

                       1. Efforts made by MRD to collect basic data around RCLF spending. A dataset has been
                          prepared, which includes basic information and data for 2010.
                       2. Taiwan, China (ROC) started an acquittal process across all constituency funds in
                          2011/12. ROC constituency funds, which in 2012 comprised of some SBD $1 million per
                          year per constituency, are released throughout the year in three tranches with the
                          release of each tranche being contingent upon acquittal of the previous. Towards the
                          end of 2012, it was reported that ROC was withholding the payment of around SBD 5.4
                                                                                            49
                          million pending the submission of constituency acquittal reports.



     47
          No definition of ‘Constituency Development Funds’ is provided in the legislation.
     48
       A 2012 application form for the RCLF, which was produced by the MRD, states that RCLF is for “social development project[s]”
     with the “nature of [RCLF] project[s]” being “housing, solar lighting, fishing, transportation, agricultural/commercial projects and
     small infrastructure”.

                                                They may also lose their seat in Parliament. A number of MPs have been convicted in
                                                the past for misusing CDFs. A recent well-publicized case saw one MP jailed for 14
                                                months for misusing rural micro-fisheries funds. Owing to his conviction and
                                                imprisonment he lost his seat in Parliament.
                                             4. In 2003 and 2008 individual MPs introduced motions in Parliament calling for increased
                                                accountability in relation to CDFs. In the latter year a “management and regulatory
                                                                                                             50
                                                mechanism” for the disbursement of CDFs was requested. Other MPs have also
                                                                                                                              51
                                                publically argued for the introduction of improved accountabilities for CDFs.


                                  The Constituency Development Funds Bill 2013 was passed in March 2013. The
                         purpose of the Act is to provide for “developing, supervising and regulating the management
                         and disbursement of Constituency Development Funds in a transparent and accountable
                         manner”52. The Act provides for the preparation of a ‘Constituency Development Plan’ based
                         on a ‘Constituency Profile’ as the basis for the disbursement of funds. It also indicates that
                         CDOs will pay suppliers in accordance with the Public Finance and Audit Act. It provides
                         power to the MRD to investigate instances of alleged mismanagement of funds. The PS of the
                         MRD has explained that the new Act is the first in a series of legislative reforms with a “bigger
                         bill” anticipated in 2014.53 Despite the above initiatives, provincial and local-level sentiment
                         toward RCLF is negative due to a lack of accountability and transparency.

                                Provincial executive members have no knowledge of what rural livelihood funds were
                         spent on in their province. In the process of formulating his provinces’ medium- term
                         development plan, one Premier invited national MPs to meet to discuss a possible alignment
                         between provincial plans and priorities and constituency spending. None of the MPs or CDOs
                         accepted his invitation.

                                 There are low levels of understanding at the community level about the amount of
                         funds available to MPs, how they are administered and what they are spent on. When asked if
                         they were aware of the sums involved those who replied nominated a figure well below the
                         current SBD 5.2 million allocated annually. During election campaigning, visits by candidates
                         were said to have provided some awareness around available constituency funds with
                         prospective MPs detailing to constituents what they intended spending CDF monies on. The
                         minority with access to media, such as newspapers, was overall better informed.

Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities




             Communities view RCLF, and CDFs more broadly, as a means of rewarding political
     supporters. In Malaita Province, it appears common knowledge that incumbent members could
     obtain a list of those individuals in their constituency who voted for them. In contrast, in
     Choiseul Province the incumbent member was said to distribute items purchased using RCLF
     for everyone. One CDO indicated that initially his MP had adopted an approach of only
     favoring individuals who voted for him. This was said to be largely because of pressure from
     his supporters to do so. The practice of only rewarding political supporters would therefore
     appear to be variable across the country and particularly dominant in Malaita Province. The
     Prime Minister has acknowledged the public’s poor perception of CDFs, commenting that the
     2013 Constituency Fund Bill was produced because of “the public’s distrust of MPs’ handling
     of constituency development funds.”54

                    7.3      TRANSPARENCY

                           7.3.1         Transparency within RDP
            RDP is a development model that empowers people and is well supported by the
     Government. A newspaper reported: “Experience with RDP has shown that when rural
     communities are given the responsibility and funding to address their highest priorities, they
     can do so in a highly inclusive and transparent manner with high quality infrastructure.”55

            The Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach of RDP is meant to ensure
     information is widely shared and accessible. As SIC members are drawn from the ranks of
     community members, and most SIC members have access to project information, there is
     scope for individuals at the village level to access relevant project data within their
     communities. CHs also regularly visit communities providing another source for information.
     Team leaders and staff from PSUs spend time answering questions from the public and
     explaining RDP processes.56 Unique to RDP is a detailed communications strategy and
     several RDP produced brochures and posters.

            Communities are proficient at sharing information on local initiatives, such as church
     fundraising activities. This is achieved through financial information placed on a public notice
     board (see Figure 6). Announcements are also made during public meetings or after church
     services. This was observed in homegrown initiatives but not in any of the sub-projects. RDP
     sub-project community meetings were held in public spaces, often after church or in a public
     meeting space such as a dedicated community building.

                         RDP. In most communities with PCDF funded projects there was no knowledge about specific
                         project costs and where funds originated. Again, this stems from the different modalities the
                         projects adopt, with the PCDF focusing on provincial-level systems and processes.

                                    Unlike RDP and RAMP, PCDF project typically involves a contractor from outside the
                         beneficiary community bidding for sub-project work in an open tender process. The winning
                         bidder will carry out the work with no requisite community contribution. This process can result
                         in little information for communities.

                                 However, efforts are made in transparency and communication. One PGSP adviser in
                         Malaita Province travels to host communities, often with the serving MPA to discuss
                         prospective sub-projects. At a footbridge project in Choiseul Province, the provincial
                         administration had been actively involved in the establishment of a PCDF ‘bridge committee’,
                         whose terms of reference included disseminating relevant project information and answering
                         “any questions from the public”. PCDF is also the only project utilizing display boards to share
                         project information (see Figure 7).

             In Taro, Choiseul Province, a number of display boards (see Figure 7) were visible at
     project sites but unfortunately did not contain financial or contact information. Conversely, a

                                                     out of five PCDF sub-projects in Malaita Province
                                                     that had a display board containing details of the

                                                    inaccessible to local-level beneficiaries and

     Choiseul Province
                                                  intelligibility of documents and processes, in
     particular the grant application form. This was highlighted in the mid-term review (MTR) of
     RAMP: “ the guidelines for the Call for Proposals were exclusive for many remote and
     isolated communities, not being able to express their needs due to the highly complex
     character of the guidelines, reducing the relevance of the programme from its onset.”59

             RAMP employs a competitive application process of placing advertisements in the
     national media. At the community level it is thought that only ‘educated’ people could respond
     to the proposals. This creates transparency and accountability problems. If successful
     applicants do not have sufficient knowledge of what they are implementing, how can they
     understand and follow the accountability provisions? The selection process did not include
     important criteria relating to local-level accountabilities such as social inclusion, good
     governance and human rights.60 Successful applicants were able to attend workshops
     providing a better understanding of RAMP procedures.

       Ibid, p. 1. A further frequent source of complaint relayed during the fieldwork was the requirement that application forms had to
     be typed and submitted in both electronic (CD) and paper form. Applicants spoken to point out this was unfeasible in remote rural
     communities, which did not have access to reliable electricity or computer equipment.

                                Similar to PCDF, RAMP sub-project documents were silent in relation to intra-
                         community processes for sharing relevant project information. Nevertheless, three successful
                         applicants had adopted existing community processes and structures to impart project
                         information. Given the RAMP requirement for a community contribution, it was clearly
                         necessary to mobilize community members as a group. Successful applicants indicated that it
                         was common practice to inform community members of what was happening and share views
                         and ideas. It was also noted that the agenda of one of the pre-implementation training
                         modules related to how to hold effective meetings.


                                                    7.3.4              Transparency within the Rural Constituency Livelihood Fund
                                Aside from the requirement that CDF funds be audited and figures published in the
                         annual SIG Budget Estimates, there appears to be no structured transparency measures for
                         RCLF. Community members lack knowledge about the amount of funds available to their MP,
                         where this money is coming from and where it is being allocated. There is a strong belief at the
                         community level that the funds are used for political purposes and are a reward for voters.

                                 The application processes for CDFs vary between constituencies. Some individual
                         community members communicate directly with their MPs to seek assistance. In other cases a
                         structured and open process is employed. In West New Georgia, Vona Vona Constituency in
                         Western Province, a ‘project proposal form’ must be completed. These forms can be obtained
                         for a small fee from a local store. The form includes a requirement to detail project objectives,
                         project beneficiaries, details of ‘local contribution’ and how the project will be managed. An
                         advisory board vets prospective projects before the MP endorses them. Similarly, in Malaita
                         Outer Islands Constituency a committee exists to screen and assess applications (which also
                         involve the completion of a written application form) and make recommendations to the
                         serving MP. The committee is said to comprise of a cross-section of community members. In
                         2012 the MRD devised a standard RCLF application form. These are completed by CDOs
                         after receiving requests from citizens and are then presented to MPs.

                                 RDP is the only project with a dispute management process that addresses intra-
                         community disputation. However, despite the existence of a ‘Feedback Handling System’,
                         provincially based RDP staff were unaware or unable to produce a copy of the document.
                         Similarly, provincial government staff members were unaware of an RDP project dispute
                         management process. Both groups thought that community members wished for disputes to
                         be referred to existing community structures for possible resolution.
                                 The RDP team leader in Malaita Province stated that if a problem could not be
                         resolved within the host community, then the Provincial Secretary would write to SIC members

     outlining the repercussions of failing to reach a satisfactory outcome (i.e. cessation of the sub-
     project). After an allocated period, if the problem remained he would then write to the PS of
     MDPAC recommending the termination of the sub-project.

              Land disputes are regarded by project implementers as one of the main causes of
     disputation in rural Solomon Islands. RDP requires “resource owners” to sign a “land
     commitment letter”. This occurs prior to project implementation. The letter attests that the land
     is not the subject of any dispute and is free to be used for the purposes of the project. Various
     SIC members referred to this letter when explaining why land related problems had not arisen
     in relation to their sub-project.

             Efforts are made by communities to vet possible land issues prior to choosing a sub-
     project. For a number of sub-projects the location or type of sub-project had changed without
     any input from project staff so as to avoid any possible land related problems. Despite such
     measures, disputes still arise and may come to the attention of project staff. Four out of the
     five RDP terminated sub-projects involved customary land-related disputes.

            Communities that had experienced disputation related to their RDP sub-project had
     universally utilized existing community resources and, in most instances, this appeared to
     have resulted in a satisfactory outcome. It also helped that members of the SIC were
     commonly prominent community leaders, including chiefs and church leaders.

                                         Development Fund62
             The documented dispute resolution procedure of PCDF relates exclusively to contract
     related disputes between provincial governments and PCDF contractors. No written provisions
     or procedures were seen for intra-community related disputes.

            At PCDF sub-project sites communities prefer to deal internally with sub-project related
     disputes. However, there was an active role for the province in the resolution of disputes,
     which could not be resolved at the local level. The key provincial player in resolving disputes is
     the provincial secretary.

             In relation to land-related disputes, one PGSP adviser indicated that PCDF projects
     would only be implemented on registered land. The PGSP ‘Planning and Budgeting’ training
     material states that projects that fall within a defined list will not be funded. This includes
     projects on land with ‘unsettled’ issues: “Any project that requires the use of land that is
     encumbered in a way [will not receive funding] . land must already belong to the Assembly

                         or it must be known that legal ownership can and will be transferred to the Assembly prior to
                         the commencement of intended project.” 63

                                 Some PCDF sub-projects were seen to be on customary land, although most are on
                         registered land. One project on customary land had triggered a land related dispute, which the
                         relevant provincial government had been trying to remedy 64. Implementing projects on
                         registered land is not a guarantee that land-related disputes will not arise. A land-related
                         dispute had arisen in relation to a PCDF staff housing project on registered land in Malu’u,
                         north Malaita, reportedly with a need to hire private security to secure the land in question.

                                                                       Projects Program65
                                 Similar to PCDF, the dispute resolution procedure within RAMP is exclusively focused
                         on contract-related disputes. There are no procedures to guide communities in relation to
                         disputes. Only a limited number of successful RAMP applicants were consulted and no intra-
                         community disputes were encountered. Sub-project implementation had yet to commence. In
                         relation to potential land-related disputes, similar to the RDP, the RAMP application form
                         requires applicants to detail who owns the land on which the sub-project will be constructed
                         and calls for a “land ownership certificate” to be completed.


                                                    7.4.4              Dispute management within Rural Constituency Livelihood
                                                                       Fund
                                 RCLF has no documented dispute resolution procedure. Interestingly, the politicization
                         of constituency funds was not a visible concern in the communities. There was a clear view
                         that the RCLF was a political fund and there was little expectation that the funds would be
                         used for broader community development. There was also little agitation around the use of the
                         funds and even a degree of humor among some when sharing a belief that non-supporters of
                         serving MPs would simply have to wait four years (Solomon Islands’ election cycle) before
                         their preferred candidate would be elected and then they too would benefit from the RCLF.
                         There was very little expectation, or understanding, that MPs should be accountable for RCLF
                         spending.

                                                1. While there were no obvious cases of misuse of funds or corruption encountered
                                                   during the fieldwork, there are significant risks that such leakage could occur as most

Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities




                       of the expenditures for these programs take place at the sub-national, even
                       community level, where activity monitoring is difficult. There is significant concern
                       regarding the misuse of public funds at the national level, but this concern is not
                       usually sufficiently substantiated. The public’s interest in ensuring proper use of
                       public funds is an opportunity to improve the governance of the programs reviewed
                       for this study, but this interest is not met with data and information regarding the
                       operations of these programs that would substantially enhance their accountability.
                   2. On the whole, there is insufficient public information about each of the programs and
                      all programs could do better in providing more visual printed materials to
                      affected/beneficiary communities so that they can develop a better understanding as
                      to how these programs work.
                   3. None of the programs have functional grievance redress mechanisms for
                      beneficiary/affected communities. Communities rely mainly on traditional dispute
                      resolution systems so they lack channels of communication, which would allow them
                      to go outside of traditional systems if they needed or wanted to.
                   4. There are limited-to-no accountability mechanisms in place between communities
                      and service providers to monitor the quality of service delivery once sub-project
                      construction is complete.
                   5. Media coverage of the programs reviewed in this study is mostly ad hoc, with no
                      systematic reporting of progress and the use of funds to the public. Public meetings
                      are held, for PCDF in particular, but these are not covered on the radio and most
                      people cannot afford to travel to participate.
                   6. While there have been disputes regarding land, this has not escalated to violence. In
                      this sense, it seems that the informal and/or traditional mechanisms for resolving
                      disputes are working even if they are not able to uphold agreements made with
                      respect to the sub-projects.
                   7. Accountability from the programs to the National Government is reasonably strong in
                      the cases of PCDF and RDP, with each convening regular project committee
                      meetings and sharing progress reports. RCLF has no means of reporting progress to
                      government stakeholders except through ad hoc audits done by the Auditor General,
                      which to-date, have not been circulated even within government.
                   8. RCLF is especially problematic with respect to accountability and transparency. Aside
                      from the audits mentioned above, there is very little information as to how RCLF
                      funds are used at all levels of government and society. This lack of information and
                      accountability stokes concern and criticism of waste, fraud and corruption, which
                      occasionally make their way into the media and public discourse.

                                                1. Develop a robust set of accountability and transparency measures for RCLF and all
                                                   CDFs including a realistic financial auditing approach that reflects capacity
                                                   requirements; regular public reporting requirements including information on funding
                                                   allocations, expenditures, types of activities funded and recipients; and social
                                                   accountability mechanisms to allow citizens to monitor the use of funds in their
                                                   communities, etc. There are instructive lessons from other countries that have
                                                   experience with CDFs, such as the use of a social audit and an independent
                                                   constituency fund board in Kenya.
                                                2. Develop and pilot social accountability mechanisms, such as community scorecards,
                                                   to enable community members/beneficiaries to hold service providers accountable for
                                                   the quality of service delivery and not just the quality of infrastructure construction.
                                                3. All of the programs should instigate a project-level dispute management policy and
                                                   process. Sanctioned dispute management systems are important for a number of
                                                   reasons including potentially curtailing sub-project related problems before they
                                                   escalate. While most communities are generally capable of dealing internally with the
                                                   majority of sub-project-related disputes, this is not a universal situation and disputes
                                                   can arise that cannot be dealt with at the local-level.
                                                4. Cultivate a culture of transparency to counter either resistance or disinterest in
                                                   providing access to information. This is important because invariably funds being
                                                   used are public monies and, accordingly, project implementers need to be held
                                                   accountable in relation to its use. A culture of transparency can be fostered in a
                                                   number of ways including ensuring that project participants at training events are
                                                   informed of the requirement to share project information with the public; guidelines or
                                                   policies are enacted by project implementers in relation to sharing project information
                                                   (and are then publicized) and instituting an open-door policy for relevant
                                                   project/government offices. Each program should regularly (once or twice a year)
                                                   publish updates on progress, in particular for the allocation and use of funds.
                                                5. Utilize mobile phone and Internet smartphone technology to allow community
                                                   members to easily provide feedback to program management units and to allow the
                                                   public to find information online as to basic sub-project details and progress.
                                                6. Develop simple, visual printed materials explaining how each program works for use
                                                   in rural areas with low levels of literacy.

      FIGURE 8: A COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE – THE
      GRIEVANCE REDRESS SYSTEM OF THE NATIONAL SOLIDARITY
      PROGRAMME OF AFGHANISTAN

       The National Solidarity Program (NSP) is a nationwide effort in Afghanistan to address the
       infrastructure needs of rural communities through the establishment of Community Development
       Councils (CDCs) elected by local communities. CDCs select priority rural infrastructure sub-
       projects in areas such as water supply and sanitation, roads, bridges and rural energy. The NSP is
       implemented through the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development with the assistance of
       the World Bank. From its inception in 2003 to mid-2011 a total of 27,800 elected CDCs have been
       mobilized and more than 48,400 community infrastructure projects have been approved and
       implemented of which 46,000 have been completed.

       In 2010 a comprehensive project level grievance redress mechanism was developed for the NSP,
       being rolled out in January 2011. A six- person complaints handling unit was established at the
       headquarters of the NSP with designated focal points at provincial, district, and community level
       offices. Channels for complaints include submission via telephone, email, website, mobile phone
       SMS, and complaint boxes. All complaints received are consolidated in a central database where
       they are categorized and assigned to the most appropriate level to resolve. Depending on the
       nature of the grievance, clear timelines are established within which each level is required to
       respond before it is referred to the next level.

       Since the implementation of the grievance redress mechanism some 532 complaints have been
       received at headquarters and field offices of which it is reported that only 40 are unresolved. Of the
       total number of complaints registered, 265 were social in nature (including land acquisition), 47
       were procurement related, 110 were financial, 65 were technical and 45 related to process delays.

                                          8.1          WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY?

                                   ith respect to small-scale infrastructure, the primary focus of this study,
                                   sustainability, has two main dimensions: quality and appropriateness of design and
                                   construction; and financial and human resources for maintenance. In short,
                                   sustainable infrastructure is built to last and has an institutional mechanism for
                         operations and maintenance, which will ensure uninterrupted and long-lasting benefit to the
                         community.

                                          Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present
                                          without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own

                    8.2       REVIEW OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICIES
              Although there have been mixed outcomes67 in the implementation of sub-projects,
     construction standards across the various programs are high. This applies particularly to
     education, health and water supply infrastructure and to a lesser extent, economic
     infrastructure sub-projects. The latter projects would benefit significantly from adopting a more
     strict business planning approach.

                           8.2.1          Building codes
             AusAID funded development of building codes for six Pacific island countries including
     Solomon Islands. This resulted in the National Building Code and House Building Manual,
     published in 1990, for each of the countries. The purpose of the code was to improve the
     structural standards of buildings to enable them to withstand the repeated and widespread
     damage caused by natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, storm surges and tsunamis).
     Adoption of the codes has been slow, with the consequence that houses and other buildings
     continue to be damaged heavily during disasters. The main cause of the slow adoption has
     been weak administration and enforcement procedures, particularly outside the building
     inspectorate of Honiara.

             Some provinces have formulated their own regulations to govern and control building
     development and construction. The provinces use the physical planners and provincial works
     officers to administer and enforce building by-laws. However, this has not been the case with
     building works in rural areas outside of the provincial capitals.

                           8.2.2          Standard designs
             Comparing the building works constructed under the different programs there is not a
     significant difference in design approach and in construction quality. Most conform to the
     “House Building Manual” specifications. For public buildings with standard architectural and
     structural design drawings, specifications and bills of quantities are generally available (for
     example, the NZAID standard designs for double classrooms and library/offices) and only
     need some site-specific modifications to make them suitable. Typical modifications are in site
     formation and earth grading, internal planning of room partitions and the type and finishes of
     external cladding used. Exceptions to the standardized cases are social infrastructure, such as
     women’s centres and kindergartens and child care centres, which are more ad hoc in design.

                           8.2.3          Quality control
             Construction codes install quality control. While codes cannot prevent damage from a
     natural disaster, they are intended to provide a degree of resilience that can protect people
     inside buildings and allow them to safely evacuate. Fully complying with seismic codes, for
     example, would only add one to two per cent extra to construction costs. Effective site
     supervision is the key to quality control. Rural infrastructure projects all appear to have been
     well supervised and are a reflection of the good standard of vocational training given to craft
     persons.

                                 The sub-projects have adopted standardized procedures for supervision, generally
                        using a checklist approach (for example the RDP technical audit form). This approach has its
                        limitations in circumstances where disaster hazards are present as it does not take a
                        sufficiently holistic view of structures at risk, particularly in ensuring that the critical parts of
                        structures such as roof and suspended floor holding down fixings, cross bracing, gable/eaves
                        fixings and continuity of steel reinforcement, are effective.

                                 Some additional works have been implemented under all four programs mainly as
                        “economic” or “environmental protection” infrastructure. Most of the economic infrastructure is
                        investment in private sector income generating sub-projects (for example piggeries, beehives,
                        restaurants). These types of projects are not standardized and are designed to meet
                        particular site and operational needs. Another type of economic infrastructure are market halls;
                        again not standardized and over-designed for the purposes of providing primary market
                        facilities, usually for a single weekday usage. Environmental protection infrastructure relates
                        primarily to appropriate technology and includes simple sheds for solar charging stations.

                              This section reviews data available on sub-project costs, looking at variations between
                        programs, provinces and sectors.


                               Table 28 summarizes the costs and benefits of selected sub-projects. Comparing the
                        cost per capita with other water supply data shows that the projects are low cost largely
                        because they are upgrading schemes. Building costs for staff housing and kindergartens
                        compared well with other cost data.

             Table 29 summarizes the water supply schemes executed and completed under the
     various programs and provides an indication of the average cost per scheme. The cost
     variation is wide, ranging from a very low cost in Western Province (SBD 3,036) to a maximum
     in Central Province (SBD 25,512), although most cluster around the average of SBD 5,248,
     indicating a broadly consistent approach to the design and competitive pricing of the schemes.

                                Table 30 gives a comparison of water supply based on RDP data taking account of the
                         cost per beneficiary, per standpipe and per gallon. These show very consistent costs on a
                         standpipe basis. The schemes are a mixture of new and upgraded/repaired systems.

                                Table 31 provides a cost comparison of three common building types constructed
                         under RDP: kindergarten (single storey ground level masonry structure); nurse aid post
                         (ground level); and staff housing (raised building structure). All are timber-framed structures.
                         Although there is a large variation in cost per square metre for the kindergartens and staff
                         houses (25 to 30 per cent) this is consistent with the local variation. The average cost per
                         square metre is consistent with international practice for low-cost permanent structures.

               8.4    MAINTENANCE

                     8.4.1       Maintenance responsibilities
              Operations and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure and assets is a key issue in
     optimizing its use and sustainability. To achieve this optimization, the type of infrastructure, the
     roles of the different stakeholders and their relationships to funding sources as well as the
     overall governance framework needs to be clarified. Below in Table 32 is a typical breakdown
     of responsibilities for various types of infrastructure reviewed in this study. The study did not
     investigate the extent to which these responsibilities were being fulfilled, but there were
     several examples where community maintenance was active (particularly for water supply), as
     well as examples where economic infrastructure (piggeries, for example), were not maintained
     and are no longer operating.

                                                    8.4.2              Example of community-based user fee: community standpipes
                                 The majority of rural water supply systems are un-metered community standpipes.
                         Revenue collection is a monthly fee, collected by the committee. Variants on this system are
                         for the committee to appoint somebody to collect revenues and also be responsible for
                         maintenance or to franchise the standpipe to an individual entrepreneur to operate a water
                         shop or kiosk. The main problem with standpipes is to ensure that the population being served
                         by the standpipe will be sufficient to generate enough revenue to cover all the maintenance
                         and repair costs.

                                The water supply community group leaders suggested that the likely and acceptable
                         water supply levy would be SBD 2 to 5 per month per family. On the basis of the average cost
                         per capita being SBD 328 (see Figure 9), the monthly charge would need to be SBD 5 per
                         household to cover the maintenance cost.

                                 Depending upon the type of infrastructure, a preventative maintenance plan can be
                         established, (see Table 33) including estimated maintenance costs including: routine
                         maintenance; repairs and retro-fitting; utilities and cleaning running costs; depreciation and
                         equipment replacement costs; other expenses (fees, defects replacement etc.).

              8.5     COMPARISON OF SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE
             Drawing on the same approach used in the earlier chapter on Efficiency and
     Effectiveness, the following Table 34 provides a comparative framework to identify the
     strengths and weaknesses of each of the programs with respect to the key dimensions of
     sustainability. The rankings were derived from the field visits, interviews and a review of
     reports and applied across the four programs and based on the 29 sub-projects.
             Using these ranking against the 29 sub-projects visited in Guadalcanal (5 sites) and
     Malaita (24 sites). The results of applying the sustainability criteria against the 29 sub-projects
     representative of the four programs are as described in the text which follows and Figure 10.

                                RCLF is rated weak for all of the sustainability indicators, as there are no guidelines or
                         technical reviews to ensure quality, social and environmentally sound design and construction.
                         There are neither any documents, nor staff, to support or enforce any codes or standards with
                         regards to the projects funded from RCLF.


                                                    8.5.2              PCDF sustainability results
                                 Within the procurement and contract arrangements applied for PCDF-funded activities
                         there are a range of provisions that are aimed at enhancing the quality of infrastructure
                         constructed. There are basic environmental management requirements, but provincial
                         governments lack staff with environmental expertise to monitor and enforce the requirements.
                         The public benefit of PCDF-funded infrastructure is also satisfactory as this is assessed
                         against the benefit of other projects that may be funded at the provincial level, and debated
                         amongst provincial assembly members. Operations and maintenance support, particularly
                         within the health and education sectors, receives recurrent budget expenditures, but these
                         transfers are not budgeted according to actual expenditures requirements according to the
                         extent of public facilities.

                                There may be some light analysis of cost-benefit taking place, but this not apparent
                         from the decision-making documents used for PCDF. Decisions are made on a political level
                         with some sector input, but with little-to-no economic analysis. Also, despite the strategic

     advantage the province has in terms of its access to various kinds of provincial maps, there is
     little evidence that projects chosen for funding were located according to land-use plans.
     There is an effort towards equity in the geographic spread of resources, but this is not a
     strategic location of resources.


                      8.5.3        RAMP sustainability results
             The EU funding provided for RAMP brings with it a set of standards that aim to ensure
     that EU funds are applied in a social and environmentally responsible way. As such, there are
     guidelines for RAMP-funded projects in environmental management and inclusive access to
     services, which are validated at the time of proposal. Funding proposals also require a case to
     be made regarding the broad public benefit of the projects as well as plans for maintaining
     infrastructure. However, there is no monitoring, certification of environmental management or
     ongoing maintenance. Similar to the other programs, there is no means of cost-benefit
     analysis nor is there any spatial planning as projects are awarded funding based on merit
     rather than planning process.

                      8.5.4        RDP sustainability results
              One of RDP’s strengths is its inclusive, participatory process which helps to ensure that
     projects are designed in such a way as to meet the needs of all community members,
     including the disadvantaged or disabled. The RDP Project Manual also includes a rigorous
     social and environmental screening checklist, and RDP employs full-time staff to monitor and
     certify compliance at the time of completion.

             While RDP requires every project to have an Operations and Maintenance Plan, there
     is no recurrent budget at the disposal of the program to ensure a flow of funds for
     maintenance. Maintenance arrangements must either be organized by the community, or
     negotiated with responsible sector ministries. Given the demand-driven nature of RDP, there is
     no spatial planning at a provincial level, some at the ward level and little at the village level.
     There is now some data available for cost-benefit analysis of water supply projects, but this
     has yet to be applied to guide and optimize the economic benefit of design.

              8.6       SUSTAINABILITY - FINDINGS
                    1. Overall, the quality of construction of rural infrastructure is sound and appropriate for
                       the supply base available in country. The difficulty in accessing supplies as well as
                       budget shortfalls pose a risk to the full completion of projects, which must be
                       monitored to ensure that this does not affect the integrity of the structures.
                    2. Per unit and per beneficiary costs vary by province, but are generally consistent with
                       similar types of small-scale rural projects in other parts of the world. There are some
                       outliers identified on both the high and low side, but mechanisms are not currently in
                       pace to identify such extreme cases and treat them accordingly.

                                                3. The likelihood of financial sustainability varies widely depending upon the type of
                                                   infrastructure and the location. However, there is insufficient data on the extent to
                                                   which maintenance funds are flowing from the various sources including national
                                                   government transfers for education and health, user fees for water and rural health
                                                   services, etc. Sector-specific studies are investigating some of these areas (i.e.
                                                   health), but this information is not being fed into the planning and design of any of the
                                                   programs included in this study.
                                                4. Most buildings seem to conform to national home building specifications, but the
                                                   adoption of structural standards that would enable buildings to withstand natural
                                                   disasters has been slow. There are some modest efforts being made to help rural
                                                   communities to design more climate and disaster resilient infrastructure, but these
                                                   are only in their early stages.
                                                5. Application of social and environmental risk mitigation mechanisms is mixed. Even for
                                                   programs that include such provisions, monitoring for compliance is generally weak,
                                                   except for RDP.
                                                6. Despite the widespread support for new water supply systems, there is no systematic
                                                   water quality testing to ensure that water is safe to drink.
                                                7. Projects that are focused on business/economic activity have little focus on
                                                   sustainability. There are no business plans, and no means of monitoring and
                                                   supporting the ongoing operations of these projects (i.e. through technical
                                                   assistance).

                                                   The current codes for the Pacific were developed 25 years ago. Design theory and
                                                   practice has developed in that time, particularly relating to earthquake design,
                                                   tsunamis and storm surges.
                                                2. Build climate change adaptation approaches into project design as it is now
                                                   recognised that the smaller Pacific islands are at severe risk of the effects of climatic
                                                   change.
                                                3. Develop a systematic process of monitor the quality of potable water for water supply
                                                   projects.
                                                4. Develop a different proposal model for economic/income-generating projects, which
                                                   includes business plans. Business development assistance should also be made
                                                   available to these businesses to improve the likelihood of sustainability.
                                                5. Develop a guide to budgeting for the maintenance of various types of infrastructure
                                                   drawing on available O&M plans and accumulated experience in different sectors.
                                                   This information should be shared with communities and other stakeholders at the
                                                   type of project initiation, as well as through training on operations and maintenance.

               6. Compile a catalogue of standard designs and unit costs from across these and other
                  programs to use as a resource to speed the process of design and to ensure quality
                  design standards. The Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation (MDPAC),
                  as the lead planning ministry, could maintain this catalogue.
               7. Continue to collect cost per beneficiary data for project types, share this information
                  across programs and apply it to project appraisal to ensure that projects are good
                  value for money. This national data should also be benchmarked against other
                  countries to assess whether the logistics and economies of scale in Solomon Islands
                  do results in higher costs, and whether there are ways to reduce these costs.

                                          Rural Communities
                               s this report was being prepared, major policy and program shifts were underway for
                               rural community infrastructure and service delivery in the Solomon Islands, including a
                               policy guiding use of constituency funds (2013 CDF Act and draft Regulations). The
                               Rural Development Program is entering its second phase (RDP 2). The Provincial
                         Government Strengthening Program, which previously supported PCDF, has concluded, so
                         PCDF is solely supported by government now. RAMP has come to an end. While each
                         province is different, and flexibility is therefore required, a framework is needed to illustrate
                         how these and other rural, sub-national investment programs and activities fit together and
                         how public and donor funds can be leveraged to the greatest effect.

                                 When the first wave of these programs came into being it was still in the wake of the
                         public sector revival and public confidence-building period after the end of civil conflict and the
                         entry of RAMSI. Efforts were made at that time to align rural development and sub-national

     service delivery support, but the main push was to get these programs up and running and to
     work out the linkages later. These linkages were never sufficiently worked out, and that is why
     this report has endeavored to take a fresh look at the experience of the last 5-10 years, and
     propose a new architecture for rural service delivery. Please note that specific and operational
     recommendations are also provided at the end of each section in this report.

              9.1     REDEFINING THE FUNDING STREAMS
             To begin to conceptualize a new architecture for rural service delivery, the three
     streams of funding analyzed in this report should be further defined and understood as one
     integrated system of support which targets different types of development outcomes and
     mandates depending upon the mode of delivery. These three funding streams and their
     current sources of funding are shown again in Table 35.


      TABLE 35: CURRENT FUNDING STREAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES




             The lines are currently blurred as to what each of these streams can and cannot
     finance and there is considerable overlap. In order to enhance the effectiveness of each
     stream, an effort should be made to better define what funds should and should not be used
     for. Table 36 outlines a suggested breakdown of the use of funds from each stream under the
     assumptions that each stream will be maintained. It is based mainly on assigned functions
     where these exist and adjusts for areas where there is significant overlap, where the outcomes
     may not match well with the institutional set-up for managing the use of the funds, and ‘best fit’
     in terms of capacities.

                                          9.2          REDISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS
                                 At present, the overall distribution is skewed heavily towards the constituency funds.
                         To ensure all three of these streams of funding continue to flow, government should make a
                         long-term commitment through its development plans and regularly allocated budget
                         resources. PCDF and RDP have been financed to a degree through the SIG budget, but the

     continuation of this funding remains uncertain. Donor funding may remain part of the mix, but
     this should be positioned mainly as support for capacity building, supplementary grant support
     (in addition to government support), program management, and further institutionalization of
     these delivery systems.
             Now that the provincial and community streams of support have proven to be effective
     service delivery mechanisms, with considerable advantages compared to constituency funds,
     there should be a redistribution of government funds so that they are not so disproportionately
     skewed towards constituency funds. The total amount spent on the four programs included in
     this study since 2008 is $US 134,226,722. Of this amount, 60 per cent went to RCLF ($US
     74,479,079); 20 per cent to RDP ($US 26,530,000); 13 per cent to PCDF ($US 18,099,461)
     and seven per cent to RAMP ($US 9,718,182).

            Figure 11 shows the distribution of the budget amongst the programs from 2008 to
     2012. Clearly the vast majority of the funds are directed through the constituency level.

            It is worth noting the SIG contributions to these four programs between 2008 and 2012.
     Figure 12 shows that from the total amount of SIG funding spent on these four programs from
     2008 to 2012, RCLF received the highest portion of funds at 87 per cent ($US 74,479,079);
     PGSP/PCDF with eight per cent ($US 6,821,955); RDP at five per cent ($US 4,285,714) and
     RAMP at zero.

                                 Considering the largest portion of SIG funds is going to the mechanism with the
                         weakest governance,69 and SIG is already funding the PCDF and RDP, it is proposed that SIG
                         consider a redistribution of some SIG funds from CDF to the other streams. For example, if the
                         SIG followed a more modest annual CDF allocation to MPs, as evidenced in other countries
                         (Uganda at $US 4,000 per MP or Pakistan at $US 60,000 per MP70), there would be a balance
                         of resources available for other funding streams and for other public programs. The shift from
                         CDF to other streams could also be incremental. It would be important to first consider the
                         need for establishing principles for funding streams; ensuring the corresponding capacity is in
                         place to implement the funds; formulae for allocation of funds to each stream; etc.
                                  Some considerations on formula are that RDP could continue to allocate funds
                         according to an equal amount for every ward, based on an amount sufficient to undertake
                         small scale infrastructure in rural areas. RDP coverage would include every ward other than
                         those in Honiara. PCDF could continue to apply a combined formula taking into consideration
                         population, equity and performance. However, the use of minimum conditions to possibly
                         exclude a province should be reconsidered as this penalizes people living in those provinces
                         for the poor performance on the provincial administration. Lastly, a formula for the allocation of
                         constituency funds should be developed. The equal distribution of funds across constituencies
                         regardless of their size is a blunt instrument, which floods small constituencies with funds they
                         cannot effectively absorb and leaves larger constituencies with insufficient funds to reach a
                         critical mass of beneficiaries. A formula similar to that used by PCDF should be considered,

     namely, a base amount for each constituency (perhaps 40 per cent), and then an additional
     amount distributed on a per capita basis (perhaps 60 per cent). One simple performance
     criteria could be considered (constituting perhaps 5 per cent of the total), such as the
     submission of a list and description of all funds committed by 15 December of each year.

             To ensure all three funding streams continue to flow beyond donor financing, SIG
     should make a long-term commitment through its development plans and through allocated
     resources. These grants could be made into recurrent grants such as a Provincial
     Development Grant to complement the existing Provincial Service Grant that largely funds
     staff and operating expenses. Community or Ward Development Grants could allow Members
     of Provincial Assembly to minimize the use of their discretionary funds on development and
     focus instead on constituency engagement.

              9.3     INTEGRATE PLANNING AND BUDGET PROCESSES
             To reduce the administrative costs of managing the three funding streams, an effort
     should be made to integrate the planning and budgeting processes associated with the
     allocation of resources. The planning process should be fed from the bottom-up, starting with
     participatory planning at the village and ward levels then advancing up through the provincial
     and national levels. Constituency development plans can be derived from data and views
     generated through the village/ward and provincial planning, and also through a separate
     competitive process of generating proposals for income-generating projects and other needs
     emerging from constituents over the course of the year.

             The main shift required in this integration is to place a premium on village-level,
     participatory planning and to resource this through additional funds to provincial governments,
     perhaps as part of their provincial service delivery grants. This would draw heavily on the use
     of RDP Community Helpers, in cooperation with the provincial government planning division,
     and utilizing them to facilitate participatory planning, ward profiling, etc. By placing more of an
     emphasis on bottom-up planning, additional focus will need to be placed on the structure,
     functions and capacity of Ward Development Committees to identify ward-levels priorities,
     compile data and monitor community investments.
           Table 38 provides an illustration of what an integrated planning process might look like.
     A more detailed description of how this would work is provided in Annex 5.

              9.4     ALIGN AND BUILD CAPACITY AND INSTITUTIONAL
                      DEVELOPMENT ACROSS LEVELS
             The proposed integrated planning and budgeting process and aligned management of
     associated funding presents opportunities for reducing administrative costs and gaining
     efficiencies. However, it also requires a realignment of resources to support a more robust
     provincial capacity to support not only provincial-level investments, but community and
     constituency-level investments as well. Much of the administrative responsibility across all
     three streams would be centered in the provincial government. RDP provincial support would
     be better integrated into the provincial administration and much of the administrative
     responsibility for constituency funds would be anchored in the provincial government.
     Efficiencies can be gained by maximizing the use of travel to communities by including both
     Community Helpers and various sector officers.
            Provincial Planning Division:
            CHs would work closely with the Planning Division to facilitate and support the village and ward-
            level profiling and planning processes. Provincial government planning divisions would need to
            be supported so they can acquire the appropriate IT systems for the storage of data gathered
            from the village data collection and ward profiling. They will also require support to develop
            systems that are appropriate for storing the data and analyzing data so it is accessible for
            planning purposes.

            Ward Development Committees:
            In addition to the consolidation of administrative responsibility at the provincial level, the
            capacity of WDCs need to be built in order for them to play a more active role in the provincial
            planning process, approving and monitoring community-level activities, consolidating village-
            level data, etc. The composition of WDCs should be reviewed, in particular to aim for more
            gender balance, and to ensure that they are adequately representative of their constituent
            villages. The role of the MPA could also be enhanced to catalyze the ward planning process and
            ensure accountability for ward and community-level activity.


              9.5     STRENGTHEN STANDARDS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT
                      SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY
             While the overall quality of construction of the infrastructure evaluated under this study
     was of good quality, there are several improvements in the current approach that can be made
     to gain cost savings, enhance design quality, facilitate more efficient procurement, and provide
     additional technical support.
             As recommended in the section on Sustainability (Chapter 8), the establishment of a
     baseline system for costing and a catalogue of standard designs, both housed at the provincial
     and national levels, would greatly enhance value for money. This data could also be used to
     develop methodology and guidelines for cost benefit analysis of various types of infrastructure.

                                 Rather than deploying technical specialists from Honiara to rural areas to supervise
                         and advise on construction, capacity could be built in the provinces to provide such technical
                         inputs. Building capacity within the provinces would also enhance the capability to properly
                         maintain infrastructure assets. Consideration could be given to use of the “Barefoot
                         Engineers” training, which has been used in Indonesia to build capacity closer to the point of
                         construction.


                                          9.6          DEVELOP MECHANISMS FOR COMMUNITY/CITIZEN
                                                       ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND QUALITY
                                                       SERVICE DELIVERY
                                 There is a range of improvements at various levels that can be made to enhance
                         transparency and accountability across the three funding streams. Several of these are
                         described in Chapter 7 of this report. Most of the recommendations refer to enhancements to
                         the current practice. However, one area of accountability currently not included in the
                         management of any of these streams of funds is rural service provider accountability to the
                         community. Once infrastructure is completed, there is no organized mechanism for ensuring
                         that the service that is being provided is satisfactory to its intended beneficiaries. To address
                         this accountability gap, instruments such as community scorecards, simple social
                         accountability tools, could be developed and tested in one or two sectors, for specific types of
                         services (i.e. rural aid posts and kindergartens). The use of information and communication
                         technologies such as SMS/mobile and smart phones would also help open up the lines of
                         communications between isolated communities and program management.

                                 In light of the severe lack of accountability and transparency in the use of constituency
                         funds, there is a range of measures that could be proposed. Several are mentioned in
                         Chapter 7. Some measures will likely be included in the forthcoming CDF Regulations, but
                         there may still need to be a continued effort in this area to ensure public funds are used for
                         broad public benefit rather than for political supporters alone. There will also need to be
                         sufficient funding allocated to support these activities.

                                 Post-completion community measures put in place to improve accountability are
                         recommended. This will determine whether or not community members are utilizing
                         investments once completed and if envisaged services are being provided to a satisfactory
                         standard. This should go beyond ensuring that individual sub-projects are delivered according
                         to project plans, that goods are received as intended or that all monies expended have been
                         appropriately acquitted. These could include citizen report cards or community scorecards;
                         simple social accountability tools that are increasingly used around the world to solicit user
                         feedback on good and services provided.71 The lessons learnt from such a process would not

                           INFO FOR PUBLIC VIEWING, FEEDBACK AND REVIEWING
                           RESULTS
                   While a database of development assistance, including small grants such as those
          reviewed as a part of this study, is maintained by MDPAC, the information is incomplete. It
          has, as yet, not been possible to include constituency funds in this database nor has this data
          reached the point where it can be used as a monitoring, planning and policymaking tool. The
          integration of provincial, constituency and community-level funding streams should allow for
          sub-project data to be compiled into one data platform and used to generate customized
          reports. Such a system should be made public, with access online, so as to allow anyone who
          is interested to see what is being funded, for how much and where. Available technologies
          would also allow for the integration of online and SMS feedback mechanisms so that program
          management could be better informed and more responsive to beneficiary communities.

                    9.8    IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS WITH AN INTER-MINISTERIAL
                           COORDINATION GROUP
                  Since the recommendations contained in this report would entail a restructuring and
          integration of existing funding streams and their associated management structures, units
          responsible for their management would need to review this report, come to a consensus on
          agreed changes and map out an action plan. The main ministries are MPGIS, MDPAC, MRD,
          and MoFT since there are implications for funding flows and development budget. The
          technical specialists responsible for the implementation of RDP, PCDF and further refinements
          of the CDFs should also be involved in such an Inter-ministerial Subnational Financing
          Coordination Group (SFCG). The SFCG should first meet to discuss this report including
          basic coordination recommendations. The group should meet quarterly or half-yearly to
          discuss the alignment and harmonization issues.

     Summary of decentralized legal framework in Solomon Islands

     Political dimension
             Solomon Islands is currently a unitary state with two levels of government, National
     and Provincial. Provincial Government evolved out of the local government features of the
     colonial bureaucracy, which divided the country into four districts, each headed by an
     expatriate District Officer. Provincial Governments are envisaged in Solomon Islands
     Constitution and were established in Solomon Islands law through the 1981 Provincial
     Government Act (PGA), which was re-enacted in 1997 legislation. This Act created a
     Provincial Assembly for each Province, with elected politicians from each ward empowered to
     pass ordinances,74 which are not to be in conflict with National policy or legislation. The size of
     each Provincial Assembly varies according to the number of wards- typically between nine and
     30 members. The table below shows the number of electoral wards for each province.

              A new federal constitution is under development and the following structural/administrative
     arrangements are proposed: i) central federal government ii) federal state governments and iii)
     community governments. The government of Honiara City is also provided for under separate articles in
     the new draft constitution. The draft constitution also refers to each level having its own development
     plan and an intergovernmental fiscal commission responsible for revenue sharing amongst the three
     levels of government. It is essential that the levels below the central government develop and maintain a

                         core set of public expenditure management competencies                                  which are embedded in solid governance
                         practice.

                                  Under the PGA, an Executive heads each Provincial Assembly. The total numbers of the
                         Provincial Executive shall not be more than half of the Assembly. The Premier, who is elected by an
                         absolute majority of Provincial Assembly members, leads the Provincial Executive. Once elected, the
                         Minister of MPGIS (in consultation with the Premier) appoints a Deputy Premier and Ministers with
                         portfolio responsibilities, even where the sectoral responsibilities of the Province for services delivery
                         are minimal. The Provincial Secretary is a staff member from the MPGIS and is accountable to the
                         Premier and the Executive, in the same way as National Permanent Secretaries are accountable to their
                         Ministers.

                                 The Provincial Assembly is elected by direct elections of registered voters every four years from
                         respective wards using a first past the post method. Each Assembly elects a speaker who in turn
                         appoints a clerk. The relevant government election authority does not organize these elections; MPGIS
                         and the Minister have the powers to also dissolve the Assemblies.

                                 This system of Ministerial appointment to the Executive creates local government autonomy. In
                         addition the running of provincial assembly elections through the MPGIS and not the Office of the
                         Election Commission as well as the vested power in the Minister of MPGIS to dissolve provincial
                         assemblies make for fair elections and e autonomy of provincial governments.

                                 The 1997 PGA is silent on the structure for a provincial administration as well as the usual
                         oversight functions of the elected members to the administration. Schedule 6 of the PGA mentions the
                         appointment of staff to be charged with the responsibilities of accounting tasks and these are to be
                         described in the financial management ordinance. Revenue collections functions are mandated to
                         provincial government but no mention of staff that will fulfill these functions.
                                 The PGA also envisaged a third tier of government, allowing Provincial Assemblies to create
                         Area Councils for local administration. Area Councils were abolished in 1996/7 leaving a gap between
                         the Provincial administration and the village level. This gap has been further eroded by the closure of
                         many Provincial sub-stations due to financial cuts exacerbated by the tension, although remnants of
                         these still exist in Malaita today. Most Provincial Governments are cut off from their constituents and are
                         only rarely able to travel to villages. This link between the village and the Provincial Government is now
                         notionally filled by Provincial Assembly Members.

                                   The PGA does not address matters to do with local participation and accountability and there
                         was little evidence of citizen oversight and any degree of depth of participation yet in place. There is
                         currently no legislation on political parties although there was a White Paper prepared in 2009 on the
                         topic.

                         78 Local level public expenditure management competencies include the ability to undertake participatory development planning,
                         raise revenue and budgets, procurement and implementation plans, manage assets, monitoring and evaluate plans and provide
                         reports and to fulfill these tasks in an accountable, transparent and participatory manner.

Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities




              It is essential that local governments (LGs) be empowered with adequate financial and human
     resources to fulfill their mandates and functions. Currently in Solomon Islands the provincial
     governments have the following sources of income: own sources revenues as permitted in the PGA,
     and provincial service grants (called the provincial fund in the PGA). Both of these revenue sources are
     reportedly utilized for provincial recurrent costs with negligible portions or none at all being assigned for
     capital investments. With the commencement of PGSP in 2008/9 some provinces have been eligible for
     a discretionary block grant called the PCDF.

              The PGA states that the Provincial Executive presents the budget estimates for revenues and
     expenditures before the beginning of each financial year and that a financial management ordinance
     must be prepared and approved by the Assembly. The PGA is quite prescriptive on the contents of the
     financial management ordinance. The PGA also states that the Provincial Government is to establish an
     Accounts Committee whose task is to examine and report on the accounts to the Assembly. There is no
     evidence that these Committees have been established although Cabinet approved a document
     supporting an expanded role for the Accounts Committee in May 2012. The PGA also states that the
     Provincial Assemblies are to publish their accounts, audit and Accounts Committee reports and again
     there was no evidence seen of any public reporting on the budgets and accounts in provinces visited.

              The main issue with the fiscal decentralization dimension is that there is not an arrangement for
     effective intergovernmental transfer of funds in place and the funds that are transferred are inadequate
     to cover mandated functions let alone any sector devolved functions that could occur. In addition there
     is no requirement for a provincial plan to be in place so it is difficult to plan realistic budget expenditures
     and track outcomes without a corresponding plan. The PGSP program has been working on putting in
     place a provincial plan over the past four years but this requirement is still not regularized. This planning
     process is lacking in any interface with villages and their development priorities as well as any horizontal
     links to sector planning and budgets.

                                                                             79
              Many countries will have a type of Fiscal Commission in place which is a government body
     that conducts fiscal research and advises the government on financial assistance to the sub national
                                                                                   80
     levels of government with the aim of achieving horizontal fiscal equalization. Equalization payments
     are cash payments made in some systems of government from the central government to subnational
     governments with the objective of offsetting differences in available revenue or in the cost of providing
     services. This is not the case in Solomon Islands although the new draft Federal Constitution does have
     a similar body mentioned called the National Finance Commission but it is described as having more
     monitoring and advisory functions.

     Administrative decentralization dimension
             The key issues of devolution and decentralization debated in Solomon Islands 1970s and 80s
     remain current today. There have been many reviews and several changes to the system over time,
     making it difficult to distinguish legal functions and responsibilities from bureaucratic habit or from
     popular assumptions and expectations. This is made more difficult by the fact that there is very little

                         documentation of these changes. Provinces do not hold key documents such as Devolution Orders, nor
                         by the MPGIS, which means that, whatever may theoretically be in place in the formal legal system, in
                         practice, these documents are not being used to determine roles and responsibilities of Provincial
                         Governments. More often, funding and competent staff are the key determinants of functions. The role
                         of coordinating National Government activities at local level is nowhere articulated in writing, yet this
                         role seems to be implicit in the understanding of most Provincial Government politicians and employees
                         when asked about their activities and functions.

                                  The PGA allows the National Government to devolve responsibility for particular functions to
                         Provincial Governments. Major government service functions such as health and education were not
                         necessarily envisaged as fully devolved functions under the Act. While there is no explicit enunciation of
                         the role of Provincial Government in the Act, the functions of Schedules 3, 4 and 5 imply a minimal role
                         for Provincial Governments in rural and economic development, the collection of taxes and then
                         permissible service delivery functions but requiring devolution orders to operate.

                                  Functions are divided into two categories as detailed in Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the PGA. The
                         PGA mandates the functions listed in Schedule 3 matters of their own functions and are delegated to
                         each provincial government. They include minor local administrative matters such as licensing of local
                         businesses, including bars and hotels, markets, fire protection and waste disposal. Provincial
                         governments were also responsible for the (now abolished) Area Councils. Schedule 3 also includes
                         functions in local shipping, including maintenance of harbors, roads and bridges. Some responsibilities
                         for agriculture and fisheries are also included as is physical planning and codification of customary law
                         regarding land use and fishing rights. Provincial Governments are responsible for control and use of
                         river water, water pollution and provision of water supplies in rural areas.

                                 Schedule 4 provides a further list of functions, which may be devolved by mutual agreement
                         between the respective Minister and the Provincial Assembly concerned. These expand on the basic
                         functions in Schedule 3 but confer only minor powers in respect of roads, harbors, cocoa and copra
                         licensing. The most significant powers conferred under Schedule 4 relate to forestry, where Provincial
                         Governments are empowered to make regulations for improved administration of timber agreements
                         approved by National Government in respect of customary land. They may also grant timber-milling
                         licenses and declare forest reserves in order to preserve water catchments. The status of Schedule 4 in
                         respect of each Province is unclear, although it appears that most Provinces have had Functions of
                         Schedule 4 devolved.

                                   In Schedule 5, the PGA distinguishes Provincial services from functions. Provincial
                         Governments may not have direct responsibility for sectoral services and budgets even though the
                         actual service delivery takes place within a Province. The PGA allows Provincial Executives to provide
                         or facilitate such services, apparently with some independence of the National Ministry responsible. This
                         seems to envisage a much more comprehensive scale of devolution and makes it very difficult to
                         achieve clarity of National and Provincial Government roles in respect of service delivery. The PGA
                         envisages “Agency Agreements” between a Premier and any public body, which would allow functions
                         to be discharged by one or the other party. It is not clear whether any Agency Agreements have been
                         signed in this way or what Agreements may remain in force in each Province.
                                   Provinces have ill-defined responsibilities from sector to sector. For example, in education,
                         Provinces are responsible for returning teachers to their homes at the end of the school year. This is
                         despite the fact that terms and conditions of service for teachers are a clear National Government
                         responsibility. Education is particularly complex as a sector because Provinces may also act in their

     capacity as Education Authorities (as do churches and some private operators), which is independent of
     the Provincial Government Act. As an Education Authority, a Province is responsible for Provincial
     secondary schools and for disciplining teachers. Again, this role is not explicitly delineated in writing, or
     if it is, documents are not readily available.

              The complexity of roles is also illustrated in rural water supply. This is a clear provincial function
     under Schedule 3, yet execution of this function requires skilled staff from the Environmental Health
     Division. While the Province directly employs some of these staff, the direct staff are usually lower
     skilled employees who report to professional seconded staff from the Ministry of Health. Although
     seconded staff are technically under the Provincial Government, in practice, the Province relies on
     National Government staff to execute even basic functions. Then in reality donor small grants programs
     such as RDP provide most household water supply schemes.

              Services under schedules 4 and 5 are most often those services, which are mandatory in LG
     legislation in other countries, such as education, roads, tourism, agriculture and sports and culture.
     There is notable absence of births, death and marriage registration function which is again a common
     mandated function of LGs in other countries. Note however these functions are included in the new draft
     Federal Constitution.

     ANNEX 5: DETAILED INTEGRATED PLANNING PROCESS

             The following is a more detailed elaboration of the proposed integrated planning process
     described in Chapter 5 of this report.

     Provincial
               Planning Product: Plans produced include Strategic Plan (every 6 years), Medium Term
     Development plan (every 3 years), Annual Plans and Budgets (every year). Budgets must be inclusive
     of recurrent budgets for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure. These plans would include
     village and ward profile data and ranked development priorities. Village and Ward Development
     priorities identified would include built infrastructure, such as schools, clinics, wharfs, roads, etc. and
     non-built development priorities which could include employment, policy and planning, training and
     education, law and order, culture and environment. Village and ward data would help build a provincial
     situation analysis and guide the development of provincial objectives and actions, which would be
     reflected across all plans and budgets.
               People: The planning division will guide the integrated planning process and be responsible for
     the development and production of all the planning documents. It would be supported by the TPBU
     (assisted by CDOs) for technical planning and budget input. A provincial forum (amalgamated
     PPDC/PARC) would be a key provincial forum to validate projects and budget. Minor changes to this
     forum composition to allow for increased participation of women would be required. If significant
     financial and staff resource restrictions exist in a province then there would be no requirement PPDC
     process as adequate community input should occur village, ward levels and through the public
     submission phase.
               Frequency: Strategic Plans would be developed at six-year intervals (currently five years) so
     they align with the production of Medium Term Development Plans, medium term plans would be
     developed at three yearly intervals, Annual Plans and Budgets would be produced annually.
     Synchronizing the development of Strategic Plans with Medium Term Plans will allow provinces to be
     able to produce both at the same time using available village and ward data and project information.
               Approval Process: Strategic, Medium Term Development and Annual plan and budget drafts
     developed by planning divisions would be presented at provincial forum (amalgamated PPDC/PARC)
     and then endorsed by the provincial executive before released for public consultation. Once
     consultation has been completed a report of submissions would be presented to the provincial executive
     for consideration and approval of changes to draft plans. All final plans would go to the full provincial
     assembly for adoption and subsequent public release. Once this has been agreed the Provincial
     Assembly will endorse and adopt the stated development priorities. As a starting point CDOs would
     state at the TPBU stage that they support allocating their constituency funds
               Funding Stream: Ward/Village (RDP), Provincial (PCDF) and possibly Constituency (CDF)
     funding streams will come together at the provincial level. The provincial forum would be a ‘town hall’
     type meeting to gain community input on development priorities and support allocation of three funding
     streams across all projects. A provincial funding stream (currently PCDF) would be the main mechanism
     for projects that address provincial investment areas, beyond the life of the PCDF program the SIG
     would provide recurrent funding for the provincial funding stream.

     Constituency
            Planning Product: Constituencies will develop Constituency Development Plans as stated in
     the CDF Bill (2013). Plans should be developed from ward profile data and project priorities developed




24                                                                                                            Annexes
                         through the integrated planning process. A format for constituency plans is yet to be determined but the
                         integrated planning process would benefit from constituency plans having clear links with provincial
                         Strategic, Medium Term Development and Annual plans and budgets. This would be achieved through
                         adopting constituency projects identified through the integrated planning process and that fit the
                         investment criteria (Table 28).
                                  People: Beyond the MP and CDO for constituency it is unclear who else would support plan
                         development of Constituency Development Plans. A recommendation is that provincial planning
                         divisions and TPBU would be part of a technical advisory body (similar to TPBU) to assist preparation of
                         Constituency Development Plans. Constituencies would be integrated into the integrated planning
                         process by CDOs becoming advisory members of TPBU, this would mean CDOs are aware of the
                         development priorities determined by villages and wards and would contribute their knowledge to the
                         integrated planning process and also give some indication of which of the projects identified by wards
                         and communities would contribute funding.
                                  Frequency: The frequency of Constituency Plan developments is yet to be determined. To be
                         of most benefit to an integrated process it would need to be linked to either medium term development
                         plans (every three years) or Strategic Plans (every five years).
                                  Approval Process: The approval process for development priorities contained in the
                         Constituency Development Plan is unclear; it should have a strong link with the integrated planning
                         process. CDOs would indicate which projects nominated by communities and villages in their respective
                         constituency they support and these projects would go through the same approval process as projects
                         from the other funding streams. Once they have been through the normal approval phase and
                         supported they will be reflected in provincial planning documents.
                                  Funding Stream: In the short term, CDOs would use the existing CDF stream as currently
                         occurs. Over time, the CDF recurrent budget would shrink as part of the budget is reallocated to
                         provincial governments to provide increased financial resources to support integrated provincial
                         planning process.

                         Ward
                                  Planning Product: WDCs would develop ward profiles that include both consolidated village
                         data and WDC ranked village development priorities. Ward consolidated development priorities being
                         the issues villages deemed the highest priority and ranked accordingly by WDCs Ward profile
                         information would be consolidated village data from the village data collection and development priority
                         identification and ranking process.
                                  People: The composition of the WDC would be consistent with RDP WDC structure and would
                         consist of representation of women, youth (male and female), traditional authority, church representative
                         and the member of provincial assembly. WDCs would compile ward profiles with support from CHs and
                         provincial planning divisions.
                                  Frequency: WDCs would develop a ward profile that includes projects to be implemented every
                         three years. This process would occur at the same time as the development of the provincial Medium
                         Term Development Plan with ward profile data and project information forming the core part of Medium
                         Term Development Plans. Validation of profile data and project information would occur annually.
                                  Approval process: Projects that have been nominated and approved through the village
                         profiling process would be forwarded to the relevant WDCs. Each WDC member would rank built and
                         non-built development priorities individually against set criteria; this would provide 2 lists of ranked
                         development priorities, both infrastructure related and those that with a non-built solution, which would
                         be approved by the WDC. Issues could be resolved by using consensus. Once ward profiles and the
                         two streams of development priorities are approved they would be forwarded to the provincial
                         government planning division.



   Produced in May 2014, Solomon Islands: Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities explores
ams investing in rural infrastructure and service delivery in the Solomon Islands. It identifies ways to
hen the current mechanisms for investing in rural service delivery by examining the three main types of
 for small-scale infrastructure and livelihood activities across four key programs between 2008 and 2012.




                                                                                                                                     25
Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities




               Funding stream: Ward priority projects would be prioritized by WDC from a consolidated list of
     prioritized village projects. WDCs would also do preliminary allocation of projects across the three
     funding streams for their specific ward. A provincial funding stream (currently PCDF) would be the main
     mechanism for projects that address provincial investment areas. Beyond the life of the PCDF, the SIG
     would provide recurrent funding for the provincial funding stream.

     Village
               Planning Product: Village profiles would be developed containing both primary and secondary
     community data on population, natural resources, social services, economic infrastructure, private
     business, natural hazards. They would also contain both built infrastructure and non-built development
     priorities identified and prioritized by villages. These projects will address the community development
     priorities.
               People: At the village level the full community will have access to the village profile and
     development priority identification and ranking process. CHs will assist communities that take part in the
     process to ensure they have the capacity to develop a community/village profile but also to support
     women and youth input into the process.
               Frequency: Full village profiling and development priority identification and ranking would take
     place every three years and would coincide with Medium Term Plan development. Annually there would
     be a revalidation of the village profile and development priorities, which would ensure village data
     information and project information is still valid.
               Approval process: The approval process requires communities to rank projects and agree on
     them in an open village forum. Separate groups may be formed to work through projects priorities as a
     group. Youth, women, men would identify and rank project priorities with these becoming the priority
     projects for the community. There would need to be consensus by the community on which
     development priorities are forwarded to WDCs if the ranking process was not clear in determining
     priorities. CHs would help guide the process to ensure participants are able to contribute to the process
     and not be excluded.
               Funding stream: The Funding stream for village profiling is the same stream utilized by WDCs
     under the RDP program. For the purposes of the integrated planning process the one stream would
     support both villages and wards. The SIG will need to provide recurrent funding to support this funding
     stream past the life of the RDP program so villages can continue to have input into provincial planning.

     Ensuring Gender Equality in Planning
          A way to ensure there is an increased and sustained role for women in the planning process is to
     ensure they have equitable representation on the main decision making bodies. Recommendations for
     this include:
              Change the PPDC structure so it has representation comprising 50% women as occurs in RDP
              PARC meetings.
              Change the WDC structure so that it comprises 50% representation by women (3 out of 6
              members from the existing 2 of 6 members).
              Train CHs so they have the ability to support the participation of women during the community
