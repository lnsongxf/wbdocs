    Promoting Access to Finance
    for Households and Businesses
    The need for financial services in South Asia is the greatest among those living in low-income,
    fragile, and frontier parts of the region. Improving access to finance for individuals and businesses
    in these geographies can provide broader development gains on a number of levels:

    •	 At the household level, it can help families build assets, manage risks, and increase consumption.

    •	 At the level of individual businesses, better access to finance can result in higher rates of job
       growth and higher tax payments.

    •	 On the macroeconomic level, there is evidence that better integrated financial systems increase
       growth and reduce inequality.

    IFC plays a critical role in increasing access to finance for households and businesses, not only
    through its investments and financing, but also through its advisory work, by providing diagnostics,
    capacity building, and sharing of best practices to its financial intermediary clients. A key aspect of
    our work is in close collaboration with the World Bank to deliver development results.

To expand access to finance and services among the under-served, IFC has identified many key areas of
intervention. The publication captures stories of change and inclusion from our beneficiaries and clients in
South Asia.

 Responsible Finance
 IFC and World Bank have played a key role in strengthening the microfinance sector through timely and crucial
 investments, as well as through comprehensive advisory interventions. At a time when most investors were
 moving away from the microfinance space, IFC continued with its support and launched the Responsible
 Finance program to introduce better client protection practices such as national code of conduct and setting
 up credit bureaus catering to microfinance and help the institutions become responsible lenders. To make a
 wider offering and increase the client base, IFC advised the microfinance institutions to develop new services
 such as insurance, pensions, microhousing and micro-agrifinance etc. The program received the Skoch
 Financial Inclusion Award 2012 for its work in advocacy.

    making financial assistance more accessible to those
    who need it most in post-conflict Sri Lanka, LOMC
    introduced a mechanism of group lending through
    IFC’s assistance — a concept that offered loans

     Creating Opportunity for Promising Entrepreneurs
     India’s 14 low-income states are home to more
     than 300 million poor, many of whom have
     promising entrepreneurial skills and just need
     someone to give them a chance. Au Financiers
     makes a business of finding them.

     Banks turned down Rajasthan farmer Suvalal
     Palsania when he sought loans to buy his first
     tractor, worried that he did not have sole title to the
     small plot of land he shared with his brothers.

     But that was no issue for Au, a fast and flexible
     non-bank financial corporation with a proven
     credit risk methodology. Seeing that Suvalal’s
     cash flows and reputation were strong, it lent him
     Indian rupees 346,000 ($5,750) for the tractor
     and an attached cart that he now uses not just to         banks and a nomination at the prestigious 2011

     needed to keep growing and creating jobs.

     Magma is a West Bengal-based large non-bank

     and farmers in 21 Indian states with plans for a
     major expansion of its successful operations in the
     low-income states. Its motto is “Investing in the
     Smallest Dream.”

     India’s small and medium enterprises need
     financing to reach their potential as sources of
     jobs and economic growth. But while their lack of
     credit history and security are obstacles to many
     banks, they are opportunity to those like Magma

            Financial Infrastructure


     To expand formal finance to underserved segments, there is a need to have in place a
     comprehensive financial infrastructure and legislative framework conducive to sharing
     of credit information by financial institutions. There is also a need to encourage greater
     symmetry in the data and information available for microfinance institutions, banks and
     financial institutions to make credit decisions. Efficient behind-the-scenes systems play
     a key role in helping local financial institutions serve the base of the pyramid market.
     Building on strong global experience, IFC investment and advisory services help build
     this infrastructure across South Asia, helping clients process payments, check potential
     borrowers' credit history, and evaluate the suitability of proposed loan collateral.

     Two core areas of our work in building financial infrastructure are:
     i. 	      Development of Credit Bureaus and
     ii. 	     Secured Transactions Collateral Registries                                                           India




      Credit Information Bureau, India
      IFC is working with two credit information bureaus to broaden their microfinance member
      base and introduce value added products in the microfinance sector. IFC has also
      partnered with Microfinance Institutes Network (MFIN) to design and develop a credit
      bureau awareness toolkit for microfinance borrowers. Through its member base, MFIN
      would help in disseminating the toolkit across the country.

      Collateral Registry, India
      IFC is advising India’s government-owned Central Registry of Securitisation Asset
      Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) to help it design a business plan
      and revenue model while expanding the database to cover all types of movable assets—                      Sri Lanka
      including stocks, inventory, and accounts receivable. This will facilitate access to finance

                                               Credit Information Bureau, Bangladesh
                                               IFC is conducting a study to assess the feasibility of establishing a credit bureau for
                                               microfinance institutions in Bangladesh. In collaboration with a working group consisting
                                               of three of the largest microfinance institutions, regulators and microfinance networking
                                               association, IFC’s scoping study will develop a business model and business plan. These
                                               will form part of the recommendations that will be sent to the Microcredit Regulatory
                                               Authority for adoption and implementation.

                                               Secured Transactions Registry, Bangladesh
                                               IFC is working with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies (RJSC) in Bangladesh to
                                               build additional functionality into the Secured Transactions Registry so that it is better
                                               able to document charges on the movable assets of small and medium enterprises. It
                                               will also provide credible information to banks on the borrower’s credibility. Small and
                                               Mozambicans owners do not have much else to offer as collateral for loans, the ability to
                                               use movable assets of their business will open up new avenues to access much required
                                               financial services.
