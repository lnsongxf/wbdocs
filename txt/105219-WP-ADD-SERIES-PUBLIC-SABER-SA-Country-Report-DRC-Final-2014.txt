    Key Policy Areas for Student Assessment                                                                        Status
    1. Classroom Assessment
       In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), classroom assessment practices by teachers are
       perceived as being of ‘moderate’ quality. Resources available to support teachers’ classroom
       assessment activities include textbooks and rubrics for grading students’ work. Several formal
       mechanisms, such as pre- and in-service teacher training, also are in place to ensure that all
       teachers develop competencies in classroom assessment. At the same time, there is no national
       document that provides overall guidelines for classroom assessment practice, and there are limited
       mechanisms in place to monitor the quality of these practices across the education system.

    2. Examinations
       The Examen d'Etat has been administered in its current form to all students in grade 12 for over 20
       years. A formal policy authorizes the examination and provides its framework. Results are used to
       certify secondary school completion and make decisions about student selection to tertiary
       education or for technical jobs. Regular funding is provided by the government and through
       student fees. Technical commissions and teams involved in different aspects of the examination
       process implement the formal mechanisms that ensure its quality, such as training all
       administrators according to a standard protocol. At the same time, there are few opportunities
       available to key stakeholders (e.g., examination staff, educators, other assessment specialists) to
       learn more about the examination. Another issue is that students’ results are not confidential.

    3. National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)
       Since 2010, the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) has been implemented every two years for
       the purposes of monitoring education quality at the country level and supporting schools and
       teachers. EGRA is administered to a regionally representative random sample of students in grades
       2, 4, and 6. A formal policy document authorizes the assessment. Results have influenced the
       reading curriculum at the primary level and supported the introduction of an in-service teacher
       training module focused on reading. However, to date, funding for EGRA has solely been provided
       by external donors. In addition, there are limited opportunities available to key stakeholders in the
       country to learn more about EGRA, including its results.

    4. International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)
       The DRC completed its participation in PASEC in 2010, led by a team in the Ministry of Education’s
       Directorate for Planning. There is no country-level policy document addressing the country’s
       participation in PASEC or other ILSAs, and funds for the country’s involvement in PASEC have
       primarily been provided by external donors. The country also offers minimal opportunities to learn
       about ILSAs. PASEC results and information have been disseminated using a limited number of
       communication strategies, specifically, through providing copies of the country-level and
       international reports to key stakeholders in the country.

The key considerations when evaluating a student
assessment system are the individual and combined
quality of assessment activities in terms of the adequacy
of the information generated to support decision
making. There are three main drivers of information
quality in an assessment system: enabling context,
system alignment, and assessment quality.


Enabling context refers to the broader context in which
the assessment activity takes place and the extent to
which that context is conducive to, or supportive of, the

   point could be to have the unit responsible for
   primary-      and    secondary-level     curriculum
   development in the Ministry of Primary, Secondary,
   and Technical Education develop item banks with
   examples of multiple-choice and open-ended
   questions aligned with the national curriculum and
   make them widely available to teachers. Also, the
   DRC could consider developing something similar to
   Mozambique’s Provinha, which is a grade 3 reading
   assessment administered and scored by teachers.
   The Provinha serves as a resource for teachers, as
   results are intended to be used formatively at the
   school level to improve teaching practices and
   student learning outcomes in reading.


3. Issue: There are minimal formal, country-level
   mechanisms to monitor the quality of classroom
   assessment practices.

   Suggested policy option: Increase or strengthen the
   formal mechanisms in place to monitor the quality of
   classroom assessment practices. For example, the
   unit responsible for research and evaluation in the
   Ministry of Primary, Secondary, and Technical
   Education could start by commissioning a national
   review on the quality of education in the country,
   which includes a component on classroom
   assessment practices.

2. Issue: There are minimal mechanisms in place to

   negative consequences for the education system and
   society; for instance, whether the examination
   contributes to enhanced quality in primary or
   secondary education, or puts undue pressure on
   schools, teachers, and students.

    Suggested policy option: Begin to put in place some
    mechanisms to monitor the impact of the
    examination. For example, allocate funding from the
    General Inspectorate of Education for expert review
    groups to regularly review the impact of the
    examination on schools, teachers, and students and

the rubrics:


    x   Latent = 1 score point
    x   Emerging = 2 score points
    x   Established = 3 score points
    x   Advanced = 4 score points

3. The score for each quality driver is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
dimensions. For example:


The quality driver, ‘Enabling Context,’ in the case of ILSA,
has 3 dimensions on which a hypothetical country
receives the following scores: Dimension A = 2 points;
Dimension B = 2 points; Dimension C = 3 points. The
hypothetical country’s overall score for this quality driver
would be: (2+2+3)/3 = 2.33


4. A preliminary level of development is assigned to each
quality driver.


5. The preliminary development level is validated using
expert judgment in cooperation with the country team
and The World Bank Task Team Leader.


For scores that allow a margin of discretion (i.e., to
choose between two levels of development), a final
decision has to be made based on expert judgment. For
example, the aforementioned hypothetical country has
an ‘Enabling Context’ score of 2.33, corresponding to a
preliminary level of development of ‘Emerging or
Established.’ Based on qualitative information not
captured in the rubric, along with expert judgment, the
country team chooses ‘Emerging’ as the most
appropriate level.

Classroom Assessment: Development-level rating justifications

1. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is no national document that provides guidelines for classroom assessment.

2. Resources available to teachers for their classroom assessment activities include the National Curriculum document, which outlines what students are
expected to learn at different age and grade levels, textbooks and workbooks, scoring criteria and rubrics for grading students work, as well as school report
cards which provide teachers with information on the maximum marks that can be awarded to students in different subjects.

3. The National Curriculum document outlines what students are expected to learn at different age and grade levels, but does not specify the desired level of
performance.

4. Country-level mechanisms to ensure that teachers develop competencies in classroom assessment include pre- and in-service teacher training that address
competencies in classroom assessment, opportunities for teachers to participate in conferences and workshops on classroom assessment, and school inspection
and teacher supervision includes a component focused on classroom assessment.

5. Classroom assessment practices are known to be of moderate quality. Although it is rare that they rely mainly on multiple-choice type questions, they are very
commonly about recalling information. It is rare that teachers do not use explicit criteria for grading students' work and to observe errors in the grading of
students' work. While it is rare that classroom assessment activities in practice are not aligned with a curricular framework, it is common that classroom
assessment activities are used as administrative tools rather than as pedagogical resources.

6. Two formal country-level mechanisms monitor the quality of classroom assessment practices. Specifically, classroom assessment is a required component of a
teacher's performance evaluation and classroom assessment is a required component of school inspection and teacher supervision.

7. Classroom assessment information is required to be used for diagnosing student learning issues, providing feedback to students on their learning, informing
parents about their child's learning, planning the next steps in instruction, grading students for internal classroom uses, and providing input for certification and
selection (specifically, classroom assessment marks are combined with the grades achieved on the examination that is organized by the government at the end
of a cycle for certification (Test National de Fin d'Etude Primaire (TENAFEP) for primary school and Examen d'Etat for secondary school).

8. Schools are required to report on individual student performance to students and parents at different pre-designated times during the school year. A
summarized record of each student's marks are produced and reported to the local education authority with copy kept in the school.

9. A variety of information about student performance is required to be reported in school report cards, including student's individual performance in all
subjects and student's performance relative to other students. Student general appreciation of learning ability (a qualitative assessment of student performance
in everyday class exercises, marked by qualitative statements Excellent, Very good, Good, Mediocre) is also required to be reported.

Examinations: Development-level rating justifications

1. The Examen d'Etat (National Exam) has been administered to all students in grade 12 for over twenty years in its current form. The examination is used for
certification of secondary school completion (in technical or academic fields), and selection to tertiary education or technical jobs.

2. Ordonnance loi numéro 67/250 du 5 juin 1967 is a law that created the Examen d'Etat and provides its framework. Loi Cadre de l'Education was promulgated
February 2014. Other relevant policy documents include the ministeriel numero MINEPSP/CABMIN/0040/2004 du 20 avril 2004 and the Loi cadre numero
14/004 du 11 fevrier 2014 de l'enseignement national. The policy documents are available upon request at the Journal Officiel de la Republique and at the
Ministry of Education in the "Recueil des directives officielles".

3. The examination is fully standardized (assessment design, administration, scoring and reporting are the same for all students taking the examination). A
variety of procedures are in place to ensure the exam's standardization, including that the examination papers and tasks are the same or are equivalent for all
students, examination administrators are trained to ensure that all students take the examination under the same conditions, quality control monitors are used
to ensure the same administration conditions in all locations where the examinations are taken, the same scoring criteria are used to correct the examination
papers and tasks, and examination results are reported using the same procedures for all students.

4. The Ministry of Education provides leadership for the examination. The Ministry of Education is a nationally recognized authority in the country. It has pushed
for further development of the examination. It has the influence and power to determine the examination agenda in the country, and has obtained funding for
examination activities. The Ministry of Education had managed and continues to manage important assessment projects and programs in the country, and key
members have participated in international steering or technical committees on assessment. The Ministry of Education has also been able to convene
stakeholders in the country to address examination issues.

5. Funding for the examination is provided by the government based on a law (Arrêté Ministériel numéro MINEPSP/CABMIN/0040/2004 du 20 avril 2004).

6. Funding for the examination is also provided by student fees, which comprises the majority of the funding for the examination.

7. Funding covers all core examination activities, specifically examination design (12% of funding), administration (34% of funding), data analysis (9% of funding),
and data reporting (3% of funding). Funding also covers planning (2% of funding) and expenses related to staff (such as per diem, training of scorers, and others,
excluding staff salaries) (40% of funding).

8. Inspection Général de l'Education (General inspectorate of education) is the unit in the Ministry of Education that has been in charge of the examination since
1967.

9. The Inspection General de l'Education is accountable to the National Committee for the exam (Comité National de l'Examen d'Etat), which is also part of the
Ministry of Education.

10. The examination unit has up-to-date computers and communication tools for all technical staff. It does not have up-to-date computer servers or top level
storage facilities and security for the building.

11. There is an adequate number of core staff who are responsible for the examination. The core staff are supported by the personnel of the ministry, mainly
teachers, who are selected to be invigilators or to support the staff in the examination centers. Quality problems have been limited to only the poor training of
examination administrators.

12. Only courses, workshops, and presentations on student assessment are available to members of the pedagogical committee, inspectors, and some teachers
and assessment specialists following the administration of the examination.

13. Teachers are provided with the opportunities to learn about the content and skills measured by the examination (e.g., courses on curriculum and pedagogy)
and opportunities to learn about other aspects of the examination (e.g., how tests are developed and scored, how results are reported and used). However, only
one examination-related task - acting as a judge during an oral exam - is mainly carried out by teachers. Teachers are sometimes asked to support other
examination-related tasks as well.

14. The examination is strongly aligned with the content areas of the national curriculum. The examination is also aligned with the skills areas of the national
curriculum and with the pedagogical approaches and activities that are compatible with the national curriculum. Regular internal and ad hoc reviews of the
alignment between the examination and what it is intended to measure take place.

15. Material to prepare for the examination includes examples of the types of questions that are on the examination, information on how to prepare for the
examination and a report on past student performance on the examination which is made available to most students by their teachers. While schools are to
provide the material to students, the comprehensiveness and quality of the material is dependent upon the quality of the resources that the teacher is able to
locate.

16. The examination is fully consistent with the classroom assessment, national and international assessment large-scale assessments.

17. The technical commissions and teams who are involved in different aspects of the examination process implement the formal mechanisms that are in place
to ensure the quality of the examination. Specifically, all proctors or administrators are trained according to a protocol, there is a standardized manual for
examination administrators, a pilot is conducted before the main data collection takes place, all booklets are numbered, there is double scoring of data, scorers
are trained to ensure high inter-rater reliability, double processing of data takes place, and external and internal reviewers or observers are invited to observe
key examination procedures.

18. The National board of the Exam "Comité National de l'Examen d' Etat" produces a comprehensive technical report (cf. Arreté ministériel numéro
MINEPSP/CABMIN/0040/2004 du 20 avril 2004, article 53) that is available only to certain stakeholders (such as the Minister of Education).

19. All students can take the examination.

20. Inappropriate behavior surrounding the examination is minimal and involves only collusion among candidates via mobile phones, passing of papers or
equivalent. However, student results are public and not confidential.

21. Examination results are perceived as credible by most stakeholder groups, and are recognized by selection and certification systems in the country and
abroad.

22. Students who do not perform well on the examination may retake the examination, take preparatory courses to retake the examination, and may repeat the
grade.

23. Only a permanent oversight committee is in place to monitor the examination.

National (of System-Level) Large Scale Assessment (NLSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. The Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) has been implemented every two years since 2010 for the purposes of monitoring education quality at the
country level, and supporting schools and teachers. It has also served as the baseline assessment for the Project for the Improvement of Quality Education (PIEQ)
which is a USAID funded education intervention. EGRA has been administered to a regionally representative random sample of students in grades 2, 4, and 6.

2. The Ministry of Education authorized the assessment with the formal policy document, MINEPSP/SG/80/384/2010 DU 25 MARS 2010, in 2010. This policy
document is available to the public upon request.

3. Although there was a detailed schedule specifying the year of future assessments, grade level(s) of students to be assessed, and subject areas, it was only
made available upon request. This schedule is derived from the deliverables related to implementing EGRA which have been committed by the Education
Development Center to USAID.

4. The Democratic Republic of Congo had leadership for the NLSA from the Education Development Center, who lead a consortium composed of itself, Catholic
Relief Services, and the Research Triangle Institute. The Education Development Center had influence and power in determining the NLSA agenda, was able to
obtain funding for NLSA activities, and was able to convene stakeholder groups in the country to address NLSA issues. However, a large portion of the oversight
and support for NLSA activities came from international staff and experts from outside of the country.

5. Funding for EGRA was allocated at the discretion of donors.

6. Funding for EGRA came only from external loans or donors

7. There was funding to cover most core NLSA activities. Funding for EGRA covered assessment design and administration, data analysis and reporting, planning,
and staff per diems and transport.

8. The team working on EGRA was composed of international experts from the Research Triangle Institute, staff from the Ministry of Education, and local project
staff.

9. The team responsible for carrying out EGRA was responsible to the donor, USAID. (This evaluation is of the team of international experts and not only of
country capacity.)

10. The team responsible for carrying out EGRA had up-to-date computers for all technical staff, top-level building security and storage facilities, and up-to-date
computer servers and communication tools. (This evaluation is of the team of international experts and not only of country capacity.)

11. The team responsible for carrying out the NLSA exercise had an adequate number of staff. The technical staff from the Research Triangle Institute trained
local staff in target provinces to implement the assessment. There were no quality problems identified with the performance of the team responsible for the
carrying out the EGRA. (This evaluation is of the team of international experts and not only of country capacity.)

12. The Democratic Republic of Congo offered very few annual opportunities to learn about NLSA. There were non-university training courses or workshops on
student assessment available annually to the NLSA team, educators, and assessment specialists. Presentations on the NLSA were given to inspectors from the
Ministry of Education responsible for primary, secondary, and professional instruction, as well as teachers and test administrators.

13. Only some teachers had opportunities to learn about NLSA results and student performance on the NLSA. These opportunities did not address the content
and skills measured by the NLSA.

14. EGRA was aligned with the content and skills areas of the national curriculum, as well as with the pedagogical approaches and activities that are compatible
with the national curriculum. Some mechanism were in place review the alignment of the NLSA and what it was intended to measure, including an ad-hoc review
of the alignment of the EGRA and what it is intended to measure and a pilot was conducted before each assessment round. However, no regular internal and
external review of the alignment between EGRA and what it was intended to measure has taken place.

15. Students had sufficient previous exposure to the type of content and skills measured by the NLSA. Textbooks or other learning resources and teachers in
their classes covered similar content and skills to those covered by the NLSA. Moreover, students were exposed to more basic content and skills than those
covered by the NLSA.

16. The NLSA was consistent with classroom assessment practices, the End of Primary School National Test (TENAFEP), and PASEC.

17. EGRA was administered to students in the local language when student's language was not French on an as-needed basis. Additionally, accommodations or
alternative assessments were not provided for students with disabilities, and special plans were not made to ensure that EGRA was administered to students in
hard-to-read areas.

18. Formal mechanisms were in place to ensure the quality of the administration and data processing of the NLSA. For example, all proctors or administrators
were trained according to a protocol, and there was a standardized manual for large-scale assessment administrators. In addition, a pilot was conducted before
the main data collection took place, all booklets were numbered, and scorers were trained to ensure high inter-rater reliability.

19. A comprehensive technical report on the NLSA was made publicly available online.

20. Country results and information were disseminated using some communication strategy. Copies of the Democratic Republic of Congo's country report and
brochures or PowerPoint presentations with the country's results were made available to development partners, including the Ministry of Education, USAID,

international NGOs, and a few civil society representatives. No products and services providing information about the NLSA results were disseminated to
schools.

21. NLSA results and information were not covered by the media.

22. Due to EGRA results, reading as a subject now figures more prominently in in-service teacher training programs. In addition, a new reading curriculum at the
primary level and reading benchmarks have been developed. Reading also will be promoted from a sub-subject to a main subject in the primary-level curriculum.

23. No formal mechanisms are in place in the Democratic Republic of Congo to monitor the impact, acceptance, and credibility of the NLSA.

24. There is no clear evidence or consensus about the NLSA having a positive impact on education quality.

International Large Scale Assessment (ILSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. The Democratic Republic of Congo participated and completed PASEC in 2010.

2. The Democratic Republic of Congo has plans to participate in the 2018 round of PASEC.

3. There was no country-level policy document addressing the Democratic Republic of Congo's participation in PASEC.

4. Funds for ILSA activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been provided by donors.

5. Funding for ILSA activities have been sourced only from external donors, such as the World Bank and CONFEMEN.

6. Funding for ILSA activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo covers implementation of the assessment exercise, data processing and analysis, disseminating
and reporting assessment results in the Democratic Republic of Congo, attendance at international meetings, ILSA staff salaries, and research and development
activities. Funding does not cover international participation fees.

7. In the Ministry of Education, a team in the Directorate for Planning is responsible for ILSA activities. The team is internationally recognized and was in charge
during the 2010 PASEC assessment exercise.

8. The ILSA unit had up-to-date computer servers and communication tools, and top-level building security and storage facilities. However, the ILSA unit did not
have up-to-date computers for all technical staff.

9. Some workshops and meetings on understanding ILSA and ILSA databases have been organized by the Directorate of Planning for staff involved in
implementation of the ILSA and education partners. In addition, funding for attending international workshops or trainings on ILSA was offered in the context of
official ILSA meetings. However, the Democratic Republic of Congo does not offer university courses on the topic of ILSA or online courses on ILSA. The Democratic
Republic of Congo also did not offer funding for international workshops or training on ILSA separate from those offered at special meetings.

10. PASEC was sufficiently aligned with the content and skill areas of the country's curriculum. In addition, it was aligned with pedagogical approaches compatible
with the curriculum.

11. Textbooks and teachers in their classes covered similar content and skills to those covered by the ILSA. Moreover, students were exposed to more basic content
and skills than those covered by the ILSA.

12. The ILSA was generally consistent with the country's classroom assessment practices, examinations, and national-large scale assessment. However, students
did have much familiarity with the multiple-choice question format that appeared on the ILSA.

13. The Democratic Republic of Congo met all technical standards required to have its data presented in the main displays of the international report.

14. Country results and information were disseminated using some communication strategies. Copies of both the country-level and international reports were
distributed to key stakeholders. In addition, the Democratic Republic of Congo's results were communicated through a press release, and brochures and
PowerPoint presentations with the country's results were made available online or distributed to key stakeholders. Only schools in the capital city received
products and services providing information about ILSA results.

15. Media coverage was limited to a few small articles, and ILSA results were written about or discussed in online blogs or forums.

16. ILSA results have been used to inform decision-making at the country level in the Democratic Republic of Congo. PASEC results have informed the Reform
Roadmap in the Ministry of Education. Results have been used in tracking the impact of reforms on student achievement levels, and informing curriculum
improvement, teacher training programs, resource allocation, and other assessment activities in the system.

17. There is evidence of a positive impact of the ILSA on education quality, as PASEC results have contributed to the Education Sector Strategy and the Education
Interim Plan.

      The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
      produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
      institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
      their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
      policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
      tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
      with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
      parents to policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
      snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
      system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

      This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of student
      assessment.
