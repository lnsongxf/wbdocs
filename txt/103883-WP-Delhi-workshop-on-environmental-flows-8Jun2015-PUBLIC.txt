Participants

Workshop attendance was on a by-invitation
basis. Invitations were sent to senior officials of
relevant central and state government agencies
with responsibility for water and or environmental
management in the Ganga basin, as well as
academics, NGOs and consultants with relevant
experience. Around 100 invitations were issued
across central agencies (MoWRRDGR; CWC;
NMCG; MoEF&CC, MoS; NIH), state agencies
(Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand,
West Bengal), IITs (Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee,
Gandhinagar), NIE, WWF, TNC, IWMI and
universities. Annex 2 contains the list of the
