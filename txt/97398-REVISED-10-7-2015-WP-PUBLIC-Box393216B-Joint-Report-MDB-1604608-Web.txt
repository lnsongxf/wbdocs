PREFACE




To stabilize warming at less than 2 degrees Celsius, as the international community agreed in 2009, the world will have
to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero before 2100. Finance and economic policy that helps shift the world to a
cleaner trajectory will be the key to mobilizing that global response.

Today, it is increasingly clear that the finance required for a successful, orderly transformation to a growing low-carbon
and resilient global economy is counted in the trillions and not billions. The immediate challenge of climate finance is to
meet the promise made by developed countries to mobilize USD 100 billion a year by 2020. Meeting this commitment
is critical to building trust and confidence around the UN climate negotiations in Paris later this year.

The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), together with other public development finance institutions, play a
strategic role in smartly deploying scarce government resources and leveraging much larger, and longer-term, private
investments. This fourth edition of the Joint Report on MDB Climate Finance reveals the important part they play in
delivering development and climate action.

In 2014, the MDBs committed over USD 28 billion for climate action in developing and emerging economies, bringing
total commitments of the past four years to over USD 100 billion. This financing has supported policy changes and
investments that provide development, adaptation and mitigation benefits directly to our client countries. It has helped,
for example, to improve agriculture and landscape management, made coastal and riverine infrastructure more resilient,
improved the efficiency of water use and water management in cities and industries, and supported community-driven
adaptation activities. It has ramped up mitigation efforts through energy efficiency, renewable energy and support for
lower-carbon transport options.

There have increasingly been questions on what gets counted as climate finance. As a group of the MDBs, we have
developed a transparent methodology. Over the last year, we have harmonized our principles for tracking climate
mitigation finance with the International Development Finance Club (which consists of development banks of national
and sub-regional origin) and have started a process for harmonizing approaches for adaptation finance.

As MDBs, we are committed to work with clients, other development finance institutions and stakeholders to provide
transparent, credible and robust information that demonstrates how climate finance is flowing.

We hope that this Joint Report on MDB Climate Finance provides useful information on MDB development finance with
climate benefits, and help to guide decision making at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development
in Addis Ababa next month, as well as key data for the Paris climate discussions.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Given the pivotal role of public finance agencies in                         23 billion, was dedicated to mitigation; and 18 percent,
scaling up climate finance, Multilateral Development                         or USD 5 billion, to adaptation, as illustrated in Figure A
Banks (MDBs) have a major role to play in mainstreaming                      (a small amount of this finance has dual, adaptation and
climate change and in providing finance in an effective,                     mitigation, benefits—please see Annex 1 for details). Of
catalytic manner. Transparent and credible information                       the total commitments, 91 percent came from MDBs’
on finance flows are essential to demonstrate the                            own resources, while the remaining 9  percent, or
effectiveness of delivering impacts on the ground.                           USD 2.6  billion, came from external resources such as
                                                                             bilateral or multilateral donors, the Global Environment

    adaptation finance went to “Energy, Transport and Other                 27 percent; and “Energy Efficiency,” 22 percent, with the
    Built Environment and Infrastructure” while 19 percent                  other categories accounting for the balance.
    went to “Other Agricultural and Ecological Resources”;
    17 percent went to “Crop Production and Food                            The MDBs have been jointly publishing climate finance
    Production”; and another 17 percent went to “Coastal and                figures for the past four years. Since 2011, the MDBs have
    Riverine Infrastructure (including built flood protection               collectively committed over USD 100 billion to address
    infrastructure).” Regarding mitigation finance, “Renewable              climate change in developing and emerging economies.
    Energy” comprised 35 percent of the total; “Transport,”                 Figure B shows the annual numbers per institution.

the MDBs.7 Total climate finance is equal to the sum of
mitigation, adaptation, and dual benefit finance from
the MDBs’ own resources as well as external resources.
Mitigation finance totaled USD 23,276 million, or
82 percent, of the total commitments, while adaptation
finance represented 18 percent of total commitments, or
USD 5,069 million, as illustrated in Figure 1.

It is important to note that some components and/or
subcomponents or elements within projects contribute to
both mitigation and adaptation (thereby delivering dual
benefits for both mitigation and adaptation); examples                       Mitigation

    /a MDB finance includes MDB own resources and external resources for all its financing (including non-climate commitments).
    Note: numbers may not add-up to the exact decimal due to rounding. This is applicable to all tables and graphs in the report.
    Note 2: EIB climate finance numbers (in this and all previous joint reports on MDB climate finance) are restricted to developing and emerging
    economies in transition, therefore excludes EU-15 countries where EIB is also active.
    Note 3: EBRD and WB’s MDB Finance only includes own resources.
    Note 4: IFC climate finance numbers reported in Table 1 include both long-term and short-term finance. IFC’s publically stated climate target
    is based on long-term climate finance only, which was 19% of IFC’s total investment business in FY14.

    and total climate finance compared to total MDB finance for                         Resources

    2014. Total climate finance as a percentage of total MDB finance
    was 22 percent and ranged from 12 percent to 36 percent across
    the MDBs.

    Sources of climate finance

    Sources of finance reported by MDBs are split between the
    MDBs’ own resources and external resources channeled through
    the MDBs. External resources include trust-funded operations
    (including bilateral donors and dedicated climate finance funds
    such as the GEF and the CIF). To prevent double counting (in
    particular as some external resources may already be covered
    in bilateral reporting), external resources managed by the MDBs
    are clearly separated from the MDBs’ own resources.
                                                                                                                                       MDB
    Total 2014 MDB climate finance was USD 25,744 million from                                                                       Resources

            Note: EIB numbers for all four years are restricted to developing and emerging economies in transition, therefore excludes
            EU-15 countries where EIB is also active. EIB numbers for 2011 were also amended (from that in the 2011 reports) to include
            EU-13 climate finance numbers, allowing for full geographical comparability among all four years.

         Part C: MDB Adaptation Finance, 2014
         In 2014, MDBs reported a total of USD 5,069 million in adaptation finance. Table 5 shows the total adaptation finance
         breakdown by MDBs’ own resources and external resources as well as reporting the nature of the recipient/borrower.
         Figure 13 provides the relative share per MDB of total adaptation finance in 2014, and Figure 14 provides the relative
         share of MDBs’ own resources and external resources by MDB.

         Data reported corresponds to the financing of adaptation projects or of those components, sub-components, or
         elements within projects that provide adaptation benefits (rather than the entire project cost). For MDBs that report
         dual benefits separately, this section as well as the accompanying tables and figures include the adaptation elements of
         that dual benefit financing but these are not shown separately. Specific information and data on dual benefit numbers
         can be found in Annex A.

     Part D: MDB Mitigation Finance, 2014
     The tables and graphs that follow present mitigation finance for 2014. Table 9 reports the total mitigation finance per
     MDB, differentiating MDBs’ own resources from external resources as well as reporting the nature of the recipient/
     borrower. Figure 17 provides the relative share per MDB of total mitigation finance in 2014, and Figure 18 provides the
     relative share of MDBs’ own resources and external resources by MDB.

     Mitigation figures reported correspond to the financing of those components and/or subcomponents or elements of
     projects that provide mitigation benefits (rather than the entire project cost). Refer to Section 2, Part D, for details
     of mitigation methodology and sectors and subsectors for mitigation finance. For MDBs that report dual benefits
     separately, this section as well as the accompanying tables and figures include the mitigation elements of that dual
     benefit financing but these are not shown separately. Specific information and data on dual benefit numbers can be
     found in Annex A.

     Regarding the share of recipients, 60 percent of total       Table 10 shows the total mitigation finance per MDB
     mitigation finance was committed to public recipients        according to region, and Table 11 provides the same
     and 40 percent to private recipients. Due to the             mitigation figures delivered to least developed countries
     different nature and clients of the various MDBs, the        and small island states. About 10 percent of mitigation
     share of commitments to mitigation finance changes           finance was delivered to least developed countries and

SECTION 2: GENERAL




Part A. Definitions and Clarifications
Comparability: In this report the 2011 numbers (when presented) were amended to be comparable to the years 2012-
2014. Therefore the 2011 numbers in this report are different from those reported in the original 2011 Joint MDB reports.
This is due to different geographic categories.

External resources: Refers to operations supported by bilateral donors and dedicated climate finance entities such as
GEF and CIF, which might also be reported to the OECD Development Assistance Committee by contributor countries.

Financing instruments: All instruments associated with MDB climate finance are covered, including grants, loans,
guarantees, equity, and performance-based instruments. Equity is defined as “ownership interest in an enterprise that
represents a claim on the net assets of the entity in proportion to the number and class of shares owned.” Guarantee is
defined as “promise from one entity to assume responsibility for the payment of a financial obligation of another entity
if such other entity fails to perform.”

Granularity: Finance reported covers only those components and/or subcomponents or elements of projects with
activities that directly contribute to (or promote) adaptation and/or mitigation.

Investments and technical assistance: Related to all vehicles used by MDB clients to support specific investments
covering a mix of capital and recurrent expenditures, as well as advisory services and capacity building.

Point of reporting: Data corresponds to commitments at the time of Board approval or financial agreement signature
and are therefore based on ex ante estimations. All efforts have been taken to prevent double counting. No corrections
will be issued in cases where a project’s scope has changed to either increase or decrease climate financing.

Policy-based instruments: Fast-disbursing financing instruments provided to the national budget in the form of loans
(also referred to as DPLs) or grants together with associated policy dialogue and economic and sector work in support
of policy and institutional reforms.

Public and private: This is based on the status of the first recipient/borrower of MDB finance. The first recipient/
borrower is to be considered public when at least 50 percent of the recipient is publicly owned.11

Reporting period: Data covers fiscal year 2014. Even though MDBs do not follow the same reporting cycle, data remains
comparable across MDBs as all reporting cycles correspond to a 12-month period.

Reporting: Reporting is complete for all fields and tables. A value of 0 in a table means the value is below USD 0.5 million
and if the value is shown as ‘-‘, then nothing was reported. As all finance figures are rounded to the nearest USD million
or USD hundred thousand, tables calculated by hand may not give the exact result shown as the total figures in the
tables.

Sources covered: MDBs’ own resources as well as a range of external resources managed by the MDBs.




11	   This is recognized as a complicated topic and the status of the first recipient/borrower may not be the same as the final beneficiary/borrower.
      For example, a loan to a national development bank for energy efficiency in small and medium enterprises is particularly complicated when a
      public-private partnership exists.

     Part C: Guidance Section on the Adaptation Finance Tracking
     Methodology
     (1) Background and Guiding Principles

     The MDB adaptation finance tracking methodology uses a context- and location-specific, conservative and granular
     approach that is intended to reflect the specific focus of adaptation activities, and reduce the scope for over-reporting
     of adaptation finance against projects. The approach drills down into the ‘sub-project’ or ‘project element’ level as
     appropriate, in line with the overall MDB climate finance tracking methodology. It also employs a clear process in order
     to ensure that project activities address specific climate vulnerabilities identified as being relevant to the project and
     its context/location.

     The reported finance, therefore, only captures the amounts associated with specific activities that are identified in the
     project document and that contribute to overall project outcomes.

     Likewise, the approach might not always capture and count activities that may significantly contribute to resilience, but
     cannot always be tracked in quantitative terms, such as some operational procedures that ensure business continuity,
     or may not have associated costs, for example siting assets outside of future storm surge range.

     It is important to note that this granular approach is not intended to capture the value of the entire project or investment
     that may increase resilience as a consequence of specific adaptation and resilient activities within the project (e.g.,
     improved drainage of a section of a newly constructed road to deal with impacts of heavy rainfall or storm surges that
     then contributes to overall road and investment resilience).

     (2) Overview of the Adaptation Finance Tracking Methodology

     This methodology is comprised of the following key steps:

     •	   Setting out the climate vulnerability context of the project14

     •	   Making an explicit statement of intent to address climate vulnerability as part of the project

     •	   Articulating a clear and direct link between the climate vulnerability context and the specific project activities

     14	 Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and
         its adaptive capacity.
27   Section 2. Part C: Guidance Section on the Adaptation Finance Tracking Methodology


     Furthermore, when applying the methodology, the reporting of adaptation finance is limited solely to those project
     activities (i.e., projects, project components or proportions of projects) that are clearly linked to the climate vulnerability
     context.

     a. Context of vulnerability to climate variability and change

     For a project to be considered as one that contributes to adaptation, the context of climate vulnerability must be set out
     clearly using a robust evidence base. This could take a variety of forms, including use of material from existing analyses
     and reports, or original, bespoke climate vulnerability assessment analysis carried out as part of the preparation of a
     project.

     Examples of good practice in the use of existing analyses or reports include using sources that are authoritative
     and preferably peer-reviewed, such as academic journals, national communications to the UNFCCC, reports of the
     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Strategic Programs for Climate Resilience.

     Examples of good practice in conducting original, bespoke analysis include using records from trusted sources showing
     vulnerable communities or ecosystems particularly vulnerable to climate change, as well as recent climate trends
     including any departures from historic means. These may be combined with climate change projections drawn from a
     wide range of climate change models, with high and low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios, in order to explore
     the full envelope of projected outcomes and uncertainties. Climate projection uncertainties should be presented and
     interpreted in a transparent way. The timescale of the projected climate change impacts should match the intended
     lifespan of the assets, systems or institutions being financed through the project (e.g., time horizon of 2030, 2050,
     2080, etc.).

     b. Statement of purpose or intent

     The project should set out how it intends to address the context- and location-specific climate change vulnerabilities, as
     set out in existing analyses, reports or the project’s climate vulnerability assessment. This is important for distinguishing
     between a development project contributing to climate change adaptation and a standard ‘good development’ project.
     The methodology is flexible regarding exactly where and how the statement of intent or purpose is documented.
     As long as the MDB concerned is able to record and track the rationale for each adaptation project or adaptation
     component of a project linked to the context of climate vulnerability established above, this could be described in the
     final technical document, Board document, internal memo or other associated project document.

     c. Clear and direct link between climate vulnerability and project activities

     In line with the principles of the overall MDB climate finance tracking methodology, only specific project activities
     that explicitly address climate vulnerabilities identified in the project documentation are reported as climate finance.
     Where climate change adaptation is incorporated into project activities that also have other objectives, the amount of
     adaptation finance counted at the project level depends on the project context, location and specific characteristics.
     It is based on the estimated incremental cost/investment associated with discrete project components or elements
     of project design that address risk and vulnerabilities under current and future climate change, in comparison with a
     project design that does not consider such conditions. In the absence of the possibility to estimate incremental cost/
     investment directly from project cost information—for example, when using policy instruments/balance sheet lending,
     equity investments or credit line lending through financial intermediaries—a proportion of the project cost/investment
     corresponding to adaptation activities may be used to represent the incremental amount. This approach may also be
     applied to project preparation activities if appropriate, depending on the standard practices of the specific MDB in
     question.

     (3) Reporting of Project Activities with Dual Benefits

     Where the same project, sub-project or project element contributes to both mitigation and adaptation, the MDB’s
     individual processes will determine what proportion is counted as mitigation or as adaptation, so that the actual
     financing will not be double counted. Some MDBs are reporting projects where the same components or elements
     contribute to both mitigation and adaptation as a separate category (Table 14). The MDBs are continuing to work on
     the best reporting method for such projects.

     Part D: Joint MDB Approach for Mitigation Finance Reporting
     (1) Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Tracking

     The 2014’s mitigation finance tracking is based on the MDB Joint Typology (see (3) below) as data was collected
     prior to March 31st, 2015, when the MDBs and the IDFC committed to the Common Principles for Climate Mitigation
     Finance Tracking,15 henceforth referred to as the “Common Principles.” The purpose of the Common Principles is
     to further align climate finance tracking between these two groups, while providing others with a transparent and
     credible approach. While the MDBs and the IDFC continue to report through their respective group-based efforts,
     the Joint MDB Approach for Mitigation Finance Reporting methodology is closely aligned with the Common
     Principles; however, this does not represent a significant departure in the reporting approach from previous years.

     As an inherent and important part of improving mitigation finance tracking, the Common Principles will be
     subject to further revision by the MDBs and the IDFC jointly, based on amassed experience. As a future step,
     comparability of reporting processes should also be addressed. In this respect, the MDBs and the IDFC are
     committed to maintaining an open and transparent exchange of information around institutional experience and
     learning, as well as to jointly discussing potential proposals to improve the Common Principles. To the extent
     possible, parties will strive to reach consensus around proposed changes or additions to the Principles. In case
     differences arise, the parties will communicate these in full when reporting on mitigation finance.

     (2) Joint MDB Approach for Mitigation Finance Reporting

     The Joint MDB Approach for Mitigation Finance Reporting is, as stated above, closely aligned with the Common
     Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking, and is based on the following attributes:

           a)	 Additionality: This approach, as well as the Common Principles, are activity-based as they focus on the
               type of activity to be executed, and not on its purpose, the origin of the financial resources or actual
               results.

           b)	 Timeline: Project reporting is ex-ante project implementation at Board approval or time of financial
               commitment.

           c)	 Conservativeness: Where data is unavailable, any uncertainty must be overcome taking a conservative
               approach, where under reported rather than over reported climate finance is preferable.

           d)	 Granularity: Only mitigation activities that are to be disaggregated from non-mitigation activities as
               far as reasonably possible are covered. If such disaggregation is needed and not possible using project
               specific data, a more qualitative/experience based assessment can be used to identify the proportion of
               the project that covers climate mitigation activities, consistent with the conservativeness principle. This is
               applicable to all categories, but of particular significance for energy efficiency projects.16

           e)	 Scope: Mitigation activities or projects can consist of a stand-alone project, multiple stand-alone projects
               under a larger program, a component of a stand-alone project or a program financed through a financial
               intermediary. For example, a project with a total cost of USD 100 million may have a USD 10 million
               documented component for energy-efficiency improvement; in this case, only the USD 10 million would be
               reported. Another example may be a USD 100 million credit line to a financial intermediary for renewable
               energy and pollution control investments, where it is foreseen that at least 60% of the resources will flow
               into renewable energy investments; in this case, only USD 60 million would be reported.

           f)	 Impact Reporting: Climate finance tracking is independent of GHG accounting and reporting in the
               absence of a joint GHG methodology.

           tracking.pdf. Also note that MDBs will adhere to the Common Principles in next year’s report.
     16	   See the table accompanying the following item (2) Typology of Mitigation Activities included in the Joint MDB Mitigation Finance Reporting for
           specific project type disaggregation issues.
34   Section 2. Part D: Joint MDB Approach for Mitigation Finance Reporting


           g)	 Verification: An activity will be classified as related to climate change mitigation if it promotes “efforts to
               reduce or limit GHG emissions or enhance GHG sequestration.”17 In the absence of a commonly agreed
               method for GHG analysis among MDBs, mitigation activities considered in this joint approach are assumed
               to lead to emission reductions, based on past experience and/or on technical analysis. Ongoing efforts to
               harmonize GHG analysis among MDBs should bring more consistency regarding the identification of many
               mitigation activities in the long term.

           h)	 Mitigation Results: Reporting according to this methodology and the Common Principles does not imply
               evidence of climate change impacts, and any inclusion of climate change impacts is not a substitute for
               project-specific theoretical and/or quantitative evidence of GHG emission mitigation. Projects seeking to
               demonstrate climate change impacts should do so through project-specific data.

           i)	 Eligibility: In fossil fuel combustion sectors (transport, and energy production and use), the methodology
               recognizes the importance of long-term structural changes, such as the energy production shift to
               renewable energy technologies, and the modal shift to low-carbon modes of transport. Consequently, both
               greenfield and brownfield renewable energy and transport modal shift projects are included. In energy
               efficiency, however, the methodology acknowledges that drawing the boundary between increasing
               production and reducing emissions per unit of output is difficult. Consequently, greenfield energy
               efficiency investments are included only in a few cases when they enable preventing a long-term lock-in
               in high carbon infrastructure. In the case of brownfield energy efficiency investments, old technologies are
               required to be replaced well before the end of their lifetime, and new technologies are substantially more
               efficient than the replaced technologies. Alternatively, new technologies or processes are required to be
               substantially more efficient than those normally used in greenfield projects.

           j)	 Exclusions: The methodology assumes that care will be taken to identify cases when projects do not
               mitigate emissions due to their specific circumstances. For example, hydropower plants with high methane
               emissions from reservoirs exceed associated RE GHG reductions; geothermal power plants with high CO2
               content in the geothermal fluid that cannot be reinjected; or biofuel projects that deplete carbon pools
               more than they reduce GHG emissions, with high emissions in production, processing and transportation.

           k)	 Avoiding Double Counting: Where the same project, sub-project or project element contributes to
               mitigation and adaptation, then the MDB’s individual processes will determine what proportion is counted
               as mitigation or as adaptation, so that the actual financing will not be recorded more than once. Some
               MDBs are reporting projects where the same components or elements contribute to both mitigation and
               adaptation as a separate category. The MDBs are working on the best reporting method for projects
               where the same components or elements contribute to both mitigation and adaptation.

     18	   The general principle for brownfield energy efficiency activities involving the substitution of technologies or processes is that: (i) the old
           technologies are substituted well before the end of their lifetime and the new technologies are substantially more efficient; or (ii) new
           technologies or processes are substantially more efficient than those normally used in greenfield projects.

     The joint mitigation methodology is a list of mitigation
     activities at the intersection of what all MDBs consider                          Other                              0              219          0

     activities not covered by the joint approach as mitigation,
     for their own reporting purposes.

     For 2014, ADB, IFC, and World Bank reported different figures according to their internal mitigation finance tracking
     approach. The IDB has an internal methodology, which covers climate change, sustainable energy, and environmental
     sustainability, and is therefore not directly comparable to the figures reported under the joint MDB approach.26

     Table C1 shows the amounts the other MDBs counted outside the joint approach according to their own internal
     methodologies and differences from the MDB joint approach.

     26	   The IDB has an internal methodology to quantify how it meets its third lending target under its 9th General Capital Increase, which incorporates
           projects related to mitigation and adaptation, sustainable energy and environmental sustainability. Under this methodology, the IDB has
           reported USD 4.4 billion. This figure is not comparable to the MDB numbers because the IDB internal methodology: (a) accounts exclusively
           for loans; (b) counts the full loan amount, rather than only the climate components; (c) includes sustainable energy and environmental
           sustainability; and (d) follows different classification criteria.
