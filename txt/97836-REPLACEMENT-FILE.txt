2      MANUFACTURING FDI IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: TRENDS, DETERMINANTS, AND IMPACT




    BOX A: Overview of Sub-Saharan Africa’s Engagement with New Partners in FDI
      China’s share of total FDI inflows into Africa averaged about 5 percent of annual global FDI flows to SSA over the past decade.
      China’s outward FDI stock in SSA reached US$24 billion in 2013, up from US$462 million in 2003. African countries, such as
      South Africa, Zambia, Nigeria, Angola, DRC, and Ethiopia attracted the lion’s share of Chinese FDI (UNCTAD 2013). Chinese
      FDI presents in a broad range of countries, including non-resource-rich countries in East Africa countries in order to penetrate
      the domestic and regional markets. Sizable inflows from China are going into manufacturing, construction, and services. The
      latter includes financial services, ICT, and electricity.
         Investment from India is also significant. The total stock originating from India in SSA was more than US$12.9 billion as of
      2012, accounting for 3 percent of the total FDI in SSA. India has traditionally concentrated in Mauritius, partly due to the ethnic
      links and the latter country’s offshore financial facilities that are used as transit points of FDI to other countries. As for sector, India
      has focused on manufacturing such as textile and garment, construction and related activates, as well as services (ICT in particular).
         Although still small, Brazil’s FDI to Africa is on the rise with the Portuguese-speaking countries such as Angola and Mozambique,
      as well as Ghana, South Africa, and Zambia as main destinations. Angola has been the largest recipient of Brazilian FDI so
      far, especially in energy, mining, and infrastructure, given the presence of a few large multinational corporations focusing on
      construction and mining. The Brazilian FDI in Angola reached US$11.7 billion.
         South Africa is the most important source of intraregional FDI in Africa. About 5 percent of total FDI in Africa originated
      from South Africa, which was the fifth largest holder of FDI stock in Africa as of 2011 (UNCTAD 2012). Most of South Africa’s
      FDI has been directed to Mauritius, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. According to UNCTAD FDI/TNC database, South
      Africa holds sizable FDI in mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and finance.
