                                guidebooks recommend shorter retention times down to about ten days (for

                                period of biogas production; it is insufficient to stabilize the sludge properly under
                                all operation conditions.

                                With unheated digesters, the annual fluctuation of air temperature and its impact
                                on digestion/biogas production should be analyzed carefully. In East Asia and other
                                regions, biogas production can be successful even when temperature minimums go
                                down briefly to about 25°C. Figure CS1-21 presents the digestion time requirements
                                as a function of temperature. This allows for the necessary digestion time in case of
                                non-mesophilic conditions.

                   Given the long retention time of sludge in digesters, designers should avoid calculating
                   sludge quantities for one-day peaks and apply those quantities to digester design. Rather,
                   two-week or one-month peak values are adequate for digester design, since the typical
                   twenty-day criterion already includes a safety margin of about five days against brief
                   sludge peaks (for instance, caused by stormwater peaks, feeding only on five days per
                   seven-day week, or unreliability of sludge production forecasts). Most of the biological
                   degradation takes place within the first ten days (see figure CS1-25).

                   Solids loading rate: (kgVS/m3/d) is sometimes recommended as a design parameter.
                   However, it never prevails for digesters fed with primary sludge and WAS. Only in cases
                   of co-digestion of additional organic waste does this parameter deserve more attention
                   (see case study 5). Typical maximum permitted loadings are 1.5–4.5 kgVS/m3/d for small–
                   large WWTPs at mesophilic temperature 30–38°C (VSA 2012a; Metcalf and Eddy 2003;

                   Temperature control and adequate mixing are key to achieving adequate performance
                   in anaerobic digesters. Usually, shallow digesters result in poor mixing, which in turn
                   fosters grit settlement and accumulation of scum. On the other hand, the large surface
                   area of cylindrical shapes provides for less intensive biogas emissions per unit area, which
                   reduces the risk of scum formation. As inert material accumulates in the digester, the
                   active volume is reduced, thereby reducing its performance. Reduced anaerobic digestion
                   performance affects biogas production and subsequent energy generation.

                   Egg-shaped digesters have the lowest outer surface to volume ratio and thus the minimum
                   energy losses, which matters particularly in cold climate regions. They also feature good
                   mixing properties, but they are more difficult to construct and usually require higher
                   CAPEX than cylindrical shapes.

               Construction is mostly done in reinforced concrete, but steel construction is sometimes
               used. The latter usually requires somewhat less CAPEX but is considered riskier in terms
               of corrosion and bursting.

               The state-of-the-art types of digester covers include floating, fixed, and membrane. The
               most common application is a fixed cover that provides free space between the digester
               roof and the liquid surface. The membrane cover is a relatively new development that
               combines its cover function with a gas holder on top of the digester. This may be attractive
               where land is in short supply and can offer cost advantages.

    DIGESTER   Mixing serves various purposes: (a) bringing substrate in contact with active biomass;
    MIXING     (b) avoidance of sludge stratification and scum layer; (c) improved gas stripping; and
               (d) avoidance of dead volume. The following are the most widespread systems for
               digester mixing:

               •	 Mechanical low-speed mixers inside the digester

               •	 Biogas injection

               •	 Mechanical pumping with internal draft tube

               •	 Mechanical pumping with external pumps

               Different mixing systems have different efficiencies. No systematic comparison exists,
               however, and specific analysis is only sometimes done. For instance, Jenicek (2012)
               reports that replacing biogas injection with mechanical low-speed mixers inside Prague’s


	                                                                       ANNEXES WASTEWATER TO ENERGY   44
               digesters increased actual sludge retention time by 25 percent. Careful analysis is hence
               always recommended before deciding on a specific mixing system.

               DWA (1996) recommends that mixing systems have a daily mixing capacity of about
               12–15 times the digester volume. Higher values are not deemed necessary as, for
               instance, recommended by Metcalf and Eddy (2003), who define a turnover time of
               tank contents of 20–30 minutes, which would imply a daily mixing capacity of 48–72
               times the digester volume.

               In general, mixing is not required twenty-four hours a day, but it should always be done
               during feeding of raw sludge.

    DIGESTER   To promote fast and intensive contact of fresh sludge with active biomass in the digester,
    FEEDING    it is common practice to mix digester sludge with raw sludge and to feed the mixture into
               the digester. Some authors recommend mixing ratios of 2–4:1 between digester sludge
               and raw sludge, with a ratio of 1:1 considered the minimum requirement.

               Generally, to minimize sludge sedimentation in pipes it is recommendable to consider
               minimum values, for instance, DN ≥ 100 mm and v ≥ 0.8 m/s (DWA 1996).

               The sludge mixture usually passes through a heat exchanger before being injected into
               the digester.

    DIGESTER   Digester heating serves two purposes:
    HEATING
               •	 Heating of (cold) raw sludge to mesophilic temperature

               •	 Compensation of heat losses through the walls, floor, and roof of the digester

               It is most common to employ external heat exchangers. In some cases internal heating
               devices inside the digester are also in use, but the maintenance of these units can prove
               problematic; therefore, internal heating is not a standard solution. The two most common
               types of external heat exchangers are heated tube-in-tube and spiral plate heat exchangers.

               In developed countries with cold winters, the thermal energy produced from CHP (about
               50 percent of the biogas’s calorific value) is mostly sufficient to enable digester heating
               without additional external fuels. Only very cold periods may require additional heat
               sources. Consequently, in warm climates heating never becomes a real OPEX issue. It
               has even proved possible in warm climate countries to eliminate digester heating and
               digester insulation (see case study 2). In this case, it is important to ensure a minimum
               temperature in the digester, ideally >28–30°C. Below that value the biological activity
               reduces drastically (see figure CS1-24). Then, if lower temperatures persist for prolonged

                              periods, neither biogas production nor sludge stabilization will be satisfactory. The
                              biological activity reduces at >40–45°C as well, but overheating is usually not an issue.

                60 percent, as indicated in figure CS1-25. Hence, digested sludge under these conditions
                usually does not achieve a VS content below 50 percent. Typically, digested sludge has
                a VS content between 50 and 55 percent. A VS content above 60 percent indicates a

    BIOGAS      Any biogas system should always contain the following:
    TREATMENT
                •	 A foam trap (for removal of foam and particles from gas)

                •	 Condensate removal (for removal of condensing gas humidity)

                If necessary, one or several of the following technologies might also be used for further
                biogas cleaning. The main substances that require improved treatment usually are H2S
                and siloxanes (Frey 2012; DWA 2011; WERF 2010b):

    •	 Biological oxidation of H2S in digester (= micro-aeration of digester)

    •	 Precipitation of H2S by Fe dosage into digester

    •	 Adsorption reactors (Fe, activated carbon)

    •	 Wet scrubbers

    The first two options are the most common and economical solutions for H2S removal in
    medium- to large-sized plants, and sometimes the processes are combined. In smaller
    facilities, adsorption in Fe filters prove easier to operate and more economical. Activated
    carbon is nowadays the standard solution for siloxane removal. Wet scrubbers are only
    applied in special cases, since this is typically the most costly, albeit one of the most
    efficient, technologies. Table CS1-6 summarizes typical features of biogas treatment.

    Micro-aeration: The air supplied into the digester should be introduced at several points
    just above the liquid level. This is where the desulphurizing microorganisms that utilize the
    oxygen have optimal conditions for their proliferation (Prochazka et al. 2013; Jäkel 2007).
    The required air quantity depends on the amount of H2S that should be oxidized. Figure
    CS1-26 presents the necessary dosages for aeration. Mercato-Romain and others (2013)
    also report on the low air supplies needed for efficient H2S removal.

    Precipitation of H2S by Fe dosage into digester: The required Fe dosage rate can be determined
    in two ways: by stoichiometric considerations or by introducing Fe so as to achieve a
    certain Fe/DS ratio in the digester.

    •	 Stoichiometrically needed are 1.75 g Fe/g S-eliminated. By using a typical overdosage
       of 100 percent (Procházka et al. 2013; DWA 1996), one can calculate the necessary
       dosage of Fe.

    •	 For safeguarding a typical H2S <200 ppm in the treated gas, a concentration of 30–40 g
       Fe/kg DS is usually necessary (Ries et al. 1992); see figure CS1-27.

                 Adsorption to activated carbon (AC): Activated carbon cannot be designated for the removal
                 of a specific substance alone. Rather, anything that can be adsorbed will be adsorbed to
                 AC. Prior testing is hence indispensable if its exact cost needs to be calculated. Since
                 H2S is frequently the dominant compound that is being adsorbed, as a rough first guide
                 one can estimate the needed AC quantities according to a typical adsorption capacity of
                 0.2–0.5 kg S per kg AC.

    GAS HOLDER   The gas holder is meant to balance biogas production with biogas utilization. The gas holder
                 should not be confused with a “storage tank”; rather, it serves as a small “balancing tank.”

                 The daily fluctuation of biogas production depends primarily on the digester’s sludge-
                 feeding regime. If feeding is done only once a day, biogas production peaks after about two
                 to three hours. For balancing this single peak, a holder volume of about 15–20 percent of
                 daily production is usually sufficient (VSA 2010). Based on that background, gas holders
                 are typically designed for a volume of about 10–30 percent of daily biogas production. The
                 lower values prevail for large WWTPs; the higher values prevail for small WWTPs. But
                 larger volumes of 50–80 percent are also sometimes recommended. However, whether
                 the small amount of extra energy production facilitated by larger holder volume does,
                 indeed, compensate for the substantial extra CAPEX is questionable.

                 Technically, low-pressure gas holders are the typical standard today. Two main types
                 dominate the market:

                 •	 Double membrane biogas holder: This type of gas holder features two membranes: an outer
                   membrane that is more robust and meant to protect against atmospheric conditions
                   (sun, wind, rain, snow) and an inner membrane that contains the biogas. The space
                   between these two membranes is connected to a blower that regulates the gas storage
                   pressure. The higher the pressure, the better is the gas holder’s resistance against wind,
                   but its energy consumption also increases. The typical compromise is a pressure range
                   of some 20–80 mbar. The membrane material is usually a PVC-coated polyester fabric.
                   Double membrane gas holders can be installed as standalones on the ground or on top
                   of the digester.

                 •	 Single membrane biogas bags: Gas bags are installed inside buildings or in specially
                   constructed containers. Their shape can be easily adjusted to requirements. Usually
                   they operate without pressure.

    FLARE   A flare is an indispensable element of any WWTP with biogas production. It should be
            considered a safety installation, rather than a standard operating unit. The shorter its
            operation time, the higher the percentage of biogas utilization, and, thus, the greater the
            financial benefits.

            To fulfil its safety function, the flare must be able to cope with the maximum possible
            hourly biogas production rate. Underdesign is to be avoided. An example is depicted in
            figure CS1-29.

    BIOGAS        Options for biogas utilization include the following (WERF 2012a; Frey 2012; DWA 2011):
    UTILIZATION
                  •	 Burner

                  •	 Fuel cells

                  •	 Stirling motor

                  •	 Direct drive engines

                  •	 Supply into natural biogas supply systems

                  •	 Utilization as fuel for vehicles

                  •	 Co-generation

                  •	 Microturbines

                  Burners only produce thermal energy. This form of energy is usually of substantially lower
                  economic value than electric power, and it is rarely required in East Asia and other warm
                  regions.

                  Fuel cells have not yet reached a technical state of the art that would make their application
                  easily possible anywhere. Even though they achieve relatively high electric efficiencies of
                  >40 percent, they require extensive biogas treatment, they pose increased safety risks
                  (H2), and their CAPEX is still too high for viable application. For instance, the U.S. EPA
                  indicates that fuel cells will only be economically viable if prices decline (U.S. EPA 2006),
                  and WERF (2010b) describes them as one of the most expensive CHP technologies.
                  Microbial fuel cells, a novel development, require further research and have not yet reached
                  the point where they could be recommended for wider application (Rulkens 2007; Kletke
                  et al. 2010; WERF 2011b).

                  The Stirling motor has very low electric efficiency of just slightly above 20 percent. It
                  requires extensive maintenance of pistons and is only available in the market in very small
                  units of about 10 kW.

                  Direct drive engines may be considered for powering large consumers of electric energy,
                  such as major pumps or aeration blowers. Even though it is sometimes stated that direct
                  drive technology is cheaper and more efficient than co-generation or microturbines
                  (Monteith et al. 2006), usually there are no substantial cost differences, and efficiencies
                  are not, indeed, superior. Thus, even though they represent a robust technology, direct
                  drive applications are not widely used.

    Supply into natural biogas systems requires, as a matter of fact, a nearby biogas pipeline,
    which is frequently not available. Should this condition be met, it still faces a series of
    additional challenges: (a) technical: increase of CH4 content, very strict criteria for H2S
    and other quality parameters, pressure increase, need for constant supply; (b) legal; and
    (c) financial.

    Utilization as fuel for vehicles has been applied in various locations worldwide. However,
    when considering this option, several issues have to be resolved: compliance with normed
    fuel quality requirements, safety aspects, and, not least, the storage issue due to constant
    supply but only intermittent utilization.

    Hence, what is typically left as the most economical option for biogas reuse at WWTPs is
    combined production of electricity and heat (CHP) through co-generation or microturbines.
    Figure CS1-30 presents typical examples.

    Figure CS1-30: Co-generation and microturbine




    Sources: GE Jenbacher (co-generation); Capstone (microturbine).


    In co-generation, the biogas is burned in a motor, and a generator converts the mechanical
    energy into electric energy. In a microturbine, the biogas is also burned, but at substantially
    lower temperatures and at a surplus of oxygen. The burned gases move a turbine, from
    which a generator then produces the electric energy. The surplus of oxygen results in
    lower gas emissions (for example, less NOx, and CO), and the turbine shows less wear
    and tear than a motor.

    Co-generation is available on the market with electric unit capacities from some 30 kW
    up to several thousand kW. The maximum electric capacities of microturbines are lower,
    currently ranging from 30 kW to 600 kW per unit.

    Figure CS1-31 presents typical electric efficiencies of these installations. They reflect
    average characteristics from products of numerous manufacturers available on the market.

    In CHP, about 50 percent of the biogas’s calorific value is converted into thermal energy,
    and about 10 percent is lost. No extra fuel is needed for the installations’ operation.

    Electric efficiencies at partial load, presented in figure CS1-32, only serve to demonstrate
    the different characteristics of co-generation and microturbines: while co-generation
    immediately loses efficiency under partial load, microturbines have a near-constant
    efficiency for awhile, and only then does the efficiency decline.

    While co-generation is a well-known system, microturbines are not yet generally
    known, but they could offer substantial advantages in East Asian countries due to their
    simpler technology and lower maintenance needs. Their requirements for gas cleaning
    are less strict; after all, this system was originally developed for military purposes with
    a focus on robustness. Their main disadvantages are slightly higher CAPEX and lower
    electric efficiency of about 30 percent. The key differences between co-generation and
    microturbines are summarized in table CS1-7.

    UASB           Both rectangular and circular UASB reactors have been constructed. However, the
    SHAPE AND      rectangular type is by far the most widespread shape nowadays.
    CONSTRUCTION
                   Typical water depth in UASB is in the range of 3–6 m.

                   The total reactor volume is usually split over several reactors. The individual reactor
                   volume per unit recommended was <1,000 m3 (Haandel and Lettinga 1994) in the ’90s;
                   nowadays it is 2,000–3,000 m3 per unit at large WWTPs.

                   The environment in UASBs is highly corrosive. Consequently, most UASB reactors are
                   constructed out of reinforced concrete, possibly with sufficient chemical resistance.
                   It is imperative that all equipment that is not made from concrete, ranging from pipes,
                   channels, distribution chambers, and manhole covers to the gas collection system, be
                   made from noncorrosive materials such as PE, PVC, or GRP.

                   The main construction differences of UASB found nowadays among large-scale plants
                   relate to the influent distribution.

    INFLUENT       It is of major relevance that the influent wastewater be evenly distributed at the bottom
    DISTRIBUTION   of the UASB reactor. To that end, the total incoming flow is split into numerous subflows,
                   each of which is then discharged at the UASB bottom through a specifically assigned pipe.
                   The influence area of this supply pipe should be less than 5 m2, and ideally between 1.5
                   and 3.0 m2 (Sperling and Chernicharo 2005).

                   With increasing flow rates, flow splitting is increasingly difficult to implement. Hence,
                   influent distribution becomes a limiting factor in terms of the maximum treatment
                   capacity UASB plants can achieve. For example, Onça WWTP (which is also part of this
                   case study) is designed for a peak flow of 3.7 m3/s (avg. 2.1 m3/s), which is near the
                   maximum flow range of what is practically recommendable.

                   Wastewater splitting is usually done on the reactor surface, either by circular distribution
                   devices or longitudinal (rectangular) devices (see figures CS3-14 and CS3-15). The former
                   consist of circular distribution wells, and the latter use longitudinal free surface channels
                   along which numerous distribution boxes are located. Each distribution box then receives
                   its specific distribution pipe. To minimize clogging risks, the pipes should have a diameter
                   of >75 mm. Since each pipe is hydraulically separated from the other, clogging can be
                   easily spotted. In that case, pipe cleaning is done either with mechanical tools or high-
                   pressure water.

    SLUDGE         It is important for the operator to know the distribution of the sludge blanket inside the
    SAMPLING AND   UASB and to optimize the discharge of sludge (as constant as with as high TS concentration
    DISCHARGE
                   as possible). To that end, it is advisable to install sludge sampling and discharge pipes at
                   different levels of the reactor. Sampling is usually done at several levels, 0.5–1.0 meters
                   apart, while sludge discharge is often possible at just two levels: one near the reactor
                   bottom and another 1.0–1.5 meters above that level (see figure CS3-16).

    Three-phase separator	 The three-phase separator is a key component of any UASB and is
    located in the upper zone of the reactor. Its purpose is to separate the three phases: biogas,
    liquor, and sludge. After all, all three phases move upward, since this is the wastewater
    flow direction, and gas bubbles rise as well.

    The three-phase separator (figure CS3-17) is constructed in such a way that the rising gas
    bubbles are collected and conveyed to the gas outlet pipe. This leads to a separation of gas
    and sludge particles, with the sludge particles consequently settling back into the sludge
    blanket. Still, some of the sludge particles may enter the settling compartment together
    with the treated effluent. Since the gas has already been effectively removed and cannot
    enter this compartment (as all vertical trajectories lead to the gas outlet), the sludge will
    be separated from the liquid phase here, and the particles will sink and glide back into the
    sludge blanket from this zone as well.

    digestion compartment, and for efficient gas collection underneath, the inclination of
    the three-phase separator should be at least 45°, and preferably greater than 50°. The
    sedimentation compartment itself should be 1.5–2.0 meters deep. Hydraulic retention time
    in the sedimentation compartment should be 1.5–2.0 hours on average (>1.0 [0.6] hours
    during daily [hourly] peak flows), and surface loading in the sedimentation compartment
    should be 0.6–0.8 m/h (<1.2 [1.6] m/h during daily [hourly] peak flows). The velocity in
    the apertures to the sedimentation compartment may not exceed 4.0 (5.5) m/h during
    daily (hourly) peak flows, and should be <2.0 m/h during average flow.

                               	 -	 Traditionally, the biogas yield has been estimated in UASB through a simple COD
                                    balance: CODbiogas = CODinfluent – CODeffluent – CODsludge, combined with the general
                                    gas equation and an assumed CH4 content in the biogas. This procedure is, for
                                    instance, described in Haandel and Lettinga (1994) and Sperling and Chernicharo
                                    (2005). However, in practice it turns out that this approach mostly leads to a more
                                    or less significant overestimation of the collectable biogas quantities. It is hence
                                    not recommendable.

                               	 -	 Generally, it is of major importance to distinguish between biogas production
                                    and collectable biogas. There is always a considerable percentage of biogas that
                                    cannot be collected for various reasons. As has been found by Lobato and others
                                    (2011, 2012), the following requires careful analysis: COD converted into sludge;
                                    COD used for sulfate reduction; dissolved COD of CH4 lost with effluent; COD
                                    not converted into CH4 and lost with effluent; and other CH4 losses. Based on an
                                    elaborate study of several UASBs, and also taking typical parameter variations into
                                    account, the following conclusion can be derived: collectable biogas = 10–17 L/
                                    cap/d (mean 14 L/cap/d). Behind these values are capita-specific pollution loads
                                    of an average 90–110 gCOD/cap/d. Hence, by including a small safety margin, it
                                    is possible to equate these capita-specific values with PE60-specific values. On
                                    that basis, the following collectable biogas yield can be assumed: 10–17 L biogas/
                                    PE60/d (mean 14).

                               	 -	 It is important to mention that the result of the above-described latest findings
                                    related to collectable biogas yields match earlier findings. Behind the above-cited
                                    PE-specific gas production numbers of Lobato and others (2011, 2012) lies a CH4
                                    yield of 113–196 L CH4/kgCODremoved. This is rather similar to what had been found
                                    by Noyola and others (2006), who reported a range of 80–180 L CH4/kgCODremoved
                                    (≈7–16 L biogas/PE60/d).

    	 -	 Conclusion: Based on the above described findings, the collectable biogas yield
          of municipal UASB can be expected to fall within a range of 7–17 L biogas/PE60/d,
          with average values of 13 L biogas/PE60/d (= 217 L biogas/kgBOD5/d, range =
          115–280 L biogas/kgBOD5/d).

    Typically, less than 50 percent of influent COD is converted into CH4. The more than
    50 percent of COD remaining is lost in the effluent, required for sulfate reduction, or
    converted into sludge. From the COD converted into CH4 only about two-thirds are
    actually collectable in the UASB, while one-third is lost. These losses can even go up to
    about 50 percent of the CH4 formed under unfavorable conditions. Under ideal conditions,
    they may be reduced to about 25 percent of the CH4 formed (Lobato et al. 2011, 2012).
    Similar results are presented by Chernicharo and others (2012).

Consequently, while to date OPEX has increased by
US$100,000 per year, after the installation of CHP it
will be reduced by about US$590,000 per year once
it is working.

    DESIGN
                              General: Few design references exist on biogas production in covered anaerobic ponds.
                              The following approaches are mostly used for estimating the biogas potential in covered
                              APs for municipal wastewater:

                              (i)	 Biogas yield from influent BOD5 load: Daily biogas production (m3/d) = 0.3 x
                                   kgBOD5,influent/d (Libhaber and Orozco-Jaramillo 2012). The result from this calculation
                                   may be considered the collectable biogas quantity.

                              		 Note: The above 300 L gas/kgBOD5 is equivalent to 150 L gas/kgCOD; assuming
                                   60 percent COD destruction in the AP, this is equivalent to 250 L gas/kgCODdestroyed;
                                   based on 70 percent methane, this is 175 L CH4/kgCODdestroyed; compared to the
                                   theoretical maximum (see below) of 350 L CH4/kg CODdestroyed, this implies a biogas
                                   loss assumption of 50 percent.

                              (ii)	 Biogas from COD load destroyed in AP: Daily biogas production (m3/d) = 0.350 x
                                   kgCODdestroyed/d. This is a stoichiometric relationship. It describes how much biogas is
                                   produced, but it does not say anything about how much of this biogas can indeed be
                                   collected. After all, much biogas is lost dissolved in the effluent.

                              		 With a loss assumption of 50 percent, the collectable daily biogas quantity thus is
                                   0.175 x kgCODdestroyed/d.

                              (iii)	Biogas from influent VS load: This approach is not recommended for municipal
                                   wastewater since it does not include the considerable dissolved influent organic load.
                                   It is more appropriate for industrial applications—for instance, in piggeries—where

                              Case study 4: The following has been found in this case study:

                              (i)	 Biogas yield from influent BOD5 load: Collected methane = 9.8–13.7 L CH4/PE60/d.
                                   That is equivalent to 160–230 L CH4/kgBOD5. Based on an average CH4 content of 70
                                   percent follows: Daily biogas production (m3/d) = (0.23 to 0.33) x kgBOD5,influent/d.

                              (ii)	 Biogas from COD load destroyed in AP: Collected methane = 150–220 L/kgCODdestroyed.
                                   Compared to the above cited maximum of 350 L/ kgCODdestroyed, the losses thus
                                   amount to about 35–60 percent.

    A typical CH4 content from biogas of covered AP according to the literature is about 70

    CO-DIGESTION OF ORGANIC WASTE: TECHNICAL SUMMARY

    Table CS5-7: Co-digestion of organic waste in anaerobic digesters: General design parameters and key characteristics of sludge management


    DIGESTED                   The total digested sludge production from co-digestion can be calculated as the digested
    SLUDGE                     sum of its individual inputs. It is worth mentioning that this approach may lead to slight
    PRODUCTION
                               overestimates of total digested sludge production. It has been confirmed by various
                               studies and applications (Dengg 2013; Kusowski et al. 2013; Iacovidou et al. 2012; Johnson
                               et al. 2011; Svardal and Haider 2010; Callegari 2010; Zupancic et al. 2008; Felde et al.
                               2005; Jansen et al. 2004), that the mutual digestion of sewage sludge and organic waste
                               enhances the biological activities in the digester. Consequently, both sludge and biowaste
                               are more efficiently degraded, and overall sludge production is lower (and overall biogas
                               yield higher) than the sum of individual digestion of the same substances. Simple design
                               tools for quantification of these effects without practical experiments are not available.
                               Therefore, the common design approach is to add up the following components:

                               • Digested sludge production from waste sludge

                               • See table CS1-5.

                               • Digested sludge production from organic waste

                               The theoretical sludge production from organic waste digestion can be estimated by
                               assuming a typical percentage for VS destruction (see table CS5-10). An estimate for the
                               digested biowaste DS can then be derived from total biowaste DS input to the digester,
                               minus VS destroyed.

    DIGESTED                   The practical implications of co-digestion for sludge dewaterability do not show a
    SLUDGE                     uniform trend. Both improved dewatering results and reduced polymer consumption for
    DEWATERING
                               conditioning and reduced dewatered DS and increased polymer consumption are reported.
                               For design considerations it is deemed acceptable to assume no relevant changes of
                               sludge dewatering characteristics (that is, to assume the same DS and specific polymer
                               consumption) after the introduction of co-digestion, as compared to prior conditions.

    FILTRATE                   The filtrate quality from sludge dewatering is affected by co-digestion. Whereas the

    If the WWTP in question is only designed for carbon removal, this additional N load is not
    crucial for compliance with the required effluent quality standards. However, due to the
    fast nitrification in warm climates, it will nonetheless increase energy consumption for
    aeration. If the WWTP is designed for enhanced N removal, the issue becomes even more
    important. In this case, the additional N load has to be duly considered in the design of the
    wastewater train.

    The additional N load can be estimated by assuming all N contained in the destroyed
    VS fraction of the organic waste ends up in the filtrate. (This is a safe assumption, since
    a minor percentage of this “destroyed” N will also be used for biomass synthesis.) For
    design purposes, it is hence important to know the N content of organic waste and the
    typical VS destruction in co-digestion. The former is presented in table CS5-8, and the
    latter can be taken from table CS5-10. If of interest, the additional P load that is returned
    to the wastewater train from organic waste co-digestion may be calculated the same way.

    BIOGAS DESIGN             Biogas production in co-digestion originates from different sources, which can be assessed
                              separately and added together to come up with total biogas production:

                              The biogas production from organic waste can be estimated using the three different
                              approaches described below. The method of choice usually depends on data availability.

                              (ii) Biogas yield from the digestion of kgCOD

                              The methane yield can be calculated with a specific value of 350 L CH4/kg CODdestroyed
                              (Nowak and Ebner 2013; Urban and Scheer 2011; Svardal and Haider 2010; DWA 2002).
                              This methane yield may then be converted into biogas yield by taking the methane content
                              of biogas (see table CS5-10) into account. For CODdestroyed as a percentage of CODtotal,
                              similar percentages as indicated for VSdestroyed in table CS5-10 can be applied.

    Of course, COD and VS of organic waste are interrelated. However, the ratio between
    these parameters is not a constant, since it depends on the material’s composition. Typical
    ratios are, for instance, COD/VS ≈ 2.0–2.5 for FOG, and COD/VS ≈ 1.4–1.6 for waste food
    (Urban and Scheer 2011; Svardal and Haider 2010).

    The biogas yields in table CS5-11 represent the theoretical maximum yield, if all VS were
    completely digested. The numbers presented are taken from DWA (2002), but quite
    similar theoretical values are cited by Miot and others (2013) and Urban and Scheer
    (2011). The practical biogas yields, though, are lower, since (a) not all VS is fully destroyed
    (compare table CS5-10); (b) the chemical composition of the substrates may vary within
    a certain range; and (c) a fraction of the substrate is always used for cell synthesis. Hence,
    when calculating the biogas yield for a specific organic waste, these additional aspects
    should be applied to reduce the biogas values derived from the data provided in table
    CS5-11. In design practice, usually only the very first of these impacts (a) is indeed phased
    into the calculations.

    The overall methane content from the digestion of a specific organic waste can be
    calculated as the weighted result according to the respective methane contents provided
    in table CS5-11.

  The disintegration (cell wall destruction) effect of ultrasound treatment is based on cavitation. Ultrasound oscillator elements are usually positioned inside a
small disintegration reactor. The emitted ultrasonic waves cause a periodic compression and decompression in the sludge matrix. Locally this causes extreme
conditions with high pressures and temperatures. Cavitation bubbles are formed and implode again. Depending on the energy applied, the extent of cell lysis of
the sludge’s microorganisms can be controlled.

At all eight WWTPs analyzed for this case study, it was
concluded that the ultrasound sludge disintegration
project is financially viable. Life cycle cost within the
lifespan of new installations for USD (ten to fifteen
years) was considered lower with the new installations
than without. Average amortization is expected within
about five years under European conditions.

ULTRASOUND SLUDGE DISINTEGRATION: TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Table CS6-8: Ultrasound sludge disintegration prior to anaerobic digesters for biogas enhancement: General design parameters and key
characteristics of sludge management


    USD                      •	 Generally, ultrasound frequencies range from 20 kHz to 10 GHz. For sludge disintegration,
    CONSTRUCTION                20–40 kHz is commonly used.
    DETAILS
                             •	 The typical lifespan of ultrasound oscillators = 45,000 operation hours. When running
                                for twenty-four hours a day, that is equivalent to more than five years. The guaranteed
                                lifespan usually is about 25,000 operation hours.

                             •	 Modular systems, which can be easily extended

                             •	 Low maintenance needs

                             •	 Automated operation

                             •	 Area requirement for disintegration reactor + pumps + control switchboard equal to
                                about 5 m2/100,000 PE60

                             •	 Minimum required room height = 2.8 m

                             •	 Noise emissions: max 65 dB

    DIGESTED                 General: The VS content in the digested sludge can be reduced by up to 25 percent (VTA
    SLUDGE                   2012). Considering VS makes up about 50–60 percent of digested sludge, that means
    PRODUCTION               overall sludge quantities may be reduced by up to 10–15 percent.

                             Case study 6: About 15 percent (10–20 percent) more VS was destroyed in the digesters
                             with USD than without USD. Therefore, in absolute terms, the percentage of VSdestroyed
                             increased from 49 percent to 56 percent, on average.

                             Furthermore, a reduction of dewatered sludge quantities of about 12 percent (5–22
                             percent) was observed. Since this reduction cannot be explained by the stronger VS
                             destruction alone, it hints at an improvement of DS in dewatered sludge by an absolute
                             +1 percent DS.

    DIGESTED                 General: A reduced VS content of the digested sludge should facilitate dewatering. Hence,
    SLUDGE                   the DS of dewatered sludge may increase, and dewatered sludge quantities (m3) to dispose
    DEWATERING
                             of/reuse may be reduced. The combined effect of reduced VS content (see above) and of
                             improved dewatered DS is said to enable an overall sludge reduction of up to 20 percent
                             (VTA 2012).



	                                                                                              ANNEXES WASTEWATER TO ENERGY   162
                  Additionally, polymer conditioning for dewatering may be reduced by up to 20 percent
                  (VTA 2012).

                  Case study 6: The operators mostly did not report dewatered DS changes. Also, polymer
                  consumption for sludge conditioning was usually not affected. Nonetheless, the reduction
                  of dewatered sludge quantities hints at an increase of dewatered DS by an absolute +1
                  percent DS (see above item). This may not have been noticed by the operators, since it is
                  a relatively minor impact that is not too apparent.

    FILTRATE      General: The filtrate quality from sludge dewatering is affected by USD. Whereas the
    QUALITY       expected impact on carbon parameters (BOD5, COD, DS) and phosphorus are mostly
    FROM SLUDGE   considered negligible for municipal WWTPs, the additional nitrogen (N) that is released
    DEWATERING
                  together with the cell liquors and is returned to the wastewater train via the sludge
                  dewatering filtrate may be worth considering.

                  If the WWTP in question is only designed for carbon removal, this additional N load is not
                  crucial for compliance with the required effluent quality standards. Nonetheless, due to
                  the fast nitrification in warm climates, it will increase energy consumption for aeration. If
                  the WWTP is designed for enhanced N removal, the issue becomes even more important.
                  In this case, the additional N load has to be duly taken into account in the design of the
                  wastewater train.

                  The additional N load caused by USD can be estimated by assuming 100 g of additional N
                  per additional kgVSdestroyed (DWA 2009). Schmelz and Müller (2004) state that this leads
                  to an increase of N return load by 5 percent.

                  Case study 6: No quantifiable impacts on increased return loads were observed at the
                  WWTPs of this case study. This could be seen as a confirmation of the cited minor N
                  increase of only 5 percent.

characteristics of energy management



    ENERGY                    General: The energy benefits are directly proportional to the extra biogas generation.
    BENEFITS FROM
    USD                       Extra biogas: Typical increases in biogas quantities are up to 30 percent (VTA 2012). For
                              the electricity generation from that extra biogas, apply the principles of table CS1-5.

                              Case study 6: USD treatment increased biogas production of the eight WWTPs of this
                              case study by 24 percent (range: 12–33 percent). This equalled an increase by about 100
                              (50–140) L/kgVSadded.

                              Given the typical electric power generation of CAS plants with mesophilic digesters of
                              about 15–18 kWh/PE60/y with N elimination (see table CS1-2), this equals an increase in
                              electricity generation by 4 (2–6) kWh/PE60/y.

                              General: The following electricity consumption is caused by USD:
    ENERGY
    REQUIREMENTS
                              USD: Typical electricity requirements of ultrasound sludge disintegration vary between 0.5
    FOR USD
                              and 20 kWh/m3 sludge with 5 percent DS treated. This is equivalent to about 0.01–0.4
                              kWh/kgDS with an average DS = 5 percent. These values hold true if 100 percent of the
                              sludge is, indeed, treated (Müller 2010; DWA 2009).

                              •	 Peripheral installations (mixer, pumps): Typically, 0.9 kWh/m3 sludge is treated (DWA
                                2009).

                              •	 Aeration of N return load: Additional aeration requirement due to N return load through
                                filtrate = 1.95 kWh/kg Neliminated for fine bubble aeration (Müller 2010; DWA 2009).

                              Case study 6: The overall energy consumption for all USD-related installations was found to
                              be about 1.1 (0.5–2.4) kWh/actual PE60/y. This is equivalent to approximately 30 percent
                              of the additional electricity generated from the increased biogas quantities (see above).
