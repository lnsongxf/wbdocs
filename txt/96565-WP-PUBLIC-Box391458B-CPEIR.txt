Public Expenditures and Investment Review




           The Government of Vietnam (GoV) has conducted a Climate Public Expenditure and Investment Review
           (CPEIR) with the support of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The
           review examined Vietnam’s policies and climate change expenditure for the period 2010–2013 from five
           ministries (MONRE, MOIT, MARD, MOC, and MOT) and three provinces (Bac Ninh, Quang Nam and An Giang). To
           assess the public expenditure and improve alignment with policy goals and targets, a Typology of Climate Change
           Response Expenditures (TCCRE) was developed. This typology was used to classify the government’s spending on
           its climate change response into three pillars: (i) Policy and Governance (PG), (ii) Scientific, Technological and Societal
           Capacity (ST), and (iii) Climate Change Delivery (CCD). The typology also examined how expenditure within each
           pillar and in each sector is relevant to Vietnam’s climate change response (CC-response). Since roughly 70 percent
           of the total investment spending is allocated at the provincial level, the analysis does not represent the totality of
           Vietnam’s CC-response, but still offers substantive insight into spending, in particular through a comprehensive
           focus on the five key line ministries.

           Based on its findings, the CPEIR proposes solutions for how to accelerate Vietnam’s CC-response through
           the state budget and informs decision makers on readiness for scaling up the CC-response while increasing coher-
           ence across sectors’ and provinces’ policies. The CPEIR report is released at an opportune time, allowing the
           review’s recommendations to inform the formulation and implementation of the SEDP 2016–2020, and enabling/
           promoting the GoV’s post-2015 climate change and green growth response program.
           The full review and background notes are available on the website of the Ministry of Planning and Investment that was established to
           track Climate Finance Options for Vietnam (http://cfovn.mpi.gov.vn), as well as on the websites of the World Bank (www.worldbank
           .org/en/country/vietnam) and UNDP (www.vn.undp.org).
Climate change impacts and a carbon
intense economy threaten Vietnam’s
development progress.
Climate-related hazards have adverse effects on the national
growth and poverty reduction, on the poor and several sec-
tors of the economy simultaneously. According to the Cli-
mate Change Vulnerability Index, Vietnam is considered one of
30 “extreme risk countries” in the world. The country is already
experiencing increases in temperature, sea level rise, intensifying
storms, and more frequent floods and droughts, which cause loss
of life and damage the economy. The rural poor are at high risk
given their reliance on the natural resources for the livelihood, par-
ticularly in agriculture and fisheries. The Mekong River Delta and
Red River Delta have already suffered from saltwater intrusion,
threatening agricultural productivity and the millions of people
relying on these watersheds for their income. Urban populations                   core climate change policies in Vietnam comprise the National

Implementation of mitigation policy should be evidence-
based and linked to global efforts. Mitigation involves com-
plex policy issues that will be resolved progressively. For the
GoV to meet its demonstrated commitment to low-carbon
growth, a national Monitoring, Reporting, and Verifica-
tion (MRV) system needs to be developed to identify, track,
and report on trends in GHG emissions. Further, mitiga-
tion policies should link with global and national action on
GHG emissions abatement and green growth targets. Key
tasks for implementing mitigation policy are to: (i) review cur-
rent mitigation activities and develop consolidated mitigation
targets for post-2020 and an implementation roadmap for low-
carbon development options; and (ii) establish a consistent
fiscal policy framework to encourage reduction of fossil fuel use.
The GoV’s policy and management of energy SOEs is also crucial
and should be reviewed given that they execute the bulk of energy
investment and sale of energy to the public. In addition, the role
of REDD+ as part of an overall coherent framework for mitiga-
tion needs to be determined.
