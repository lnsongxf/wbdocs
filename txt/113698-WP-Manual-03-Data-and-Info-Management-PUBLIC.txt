4             DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Preface and Acknowledgements
Five manuals were prepared by IFC for the development of agri-insurance markets where the public and
private sectors work together in a partnership (PPP). The manuals are designed to strengthen the capacity
of the government and market players to effectively design agri-insurance products, both traditional
indemnity and index, introduce them to the market, and build sales. The manuals are designed to be
succinct yet at the same time sufficient to create the technical and administrative foundation for a modern
agri-insurance system, and to allow programs in early stages of development to properly plan the required
system. Finally the manuals are designed to train practitioners, to build local capacity for skills that are
required to start the program, and to enable the program to grow over time.

The principle author of the manuals is Professor Myles Watts, University Professor, Lead Actuary at Watts
& Associates, Member of the Board at the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and 5th Generation
Montana Farmer. Watts and Associates designed and launched numerable agri-insurance products in
North America, frequently consults for the major reinsurers, and supports insurance programs around the
world. They have established their own index insurance company, eWeatherRisk. The manuals incorporate
practical lessons learned over the past 40 years.

The development of the manuals was a joint activity of the Ukraine Agri-Insurance Project (2007-2015),
IFC’s Global Agri-Finance Team, and the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) (2009 to present). Dr. Gary
Reusche led the Ukrainian project, served as a technical specialist on the global agri-ﬁnance team, and as
a member of the GIIF technical committee and core management team. Agri-insurance development is
closely linked to agricultural ﬁnance and value chains and they are effectively developed in unison.

The manuals result from training workshops developed by the agri-insurance project in Ukraine and globally
by GIIF technical experts. The entire agri-insurance team in Ukraine made practical contributions to the
manuals, with special recognition due to Victoria Yakubovich for collecting, organizing and preparing the
initial drafts and Andrey Zaripov a member of the GIIF team for helping to develop the reinsurance and cash
ﬂow models. The project team included experts from the Alberta (Canada) provincial agri-insurance program,
in particular Richard McConnell, who contributed his experience and expertise to the training activities.

Peer review and Spanish language translations of the manual resulted from IBRD consultants in Central and
South America, especially Pablo R. Valdivia Zelaya and Roberto Dario Bacchini.

The team is grateful to Professor Gary Brester for his practical contributions and editing of the manuals
and Olesya Zhuchenko for coordinating the publication of the manuals, working with designers to plan the
layout, and printing.

Finally support for the manuals was provided by the Canadian government, and the Global Index Insurance
Facility (GIIF) lead by Gilles Jacques Galludec (Program Manager) funded by the European Union, Japan and
the Netherlands.

6        DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
1.0.       Introduction
Data and information management refers to the development, collection,
use, and preservation of data and the methods needed to acquire, control,
protect, deliver, and enhance its value to achieve the goals of agricultural
insurance programs. Issues related to the collection, development,
updating, and quality of data are often overlooked when developing
agricultural insurance programs. However, such programs will likely
fail without a concise, well-developed plan for data and information
management.

Data are needed by those who develop, operate, and manage agricultural
insurance programs. In addition, agricultural producers need access to
high-quality data for making individual purchase decisions. Better data
quality and larger data quantities improve decision-making, management,
and product development. Successful agricultural insurance programs
require accurate and comprehensive data collection, management, and
security.

This manual presents a wide range of management issues related to
agricultural insurance data. Speciﬁcally, issues related to data uses, needs,
documentation, quality control, security, accessibility, storage, and public
policy are discussed. In addition, data needs related to underwriting,
loss adjustments, premium rating, and reinsurance are also presented.
Because speciﬁc agricultural insurance products often have differing
data requirements, similarities and differences among such products
are delineated. Finally, this manual also considers computer hardware
and software design issues and requirements and provides examples of
necessary data ﬁles.




                                                                                MANUAL 3   7
2.0.       Data Uses
Accurate and comprehensive data are needed by those who develop,
operate, manage, and regulate agricultural crop insurance programs. In
general, the preferred approach to rating is the use of historical data for
the perils of concern. If historical data are not available, other approaches
are used to rate various crop insurance products. However, the results
of such rating are usually inferior to those derived using comprehensive
data. Agricultural producers and producer organizations need data to
decide whether or not to purchase products and to develop crop insurance
products. In addition, producers use data for making decisions regarding
coverage levels and product purchases. In most cases, the performance
of insurance products and their efficacy regarding risk management
for agricultural producers is largely a function of data availability and
maintenance.

Primary insurance providers need data to establish premium rates, service
products, evaluate product performance, monitor individual producer
activity, research and develop new products, and modify existing
products. Furthermore, insurance providers require data to develop
ﬁnancial reviews and other information needed for internal and external
auditing, reports to external organizations, and for evaluating reinsurance
premiums. In many cases, primary insurance providers also receive
premium subsidies from government agencies. Thus, data are needed to
complete those transactions and also for dispute resolution proceedings.

Reinsurance companies also require comprehensive data to evaluate
the riskiness of agricultural insurance portfolios, establish reinsurance
premium rates, and service reinsurance contracts. In addition,
government agencies require data to help manage, operate, and evaluate
crop insurance programs. This is true regardless whether products
are offered through the private sector or directly from government
agencies. In all cases, government agencies are likely to be involved in
the regulation and monitoring of crop insurance programs—especially
when they provide premium or administrative subsidies and/or stop-loss
coverages. Government agencies are also often involved in regulatory
actions, audits, and dispute resolution procedures.

2.1        Program Development
The development of agricultural insurance programs often hinges upon
the availability of high-quality data. For example, individual yield or
revenue products cannot be designed without a sufficient amount of
producer-level yield data. In the absence of such data, programs are often
developed around area or group yield principles. In addition, revenue
products require that an unbiased source of price discovery be available so
that product rating can maintain its actuarial soundness.

Substantial quantities of data must also be available for developing
programs affected by correlations among individual agricultural producers
and regions. Consequently, program development is often the result of
data availability.




8       DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
2.1.1. Strategic Planning: Data development, accessibility, and management are critical to the success of
agricultural insurance programs. Hence, it is essential that a strategic management plan regarding data issues
be developed along with the other aspects of agricultural insurance programs. The tendency is to assume that
data issues will resolve themselves if a solid program is ﬁrst developed. However, solid programs cannot be
developed in the absence of strategic data planning.

Strategic data plans must consider the interaction of data management and acquisition with respect to
national agricultural risk management policies and agricultural programs. Agriculture insurance programs
need to coincide with the goals of other government actions. If properly developed, such systems can generate
substantial synergies with national policy in terms of data acquisition, evaluation, and growth.

Finally, strategic data plans should be constructed around stated objectives and should meet various performance
measures. In this way, proper evaluations of such programs can be quantiﬁed with respect to stated goals.

2.1.2. System Governance: Equitable and transparent governance structures are essential for all aspects
of an agricultural insurance program, but they are especially important for data management issues because
of the personal and conﬁdential nature of required data and document information. Governance issues are
directly related to data availability and collection. For example, data governance must consider requirements for
reporting contract details (e.g., legal entities, acreages, etc.), provide details for dispute resolution, and develop
best management practices for information, business, agronomic, and insurance actions.

Governance structures must clearly describe rules and enforcement of contract details such as product eligibility,
crops, perils, design, losses, deadlines, and repercussion for the misrepresentation of each. In each case,
governance structures must clearly offer reasons for the need of such information. Data governance is also
important for underwriting and developing loss adjusting standards.

Governance decisions must also include processes for providing all stakeholders with sufficient information
for optimal decision-making. For example, the data needs of regulatory agencies include information on
crop insurance companies. These data and information needs may be quite different from those of internal
stakeholders and system personnel. External stakeholders and policy makers have different data needs, as do
reinsurance companies.




                                                                                                 MANUAL 3           9
2.1.3. Coordination of Business Functions: Current and accurate data are needed to manage and effectively
coordinate agricultural insurance functions. These functions are a product of the need to communicate with
participants and develop transparent business process reviews.

Strategic directions and rationale, team members, and performance assessments are examples of internal
communications which require the use of business process and governance data and information. External
communication efforts include rapid responses to information requests and educational materials that are
readily available for distribution. Such materials must be kept current and systems need to be established to
monitor version control of all external documents.

Effective communications with customers (producers), media representatives, and government officials require
that tracking systems be developed to respond to requests. Efficient tracking systems ensure that all requests
are answered within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, such systems should monitor return responses to
improve quality.

Other business processes that require data and documentation include monitoring the performance of each
aspect of the agricultural insurance system. For example, loss adjustment activities should be monitored in
terms of claims responses, actions by loss adjusters, and indemnity delivery. Business process review systems
also require substantial data for monitoring standard business activity such as accounts receivable and payable.
In addition, discounts for early payment of receivables may be offered; these details must be carefully monitored.

2.1.4. Financial Reporting and Accountability: Agricultural insurance systems require substantial amounts
of business management data for ﬁnancial reporting and accountability purposes. Such reports are routinely
submitted to government agencies, regulators, managers, and investors.

Regulatory agencies often require the reporting of performance measures relative to goals, portfolio risk,
loss ratios, and information related to ﬁnancial sustainability. Regulatory frameworks should be developed in
conjunction with data management systems to reduce the costs of reporting.

Internal ﬁnancial reports are often needed to assess portfolio risk, cash ﬂow needs to meet indemnity claims,
administrative costs, and overhead. In addition, government agencies frequently request speciﬁc reports
on various insurance activities. Much of the data needed to respond to these requests are contained in ﬁles
generated by insurance providers with respect to the sale of insurance products. It is essential that business
management systems are able to seamlessly access these data to reduce costs and increase response times.

Data are also necessary for effective interactions between private companies that provide insurance,
government agencies that monitor and may also provide insurance, and agribusinesses. Agricultural producers
must be provided with meaningful, understandable data regarding product performance.

Accurate and reliable data often help to obviate competing objectives among agricultural insurance participants.
Producers prefer low premium rates, high coverage levels, and ﬂexible terms for loss adjusting. Insurers and
reinsurers want to be compensated for the risk incurred by offering such programs. Program administrators
often want management ﬂexibility, oversight, and sufficient budgets to perform their roles. Many of the
competing objectives can be met if data are used to illustrate stakeholder issues.

2.2.       Product Design
The primary areas of product design for which data requirements are of the most concern involve underwriting,
rating, and indemniﬁcation. Large quantities of high-quality data are needed when using empirical methods to
develop actuarially sound premium rates and for determining indemniﬁcation policies.

Product design must occur in conjunction with the development of data collection and management systems.
Products cannot be properly serviced if issues related to data quality, quantity, accuracy, and timeliness needed
to meet operational requirements of the program are ignored.
2.2.1. Data Requirements for Empirical Rating: The need for large quantities of high-quality historical
data are most acute for establishing premium rates. Empirical rating processes provide the most actuarially
sound approach to rating and result in lower premium rates compared to other methods. However, empirical
rating processes are highly data intensive. For example, an ideal data set for rating an individual yield insurance
product would consist of more than 100 years of observations for each producer in any given region. Such data
are seldom available, so other procedures are frequently used. For example, shorter periods of data are usually

10      DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
used for empirical rating processes. Premium rates are then increased by
various load factors to reﬂect unknown risks that cannot be determined
because of insufficient data volumes.
2.2.1.1. Combining Data Using Bootstrapping Procedures: In some
cases, regional yield data may be available for a relatively long period
of time while individual farm level data are often not. In these cases,
bootstrapping procedures can be used to combine the shorter term farm-
level data with longer term regional data. Bootstrapping procedures
combine longer term regional variations in yield with variations in
multiple farm yield observations to increase the accuracy of individual
farm yield variance estimates. These adjusted variances are then used for
establishing premium rates.
2.2.2. Data Requirements for Parametric Rating: Parametric rating
procedures are often used when historical data are insufficient to provide
reasonable empirically rated premiums. Historical data may simply not exist
in the quantities needed, or the data may be of poor quality. Poorer quality
data occur when observations include inaccuracies or missing values, are
collected using inconsistent methods, or are affected by policy changes. In
these cases, a variety of statistical distributions may be used to represent
the underlying variation in yields that occur in actual observations. In some
cases, limited historical data may help identify the appropriate statistical
distribution for rating purposes. In other cases, a normal or uniform
distribution may simply be assumed. These two distributions often provide
conservative and liberal endpoints for premium rate ranges. Statistical
distributions are used to establish expected indemnities which are then
combined with liabilities to establish pure risk premium rates. These
procedures, however, often require the addition of substantial premium rate
loading factors to reﬂect uncertainty associated with actual yield outcomes.

2.3.       Program Management
Reliable data that are easily accessible by program managers are
essential for the success of agricultural insurance programs. Program
administrators and managers use data to:
   • Develop strategic plans;
   • Interface with government agencies and private insurance
       companies;
   • Evaluate rating outcomes;
   • Develop and adjust products;
   • Conduct internal audits;
   • Prepare ﬁnancial reports;
   • Evaluate business processes in terms of efficacy and efficiency.
Effective communication among private insurance companies, reinsurers,
government agencies, regulators, and agricultural producers are essential
for the control of such programs. In addition, data are used in day-to-day
operations:
   • To support and record sales;
   • In the application process for products;
   • For underwriting process;
   • For loss adjusting purposes;
   • To support claims processing procedures;
   • For dispute resolution processes.

                                                                                MANUAL 3   11
2.4.      Program Evaluation
Agricultural insurance programs generally have a public-sector component attached to them. Hence, program
evaluation is necessary for deciding whether public goals are being met. In addition, internal evaluation of
programs is an essential part of general business procedures. In both cases, data are needed for research
and to evaluate the efficiency of agricultural insurance programs. In addition, policy makers often need
information regarding the consequences of crop insurance programs on agricultural production, environmental
issues, agribusiness industrial organization, food supplies, and public policy goals. Insurance companies use
performance data to identify areas for product improvements, develop new products, and adjust program goals.

2.5.      Documentation
Data must be accurately recorded and maintained. A good data management system will not only record data,
but also document sources of all observations. Documentation of data and their sources allow for seamless
continuity of programs as they develop, grow, and change. In addition, a variety of documents and their sources
need to be maintained by agricultural insurance data management programs.

2.6.      Public Policy
Public resources are frequently used to support agricultural insurance programs. The rationale for public sector
involvement often centers on maintaining rural communities, reducing the need for disaster relief, stabilizing
food supplies, and supporting farm incomes through risk mitigation. Thus, substantial data resources are
needed to develop and evaluate public policy issues related to agricultural insurance programs.

Data are needed to evaluate whether or not public policy goals are being accomplished. Public accountability
of such programs requires that companies submit themselves to independent third-party audits of products
and business management performance. Producers, taxpayers, regulators, and government officials need to be
assured that public resources are being used effectively.

Public policy accountability may extend beyond a single country. For example, agricultural insurance programs
must be evaluated for compliance with international trade agreements—especially for programs that receive
substantial government subsidies.

Insurance companies must also maintain sufficient data to demonstrate regulatory compliance various public
agencies. Furthermore, these companies must comply with legal rules that govern contractual compliance
issues. That is, data ownership, access, conﬁdentiality, and use must follow legal guidelines.




12      DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
3.0.       Data Needs
The development, execution, and supervision of methods to acquire,
control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and information
assets are important elements of a data management program. Data
management in agricultural insurance programs extends beyond
numbers and includes maintaining producers’ personal information, policy
documents, and business management practices.

A variety of initial data needs are required for the development of
agricultural insurance programs. Although most products require at least
some common data, each product also requires speciﬁc information.

Data are also required for operational needs. For example, data must be
updated annually to improve rating processes and evaluate products and
programs.

3.1.       Initial Data Needs
Agricultural insurance products can be categorized into to two general
types: (1) individual products and (2) proxy products. This taxonomy
is an important element of data requirements. Indemnity payments
for individual products are triggered by individual yields or revenues
related to speciﬁc land parcels. Individual product liabilities are generally
determined by a producer’s actual yield or revenue outcome.

In contrast, proxy products are triggered by variables that are correlated
with individual actual outcomes. Examples of proxy variables include per
acre area yield/revenue, national prices, climate outcomes, and satellite
imagery. Proxy product liabilities are usually determined by regional
historical outcomes. Alternatively, proxy product liability may be based
on individual producer outcomes. Consequently, data requirements are
substantially different depending upon product type and design.

Individual products require farm-level historical data for rating and loss
adjusting. Thus, individual products are data intensive because of the
large number of farm producers, their length of time in agriculture, and
changes in farm structures and size. When acquiring data for individual
products, requests should be kept to a minimum and not be duplicative.
Data series continuity needs to be maintained even if a producer changes
primary insurance providers across years. Data requests need to be
automated and consistent across years. Data accuracy and completeness
are essential elements of individual insurance products.

Proxy products do not generally rely on information about an individual
farm’s speciﬁc performance. Rather, rating and indemnities are based on
outcomes that occur within a region. This greatly reduces the amount
of data that needs to be collected from producers and the amount of
monitoring, data collection, and loss adjusting that needs to be done on
an annual basis. However, the data that are collected need to be well-
documented and transparent in the case of area yield and revenue insurance
products. Because these products are based on regional yields or revenues
rather than farm-level outcomes, producers are likely to question the data
when outcomes on their operations differ from regional outcomes. In
addition, while area-based weather or satellite imagery products do not
require data from individual producers for indemnity calculations, they both
produce voluminous amounts of data that need to be carefully managed
and monitored for aberrations and pipeline interruptions.


                                                                                MANUAL 3   13
Margin insurance products combine some elements of individual and proxy products. Hence, the data needs of
this product are a hybrid of the other two.

Every insurance product, however, will require some common data and documentation. For example, the
complete legal names of producers, mailing addresses, individual identiﬁers, telephone numbers, and e-mail
addresses should be collected when a producer initially purchases an insurance contract. Thereafter, providers
should be notiﬁed by producers if changes in those identiﬁers occur.

All products also require a physical description of farms and areas that are to be insured within those farms.
Sizes and legal descriptions of property are needed as well.

For each insurance policy on each insured area, documentation should include the insurance provider name,
product purchased, policy number, expected outcomes (e.g., yields, revenue, precipitation, etc.), coverage levels
and deductibles, and indemnity triggers. In addition, prices used to calculate indemnities, total liability, premium
rates, total premiums, total premiums paid by a producer, total premium subsidies (if any), and timing of
indemnity payments should be documented.

3.1.1. Individual Insurance Data Needs: The two primary individual insurance products are yield and revenue
based. In terms of yield insurance products, indemnities are paid when per acre actual yields do not meet a
certain value. For revenue products, indemnities are paid when per acre revenues (i.e., yield/acre multiplied by
price/unit) do not meet certain values.

3.1.1.1. Individual Yield Insurance Data: For individual yield insurance products, crop yield histories for
each insured acre by growing season are required. At least four years of data should be included, but ten or
more years are preferred. Consideration must be made for rotational crops or fallow years. If such data are
not available, alternative values need to be established. For some crops, variety and quality outcomes are also
needed. In addition, the per unit price at which yield losses will be indemniﬁed must be clearly known.

Requirements for best management practices need to be documented including planting dates, potential
required fertilizer herbicide and pesticide applications, irrigation activities (if applicable), and other required
practices as needed.

Claims and loss-adjusting actions need to be documented at appropriate times. Descriptions of both covered
and uncovered losses need to be developed as well as amounts and dates of indemnity payments. In addition,
yields for each crop year need to be collected once a producer enters into an insurance contract whether or not a
claim is initiated.

3.1.1.2. Individual Revenue Insurance Data: All of the data required for individual yield insurance products
are also relevant for individual revenue insurance products. In addition, documentation of the prices that will be
used to calculate revenues should be speciﬁed. These prices may differ from those used to calculate indemnities
for yield products. Additional data requirements include expected harvest prices, expected revenue per unit,
revenue coverage levels, and revenue deductibles. In addition, documentation should clearly indicate trigger
revenues and total liabilities.

3.1.2. Proxy Insurance Data Needs: Proxy insurance products are designed to compensate producers for
losses that are not directly measured. A variety of reasons exist for developing such products. In some cases, it
is simply too expensive to measure certain outcomes. For example, forage is consumed by livestock and is not
directly measurable. In addition, the moral hazard associated with some agricultural commodities and regional
situations renders the use of individual insurance products infeasible or the operations costs are prohibitive.

In such cases, proxy insurance products rely on more easily measured outcomes to calculate indemnities. These
proxies are generally related to regional rather than individual measurements. Because losses are not directly
measured, however, the proxy measure used to trigger insurance indemnities may not be perfectly correlated
with individual loss experiences in a given time period.

Several proxy metrics have been developed, including area yield, area revenue, price insurance, weather, and
satellite imagery of vegetative growth. In some cases, yields of crops that are more easily measured and where
yields are highly correlated with a different crop are sometimes used as a proxy. The costs of such products
primarily depend upon existing infrastructure as it relates to gathering proxy measures.



14      DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Proxy insurance alternatives usually require that much less data be obtained from individual farms. However,
total data requirements and management may be quite large as a result of voluminous measurements over time.
In addition, proxy-based products do not require individual farm histories or in-person loss adjustments to settle
claims. However, some monitoring must occur to ensure that crops being insured are actually being produced.
This is especially important if government subsidies are being used to off set premium payments.

3.1.2.1. Area Yield Insurance Data: In addition to data needed for all insurance products, area yield products
also require data regarding the area or regional yield history of the crop being insured. This history should be
as extensive as possible for rating purposes. In addition, actual area or regional yields need to be calculated in
a timely manner following harvests. This can be a difficult task as most regional yield estimates depend upon
producer surveys. Delays in obtaining these data can marginalize the initial reason for purchasing insurance (i.e.,
the timely indemniﬁcation of a loss).

After the growing season or harvest, region yield data that are used to calculate indemnity triggers must be
published. Trigger yields for each level of coverage must be announced. As is the case for all claims, indemnity
payments and dates must be documented.

Area yield products usually rely on third-party data collections. Hence, the methods used to collect these data must
be well-understood. In addition, it is critical that such data are gathered using consistent methods over time.

3.1.2.2. Area Revenue Insurance Data: In addition to data required for area yield insurance, area revenue
insurance requires data on area or regional revenue per unit insured. That is, average commodity prices for a
region must be established in order to calculate expected area revenues and to provide indemnity triggers. The
same third-party data issues that affect the collection of yield data are also relevant for the establishment of
price data used in revenue insurance products.

3.1.2.3. Price Insurance Data: Price insurance is generally a livestock-related (e.g., cattle, sheep, and hogs)
product. Such products are usually based on the number of animals marketed by an individual. However,
expected prices and indemnity triggers are based on national or regional market price outcomes. Consequently,
these products have both individual and group or area components attached to them.




                                                                                                MANUAL 3           15
In addition to data required for all insurance products, additional data needed include:
     • Numbers of livestock to be insured;
     • Physical description of livestock (e.g., quality, expected weight at time of sale);
     • Livestock price when insurance is purchased;
     • Expected livestock price at date of sale;
     • Actual livestock price at date of sale;
     • Price coverage level/deductible selection farmer;
     • Premium rate;
     • Premium subsidy (if any);
     • Indemnity amounts (if relevant).
3.1.2.4. Weather Index Product Data: Weather index products may address single or multiple metrics. Single-
weather products may have “all or nothing” indemnity payments and may be based on rainfall indices, temperature
(heat or cold), or transpiration (a combination of rainfall and heat). That is, if a measured value is below a trigger
value, then indemnities are paid in their entirety. Data required for such products are typically temperature
measurements at speciﬁc times within a region or close proximity to the insured property. Weather stations often
provide these data.

Dual-trigger single-weather index products may provide prorated indemnities depending upon outcomes that
occur between two different triggers. For example, a dual trigger of high and low rainfall could be used to
calculate an indemnity that could be prorated depending upon the closeness of the observation to the high or
low trigger levels.

Multiple-weather index products can be developed to insure against both temperature and precipitation
outcomes with single or dual triggers. These could be “all or nothing” products or they may provide prorated
indemnities. Once again, data are usually obtained from weather stations.

These products require particular attention to timing issues related to weather measurements. That is,
temperature and precipitation triggers may be established based upon available reporting measurements within
the context of a single point in time, over a single day, throughout growing seasons, or on an annual basis.

3.1.2.5. Satellite Imagery Data: Satellite imagery is generally used for measuring vegetative growth. This
proxy insurance product is based on correlations between vegetative measurements and yield outcomes. The
use of satellite imagery involves substantial costs and generates huge amounts of data that must be carefully
managed. In addition, satellite imagery can be interrupted for extended periods of time and inﬂuenced by cloud
cover and other atmospheric phenomena. Furthermore satellite imagery data must be calibrated to accurately
reﬂect crop yield losses.

3.1.3. Margin Insurance Data Needs: Similar to price insurance, margin insurance can have individual and
group elements included in terms of data requirements. However, because margin insurance is designed to
mitigate the risk that differences between livestock revenues and livestock production costs may narrow, a
variety of additional data are needed, including:
     • Historical average input requirements;
     • Expected input prices;
     • Estimated input expenditures during the current growing season;
     • Selected margin coverage level/deductible.




16       DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
3.2.      Operational Data Needs
The operational aspects of agricultural insurance programs require accurate and timely data to perform business
functions and provide information for the evaluation of business effectiveness. Program management and
transparency are greatly enhanced by appropriate business management information systems.

3.2.1. Functional Needs: The operational functions of agricultural insurance programs include sales and
application processes, underwriting, ﬁeld audits and loss adjustments, claims processing, and dispute resolution.

Sales and application processes require a structure for recording sales, contract responsibilities, producer
information, insured crops, and product details. Operational management requires that such information be
readily accessible by managers.

Underwriting activities are highly data dependent. Data and information regarding agronomic practices,
contractual obligations, and production histories are critical for appropriate underwriting. In addition,
underwriting activities meet speciﬁc data processing premium rates, coverage levels, and indemnity triggers.
Many aspects of underwriting are regionally speciﬁc. Hence, information and data are often needed throughout
a region where coverage is being offered.

Field audits and loss adjusting represent substantial functions of business operations in agricultural insurance
systems. Loss claims need to be quickly recorded and addressed by loss adjusters. Field audits are needed to
ensure that crops are planted and best management agronomic practices are followed need to be carefully
organized and monitored. In addition, loss adjusters must verify losses and their causes. This operational
process requires access to data and information related to speciﬁc insurance contracts and accurate land
descriptions.

After losses and their causes have been veriﬁed, claims processing becomes the most visible aspect of
agricultural insurance systems from the perspective of a producer. Indemnity payments must be consistent and
transparent with respect to contracts that have been sold. Producers need to understand the reasons for and
size of indemnity payments, as well as the timing of those payments. This operational aspect is likely to be the
most important element for establishing trust in agricultural insurance programs.




                                                                                               MANUAL 3            17
Finally, the business operations of agricultural insurance programs must
provide a clear and transparent process for dispute resolution. Disputes
often occur over ambiguous underwriting rules and inconsistent or
inaccurate data and information management. Data systems must be
developed to minimize discrepancies and errors created during sales and
loss adjustment processes. Random secondary ﬁeld audits should be
included as a standard management practice. Producers should have
clear and concise instructions for appealing decisions, and underwriting
rules should clearly identify a formal review process. Resolution
outcomes should be communicated quickly and completely between both
parties in a dispute.

3.2.2. Informational Needs: A variety of information needs to be
collected and managed for the effective operational control of agricultural
insurance programs. Informational needs include the identiﬁcation of
best management practices regarding various agronomic activities,
legal contractual obligations, and underwriting procedures. Personal
information regarding the identiﬁcation of agricultural producers and land
parcels are critical informational needs. The ability to link or combine
data sets seamlessly is an important aspect of data management.

In addition, the storage, backup, and movement of information must
be part of operational planning processes. Forms and applications may
be stored in paper or electronic formats (or both). The identiﬁcation of
producers must be clearly established and the legality of signatures and
ownership claims must be veriﬁed.

3.3.       Reinsurance Data Requirements
Reinsurance is the process of transferring risk to another entity. Most
agricultural insurance programs need to have at least part of their book of
business reinsured by other companies because most private agricultural
insurance issuers lack the ﬁnancial resources to accept the risk of crop
insurance liabilities. In addition, agricultural insurance products do not
represent sufficient diversiﬁcation opportunities to reduce risk exposure.
Weather-related events often affect broad regions and are not usually
speciﬁc to certain crops. Hence, indemnities are often highly correlated
across regions.

Other types of insurance (e.g., casualty, life, health) have risks that are
not highly correlated with agricultural insurance. Reinsurance companies
build risk portfolios that have low correlations among adverse outcomes
across products, regions, and time. Thus, companies with such portfolios
can often add agricultural insurance risks without greatly increasing their
overall risk exposure.

Agricultural insurance providers will likely need to develop reinsurance
submissions to cede risk to more diversiﬁed and larger companies. Data are
needed to quantify the amount of risk and the quality of the program so that
reinsurers are willing to accept this risk. The quality of data and program
control can result in faster acceptance and lower costs for ceding risk.

3.3.1.   Reinsurance Submission

Reinsurance submission processes are highly conﬁdential and speciﬁc to
each reinsurer. The goal of a reinsurer is to keep the costs of acquiring
risk low while charging rates that compensate them for these costs and
added risk acceptance.



18       DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
In general, reinsurance submissions contain descriptions of each product along with competitive issues,
usefulness, and viability. The market size, needs, uses, and design of each product are usually detailed as well.

In terms of data needs, the bulk of reinsurance submissions will present actuarial documentation, product
administration, underwriting, and loss adjustment information. Each of these factors is critically related to
accurate and comprehensive data collection and security.

3.3.1.1 Actuarial Documentation: This component of a reinsurance submission consists of descriptions and
documentation of data, rating methods, assumptions, and often a rating example. A major component of
this section involves a discussion of data used for rating, including a description of methods used to establish
premium rates.

Actuarial documentation often involves a discussion of risks associated with both rates and premiums. Once
again, this is a product of historical data. Historical data are generally used to simulate a book of business based
upon actual or simulated loss histories. The efficacy of this particular section is greatly enhanced by accurate
data descriptions and documentation.

3.3.1.2. Product Administration: Product administration is also highly data intensive. Not only would this
section of a reinsurance submission include issues related to data management, but also to record keeping,
conﬁdentiality, and accounting systems. The timing of sales, processing, and indemnity payments would also be
included in this section. Performance reviews of personnel who monitor and manage this product also involve
proper documentation and data management.

Financial documents—including income statements, balance sheets, and cash ﬂow statements of the primary
insurer—would be included in this section and also require accurate data management. To a great extent, the
competency of ﬁrms involved in agriculture insurance sales is reﬂected in the accuracy and completeness of
product administration.

3.3.1.3. Underwriting: A reinsurance submission would include a section that describes underwriting
processes. Speciﬁcally, the policy provisions of each product would be outlined in this section. Such provisions
include issues related to required best management practices by those purchasing insurance products, a
schedule of deadlines including sign-up and premium dates, and other important events such as rules for early
and late planting dates and harvest windows. Any legal or policy issues that currently exist with respect to
products should also be documented in this section.

3.3.1.4. Loss Adjustment: The purpose of loss adjusting is to assess claims (i.e., monitoring, ﬁeld management,
gathering and verifying data, involvement in the underwriting process, and producer education). Procedures
and personnel used for loss adjusting are important components to a reinsurance submission. For example,
loss adjusters may be provided by government entities or by insurance companies. Alternatively, loss adjusters
may be certiﬁed independent contractors. Loss adjustment procedures and documentation need to be clearly
identiﬁed. Continued education of loss adjusters needs to be speciﬁed. In addition, compliance issues with other
government programs may be a component of loss adjustment processes and procedures for validating loss
adjustment decisions and must be clearly identiﬁed.

3.3.2.   Data Reporting and Auditing Requirements

Reinsurance agreements specify various data reporting and auditing requirements. These requirements ensure
accurate payment of reinsurance premiums and reinsurance indemnity obligations. In many cases, a reinsurer’s
gross liability may be limited by reinsurance agreements.

Reinsurance agreements also stipulate liability and indemnity reporting schedules. For example, the expected
total liability prior to the reinsurance attachment is usually speciﬁed. In addition, total liabilities incurred as
a result of product sales need to be reported immediately after sales closing dates. If preliminary indemnity
payments are due, forecasts for ending indemnity payments should also be made. Regular crop and growing
condition reports and indemnity forecasts need to be made throughout growing seasons. The ﬁ nal report
should be received shortly after harvest and prior to the reinsurance payment notiﬁcation.

Data and business systems need to be developed that allow for reinsurers to audit transactions, verify liabilities,
and provide indemnity payments. In most cases, reinsurers prefer the opportunity to monitor these accounts
online and in real-time. However, these requirements vary by reinsurer and by government regulators.


                                                                                                 MANUAL 3             19
4.0.       Data Sources
Data used in designing, operating, and maintaining agricultural insurance
programs are obtained from three sources: (1) individual farms, (2)
agricultural insurance systems, and (3) third parties. Each of these
sources provides unique value and complications.

Accuracy, conﬁdentiality, and consistency are critical components for
data collection. Data must be carefully evaluated and cross-checked
with related observations to ensure accuracy. Conﬁdentiality of farm-
level data must be assured. In addition, the data collection methods
and activities of third-party sources must be understood by those who
depend on that data for rating and underwriting.

Another critical element involves transparency. Although conﬁdentiality
must be maintained for individual producers, summary data must be
reported so that participants and other stakeholders are conﬁdent
that insurance decisions are based on data outcomes. Furthermore,
data management systems must be able to document changes in farm
ownership, production practices, new producers, and land use.

Program integrity is also important. The accuracy and consistency of
data collection is paramount for the integrity and viability of agricultural
insurance programs. Both factors affect the amount of trust that
stakeholders have in such programs. Data must be gathered and reported
in a timely manner. The accuracy of data must be carefully evaluated,
and data adjustments or procedural changes must be transparent and
credible. Data revisions must always be considered within the context
of their inﬂuence on indemnity payments and rating. This is especially
relevant for area yield and revenue insurance products for which data
revisions frequently occur. The purpose for those revisions must be clear
and their impacts on proposed or actual indemnities must be evaluated.

Finally, the storage format (i.e., paper or electronic) along with the length
of time that information should be stored need to be carefully considered
when establishing agricultural insurance programs.

4.1.       Farm Data
Farm-level data provide important information for crop insurance
programs but are also hampered by accuracy, continuity, and short time
periods. Farm-level data are needed to develop individual insurance
products and for rating purposes. These data are equally necessary for
updating and evaluating actuarial soundness over time. Necessary farm-
level data include producer identiﬁcation and product choices, liability
determination, management practices, annual production, and claim
initiation.

4.1.1. Producer Descriptions and Insurance Choices: Information
must be obtained regarding a producer’s or entity’s name, identiﬁcation
number, correspondence address, and age. Other documentation may
be needed to establish compliance with environmental regulations and
participation in other government agricultural programs. Total acreages
of each crop are also needed if a producer is required to insure all acreages
within a speciﬁc program.

In addition, descriptions of insurance products selected for each covered
crop, coverage and deductible selections, co-payment selection, and other
special provisions must be recorded.


20      DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
4.1.2. Liability Determination: It is necessary to obtain information regarding the total liability associated
with each contract that a producer has purchased. Total liability can only be determined if the following factors
are identiﬁed:
   • A description of each area planted to each crop;
   • Historical yield data for each speciﬁc area and for each crop for all growing seasons.   Such data should
      include yields for consecutive years for annually planted crops. For rotational crops, yields are needed for
      consecutive growing seasons. And, in cases that involve more than one crop within a growing season,
      yield data for consecutive growing seasons are also needed;
   • Whole farm historical income and input expenditure data if whole farm income of margin products are
      being offered;
   • Management practices implemented on the farm including timing of ﬁeld activities.
4.1.3. Best Management Practices: A variety of management practices must be documented as part of data
collection activities. For example, documentation is needed for:
   • Irrigation practices, including evidence that appropriate irrigation timing and application occurred;
   • Planting dates, which may include documentation that a crop was not planted too early during a growing
      season (which could cause frost damage) nor too late (which could result in too few days for crop maturity);
   • Completion data for required practices such as fertilizer and herbicide applications, when this is a required
      production practice;
   • Crop harvest date.
4.1.4. Claim Initiation: For an agricultural insurance program to remain viable, producers must report yields for
each growing season regardless of whether they initiate a claim for loss. This practice is necessary so that a
producer’s yield history can be updated. If an indemnity claim is initiated, then producers must report yields at that
time; these need to be veriﬁed during the loss adjustment process. If an indemnity claim is not initiated, yields can
either be reported after harvest by a producer or when the next insurance contract is signed. However, producers
must be able to document yields, and processes need to be developed to verify that documentation.

It is also important to have a system that cross-checks reported yields with other unbiased information. For
example, some agricultural insurance programs spot check yields from a sample of farms whether or not
indemnity claims have been initiated. Loss adjusters then visit those farms during harvest seasons to assess
actual yields. Reported yields are then compared to those assessed by the loss adjuster. These approaches help
provide incentives for accurate reporting.




                                                                                                  MANUAL 3           21
4.2.         Agricultural Insurance System Data
A variety of data need to be recorded and developed within agricultural insurance systems, including:
     • Eligibility requirements to determine whether or not a farmer is eligible to purchase a product. These
         eligibility requirements are deﬁned by the insurance provider and/or the regulatory agency that oversees
         the provision of insurance;
     • Premiums and coverage options established by the insurance company and/or the government agency
         that develops the product;
     • Field monitoring and annual production data veriﬁcation provided by the crop insurance system through
         the use of loss adjusters and crop inspectors;
     • Indemniﬁcation amounts and premium co-charges or discounts, which need to be clearly described by
         insurance providers;
     • Uninsured causes of loss.      Such information can be provided by loss adjusters and crop inspectors and
         are critical for accurately updating yield histories or determining whether changes in program or product
         design are needed.

4.3.         Third-Party Data
Third-party data are particularly necessary for evaluating crop values and, in cases of margin or proxy insurance
products, identifying input costs or quantities. That is, the costs of compensating a yield loss by replacing
the physical commodity are prohibitive. Rather, yield losses are more effi ciently “replaced” using monetary
equivalents. However, moral hazard issues related to individual crop pricing are too severe for the development
of affordable crop insurance products. Hence, yield losses need to be valued through the use of price data
that cannot be altered by any individual, but which reﬂect reasonable values across each product and region.
Therefore, third-party data are frequently used to establish commodity and input prices.

In many cases, third-party data are not always available for a given region or country. In these cases, data are
often obtained from other countries. However, this practice introduces exchange rate variability into indemnity
calculations. Furthermore, substantial basis risk exists between countries, and such risk can be quite variable
throughout any given year.

Third-party data are often obtained from satellites and weather stations. Observations regarding rainfall,
temperature, and vegetative growth are often used as proxies for yields. However, the value of these
observations not only depends on their correlations with actual yields, but also on an uninterrupted pipeline
of data. Satellites and weather stations may experience mechanical or electronic failures. This can inhibit
data updating and completeness. In addition, these interruptions can result in delayed indemnity calculations
and payments. Finally, relying on single-source third parties for critical data is risky, as catastrophic failures of
programs can occur if public policy changes or corruption within the management of those sources restricts
data access.

4.3.1.    Commodity Prices: A variety of third-party sources exist for determining commodity prices, including:
     • National Government Sources (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, National Statistical Service, Census Bureau,
         Bureau of Economic Analysis, Customs and Excise Office, Internal Revenue Service, etc.);
     • Commodity Market Exchanges (e.g., Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
         Minneapolis Grain Exchange, Kansas City Board of Trade, SAFEX, Africa Mercantile Exchange, Brazilian
         Mercantile and Futures Exchange, NYSE Liffe, Australian Securities Exchange, Tokyo Grain Exchange);
     • Local market surveys;
     • Farm organizations.
However, prices must be relevant or highly correlated with insured product prices. For example, the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange provides futures market data for 13.5% protein spring wheat. However, many other wheat
classes are produced, and prices for those need to be assessed. In addition, futures market prices for any given
month change minute-to-minute, and monthly contracts expire throughout a year. Additionally, futures
markets prices for the delivery of a commodity at harvest can vary greatly between the time in which an
agricultural insurance contract is signed and harvest actually occurs. Consequently, it is important to establish
the precise methods that are to be followed when using third-party data.

22        DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
4.3.2. Input Prices: Margin products require information about the price of inputs such as energy, fertilizer,
machinery and equipment, feed, hired labor, contract services, etc. Not only are these prices highly variable
across years, regions, and input quality, but a consistent source of these prices are often difficult to obtain.
Depending upon the input price of interest, sources include:
   • National governments (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, National Statistical Service, Census Bureau of
      Economic Analysis, Customs and Excise Office, Department of Labor, etc.);
   • Commodity Market Exchanges (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange, Africa Mercantile Exchange, APX-
      ENDEX, European Energy Exchange, Australian Securities Exchange);
   • Local market surveys.
4.3.3. Proxy Index Data: Proxy index products do not measure yield losses directly. Rather, indemnities are
triggered when certain proxies for yield do not meet speciﬁc targets. For example, proxy index products may
insure against precipitation, temperature, and remote-sensed vegetative growth outcomes that either exceed or
do not meet certain levels.

Such measurements are often obtained from weather stations or satellite imagery. Nonetheless, problems
exist when using such data. That is, weather station data may not be consistently reported or may be subject
to interruption. In addition, the correlation of these data with actual micro-climate outcomes can vary over
time. Finally, a number of problems can occur with the use of satellite imagery, including cloud cover and other
atmospheric conditions that can inﬂuence the accuracy of measurements.

Satellite hardware and digital signals are subject to depreciation and degradation. In addition, satellites have
ﬁnite lengths of service and plans may not exist for physical replacement or software updating. Furthermore,
satellite readings must be initially mapped with actual yields. These mappings may need change over time
because of variances in mechanical functions and satellite orbits. Calibration and orbital variations can inﬂuence
the consistency and usefulness of satellite-sourced data. Hence, data systems based on these third-party
providers need to accommodate these variations. Finally, the pipeline must also be dependable so that transfer
is not interrupted by mechanical, political or corruption transfer issues.

Weather data may be obtained from the Global Summary of Day (GSOD) system or the Global History Climate
Network – Daily (GHCND) program. GSOD data are free of charge to non-commercial users and are derived
from global integrated surface data. Information from over 9,000 weather stations is currently available. Some
of these stations have been reporting data since 1929. These stations include many airport and city locations
worldwide. Various daily summary observations such as temperature, dew point, wind speed, air pressure,
visibility, and precipitation are gathered by the GDOD system. The data are updated daily within one to two
days after the date of observation.

The GHCND database provides historical daily weather data over global land areas. It reports a composite of
climate records from numerous sources that are merged before being subjected to quality assurance reviews.
Data archives include daily maximum temperatures, daily minimum temperatures, temperature at time of
observation, precipitation (rainfall and snow water equivalents), snowfall, and snow depth. Some GHCND
data are exchanged under the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Weather Watch Program as
stipulated by WMO Resolution 40. WMO member countries can restrict the use of that data for commercial
purposes outside of the receiving country.

Historical weather data often contain unrealistic observations, missing observations, and other errors. This
requires that weather data be carefully screened before being used for rating and underwriting purposes. Missing
observations must be appropriately adjusted and unrealistic outliers must be altered to avoid rating errors.

Weather datasets contain huge numbers of observations. For example, if ﬁfty years of daily data are available,
then 18,000 observations for each measured variable are available for an individual weather site. Consequently,
automated computer processes must manage, update, and process these large numbers of observations.

5.0.            Data and Information Files
In addition to accessing large quantities of high-quality data for rating
and indemniﬁcation purposes, successful agricultural insurance programs
must manage information on individual producers. Management
information systems must not only be developed to record yield
information efficiently, but a plethora of documentation is also necessary
for veriﬁcation and administrative purposes. Although a variety of
methods can be used, it is instructive to consider the details of a speciﬁc
example to illustrate the scope and scale of documentation needs.
Management information systems must be designed to account for
operational realities, provide for the needs of the crop insurance system
and be consistent with product design and underwriting.

5.1.           An Example from the United States
The U.S. agricultural insurance program uses multiple data collection
processes. Insurance issuing agencies construct a data ﬁle and transmit
it to government agencies at speciﬁed time periods. Depending upon
participation, multiple ﬁles may be constructed for an individual producer.
These ﬁles are conﬁdential and submitted for each year that insurance
is purchased. Given the scale of the endeavor, it is important that
management information systems are thoroughly evaluated so that data
are organized efficiently from the beginning of the program.

There are nine primary and several other minor data ﬁles used by the U.S.
system. In total, each contract contains 435 potential primary data ﬁeld
although some ﬁelds are duplicative. Table 5.1 presents the nine ﬁle types
used in the United States and the accompanying number of data ﬁelds for
each. The table also indexes the ﬁle name attached to each type and a
brief description of the ﬁle type contents.

Most of these ﬁle types are used for administrative, rating, or actuarial
purposes, and do not change within a given year for speciﬁc products.
However, a recording of this documentation is essential for avoiding and
resolving disputes. The most relevant ﬁle type for this manual is ﬁle
type 10. An example of ﬁle type 10 is presented in Table 5.2. File type 10
contains forty-six ﬁelds, some of which are simply blanks to maintain ﬁle
integrity. A total of thirty-eight ﬁelds contain usable data.

24            DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
The following provides a description of each ﬁeld:
   • Field 1: Record Type. This ﬁeld must be completed with a “10” for this File Type.
   • Field 2: Approved Insurance Provider. A two-digit code number that represents the name of the insurance
      provider.
   • Field 3: Location State. A two-digit code for each of the ﬁfty U.S. states.
   • Field 4: Policy Issuing Company. In some cases, an approved insurance provider will subcontract with
      another company for the purposes of issuing policies. This ﬁeld allows that information to be recorded.
   • Field 5: Policy Number.
                           A 7-digit policy number must be assigned for each separate policy. Hence, a single
      producer may have several policy numbers and, therefore, several Type 10 ﬁles for any given year.
   • Field 6: Crop Year. Crop years usually coincide with the year that an insurance contract is issued.
                                                                                                       The
      exception occurs with winter crops in which a crop is planted in one year, but not harvested until the
      following year.
   • Field 7: Type 10 Key Reserve. Field 7 is currently reserved for future use.
   • Field 8: Record Number. A value of “001” is entered when an individual has a “substantial business interest”
      in the crop, deﬁne as at least 10% business interest in the crop. If a 1/3-2/3 landlord/tenant crop share
      lease were involved, then the producer would have 66% business interest in the crop. In these cases,
      landlords and tenants would have separate File Type 10s.
   • Field 9: Branch Office.
                           Many agricultural insurance companies have branch offices. This ﬁeld indicates the
      branch location where the policy was sold.
   • Field 10: ID Type.This ﬁeld indicates the type of personal identiﬁcation number being used the purchaser.
      In the United States, this number is usually a social security number, but other identiﬁcation numbers may
      also be used.
   • Field 11: ID Number.   This ﬁeld is populated with an identiﬁcation number for the person purchasing the
      contract.
   • Field 12: Entity Type. Indicates the type of ownership that exists on the property for which the contract is
      being purchased. Examples in include “corporation,” C, and “individual,” I.
   • Field 13: Producer Last Name. The purchaser’s last name.
   • Field 14: Producer’s First Name. The purchaser’s ﬁrst name.
   • Field 15: Producer’s Middle Name. The purchaser’s middle name.
   • Field 16: Producer Name Suffix. The purchaser’s suffix (if any).
   • Field 17: Producer Title. The purchaser’s title (if any).
   • Field 18: Business Name. The purchaser’s business name (if different from the purchaser’s name).
   • Field 19: Address Line 1. The purchaser’s primary address.

     • Field 20: Address Line 2. Additional address information (if any).
     • Field 21: City. The purchaser’s city address.
     • Field 22: State. The purchaser’s State address.
     • Field 23: Zip Code. The purchaser’s ZIP code.
     • Field 24: Zip Extension. The purchaser’s ZIP code extension.
     • Field 25: Phone Number. The purchaser’s phone number.
     • Field 27: Ineligible SBI Flag. If a “Y” is entered in this ﬁeld, then the applicant is not eligible to purchase a
       policy. A person may be ineligible because of previous insurance fraud convictions.
     • Field 28: Filler. Must be blank .
     • Field 29: Ineligible SBI Share. Percentage ineligible if “Y” is entered in Field 27.
     • Field 30: USDA Common Customer ID. Reserved for internal uses related to eligibility.
     • Field 31: Uninsurable SBI Flag. Used in cases where a valid ID number has not been provided.
     • Field 32: Filler. Must be blank.
     • Field 33: Successor-In-Interest. Indicates the successor of interest to whom the check for indemnity
       payment will be sent if a purchaser dies during the year.
     • Field 34.   Previous Policy Number. Used for cases in which a Sucessor-In-Interest was relevant in previous
       years.
     • Field 35. Filler. Must be blank.
     • Field 36. SSN Validation Flag. Used for internal social security number editing.
     • Field 37. Measurement Service Flag. An indicator of whether or not the acreage was actually measured or
       whether a producer’s estimate of acreage is being used.
     • Field 38. Filler. Must be blank.
     • Field 39. FCIC Control Time. Internal use.
     • Field 40. FCIC Control Date. Internal use.
     • Field 41. Reinsurance Year. Internal use.
     • Field 42. Batch Number. Internal use.
     • Field 43. Transaction Sequence. Internal use.
     • Field 44. Transaction Rejected Flag. Internal use.
     • Field 45. Transaction Source Flag. Internal use.
     • Field 46. Filler. Must be blank.
Type 10 ﬁles document and identify the purchaser of a speciﬁc contract. The Type 11 ﬁle records acreage
information, including identifying land parcels. The Type 12 ﬁle documents premium payments, while Type 15
ﬁles record yield histories. Type 20 ﬁles document losses and indemnity payments and Type 21 ﬁles document
losses and their causes. Type 25 ﬁles are used for settling disputes, and type 55 and 56 ﬁles provide data on the
issuing insurance agent and loss adjuster, respectively. The documentation regarding these ﬁles can be found at:
http://www.rma.usda.gov/data/m13/.

The above discussion and examples illustrate several points. First, all crop insurance programs must manage
a plethora of data and documentation. Second, a great deal of planning is needed to operationalize such
programs. Third, successful crop insurance programs grow and change. Data management systems must
adapt to change. Fourth, the U.S. system is relatively clumsy as a result of growth and technological change
since program initiation. When the system was ﬁrst launched, computer usage was in its infancy and most
recordkeeping involved paper copies. As data needs grew and technology changed, the system had to adapt to
the use of electronic databases. Better systems can be developed using current technology, but ﬂexibility must
be built into such systems.

28        DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
6.0.       Quality Control
Agricultural insurance programs are heavily dependent upon large
quantities of accurate data and information. However, much of the
required data is likely to contain a variety of errors. Therefore, quality
control processes in terms of data input and security must be developed
to minimize data errors. The goal of quality control procedures is to
ensure that products, services, or processes meet speciﬁed requirements
and are dependable, satisfactory, transparent, and ﬁscally sound.

A variety of data management concerns are associated with quality
control issues in agricultural insurance programs. Automated error
notiﬁcations during data entry provide one example. In addition, issues
related to data transfer, missing data, outliers or aberrations, and
procedures for updating and revising data must be considered when
establishing management information systems.

Finally, it should be noted that incorrect observations often have worse
impacts on the success of a product than having no observations. Thus,
quality control processes must be able to identify errors. All data should
be scrutinized and aberrant or missing data should be identiﬁed. In many
cases, data quality issues can be addressed in appropriate ways that
maintain the usefulness of information for insurance programs. However,
the failure to recognize these problems can result in poor underwriting and
premium rates as well as inconsistent communication with stakeholders.

6.1.      Data Management Concerns
Management information systems must be developed to automatically
incorporate quality controls and also allow for human checks on data
issues. Automated processes can, for example, alert data personnel to
entries that are outside of reasonable ranges. Frequent presentation
of data in graphical or tabular form can also identify outliers and
aberrations. Graphical and statistical processes can also be used to
identify data that are trending over time and/or whether variations in
observations are increasing or decreasing over time.

Processes must be developed for the secure, safe, and accurate
transmission of data among authorized stakeholders. In addition,
appropriate and clear version controls must be instituted so that incorrect
additions to data ﬁles can be removed easily. Software and hardware
updates must be scheduled so that operations are not interrupted and
that data integrity is maintained. Furthermore, systems need to be
developed so that they are not dependent on a speciﬁc person as all
businesses must be prepared for human resource turnover.

Procedures must be developed for the automated updating of a variety
of data and to accommodate periodic revisions of third-party data.
Furthermore, methodological changes in third-party data collection
procedures must be monitored and their potential impacts on product
design and performance must be evaluated.

The effects of technological change on yields must be continually
considered. Technological change occurs through the development
of new genetic varieties, new machinery, and advanced production
practices. The impacts of climate change, government regulations, trade
agreements, and land use has important implications for agricultural
insurance programs as well. Additionally, changing relative input prices
can affect yields and yield variability.

                                                                              MANUAL 3   29
6.2.       Data Transfer
Data sharing is fundamental to agricultural insurance programs because of the wide variety of stakeholders
involved in these programs. However, not every stakeholder needs access to all data and information. Hence,
security and conﬁdentiality are important features of data transfer operations.

Data and information transfers occur between:
     • Farmers and insurance providers;
     • Insurance providers and regulatory or government agencies;
     • Organizational units within insurance companies;
     • Insurance companies and reinsurers.
The mechanisms for such transfers are varied and include:
     • Physical transfers through mail or courier;
     • Protected or unprotected transfers of digital data through physical devices;
     • Electronic transfers of digital data through encrypted or unencrypted processes;
     • Telephone and fax technologies;
     • Local intranets.
In addition, consideration must be given to which stakeholders have “read only” rights to data versus the ability
to change data ﬁles.

6.3.       Missing Data
The nature of crop insurance data often results in missing observations. Missing observations occur because
producers may have lost or not documented yields in a given year, weather stations may have failed to record
information for several days, or third-party price reporting may not have occurred consistently.

Within modern electronic databases, such missing data generally should not be coded with an entry of “0”.
For example, a yield observation may be missing, but yields were not actually zero. Conversely, it is certainly
possible that a zero is legitimate entry for a yield observation. In addition, the systematic occurrence of missing
data may be a signal that stakeholders are attempting to hide important information. Consequently, procedures
must be developed to account for missing observations. In some cases, missing observations are simply ignored.
In others, a value is entered for the missing entry. This value could be obtained through interpolation of
surrounding data, or it may an average of other observations which were in a similar region at a similar time.




30       DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
6.4.       Outliers
Data outliers (aberrations) occur for a number of reasons in crop insurance data, including entry errors, mistakes,
miscommunication, and poor measurement procedures. Depending upon the volume of data, graphs can often
reveal outliers. When data volume is large, descriptive statistics can be used to identify outliers. In addition,
consideration of intertemporal variability and comparisons to related data series can be used to identify aberrations.

Procedures must be developed to account for outliers. In some cases, coding outliers as “missing” may be a
reasonable approach. In other cases, nearby observations, correlations with related variables, alternative data
sources, or interpolation can be used to replace outliers with reasonable values.

6.5.       Trending Data
Technological or other structural changes are often embedded in agricultural data. Such changes are often
manifested as linear or non-linear trends. In addition, short term changes in government agricultural or trade
policy can cause short term changes in the levels of agricultural prices or, occasionally, yields. Trends can be
identiﬁed either through graphing or statistical procedures.

Trends should be accounted for when setting premium rates. If trends are ignored, then premium rates are
likely to be set too high and/or coverage levels will be less than expected. In addition, trend recognition can help
identify changing variability of yields or prices.

6.6.       Updating and Data Revisions
Data and information required by agricultural insurance programs need to be continually updated as new
information becomes available. Updating information is not only necessary for operational efficiencies, but also
for evaluating the efficacy of programs and for underwriting revisions. Hence, systems must be developed to
allow for data to be updated seamlessly and accurately.

Agricultural insurance programs often use substantial amounts of third-party data. Third-party data may be
in the form of regional yield or price information, weather observations, or satellite imagery. In addition to
updating data as it becomes available, third-party data are frequently subject to revisions. Methodologies must
be established to incorporate data revisions obtained from third-party interests. The impacts of data revisions
on rating, underwriting, and product servicing need to be carefully considered.

7.0.        Data Access and Security
A critical element of successful agricultural insurance programs relates
to data access, security, and conﬁdentiality. Initially, these issues are
related to public policy decisions regarding access. That is, in addition
to insurance providers, reinsurance companies, product designers, and
program evaluators need access to some, but perhaps not all, system
data. However, each of these groups has different needs and, in many
cases, should be blocked from certain conﬁdential information that is not
necessary for their purposes.

In terms of implementation, computer hardware and software decisions
must facilitate appropriate access by different groups. In addition, the
selection of hardware and software systems must consider costs, ease of
use, quality control, expansion, and updating actions. Finally, information
backup and security must be assured in such programs.

7.1.       Information Security
Information security refers to the protection of information and
information systems from unauthorized use, access, disclosure,
disruption, modiﬁcation, or destruction. These issues cross the areas of
conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

7.1.1. Conﬁdentiality: Protecting information conﬁdentiality is
a standard business practice. The lack of such protection causes
businesses and strategies to fail if customers lose trust and conﬁdence
in business accountability. In addition, conﬁdentiality is an ethical and
legal requirement in many regions of the world. The privacy of such
information is a fundamental right and requirement in many societies.

Information security must, therefore, protect the privacy of individuals.
Maintaining conﬁdentiality necessarily requires preventing disclosure
of information to unauthorized individuals or systems. In addition, the
privacy of personal information must be maintained.

7.1.2. Integrity: Another aspect of such systems is that they must
ensure that data cannot be corrupted by others. Information systems
need to be designed to ensure that data integrity is maintained. Data
integrity can be breeched in two ways: (1) the theft of data and (2) the
corruption of data.

Data integrity requires that systems be developed to keep data from
being modiﬁed without authorization. Data integrity can be violated in a
number of ways:
     • An employee may accidentally delete important data ﬁles;
     • Computer viruses can infect computer programs;
     • An unauthorized user can vandalize a web site by corrupting or
       deleting important ﬁles.

7.1.3. Availability: Management information systems must make
information available to those who need it in a timely manner. In some
cases, individuals need access to only a limited amount of the complete
data set. In addition, it is sometimes sufficient for users to simply view
data rather than modify it. In other cases, individuals should be allowed
to view only limited amounts of data.




32       DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Finally, data must be available on demand. That is, computing systems must be maintained and security
systems established so that appropriate access is available at all times. Systems must not only function correctly
but also be protected from disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades.
7.1.4. Authenticity: As the electronic sale of agricultural insurance products becomes more common, it is
essential that purchases, requests, and access are deemed to be genuine rather than forged or the result of
unauthorized impersonations. Hence, systems must be designed to ensure the authenticity of participants.
7.1.5. Non-Repudiation: Non-repudiation refers to ensuring that policy purchasers and insurance companies
fulﬁll their contractual obligations. This requires that each party be unable to deny receiving or ordering a
transaction. Hence, most electronic commerce uses digital signatures and encryption processes to establish
authenticity and minimize non-repudiation.

7.2.      Access, Control, and Transparency
Access to protected information must be restricted only to those who are authorized to view or download
selected data. Mechanisms must be established to control the access to protected information. The
sophistication of control mechanisms should be matched to the value of information being protected. More
sensitive or valuable information requires stronger control mechanisms. Access and control mechanisms must
also recognize transparency issues. A lack of transparency in the interest of restricting access and improving
control also reduces credibility and conﬁdence in agricultural insurance programs. Tradeoff s between controlling
access and transparency are important considerations in designing data systems.
The foundations on which access control mechanisms are built include issues related to identiﬁcation,
authentication, and authorization.
7.2.1. Identiﬁcation: Data procedures that positively assure the identity of those who try to access data
systems must be developed. Data access should only be granted upon the veriﬁ cation of a person’s identity and
rights to view, download, or alter data.
7.2.2. Authentication: A variety of information can be used to authenticate a person’s identity including:
(1) information a person knows, (2) something a person has, or (3) unique physical characteristics (often called
biometric data).
For example, information that a person knows would include such things as a Personal Identiﬁcation Number
(PIN), a password, or a pre-established answer to a speciﬁ c question. Things that a person has include driver’s
licenses or magnetic swipe card. Unique physical characteristics include biometric items such as ﬁ ngerprints,
voice prints, and retinal (eye) scans.
7.2.3. Authorization: Agricultural insurance programs must develop consistent process for determining
a person’s authority to access information. Clear requirements for access and the actions that can be taken
by individuals (e.g., download, view, create, delete, or change data) should be carefully developed and widely
advertised.

Authorization to access information and other computing services necessarily involves decisions regarding
administrative policies and procedures. To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable
and consistently applied.

8.0.       Computer Hardware, Software,
           and Backup
The quantity and use of data in agricultural insurance programs
necessitates the use of high-speed, reliable computer management
information systems. Three elements must be considered when designing
such systems: (1) computer hardware, (2) computer software, and (3)
backup storage and operations systems. Hardware systems must be
reliable and easy to maintain and redundant backups of data are essential.
In addition, data must be available during times when systems are not
functional because of interruptions in electrical power or during system
upgrades.

8.1.      Hardware and Software Requirements
Decisions regarding hardware and software systems are important
elements of any agricultural insurance program. The selection of such
systems should be carefully considered before launching such programs,
as systems are costly to alter once programs have begun. A variety of
criteria must be considered in making these decisions, including system
performance, cost, storage capacity, dependability, and back-up and
disaster recovery.

8.1.1. Performance: Hardware and software must be jointly considered
in terms of their ability to perform tasks necessary throughout the life
of the project. Systems must be designed so that data can be easily and
quickly entered, updated, sorted, and retrieved. Software systems need
to meet the requirements of the insurance program, including data and
documentation entry, evaluation, sorting, management, and quality
control. In addition, security measures need to be a central component
of management information systems. Hardware and software systems
should anticipate of future growth and alterations. Hardware and
software elements of the program will need to allow for such changes as
new products and procedures develop.

8.1.2. Cost: Most of the costs of hardware and software systems
are ﬁxed in nature. Hence, decisions regarding performance need to
be compared to initial capital expenditures. However, it is important
to choose systems that can be expanded with minimal expenditures
in anticipation of program growth. In addition, the costs of modifying
software for new products are often underestimated. Consequently, it
is critical that selected software programs be ﬂexible in anticipation of
future changes.

8.1.3. Storage Capacity: Storage capacity needs are ultimately a
function of the amount of data to be processed and stored. It is critical to
select systems that not only meet current needs but are also seamlessly
expandable to meet future needs. It may be difficult to upgrade storage
capacities if systems are not properly conﬁgured initially.

The selection of storage capacity features, including storage space and
internal memory, is also inﬂuenced by the complexity of required features
and the amount of activity associated with data input and access.




34      DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
8.1.4. Dependability: Hardware and software systems must be dependable and have adequate manufacturer
support. Systems should have a strong history of performance without the need for frequent interruptions
caused by updates and modiﬁcations. Mistakes that are made during data entry or access should be identiﬁ ed
by the software and should not cause a system to stop functioning. The capacities and capabilities of hardware
and software should be thoroughly investigated before purchase. The ability to obtain continued manufacturer
support and extended warranties can reduce future operational costs.

8.1.5. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Hardware and software systems should be seamlessly and continually
backed up at both on-site and off-site locations. Backup systems should have consistent and obvious version
control identiﬁers. On-site backups are important for correcting or restoring minor data entry problems and are
critical for version control. Off-site backup mechanisms are especially important for disaster recovery that could
be caused by damage to local hardware or security breaches.

Data access should not be disrupted during hardware and software maintenance or while data are being updated.

9.0        Summary
Agricultural insurance programs are complex business systems that
require coordination among many entities. Much of this coordination
involves the management of information and data. Although program
design, management, and product development are highly data intensive,
strategic evaluation of data management often receives low priority.
However, the viability and success of agricultural insurance programs
is critically dependent upon the collection and management of data
for rating, underwriting, sales, indemnities, subsidies, and reinsurance.
Because data requirements for product development and program
operations are not only voluminous but also frequently shared among
stakeholders, it is critical that computer-based hardware, software,
and backup systems be developed to keep data management costs low,
remain expandable, provide for ﬂexibility, be redundantly backed up, and
secure. Agricultural insurance programs should not be developed without
a thorough strategic plan that addresses data needs, availability, and
management.
