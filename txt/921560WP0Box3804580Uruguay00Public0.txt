THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

      This assessment (asesoramiento primario) is done to appraise the
      feasibility of the project in terms of fire requirements and norms.

      The time for the assessment has increased substantially because of a
      staff shortage in the Fire Department (Dirección Nacional de Bomberos)
      and lack of coordination between supervising authorities. Personnel are
      not well qualified to handle the procedure. On average the procedure        90 days      UYU 5,725

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs

the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

ENFORCING CONTRACTS
Economies in all regions have improved contract                   reducing backlogs by introducing periodic reviews to
enforcement in recent years. A judiciary can be improved          clear inactive cases from the docket and by making
in different ways. Higher-income economies tend to look           procedures faster. What reforms making it easier (or
for ways to enhance efficiency by introducing new                 more difficult) to enforce contracts has Doing Business

what the length is in months of the maximum                 to terminate 1 redundant worker; (vi) whether the
