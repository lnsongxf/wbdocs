investments are targeted to their best use; and (b) a World Bank Development Policy Loan with a
Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO) (US$102 million) to strengthen the country’s
fiscal resilience to disasters.

This study presents a series of complementary options for a national disaster risk financing strategy
for Sri Lanka, drawing significantly from international experience and based on a preliminary
review of the current budget management of natural disasters and a prototype fiscal risk analysis
in Sri Lanka. It benefits from the international experience of the World Bank, which has assisted
several countries in the design and implementation of sovereign disaster risk financing strategies
(for example, in the Caribbean island states, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, the
Philippines, and Vietnam) and property catastrophe risk insurance programs (for example, in
Eastern Europe, Romania, and Turkey). This experience is necessarily tailored to the institutional,
social, and economic characteristics of Sri Lanka as well as the availability of relevant data.


Funding of Disaster-Related Expenditures
Currently, funds for disaster-related expenditure are allocated either through general budget
formulation or extraordinary requests to the Treasury via the National Budget Department (NBD),
and general budget procedures apply to the postdisaster execution of all funds. However, provinces
follow a distinct and separate budgeting process, which does not fully meet their needs for disaster-
related expenditure.

To help expedite funding and remedy shortfalls, the 2005 Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act
provides for the establishment of a National Disaster Fund, but this fund has yet to be implemented.
According to the 2005 Act, the fund is intended to consolidate external and internal funds for
disaster-related expenditure, including funds in the form of loans, donations, gifts, or grants.
viii / Executive Summary




                    Risk Profile
Sri Lanka’s         Sri Lanka’s catastrophe risk profile is characterized by a mixture of high-frequency, low-severity
catastrophe         events and a number of single large-loss events. Floods are relatively frequent and less variable in
risk profile is     terms of impact severity than other types of catastrophic events. Cyclones and droughts, however,
characterized       are infrequent and typically have more-severe impacts.
by a mixture of
                    Preliminary analysis was completed on historical (direct and indirect) losses arising from the
high-frequency,
                    physical and property damage impact of past disasters on relief assistance as well as housing and
low-severity
                    road reconstruction. Over the long term, the combined average annual loss to these sectors from
events and
                    natural disasters is estimated at SL Rs 50 billion (US$0.38 billion). The annual expected loss (AEL)
a number of
                    is highest from flooding (with an AEL of SL Rs 32 billion, or US$0.24 billion), followed by cyclones
single large-loss
                    and high winds (with an AEL of SL Rs 11 billion, or US$0.08 billion). This annual expected sector-
events.
                    specific loss from natural disasters represents 0.50 percent of Sri Lanka’s gross domestic product
                    (GDP) and is equivalent to 3 percent of total government expenditure.1


                    Insurance Industry Role
                    Twenty-one insurance companies currently operate in Sri Lanka, 18 of which offer non-life insurance
                    with subclasses such as fire. Most insurers issue natural catastrophe coverage as extensions or
                    endorsements of existing fire and allied perils policies, which may indicate an undervaluation of
                    natural disaster risk.

                    The current insurance penetration and density of non-life products that relate to catastrophe risk
                    is very low in Sri Lanka. Less than 1 percent of the residential property stock is currently insured
                    against natural disasters.2 This suggests significant growth opportunities for the insurance market.

                    The state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) is the non-life market leader in terms of
                    total gross written premium (GWP) share. SLIC is the designated insurer for all state and interstate
                    insurance and insures public infrastructure construction, such as roads and bridges, as well as
                    some major hotels in Sri Lanka. The National Insurance Trust Fund’s (NITF) potentially inadequate
                    retrocessionaire role is also a source of concern for the industry.3


                    Overview of Strategic Options
                    This study presents the GoSL with a series of options for consideration that could help the
                    government increase its immediate financial response capacity against natural disasters and better
                    protect its fiscal balance. Specifically, there are seven options for consideration spread across the
                    short, medium, and long term (table ES.1).


                    1
                     	 Loss estimates are based on estimated nominal 2014 GDP of SL Rs 9,929 billion, which is based on actual nominal
                        2013 GDP of SL Rs 8,671.1 billion plus 14.5 percent growth (the average of the preceding five years’ growth).
                        The natural disasters modeled include flood, landslide, cyclone, and drought. Tsunami was not modeled. Total
                        government expenditure for this analysis is based on 2013 estimates.

                       financing of postdisaster operations
Medium term            4b. Establish a robust catastrophe risk insurance program for public assets
Medium term            4c. Enhance the management of contingent liability related to social protection


National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF)
Short term             5. Introduce a reinsurance strategy for the NITF
Medium term            6. Strengthen the agricultural insurance program


Private insurance market
Medium term            7. Enhance data sharing on agricultural insurance




Challenges
The biggest short-term challenges facing the GoSL are twofold: (a) the lack of a centralized damage-
and-loss data collection system able to report information related to the damage and losses
borne by different sectors, and (b) the lack of disaster risk assessment tools. Addressing both of
these challenges would help quantify the underlying natural hazards facing Sri Lanka and allow
the preliminary calculation of their likely financial impacts on the state. Once these activities are
undertaken, they would inform the development of a national disaster risk financing strategy.

The subsequent implementation of a national disaster risk financing strategy would also
require significant institutional capacity building. Disaster risk financing is one component of a
comprehensive fiscal risk management strategy, which requires specific financial and actuarial
expertise. Major capacity building related to disaster risk assessment and management of natural
disasters would be required to develop and use financial tools to guide the GoSL in its national
disaster risk financing strategy.

T
      he 2005 Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act established the National Council for Disaster
      Management (NCDM) as the country’s supreme body for disaster management.4 As such, it is
      responsible for guiding the allocation of all funds for disaster management, including funding
allocations through the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Fund established in 1993.




                                                                                                                               CHAPTER 1
Before the NCDM was established, responsibility for disaster management had moved between
various authorities (figure 1.1). The Ministry of Social Services (or equivalent) was responsible
for all disaster management functions until 1996, when preparedness, mitigation, and response
and recovery responsibilities were transferred to the National Disaster Management Center. After
enactment of the 2005 Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act, disaster management fell under the
purview of the Ministry of Disaster Management (MDM). The Act’s legal definition of “disaster” has
also clarified the respective responsibilities of the NCDM and MDM.5


Funding of Disaster Expenditure
The 2005 Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act provides the basis for the establishment of a
National Disaster Fund, but this fund has yet to be implemented.6 The Fund falls under the purview
of the NCDM, but because it has not yet been established, signatories for release of funds have
not been appointed. The Fund is intended to facilitate emergency response, recovery, relief, and
reconstruction.7 Under the Act, the Fund is also intended to consolidate external and internal funds
for disaster-related expenditure, including funds in the form of loans, donations, gifts, or grants.

  	 The Sri Lankan Disaster Management Act No. 13 of 2005 was passed on May 13, 2005, by the Parliament of
    Sri Lanka. Its council is chaired by the president, with the prime minister as vice chair. The council also includes
    the Leader of the Opposition and the ministers of more than 20 ministries, including the chief ministers of all the
    provinces. For more information about the NCDM’s composition, see appendix B.

  	 “Disaster means the actual or imminent occurrence of a natural or manmade event, which endangers or threatens
    to endanger the safety or health of any person or group of persons in Sri Lanka, or which destroys or damages
    or threatens to destroy or damage any property” (Clause 25, Act No. 13 of 2005). For a detailed list of events
    considered to be disasters under this definition, see appendix B.

                       Currently, funds for disaster-related expenditure are allocated through general budget formulation
                       or extraordinary requests to the Treasury via the National Budget Department (NBD), and general
                       budget procedures apply to the postdisaster execution of all funds. The MDM and line ministries
                       receive funds for their disaster-related responsibilities through the general budget formulation.

                       Under the 2013 National Policy on Disaster Management, the MDM is the entity responsible for
                       immediate postdisaster spending, including immediately needed food supplies, water and sanitation,
                       medical assistance, counseling assistance, shelter, clothing, and other immediate needs. The MDM
                       also funds the overheads of emergency operation centers established in the Disaster Management
                       Centre’s district and divisional secretary offices.

                       As part of this mandate, the MDM allocates postdisaster funds at the district level, following impact
                       assessments and requests from the district secretaries. For emergency disaster relief and short-
                       term, small-scale reconstruction, the MDM issues funds to the district secretaries.8 It also provides
                       guidance on the rates applicable to specific expenditure types (table 1.1). Large-scale reconstruction
                       is beyond the remit of the NCDM and the MDM, falling instead to individual line ministries at the
                       federal level. The budget process anticipates that line ministries account for large-scale postdisaster
                       reconstruction costs in their annual budget estimates.

                       If disaster-related expenditure demands exceed provisions in the general budget formulation,
                       the Treasury has recourse to a Miscellaneous Fund, which has been used in the past for disaster
                       spending. The NBD director general authorizes transfers from the Miscellaneous Fund immediately
                       upon request of the MDM.

If the Miscellaneous Fund does not have sufficient capacity, heads of department and secretaries
may transfer additional funds between budget lines with the approval of the Treasury. However,
this approval and the subsequent transfer process can take time, delaying the provision of urgent
funding. In extraordinary cases, if intradepartmental transfer cannot meet the required demand, the
relevant minister can submit a supplementary estimate to the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Parliamentary
approval also takes a significant amount of time, and therefore raising funding in this way is not
suitable for immediate postdisaster needs.

Between 2006 and 2013, the general budget allocated around SL Rs 35 billion for disaster-related
projects (figure 1.2). This amount varied significantly year-on-year, reaching a high of SL Rs 9 billion
in 2012 (after the severe flooding of 2011) and a low of SL Rs 200 million in 2006. The portion of
spending attributable to external assistance executed on budget also varied significantly.

Provinces follow a distinct and separate budgeting process that does not fully account for disaster-
related expenditure needs. The provincial governments prepare their budgets independently, but
their budget formulation does not explicitly take disaster-related expenditure into account. Some
small provision is made currently at the provincial level, through allocations to divisional secretaries
through the Department of Social Services (DSS) for minor expenses on disasters. For example, the
Western Provincial Council issued expenditures to its 40 divisional secretaries, through the DSS,

                                                  of SL Rs 12 million in 2010, SL Rs 9 million in 2011, and SL Rs 3 million in 2012. The provisions not
                                                  only are small in the context of budget sizes and potential needs, but vary significantly from one
                                                  year to the next.

                                                  In the absence of a National Disaster Fund, the national budget explicitly accounts for provision
                                                  of external assistance to the implementing line ministries for disaster-related expenditure.
                                                  Total expenditure on donor-linked programs carried out by various ministries (as implementing
                                                  agencies) during 2006–13 exceeded SL Rs 17 billion (figure 1.2). Multiple factors drive the
                                                  large variation in spending year-on-year; for example, severe flooding in 2011 led to a spike in
                                                  externally funded spending in 2012 (as further described in box 1.1).

       uantifying risk is a critical first step in the development of any strategy for financial
       management of natural disasters. Furthermore, the value of such analyses goes well beyond
       disaster risk financing, because outputs have applications across all areas of disaster
risk management, from contingency planning to resilient building. This chapter presents the
results of initial quantitative analysis by the World Bank Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance
(DRFI) Program to estimate possible disaster losses from a sector-specific perspective, using
a probabilistic framework.9 Sensitivity analyses are also presented to provide some context
regarding possible total economic losses. It should be noted that any modeled results provide
a view on possible loss experience, but they should not be taken as predictive of specific future
events or annual experience. As models are only representations of possible realities, multiple

valid views of risk can, and do, exist.

Sri Lanka’s catastrophe risk profile is characterized by a mixture of high–frequency, low-severity
events and a number of single large-loss events. Floods are relatively frequent, with impacts
generally of small to moderate severity. However, cyclones and droughts are infrequent and typically
have larger impacts.

Sri Lanka was also significantly affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, a
major large-loss event. However, the probabilistic analysis excludes tsunami risk because the losses
presented do not capture the total natural hazard risk for Sri Lanka. It was not appropriate to include
tsunami risk in the analysis, given the limited data points in the context of the methodology applied.
An estimate of tsunami risk for Sri Lanka based on a full probabilistic catastrophe risk model10
would alter the shape of the curve, notably for the longer return periods.11 We generally expect to
see steeper curves—with greater divergence between short- and longer-return-period losses—when
perils characterized by severe, infrequent events (such as tsunamis and earthquakes) are more
dominant.

 	 The DRFI Program was established in 2010 as a partnership between the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
    and Recovery (GFDRR) and the World Bank to improve the financial resilience of governments, businesses, and
    households against natural disasters (GFDRR, “Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance: What We Do,” accessed
    October 29, 2015, https://www.gfdrr.org/disaster-risk-financing-and-insurance).

   	The analysis presented in this chapter uses an actuarial method based on historical losses, as the explanation of
    methodology describes (box 2.1). A full probabilistic model uses physical modeling of the hazard events in addition
    to loss and magnitude data to derive probabilistic loss curves, and allows the extrapolation of the view of risk
    beyond the loss record.

   	The “return period” refers to the time period defining the probability of a flood’s severity and associated loss, such
    as a 1-in-50-year loss or a 1-in-200-year loss.

                     Losses from Costs of Relief Assistance and Housing and Road
                     Reconstruction
                     Analysis was completed on historical (direct and indirect) losses arising from the physical and property
                     damage of past disaster events on the costs of relief assistance and housing and roads reconstruction.
                     This is a subset of full economic loss and is hereafter described as “housing/roads/relief” sector-
                     specific losses. As discussed earlier, this analysis specifically excludes the impact of tsunami.

                     On average over the long term, Sri Lanka’s housing/roads/relief sector-specific losses per year from
                     natural disasters are estimated at SL Rs 50 billion (US$0.38 billion).12 Annual expected losses (AEL)
                     are the highest for flood peril, with an AEL of SL Rs 32 billion (US$0.24 billion), followed by cyclone
                     (SL Rs 11 billion, or US$0.08 billion).13 This annual expected sector-specific loss from natural
                     disasters represents 0.5 percent of Sri Lanka’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is equivalent to 3
                     percent of total government expenditure.14

                     Sri Lanka is estimated to face housing/roads/relief losses related to natural disasters in excess of SL Rs
                     237 billion (US$1.8 billion) once every 100 years.15 This figure is equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP and
                     14.2 percent of total government expenditures, taken as the total 2013 estimated expenditure figure.

                     The three tables below set out further estimates, as follows:

                     uuAggregate housing/roads/relief sector-specific AEL, by peril type and as a share of GDP and
                       total government expenditure (table 2.1)
                     uuHousing/roads/relief sector-specific losses per peril type, by return period (table 2.2)
                     uuHousing/roads/relief sector-specific losses for all perils as a share of GDP and total government
                       expenditure, by return period (table 2.3)
                     Next, the two figures display the models in terms of probable maximum loss (PML) curves, as follows:

                     uuFitted sector-specific PML curves by peril type, in billions of Sri Lanka rupees (figure 2.1)

                       (figure 2.2)




                     12
                       	Loss estimates are based on estimated nominal 2014 GDP of SL Rs 9,929 billion, which is based on actual nominal
                         2013 GDP of SL Rs 8,671.1 billion plus 14.5 percent growth (the average of the preceding five years’ growth). The
                         natural disasters modeled include flood, landslide, cyclone, and drought. Tsunami was not modeled.

Sensitivity Analysis for Total Economic Losses
Information on the full economic loss arising from past disaster events was not available except for
the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Analysis of that event attributes approximately 35
percent of the total economic loss to the housing and roads sector.16 A sensitivity analysis has been
applied to the preceding analysis of disaster-related housing/roads/relief costs to estimate total
potential economic loss from disasters under scenarios of different importance of the explicitly
modeled housing/roads/relief losses.

The sensitivity analysis takes, as a baseline, the housing and roads costs equating to 35 percent of
total economic losses from the Indian Ocean tsunami. The analysis then applies alternative figures
of 25 percent and 45 percent to the importance of housing and road sector losses within the total
economic loss (hereafter referred to as importance ratios). Because the authors had access to data
on roads and housing sector losses, they could use these importance ratios (25–45 percent) to
estimate different views of total economic losses (tables 2.4 and 2.5).

It should be noted that alternative analysis based on detailed economic loss data (if available) could
produce materially different results. In addition, each major event has its own unique impacts and
cost components for various economic sectors, which often vary significantly from event to event.
As such, the following numbers and analysis should be considered for illustrative purposes only
and not as a full scientific probabilistic estimation of economic losses. Also note that the analysis
presented below excludes tsunami from all modeled figures.

If we assume that housing/roads/relief losses account for 25–45 percent of total economic losses,
the long-term average total economic loss per year related to floods, drought, landslides, and
cyclones is estimated at between SL Rs 111 billion (US$0.9 billion) and SL Rs 200 billion (US$1.5
billion). These figures represent 1–2 percent of Sri Lanka’s GDP and 7–12 percent of total government
expenditure. Table 2.4 sets out estimated annual aggregate economic losses according to the
sensitivity analysis assumptions, in both monetary amounts and as proportions of GDP and total
government expenditure. Table 2.5 sets out the same estimates by return period.

                            Box 2.1 Loss Risk Estimation Data, Methodology, and Key Assumptions
  The technical results in this chapter derive from an actuarial analysis of past disasters in Sri Lanka, from 1998 to
  2012 inclusive. This analysis is based on empirical analysis of past losses and not on a probabilistic catastrophe
  model (which is not available).

  Basic checks were completed by comparing various tables, but no independent checks were completed. Any material
  errors in the underlying data could materially affect the results of this technical analysis.

   Methodology
  The methodology followed these key steps:

  uuHistorical losses were compiled into a single table of aggregate losses, by peril and event year.
  uuLosses were then deflated to historical rupee values and divided by nominal GDP to calculate the loss as a
    percentage of GDP.
  uuHistorical loss rates (as a percentage of GDP) were analyzed for past trends, by peril and by combination of
    perils, and the data were detrended were necessary.
  uuA number of statistical distributions were fitted to the aggregate loss rates. Each distribution was reviewed for
    goodness of fit, and the most appropriate was then adopted.
  uuFor each fitted distribution, 10,000 simulations were generated, and the 10,000 event years were chosen for the
    adopted distribution. PML curves were then generated from the fitted distribution.
  uuLosses in 2014 values were estimated by multiplying the loss rates (from the adopted distribution) by an estimate
    of GDP for 2014.
  uuA sensitivity analysis was undertaken to provide context around potential total economic losses by assuming that
    the housing/roads/relief losses accounted for various proportions of the total loss. This approach has limitations,
    including that (a) alternative analysis based on detailed economic loss data could produce materially different
                                                                       Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing Options / 11




Box 2.1, continued


     results, and (b) the importance ratios applied (the importance of housing and road sector losses within the total
     economic cost) use data from a single event as a baseline (35 percent taken from the Indian Ocean tsunami).
     Each major event has its own unique impacts and cost components for various economic sectors, which often
     vary significantly from event to event, which is a key limitation of this approach.
Assumptions
The analysis uses the following key assumptions:

uuA sensitivity analysis around a baseline of 35 percent for transforming housing/roads/relief sector-specific losses
  into full economic losses is reasonable, as taken from the 2004 tsunami loss estimates.
uuNominal GDP for 2014, estimated at SL Rs 9,928.8 billion, is equal to 2013 GDP multiplied by assumed GDP
  growth of 14.5 percent (9,928.8=8,671.1*1.145).
uuTotal government expenditure (current and capital) for 2013 is estimated at SL Rs 1,669 billion.
uuThe fitted statistical distributions are a reasonable approximation of the loss impact of natural disasters.
uuGDP is a reasonable exposure measure for estimating losses.
uuThe methodology adopted and estimates of historical losses are appropriate and without material error.
uuThere are no material errors or omissions in the data underlying the disaster damage report (for example, the
  DesInventar database).
uuPast price inflation is a good proxy to deflate the historical losses into historical rupee amounts.

      his chapter provides an overview of the current insurance and reinsurance market in Sri Lanka
      as well as the market conditions for DRFI products in the country. It also provides insights
      into natural catastrophe insurance in Sri Lanka and its current capacity to meet any shortfalls,
including through microinsurance schemes.

Twenty-one insurance companies now operate in Sri Lanka, of which 3 offer only life insurance,
6 concentrate on non-life (or general) insurance, and 12 focus on both life and non-life insurance.
Non-life insurance includes subclasses for fire (natural perils), marine, health, motor, and other




                                                                                                              CHAPTER 3
policies that do not belong in the life insurance category. Natural perils or catastrophe insurance
includes atmospheric perils, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, tidal waves, and volcanic eruptions.
However, it typically excludes slope failures and landslides.

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) is the non-life market leader in terms of total gross written
premium (GWP) share, followed by private insurers Ceylinco Insurance, Janashakthi Insurance,
Union Assurance, and Peoples Insurance. These five insurance companies dominate the market,
with a total of 71 percent GWP of the general insurance business.

The combination of a rise in motor insurance with a sharp decrease in terrorism insurance has
significantly affected fire insurance, and consequently natural perils insurance, in Sri Lanka. Table
3.1 shows the performance of the non-life insurance market from 2008 through 2013 in terms of
GWP. During this period, the year-on-year growth of the motor insurance sector is striking. This
growth can largely be explained by the increase in volume of new vehicle registrations and the
required insurance for such vehicles in Sri Lanka. In contrast, fire policies (whose subclass includes
terrorism) experienced a sharp reduction in GWP from 2009 to 2010. This is possibly because of
the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF)’s 75 percent reduction in terrorism coverage rates after the
end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in May 2009.

                        In 2012, non-life insurance penetration (comprising total GWP as a percentage of GDP) was only
                        0.66 percent, below that of India (0.78 percent) but above Pakistan’s insurance market (0.28
                        percent).17 The low penetration rate could be attributed to low awareness of the benefits of insurance,
                        state provision of free health services to all citizens, and pension schemes for all public sector
                        employees.18 On the other hand, a low penetration combined with the country’s growing economy
                        suggests significant growth opportunities for the Sri Lankan insurance market.

                        The insurance density (or GWP per capita) increased by almost 14 percent in 2012 to SL Rs 4,287.11
                        (US$33), of which SL Rs 2,338.50 (US$18) accounted for non-life insurance.19 This again places
                        Sri Lanka between India (US$53) and Pakistan (US$9). The increase in insurance density could be
                        attributed to improved awareness of insurance products and increased economic activity. Table 3.2
                        indicates the level of development of the non-life insurance market between 2008 and 2013.

Discussions with the insurance industry in the context of this study highlighted that, as a consequence
of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, net earned premiums for fire policies increased
from SL Rs 687 million in 2004 to SL Rs 1,034 million in 2005.20 This was because of an increase
in fire policy sales and potentially an increase in premiums soon after the tsunami. However, in
2008, a high net combined ratio (an indicator of profitability that, if exceeding 100 percent, is not
profitable) of 122 percent showed that the non-life insurance sector had low profitability. This was
directly due to a fire net claims ratio of 82 percent, which resulted from flood losses in 2008 as well
as a competitive business environment. A much-improved combined ratio of 99 percent in 2012
could be attributed to a premium increase in the non-life insurance market and a reduction in the
net claims ratio of fire policies.21

Most insurers issue natural catastrophe coverage as extensions or endorsements of existing fire and
allied perils policies, which may suggest an undervaluation of natural disaster risk. Within such
extensions or endorsements, insurers either provide additional coverage at the same premium as the
fire and allied perils policy or at a slightly higher premium in accordance with the existing policy’s
conditions. In instances where the sum insured or the natural catastrophe risk is high, insurers may
conduct a detailed survey to determine whether to provide or decline coverage. This survey can
include assessment of historical losses, engineering surveys, and zoning maps of risk-prone areas.
According to key industry players, if insurers were to issue separate natural catastrophe coverage,
the required premium would be higher than the premium for fire and allied perils.22 Insurers are
therefore reluctant to market natural catastrophe coverage separately. This might imply a potential
undervaluation of natural catastrophe risk.

Each insurance company has its own methodology to assess the additional premium for natural
perils. High-risk policies—which can be based on factors such as the sum insured, the level of
premium, or the location (for example, proximity to natural catastrophe or high-risk zones)—are
treated on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration policyholders’ risk exposure and past
claim experience. Usually a deductible is imposed when granting natural perils coverage.


Key Market Players
Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC)
As the designated insurer for all state and interstate insurance, SLIC insures public infrastructure
construction such as roads and bridges as well as some major hotels in Sri Lanka. The Department
of Public Finance states that “all government and semi government institutes should, in accordance
with their requirements, obtain general insurance cover [Marine, Fire, Motor, and General Accident]
only from the National Insurance Trust Fund or the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd.”23 SLIC
also has a risk management department that carries out site-specific analyses and risk-zoning
approaches to quantify natural catastrophe risk. However, most public assets are not insured for
catastrophic perils by the line ministries or public sector bodies. Furthermore, no comprehensive
inventory of public assets is available to SLIC to quantify this direct sovereign risk.

16 / CHAPTER 3: The Domestic Insurance Market




                    With large reserves at its disposal and a large premium base, SLIC can provide competitive insurance
                    market rates. The four other leading private non-life insurance companies must rely on aggressive
                    pricing, low premiums, and speedy settlement of claims to attract customers.

                    National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF)
                    The state-owned NITF—Sri Lanka’s sole national reinsurer—provides medical insurance as well
                    as crop, motor, strike riot, civil commotion and terrorism, and migrant workers insurance and
                    reinsurance products. A government-sponsored pool of funds was set up to cover risks arising from
                    strike, riot, civil commotion, and terrorist (SRCC&T) activities. The NITF manages this SRCC&T
                    Fund, to which insurance companies are required to cede all premiums collected for terrorism
                    coverage. The crop insurance scheme is only available to paddy farmers to cover them against the
                    loss of their crops due either to natural perils such as drought and floods or to the peril of wild
                    elephants destroying their paddy fields. Last, under the Regulation of Insurance Industry (RII) Act,
                    the 18 companies that cover non-life insurance are required to cede 30 percent of their reinsurance
                    premiums to the NITF.24

                    The NITF’s potentially inadequate retrocessionaire role is a source of concern for the industry. The
                    government’s initial rationale for setting up the NITF was that a significant amount of GWP could
                    be retained in Sri Lanka, with savings in foreign exchange being remitted to reinsurers. However,
                    primary insurers commonly observe that the NITF is often delayed in settling general claims related
                    to legitimate losses. Furthermore, in the event of a major catastrophe, the NITF may need to rely on
                    the GoSL for financial assistance, which would then increase sovereign risk. In addition, insurance
                    companies are unanimously concerned about the NITF’s ability to quickly and effectively settle
                    claims in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Many favor the creation of an independent insurance
                    fund or pool for natural catastrophes that would be under the control of either the insurance industry
                    (independent of the state) or a limited liability company with private insurers as stakeholders.25

                    Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB)
                    The AAIB is a specialist insurance division of the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agrarian
                    Services. It provides insurance schemes for paddy, maize, and vegetable crops as well as livestock
                    in identified areas of Sri Lanka. Insurance premiums are based on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s
                    established cost of cultivation. Moreover, provisions under the RII Act do not apply to the AAIB,
                    which therefore is not required to cede 30 percent of all premiums to the NITF.

                    Approximately 90 percent of the AAIB’s GWP is drawn from bank loans for farming activities, while
                    the other 10 percent comes from private individuals. However, the AAIB provides insurance coverage
                    to less than 5 percent of Sri Lanka’s farming community, yielding GWP income of SL Rs 137 million in
                    2011. In the case of paddy farming, for instance, farmers favor the NITF because its coverage is free
                    (in contrast to the AAIB, which charges a nominal premium).26 Regardless, the AAIB successfully met
                    the challenge of a total payout of SL Rs 268 million for the 2010–11 floods.

Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL)
Beyond the NITF, the Sri Lankan insurance sector is regulated by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka
(IBSL) and governed by the RII Act. The RII Amendment Act of 2011 also brought the NITF under the
IBSL’s purview. The Board’s role is to regulate insurance companies and brokers, implement policies,
and monitor the requirements and programs of Sri Lanka’s 21 insurers. The IBSL also collects,
compiles, and publishes key life and non-life (including fire) insurance statistics that directly relate
to catastrophe insurance. However, it does not require a breakdown of premiums and claims per
type of peril under fire policies. This hinders the quantification and assessment of catastrophe risk
in Sri Lanka. There are no tariffs for fire and allied perils insurance in Sri Lanka.

Private Reinsurers
Although the RII Act contains no provisions for the licensing of reinsurance arrangements, a
registered company wishing to engage in reinsurance business has to obtain the IBSL’s approval.
Major private reinsurers in Sri Lanka include General Insurance Corporation of India, Scor Re,
Munich Re, and Swiss Re.

The IBSL requires insurers to reinsure with companies that have long-term ratings (for example,
BBB with Standard & Poor’s or B+ with Moody’s). Such requirements, however, do not apply to
the NITF. In this context, some reinsurers have started to tighten their underwriting conditions
applicable to selected property policies and to exclude catastrophe coverage, while other leading
overseas reinsurers are committed to providing coverage for high-severity catastrophe losses.

Insurance Brokers
Given the increase in motor vehicle premiums and low barriers to entry, the insurance industry has
experienced an upsurge in insurance brokers in recent years. By 2012, 54 insurance brokers had
entered the market. Non-life insurance constituted 98.5 percent, and life insurance 1.5 percent,
of the brokerage industry. General insurance business generated through insurance brokering
companies also constituted 25.2 percent of the total GWP.27

Microinsurers
Sanasa Insurance Company Limited (SICL) is a service support organization with a microinsurance
business, operating mostly in rural areas of Sri Lanka. The company enjoys high market penetration
(currently at 15 percent in rural areas), thanks to its extensive network of offices across the island.
However, only a small proportion of this business is devoted to general insurance. SICL products
include life, general, motor, agricultural, and livestock insurance.28

Business and Housing Lenders
Financial institutions that grant business and housing loans require a fire policy for the former and
a mortgage protection insurance policy for the latter to protect the property or stock from the perils
included in the policy. In the case of business loans, the policy is given in the name of the borrower,
with the financial institution named as an interested party. Policies for housing loans more closely
resemble life policies and do not cover fire or allied perils that include natural perils. Further, these
policies will extend to the end of the mortgage period as opposed to the value at risk.

18 / CHAPTER 3: The Domestic Insurance Market




                    Effects on Insurers of IBSL Regulatory Changes
                    The insurance industry dynamic was altered as a result of regulatory changes introduced by the IBSL.
                    These changes included implementing a risk-based capital (RBC) model for Sri Lanka’s financial
                    industry, which has been positively received by the domestic insurance industry. The RBC model
                    requires an insurance company with a higher risk to hold a larger amount of capital.

                    Table 3.3 shows the solvency indicators of individual general insurance companies. The required
                    solvency margin (RSM) is the minimum buffer of assets required over and above a company’s
                    liabilities to be able to cover for uncertain risks. All of the individual general insurance companies
                    shown in table 3.3 are above the RSM, showing a solvency ratio (available solvency margin [ASM] as
                    a ratio of the RSM) well above the ratio of one. However, it is not clear how the calculation of RSM
                    takes catastrophe risk into account. There are also currently no specific regulations in the RII Act
                    governing catastrophe insurance.

                    The IBSL is also in the process dividing life and non-life insurance business into two separate
                    entities, with the goal of completing this initiative by 2015. This is believed to be a challenge for
                    most insurers, both financially and operationally. Although the larger insurers have already achieved
                    a certain degree of segregation between the two, the smaller insurers still seem less equipped for

the split. In addition, there lies a possibility for consolidation within the insurance industry through
mergers and acquisitions.


Natural Catastrophe Insurance and Losses
The most frequent natural disasters in Sri Lanka are floods, landslides (typically excluded in a fire
policy), and droughts. Drought is insured under the agriculture insurance scheme (AAIB) because it
predominately affects crops. Gross claims for floods usually amount to approximately 0.02 percent
of the industry GWP for fire policies. Net claims significantly increased in 2007 and 2009 because
of floods in many areas of Sri Lanka including the eastern, southern, and western provinces. They
decreased in 2010, 2011, and 2012, possibly because of improved flood prevention systems,
especially in the Greater Colombo area.

For this report, information on net claims from eight insurers was collated and extrapolated to the
whole market. Taking into consideration those companies’ market shares and the industry’s customer
retention rates, total industry flood claims for 2007–12 were calculated as well as potential industry
gross claims as a percentage of industrywide GWP for fire policies (table 3.4).

Natural catastrophe coverage is usually provided for free under the fire and allied perils policy if the
policy is deemed low-risk. If any particular peril included under the fire and allied perils policy is
considered high-risk, the premium for that particular peril is increased, depending on the exposure,
in the form of an endorsement or extension. However, the premium increase is often minimal to
provide a competitive offer.

When assessing high-risk areas for natural catastrophes, a significant proportion of insurers have
developed their own analytical data programs to determine policyholders’ premiums. The data are
drawn from surveys, historical events, and geographical and weather patterns from the Disaster
Management Centre as well as from policyholders’ past claim experience. Insurers consider their
methods to be proprietary and confidential.
20 / CHAPTER 3: The Domestic Insurance Market




                    Although the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused the largest insurance loss in
                    the history of Sri Lanka’s insurance industry—a total insurance loss of approximately US$129
                    million—all of the major insurance companies survived the incurred losses, thanks largely to their
                    comprehensive reinsurance programs and low market penetration. More than 70 percent of insured
                    losses were recovered from reinsurance. Though the peril of tsunami was not included in policies
                    issued with agreement and support from their reinsurers, local insurers agreed to settle claims if
                    the policy covered flood or earthquake. In 2004, as a result of the tsunami, the net claims ratio was
                    123.9 percent. After the tsunami, most claims were settled within days. Ex gratia payments were
                    also made to policyholders who did not have proper insurance to cover their losses. It must also be
                    noted that large infrastructure such as railways and roads were government-owned and not insured.
                    A major portion of the impact was therefore absorbed by the state. Should a similar catastrophe
                    happen in the future, this could create a sovereign protection risk.

                      Disaster Risk Financing
                        Strategy in Sri Lanka

A
      comprehensive national disaster risk financing strategy should be designed to improve the
      Government of Sri Lanka’s (GoSL) capacity to access immediate financial resources in the
      event of a national disaster, while maintaining its fiscal balance. Building on the country
disaster risk financing framework promoted by the World Bank, seven options for a comprehensive
disaster risk financing strategy in Sri Lanka are presented (table 4.1).29

                      Sovereign Protection
                      Option 1: Streamline Damage-and-Loss Data Collection and Reporting
                      Historical data are a crucial component of disaster risk assessment and actuarial analysis, and thus
                      play a significant role in the development of disaster risk management strategies and financing
                      instruments. Sri Lanka’s current systems, however, lack the ability to collect and report information
                      related to the damage and losses sustained by different sectors such as transport, education,
                      health, agriculture, livelihoods, industries, and services. At present, the closest available tool is
                      the DesInventar historical disaster database, managed by the Disaster Management Centre of
                      Sri Lanka under the Ministry of Disaster Management (MDM). This system only gathers information
                      on the impact of disasters on individuals and housing. In addition, the National Disaster Relief
                      Services Center (under the same ministry) maintains a system based on Sahana software, which
                      aims to collect data required for relief provision.30

                      A new database in line with the standard damage-and-loss assessment methodology should therefore
                      be developed to allow line agencies at the national and subnational levels as well as local authorities
                      to report damage and losses easily. It would also enable the Ministry of Finance (MoF), MDM, and
                      other line ministries to access critical information for recovery planning. It should be noted that
                      although this initiative could be launched in the short term, completion of a comprehensive loss
                      database might take 15–20 years.

                      Option 2: Develop Financial Tools to Support Decision Making, Including
                      a Disaster Risk Model for MoF

                      Disaster Risk Assessment
                      The design of a national disaster risk financing strategy starts with a detailed disaster risk assessment.
                      It is critical to quantify risk in order to understand the size of losses to be managed and the costs
                      and benefits of using different financing sources to manage these losses. Catastrophe risk modeling
                      techniques can complement the actuarial analysis of historic loss data to assess the financial and
                      fiscal exposure to natural disasters. The Sri Lanka Climate Resilience Program is developing detailed
                      risk models for 10 selected river basins.

                      Georeferenced Exposure Database
                      Next, a national georeferenced exposure database should be built that includes the attributes
                      of public and private buildings and infrastructure exposed to natural disasters, such as schools,
                      hospitals, public buildings, roads, and bridges, as well as agricultural land and cropping patterns.
                      It could also include private assets such as houses. This database, combined with the catastrophe
                      risk model discussed below, would allow, among other applications, the assessment of the financial
                      and fiscal impact of natural disasters. Exposure information of this type would also be critical for
                      the insurance industry to offer sustainable and affordable property catastrophe insurance products.


                       	Sahana (www.sahanafoundation.org) is an internationally recognized, web-based disaster management system
                      30

                        that addresses common postdisaster coordination problems such as finding missing people, managing aid, and
                        managing volunteers. Sahana software was originally developed by a group of Sri Lankan information technology
                        professionals to help their country recover in the immediate aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake
                        tsunami. Among the world’s currently available proprietary disaster management systems, Sahana is the only free
                        and open disaster management system that can be downloaded and customized freely.
                                                                    Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing Options / 23




Such a database has already been developed for the city of Batticaloa under the World Bank’s Open
Cities Project.31 The project’s objective was to map the complete building stock, including critical
assets and road infrastructures, of the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat, which covers 68
square kilometers and includes about 90,000 people. The characteristics collected focused on
the basic information necessary for vulnerability assessment. Footprints and basic characteristics
(including number of floors, usage, and construction materials of walls and roof) were collected
for all 30,000 buildings in the area. These data are now freely available in OpenStreetMap and in
the government geospatial data-sharing platform RiskInfo (www.riskinfo.lk) for easy use by many
stakeholders.32

Disaster Risk Model
Finally, a disaster risk model should be developed for the MoF. The ongoing flood and drought risk
models—financed by the US$110 million Climate Resilience Improvement Project (a component
of the government’s Climate Resilience Program)—will identify and measure the economic and
financial risks in nine selected river basins.

In turn, the disaster risk model would produce, as outputs, losses in financial terms that can inform
the government’s contingent liability. Further applications (financial decision-making tools) could
be developed to use the reported losses to help the MoF design the national disaster risk financing
strategy, including the size of the annual budget allocation to the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
Fund and any disaster risk transfer strategy (for example, insurance). Mexico’s Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit currently uses such a model (further described in box 4.1).

Option 3: Develop a National Disaster Risk Financing Strategy
The national disaster risk financing strategy should rely on a risk-layering approach that promotes
the use of a mix of instruments that both retain and transfer risk. This could include risk retention
(through reserves or contingency budget and contingent credit lines) as well as risk transfer
instruments (such as insurance). See appendix A for further details and a comparative analysis
of risk financing and risk transfer products. Appendix F describes the operational framework for
implementing disaster risk financing and insurance (DRFI) solutions.

                                            Box 4.1 R-FONDEN: The Financial Catastrophe Risk Model
                                                of Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
                        To inform the design of a risk financing strategy for its Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN), the
                        Government of Mexico developed a catastrophe risk model called R-FONDEN (for Riesgo-
                        FONDEN, or FONDEN Risk). This probabilistic risk model offers catastrophe risk analysis of
                        four major perils (earthquake, floods, tropical cyclones, and storm surge) that could threaten
                        infrastructure in key sectors (education, health, roads, and low-income housing) at the national,
                        state, and substate levels. The analysis can be performed on a scenario basis or on a probabilistic
                        basis.

                        R-FONDEN takes as input a detailed exposure database (including details of buildings, roads,
                        and other public assets). It produces, as outputs, risk metrics including annual expected loss
                        (AEL) and probable maximum loss (PML).

                        The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit currently uses this model, in combination with the
                        actuarial analysis of historic loss data, to monitor the disaster risk exposure of the FONDEN
                        portfolio and to design disaster risk transfer strategies such as the placement of indemnity-
                        based reinsurance and the issuance of catastrophe bonds.

                        For further information on FONDEN, see appendix C.

                      Disaster risk layers could be financed through an optimal combination of financial instruments, using
                      a three-tiered financial strategy (figure 4.1). The costs and benefits of using different instruments
                      would need to be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively in the context of Sri Lanka’s disaster risk
                      profile to determine their value within a national strategy as follows:

                      uuLow-risk layer (for disasters with return periods of about 5 years or less): The annual budget
                        allocation or contingency budget could finance recurrent disaster losses such as localized
                        floods or landslides.
                      uuMedium-risk layer (for disasters with return periods of about 5–20 years): Contingent credit would
                        finance losses from disasters that are more severe but less frequent. This budget instrument
                        would allow the GoSL to draw down funds quickly after a natural disaster. It has already been
                        introduced in Sri Lanka, in the form of the Development Policy Loan with Catastrophe Deferred
                        Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO), which was declared effective by the World Bank on August 22,
                        2014.
                      uuHigh-risk layers (for disasters with return periods greater than 10 years): For low-frequency, high-
                        severity risks, the GoSL could consider the feasibility of risk transfer to the international capital
                        and insurance and reinsurance markets through either traditional or nontraditional catastrophe
                        (re)insurance or nontraditional (re)insurance products, such as catastrophe bonds and
                        catastrophe derivatives. Disaster risk transfer instruments, such as disaster insurance, can offer

                     valuable capacity for events beyond the capacity of the risk retention instruments described
                     above. The GoSL could consider buying parametric insurance against major disasters, whereby
                     payouts could be disbursed based on parametric triggers such as the physical magnitude of
                     a hazard event. This type of insurance product is considered transparent by the international
                     markets and allows for fast claim settlements (usually within two to four weeks).
In summary, the GoSL should consider a bottom-up disaster risk financing approach. The GoSL
should first secure financing for recurrent events (bottom risk layer) through risk retention
(operationalization of national reserves and/or contingent credit) and then deal with the higher risk
layers through the consideration of disaster risk transfer instruments.

Option 4a: Establish a National Disaster Reserve Fund as a Fast-Disbursement Mechanism
for the Financing of Postdisaster Operations
A National Disaster Reserve Fund (NDRF) could serve to rapidly finance postdisaster operations. A
basket of mechanisms and instruments could be developed as part of an NDRF, akin to a financial
trust, which would disburse funds after a disaster according to predetermined rules of disbursement
and procurement to allow for rapid implementation of recovery operations. This facility could build
on the successful example of Mexico, which established the Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN), further
discussed in box 4.2. Funds from the Cat-DDO could also be channeled through this mechanism.

                                                Box 4.2 Mexico’s Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN)
                        The Government of Mexico created the Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN) in 1996 in response to
                        the delays faced in the postdisaster financing of emergency and recovery activities. FONDEN is
                        a financial mechanism to provide the federal agencies and the Mexican states with postdisaster
                        financial resources. FONDEN’s mandate is to (a) finance postdisaster emergency assistance
                        (through a revolving fund), and (b) provide the 32 Mexican states and the line ministries (for
                        example, the Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and Ministry
                        of Human Development) with financial resources in case losses from natural disasters exceed
                        their budget capacity.

                        FONDEN finances the postdisaster recovery and reconstruction of public assets (100 percent
                        of federal assets and 50 percent of state and municipal assets) and low-income houses. In
                        1999, the FONDEN Trust Fund was established to help finance the FONDEN program through a
                        catastrophe reserve fund that accumulates the unspent disaster budget of each year.

                      Option 4b: Establish a Robust Catastrophe Risk Insurance Program for Public Assets
                      Natural disasters can have severe impacts on public infrastructure such as roads and bridges.
                      Countries’ strategies for financing reconstruction will vary depending on many factors, including
                      access to capital markets and the size of the event with respect to the fiscal budget. For example,
                      developed economies with easy access to the capital markets may choose to self-insure because
                      they have access to additional financial capacity to bear the full cost of recovery and reconstruction
                      when a disaster strikes. Other countries may require by law that public assets have catastrophe
                      insurance against natural disasters.

                      However, in practice, despite the introduction of compulsory insurance, most public assets remain
                      either uninsured or underinsured. This occurs partly because public managers are reluctant to
                      spend a portion of their limited budgets on insurance premiums. They also often lack even basic
                      information on how to select cost-effective insurance coverage.

                      A catastrophe risk insurance program for public assets could be established in Sri Lanka to promote
                      disaster insurance of public assets in collaboration with the insurance industry. Typically, this
                      program would aim to offer technical assistance to public entities in the design of their catastrophe
                      insurance coverage of public assets. Standardized terms and conditions for the property insurance
                      policies would be developed in collaboration with the insurance industry (with companies such
                      as Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC)), which would help public managers identify their risk
                      exposure and insurance needs. The program could also structure a national insurance portfolio of
                      public assets to be placed in the private insurance and reinsurance market. A national approach to
                      insuring public assets would allow for economies of scale and diversification benefits and thus lower
                      reinsurance premiums.

Option 4c: Enhance the Management of Contingent Liability Related to Social Protection
Responsive, scalable social protection programs and systems have the potential to mitigate the
impact of natural disasters on poor households. By providing a safety net to affected individuals,
social protection programs can prevent beneficiary households from depleting already-limited
savings, cutting expenditure on essential items, and reducing investments in human capital (such as
schooling) in the face of disasters. For instance, evidence shows that the implementation of social
protection programs that provide cash and in-kind transfers (cash-for-work programs, social funds,
and categorical services and benefits) in parallel with more-traditional relief and reconstruction
efforts have played an increasingly important role in reducing short-term food insecurity among
affected populations and ensuring long-term recovery in the aftermath of disasters in many countries
in South Asia (including Maldives and Pakistan) as well as in Turkey.

Flexible social protection systems that are disaster-triggered and linked to disaster risk management
systems and contingent financing also have the potential to reduce the administrative and financial
burdens of governments when responding to disasters. Among these burdens, postdisaster transfer
mechanisms can be administratively and logistically cumbersome; identifying affected people is
time-consuming and often inefficient, particularly after a disaster; and funds can take too long to
reach those with immediate needs. Scalable programs with built-in risk mitigation and risk financing
mechanisms can respond quickly to beneficiaries’ needs within existing systems. These programs
provide immediate assistance to poor people; protect development gains by preventing people from
falling back into poverty after a disaster; and promote shared prosperity through better targeting,
focusing on underlying factors affecting inequality such as gender. To those ends, the programs use
census and survey data as well as geospatial platforms to locate vulnerable people.

Finally, disaster-linked social protection programs can build governments’ capacity to provide
timely, focused assistance to affected vulnerable populations in the aftermath of a disaster while
protecting their long-term fiscal balance through risk financing instruments. This can be achieved
by making full use of financial instruments that allow for a more efficient management of disaster-
related liabilities. To ensure the effectiveness of such programs, a key step is to quantify the costs
and benefits of disaster-linked social protection schemes and their budgetary impacts.


National Insurance Trust Fund
Option 5: Introduce a Reinsurance Strategy for the National Insurance Trust Fund
Currently, the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) acquires 30 percent of all reinsurance coverage
from the private market. However, the government lacks a strong understanding of the NITF’s full
liability. At the same time, an effective risk management strategy is not in place. Although the NITF
is implicitly backed by the MoF, an important event could lead to significant claims from private
insurers that may be difficult for the NITF to meet.

To better manage this liability, the GoSL could introduce a risk-layering strategy. This would include
an assessment of the full liability in the NITF’s portfolio as well as modeled loss projections to better
understand the likely claim requirements after a significant event. The benefit of such a strategy
would be to limit the MoF’s liability in the aftermath of a major event, at a time when the government
budget will already be stretched.

                      Option 6: Strengthen the Agricultural Insurance Program
                      To transfer more responsibility for disaster recovery and rehabilitation to private individuals,
                      the MoF has begun to reform its agricultural subsidy program. The subsidy itself has decreased,
                      and the savings from the reduced subsidy are being used to support an insurance premium for
                      small farmers. However, the effectiveness and sustainability of the insurance scheme has not been
                      evaluated. Challenges include the following:

                      uuLimited understanding of annual payouts under the scheme and maximum payout requirements,
                        which could lead to difficulties in meeting claims
                      uuAn inconsistent trigger for claim payments, resulting in an ad hoc product response
                      uuAbsence of a strategy to manage the liability under the scheme, potentially leading to the
                        inefficient allocation of capital

                      Even though the uptake of the product has been effective, distribution of the program could
                      be improved in some respects. More diagnostic work could be undertaken to identify specific
                      areas of engagement to support the scaling and efficiency of this program. Such activities could
                      include the following:

                      uuIncreasing the understanding of liability under the scheme
                      uuImproving the pricing mechanism
                      uuIncreasing the efficiency of the payment trigger
                      uuEvaluating the benefits of pooling the collective risk into a captive
                      uuIncreasing the efficiency of distribution and claims payments

                      Private Insurance Market
                      The current insurance penetration and density of non-life products that relate to catastrophe risk
                      is very low in Sri Lanka. Less than 1 percent of the residential property stock is currently insured
                      against natural disasters.33 This is a consequence of factors such as low penetration, prevalence of
                      government-run social welfare, and general aversion to the concept of insurance.

                      Catastrophe pools within the domestic private insurance market are not recommended in this note.
                      Initiatives to pool risk into national vehicles for catastrophe risk have had some success in other
                      countries. The domestic insurance industry, among others, has also shown some interest in a tariff-
                      based natural catastrophe fund. However, research suggests that a multiperil catastrophe pool
                      might not be the best option for Sri Lanka for several reasons:

                      uuThe resilience of the domestic insurance industry, as shown, for example, by its coping
                        mechanisms and absorption of losses after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
                      uuRecent developments in loss history and increased capital and regulatory requirements under
                        the new risk-based capital model, which has guided the insurance industry to better manage
                        risks

Option 7: Enhance Data Sharing on Agricultural Insurance
Several private insurance companies have expressed an interest in developing crop insurance
products. Sanasa Insurance Company Limited has introduced such a product. The lack of available
data, such as hydrometeorological information, however, has presented a key obstacle to the further
development and implementation of crop insurance products.

A program to facilitate data and information sharing for insurance service providers would help
deepen market penetration. This would include supporting the establishment of data-sharing
platforms at required resolutions and formats and strengthening the capability of agencies in
providing such services, including the Department of Meteorology, the Irrigation Department,
and the Disaster Management Centre.

      o sustainably reduce the financial impact of disasters, governments should always consider ways
      to reduce the underlying drivers of this risk. Financial protection complements risk reduction by
      helping a government address residual risk that is neither feasible nor cost-effective to mitigate.34


Definition and Beneficiaries of DRFI Solutions
Historically, governments addressed the financial effects of natural disasters mostly on an ad hoc




                                                                                                              APPENDIX A
basis after events. However, they are increasingly focusing on proactive predisaster planning. This
began with a handful of industrialized countries and is gradually being taken up by governments
from around the world.

Disaster risk financing and insurance (DRFI) aims to increase the resilience of vulnerable countries
against the financial impact of disasters. A comprehensive strategy can secure access to postdisaster
financing before an event strikes, ensuring rapid, cost-effective liquidity to finance recovery efforts.
The main beneficiary groups of financial protection include national and local governments,
homeowners and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), farmers, and the poorest. Governments
normally seek to strengthen the financial resilience of these groups using appropriate strategies for
each as follows:

uuSovereign disaster risk financing aims to increase the capacity of national and subnational
  governments to provide immediate emergency funding as well as long-term funding for
  reconstruction and development. This policy area also works with governments to account
  for other contingent liabilities, such as government-supported agricultural insurance or social
  protection schemes that will require payouts following a disaster. Finally, it requires setting up
  systems for effectively allocating and disbursing the necessary funds.




                                                                                                                      APPENDIX A
     Example: Contingent credit is a financial instrument that allows governments to secure funds
     in advance of a disaster to be available immediately in case of emergency. In 2008, the World
     Bank approved the first such loan, called a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO).
     Contingent credit complements other instruments such as (a) national reserves to finance high-
     frequency, low-severity events (for example, Mexico’s Natural Disaster Fund [FONDEN]); and
     (b) catastrophe risk transfer solutions to finance low-frequency, high-severity events (such as
     sovereign insurance pools created by Caribbean and Pacific island states). To transfer risk to
     specialized risk carriers, the government of Colombia, for example, is building on international
     best practice in insuring public concessions for infrastructure worth US$38 billion.
uuProperty catastrophe risk insurance aims to protect homeowners and SMEs against loss arising
  from property damage.
     Example: The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP), a public-private partnership between
     the government of Turkey and the domestic insurance industry, provides earthquake insurance

  Insurance” (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2014).

                          to homeowners. TCIP increased catastrophe insurance coverage from less than 3 percent of
                          residential buildings to 23 percent nationwide and over 40 percent in urban areas. Since its
                          establishment in 2000, the TCIP has paid nearly 21,000 claims totaling over US$70 million as
                          of January 2014.
                     uuAgricultural insurance aims to protect farmers, herders, and fishermen from loss arising from
                       damage to their productive assets.
                          Example: The Indian government adopted risk financing and insurance principles to transition
                          its National Crop Insurance Program from a social crop insurance scheme to a market-based
                          crop insurance program. As a result, farmers receive the claims payments much faster and have
                          improved coverage of their assets.
                     uuDisaster-linked social protection helps governments strengthen the resilience of the poorest
                       and most vulnerable to the debilitating effects of natural disasters. It does this by applying
                       insurance principles and tools to enable social protection programs such as social safety nets
                       to scale up and scale out assistance to beneficiaries immediately following disaster shocks.
                          Example: The government of Ethiopia is integrating disaster risk contingency planning and
                          financing into the Productive Safety Net Program, its food security safety net. Starting in 2006,
                          the program began using DRFI tools on a trial basis to expand its capacity during extreme
                          events. A contingent financing window allowed Ethiopia to increase the number of beneficiaries
                          of food assistance during the 2011 Horn of Africa drought from 6.5 million to 9.6 million
                          drought-affected people.35

                     Key Considerations for Financial Protection
                     A government has access to many different sources of financing for postdisaster response and
                     reconstruction. The government can mobilize some of these options following a disaster, such as
                     budget reallocations or credit (ex post). Other options need to be established before a disaster hits,
                     such as contingent credit lines or insurance (ex ante). These financing options all differ in terms of
                     their cost of use, amount of money available when disaster hits, and speed of access.

                     Alternative instruments are not inherently better or worse; they simply address different needs. For
                     example, after a disaster, a government could issue bonds or raise taxes to pay for reconstruction.
                     Such measures provide access to large sums of money but take a long time to become available.
                     Insurance, on the other hand, can be much more expensive but can help governments manage the
                     volatility of unplanned demands on budgets by spreading the cost of disaster across time. This
                     presents governments with a trade-off in managing costs and risk.

                     To efficiently address the funding needs arising from disasters, a number of considerations are
                     important. First, understanding the timing of needs is essential. Immediate liquidity is crucial to
                     support relief and early recovery operations, while the government has more time to mobilize the
                     majority of resources for the reconstruction program (figure A.1).

   A second consideration is the cost of different sources of money. Table A.1 provides an indicative
   cost multiplier for different financial risk instruments. This multiplier is defined as the ratio between
   the cost of the financial product (such as the premium of an insurance product or the expected net
   present value of a contingent debt facility) and the expected payout over its lifetime.

   Taking these considerations into account, a government can combine different instruments to protect
   against events of varying frequency and severity. Such risk layering ensures that cheaper sources of
   money are used first, with the most expensive instruments used only in exceptional circumstances.

Note: Cat-DDO = Development Policy Loan with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option. The cost multiplier represents the estimated cost of resources as a
multiple of the average expected loss it finances. Donor grants do not have a financial cost but are often reallocated from other ongoing projects and may have
an opportunity cost. Reserves are generally held in short-term assets; their cost is the difference between the returns on long-term investments and short-
term investments. Budget reallocations are funds reallocated from other programs and may have an opportunity cost; unless they affect the credit rating of a
government, the cost of emergency loans is reflected in the interest rate applied.

     Appendix C: Mexico’s Natural Disaster
     Fund (FONDEN)

     M
            exico has a long history of, and broad exposure to, natural disasters. Located along the
            world’s “fire belt”—where 80 percent of the world’s seismic and volcanic activity takes
            place—Mexico is a seismically active country. The country is also highly exposed to tropical
     storms and is located in one of the few regions of the world that can be affected simultaneously by
     two independent cyclone regions: the North Atlantic and the North Pacific.

     To address its vulnerability to adverse natural events, Mexico has developed a comprehensive
     institutional approach to natural disasters. The catalyst to comprehensive disaster risk management
     was the Mexico City earthquake of 1985, which killed 6,000 people, injured 30,000 others, and left
     a total of 150,000 victims. Total direct losses exceeded US$4 billion.

     Mexico established the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) in 1986 as the main mechanism
     for interagency coordination of disaster efforts. SINAPROC is responsible for mitigating losses of
     societal and essential functions caused by disasters. Responsibility for SINAPROC lies with the
     Ministry of the Interior, within which the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) was
     also established. CENAPRED is an institution that bridges the gap between academic researchers
     and government by channeling research applications developed by university researchers to the
     Ministry of the Interior.


     The Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN)
     Despite developing an institutional approach to disasters, all levels of government in Mexico were
     still regularly required to reallocate planned capital expenditures toward financing postdisaster
     reconstruction efforts. Budget reallocations created delays and scaling back of investment programs
     while also slowing deployment of funds for recovery efforts. In response, legislation was passed in
     1994 to require federal, state, and municipal assets to be privately insured. In 1996, the government
     created the Natural Disasters Fund (FONDEN) in the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit.

     FONDEN is an instrument for the coordination of intergovernmental and interinstitutional entities
     to quickly provide funds in response to natural disasters. Its main purpose is to provide immediate
     financial support to federal agencies and local governments recovering from a disaster, particularly
     for (a) provision of relief supplies, and (b) financing for reconstruction of public infrastructure and
     low-income homes. FONDEN is also responsible for carrying out studies on risk management and
     contributing to the design of risk transfer instruments.


     Main Features
     FONDEN was originally established as a budgetary tool to allocate funds annually to pay for expected
     expenditures for disaster losses. In 1999, FONDEN was modified through the establishment of the
     FONDEN Trust Fund, a catastrophe reserve fund that accumulates the unspent disaster budget of
     each year.
                                                                  Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing Options / 37




Financial support is directed toward public infrastructure as well as low-income households that,
because of their poverty status, need government assistance. The adverse natural events covered
by FONDEN consist of geological perils (including earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, and
landslide) and hydrological perils (including drought, hurricane, excess rainfall, hail storm, flood,
tornado, and wildfire).

FONDEN is based on three complementary instruments: the Revolving Fund, the FONDEN Program,
and the FONDEN Trust Fund. The first provides monies for disaster relief efforts, the second supports
reconstruction of infrastructure, and the third manages Mexico’s catastrophe risk financing strategy.
They are further described as follows:

uuRevolving Fund: This fund finances emergency supplies to be provided in the aftermath of a
  natural disaster, such as shelters, food, primary health care, and so on. In the case of high
  probability of a disaster, or imminent danger, the local governments can declare a situation of
  emergency and obtain resources from FONDEN immediately. Doing so allows local governments
  to take measures to prepare for immediate relief needs.
uuFONDEN Program: This program finances rehabilitation and reconstruction projects for public
  infrastructure (owned by municipal, state, and federal governments) as well as the restoration
  of natural areas and private dwellings of low-income households following a natural disaster.
uuFONDEN Trust Fund: This Trust Fund manages FONDEN’s assets, including its risk transfer strategy
  (reinsurance or alternative risk transfer instruments). The federal FONDEN Trust manages the
  financial resources provided by the federal government, including the annual budget allocation.
  The state FONDEN Trusts, set up for each of the 32 states, manage the financial resources
  received from the federal FONDEN Trust after a natural disaster.

Institutional Structure
Located within the civil protection unit of the Ministry of the Interior (figure C.1), FONDEN is a trust
managed by one of Mexico’s main state-owned development banks (Banobras).36 The structure of




                                                                                                                                    APPENDIX C
FONDEN includes a counterparty in each of the 32 Mexican states, including Mexico City, to facilitate
the assignment and management of federal transfers. The main advantage of this structure is the
ability to provide resources to state governments immediately—on average, five days after the
disaster.

The FONDEN Trust receives an annual allocation from the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to
develop and manage its risk financing strategy. The risk is layered, with some tranches retained
and others transferred through various instruments. To transfer risk to the reinsurance markets for
parametric coverage or the capital markets for catastrophe bonds, the FONDEN Trust places excess
risk first with the public insurer Agroasemex. This entity passes on the risk to the markets.

                     FONDEN Program
                     The purpose of this program is to provide financing to state and local governments that are
                     overwhelmed by the occurrence of a disaster. The assessment of losses to be cofinanced by FONDEN
                     is based on a specific procedure involving the local and federal authorities. This procedure includes
                     six main steps and should not exceed 23 days after occurrence of the disaster:

                     1.	 After a disaster, a specialized federal or state agency (for example, the meteorological
                         department or geosciences department) certifies the occurrence of a natural disaster and
                         informs the state government.
                     2.	 Within 4 days after a natural disaster, the state government sets up a technical committee to
                         identify and assess the damage.
                     3.	 Within 10 days, the technical committee provides the state government with a technical and
                         financial evaluation of the natural disaster.
                     4.	 Within 15 days, the state government informs the federal government. The Ministry of the
                         Interior issues a declaration of a state of natural disaster. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance
                         and Public Credit authorizes FONDEN to release early partial contribution to the state.
                     5.	 Within the next 2 days, the Ministry of the Interior should (a) ensure that the requested
                         assistance is related to the natural disaster; (b) verify that the damaged infrastructure has not
                         benefited from FONDEN in the past (if this is the case, the proof of insurance of the damage
                         infrastructure is requested); and (c) formally approve the cofinancing of the reconstruction of
                         the damaged assets.
                     6.	 The claims are authorized to be financed by FONDEN. In the case of federal assets, the federal
                         FONDEN Trust pays the contractor directly. In the case of state or municipal assets, the federal
                         FONDEN Trust transfers the funds to the state FONDEN Trust once the state government has
                         transferred its contribution.
                                                                          Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing Options / 39




FONDEN Trust
The federal government aims to promote the private insurance of specific public assets owned by
federal agencies and state governments, thus reducing its financing dependence on FONDEN in case
of a natural disaster. The federal government has empowered FONDEN to develop a catastrophe risk
financing strategy, relying on private risk transfer instruments such as reinsurance and catastrophe
bonds. This helps FONDEN to increase its financial independence and overcome some political
economy issues.

The financial structure of FONDEN is depicted in figure C.2. The public bank Banobras acts as the
account manager of the FONDEN Trust. The public reinsurer Agroasemex intermediates any financial
transactions with the international reinsurance and capital markets.

FONDEN 2011 Disaster Risk Financing Strategy
FONDEN’s disaster risk financing strategy relies on a combination of risk retention and risk transfer.
To execute this strategy, FONDEN receives an annual budget allocation from the federal budget,
which is sometimes complemented by an exceptional budget allocation in the case of a major
disaster. To purchase insurance coverage, the federal law was modified to allow FONDEN to transfer
risk to the reinsurance and capital markets, with the insurance premium being defined as a service
in the government budget law. The transferring of risk to the reinsurance and capital markets is
intermediated by the public reinsurance company Agroasemex. Figure C.3 describes FONDEN’s
disaster risk financing strategy for 2011.

                    To implement the risk financing strategy, the federal budget included a budget line of 0.4 percent of
                    the government expenditures for the financing of public assets and FONDEN, which corresponded
                    to Mex$10 billion in 2011. If the annual budget allocation is insufficient, FONDEN can receive an
                    exceptional budget allocation from the federal government reserve funds (such as the oil fund).

                    For the first time, in 2011, FONDEN placed an indemnity-based excess-of-loss (XL) reinsurance treaty
                    on the international reinsurance market. Reinsurance payouts are based on the losses reported by
                    FONDEN that are borne by the federal government (that is, 100 percent of the damage to federal
                    assets and 50 percent of the damage to state or municipal assets and low-income housing). The
                    losses reported to FONDEN included replacement costs (on average, 75 percent of the total losses)
                    and improvement costs (on average, 25 percent of the total losses). Only replacement losses are
                    covered under the reinsurance treaty. As of March 2011, the federal government was expecting to
                    place a XL reinsurance treaty of Mex$6 billion on excess of Mex$12.5 billion.

                    FONDEN also secured the protection of a catastrophe bond. In 2006, it issued a US$160 million
                    catastrophe bond (CatMex) to transfer Mexico’s earthquake risk to the international capital markets.
                    It was the first parametric cat bond issued by a sovereign entity. After the CatMex matured in 2009,
                    Mexico decided to further diversify its coverage by pooling multiple risks in multiple regions. In
                    October 2009, with assistance from the World Bank, it issued a multiperil cat bond using the World
                    Bank’s newly established MultiCat Program. The federal government issued a four-tranche cat bond
                    (totaling US$290 million) with a three-year maturity, called MultiCat Mexico. It provided (binary)
                    parametric insurance to FONDEN against earthquake risk in three regions around Mexico City and
                    hurricanes on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The cat bond repaid the principal to investors unless
                    an earthquake or hurricane triggers a transfer of the funds to the Mexican government. During the
                    lifetime of the bond, no event triggered a repayment.

Appendix D: Turkish Catastrophe
Insurance Pool
Bridging the contents of Europe and Asia, Turkey is highly exposed to severe earthquakes. Despite the
common occurrence of earthquakes, Turkey’s private insurance market was long unable to provide
adequate capacity for catastrophe property insurance against earthquake risk. Without adequate
commercial protection of residential buildings, the government faced a significant contingent
financial exposure in postdisaster reconstruction of private property.

After the Marmara earthquake in 2000, in cooperation with the World Bank, the government worked
to limit its financial exposure to the residential housing market through the establishment of the
Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP). The pool enables the Government of Turkey to ensure
that owners who pay property taxes on domestic dwellings can purchase affordable, cost-effective
coverage. As a result, the government’s contingent fiscal exposure to earthquakes is decreased by
the transferring of risk to the international reinsurance markets, which reduces pressure to provide
postdisaster housing subsidies.

The TCIP is a public sector insurance company that is managed on sound technical and commercial
insurance principles. It operates as a genuine public-private partnership with most, if not all,
operational functions outsourced to the private sector (figure D.1). The TCIP purchases commercial
reinsurance, and the Government of Turkey acts as a catastrophe reinsurer of last resort for claims
arising out of an earthquake with a return period of greater than 300 years. The full capital risk
requirements for the TCIP are funded by commercial reinsurance (currently in excess of US$1
billion) and its own surplus capital (about US$0.5 billion).

The TCIP policy is a stand-alone property earthquake policy with a maximum sum insured per policy
of US$65,000; an average premium rate of US$46; and a 2 percent of sum-insured deductible.
Premium rates are based on the construction type (two types) and property location (differentiating




                                                                                                             APPENDIX D
among five earthquake risk zones) and vary from less than 0.05 percent for a reinforced concrete
house in a low-risk zone to 0.60 percent for a house in the highest-risk zone.

The TCIP sold more than 3 million policies at market-based premium rates (23 percent penetration)
in 2009, compared with 600,000 covered households when the pool was established. To achieve
this level of penetration, the government invested heavily in insurance awareness campaigns and
made earthquake insurance compulsory for homeowners on registered land in urban centers. The
legal framework for the program envisages compulsory enforcement mechanisms in urban settings,
while coverage is voluntary for homeowners in rural areas.

   Emergency response and relief operations. This phase includes emergency assistance to the
   affected population to ensure basic needs, such as shelter, food, and medical attention. This
   assistance, provided during or immediately after a disaster, can save lives, reduce health impacts,
   ensure public safety, and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected. This phase aims
   to stabilize the society and to prevent or mitigate further loss. Such costs can be difficult to estimate
   ex ante because they depend on the specific characteristics of the catastrophic event (location,
   intensity, time of the year [winter or summer], time of day [day or night], and so on). But the
   costs are relatively small compared with the subsequent recovery and reconstruction operations.
   Although relief costs are limited, they need to be financed within hours after a disaster. The capacity
   of governments to mobilize resources for relief operation on short notice should be a key component
   of their risk financing strategy.

   Recovery operations. Following the initial relief efforts, recovery operations are crucial to limit
   secondary losses and ensure that reconstruction can start as soon as possible. They aim at the
   restoration and improvement, where appropriate, of facilities, livelihoods, and living conditions
44 / Appendix E: Postdisaster Operational Phases




                     of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors. In other words,
                     recovery operations restore the society’s functions, such as reopening of schools, businesses, and so
                     on, even if only in temporary shelters. They include, among other things, the emergency restoration
                     of lifeline infrastructure (for example, water, electricity, and key transportation lines); the removal
                     of debris; the financing of basic safety nets; and the provision of basic inputs (such as seeds and
                     fertilizers) to restart agricultural activities. It is also during this phase that engineering firms can be
                     mobilized to start the design of infrastructure work that will take place during the reconstruction
                     phase. The government may also have to subsidize the basic restoration of private dwellings,
                     particularly for low-income families, before the reconstruction phase starts.

                     Reconstruction operations. This phase generally centers on the rehabilitation or replacement of
                     assets damaged by a disaster. They include repair and rebuilding of housing, industry, infrastructure,
                     and other physical and social structures that make up that community or society. These include
                     public buildings and infrastructure that are the direct responsibility of the state. National or local
                     authorities generally have to face obligations that go beyond their own assets. In most cases, the
                     government will have to subsidize the reconstruction of private assets, particularly housing for low-
                     income families who could not otherwise afford to rebuild their homes.

Appendix F: Operational Framework
for Implementing DRFI Solutions

T
     he Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) Operational Framework developed by the
     World Bank DRFI Program seeks to provide governments implementing financial protection
     strategies with a framework for the development and implementation of cost-effective,
sustainable DRFI solutions.37 The structure of the DRFI Operational Framework emerged through
a long, sustained dialogue and many years of working with governments and the private sector. It
builds on more than 15 years of intensive partnerships with more than 60 countries worldwide in
developing DRFI strategies and addressing challenges at both the policy and technical levels.

This framework aims to answer basic questions and challenges usually faced by governments when
they initiate or improve their DRFI strategies. Experience has shown that a DRFI engagement is
usually triggered by two main entry points. First, governments often are looking to implement a
specific product or financial instrument; here, the challenge is to help policy makers situate this
instrument in the larger context of financial protection and disaster risk management. Second,
governments may start from a particular development goal—such as protecting small farmers against
drought or ensuring access to immediate postdisaster liquidity for central and local governments—in
which case it is necessary to identify the appropriate solutions. In both cases, the DRFI Operational
Framework provides governments with an initial orientation to start the relevant discussions with all
stakeholders and gain an understanding of how the work might evolve over time. As a second step,
it helps governments to identify and prioritize policy options and the needed actions to implement
these choices.

Although the overall goal of DRFI—to increase the financial resilience of society to disasters—is
common across all countries, a government has many options to achieve this goal, depending on
its circumstances and time frame. The DRFI Operational Framework helps governments and policy
makers identify and prioritize solutions appropriate for their countries. Introducing a common




                                                                                                                           APPENDIX F
language also enables and strengthens the international cooperation often required between
governments and their partners as well as among governments to exchange experiences and good
practice. A structured, consistent way of approaching disaster risk financing helps governments
better identify and implement their priorities and enables international development partners and
the private sector to better support them in doing so.

The Operational Framework is not, however, a blueprint for action, meant to provide detailed
guidance on how to carry out each step. Such implementation requires the sustained engagement
and commitment of the countries and their partners. Countries are diverse, and so are their DRFI
needs and solutions. Low-income countries constrained by a lack of capacity may not use financial
instruments in the same way that middle-income countries yield and fine-tune them. Small island
developing states subject to financial shocks that can reach multiples of gross domestic product
(GDP) face different challenges than large middle-income countries that are trying to safeguard low-
income populations against disasters.

 	This framework is laid out in “Financial Protection against Disasters: From Products to Comprehensive Strategies—
37

  An Operational Framework for Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance,” Working Paper 94988 (Washington, DC:
  World Bank and GFDRR, 2014), which this appendix summarizes.
46 / Appendix F: Operational Framework for Implementing DRFI Solutions




                            The DRFI Operational Framework is presented in three components that should be seen as one
                            package and applied in an iterative way: (a) a decision tree for governments engaging in DRFI
                            (figure F.1); (b) an overview of government actions to increase financial resilience of defined
                            beneficiaries (table F.1); and (c) illustrative examples from international experience (table F.2).

                            The decision tree guides policy makers through a set of fundamental questions to guide the
                            process of identifying the appropriate policy and developing the required actions to implement
                            it (figure F.1). A government’s DRFI engagement can be seen in three main phases: diagnostic,
                            preparation, and implementation. As a first step, governments need to identify and prioritize
                            the problems they want to address. Second, policy makers—in line with their priorities—need
                            to define a set of solutions and develop a DRFI strategy. Finally, to implement the strategy, the
                            government needs to design and execute an action plan.

                            At each step of the decision process, policy makers can consult the second component of the
                            DRFI Operational Framework—the matrix of policy objectives and actions (table F.1)—to help
                            answer the questions and develop and implement the DRFI strategy. The steps in the decision
                            process are as follows:

                            1.	 Identify and prioritize overarching goals and beneficiaries of planned DRFI engagement
                            2.	 Assess risks to identify the impacts that are of concern and the problems driving those impacts
                            3.	 Arrange financial solutions, starting by identifying and prioritizing sources of funds to mitigate
                                financial impacts

4.	 Deliver funds to beneficiaries after identifying effective delivery channels of those funds
5.	 Identify policy goals and actions needed, consolidate them into a Strategy and Action Plan, and
    begin implementation
6.	 Monitor and evaluate implementation to refine policies and actions
Finally, the third component of the DRFI Operational Framework presents illustrative examples
of how governments are implementing DRFI solutions (table F.2). Although this decision process
is presented sequentially, governments usually begin engagement in DRFI to address an acute
challenge. It is important to develop a comprehensive strategy, but governments need not put
off implementation for many years. Many actions can—and should—start immediately while a full
diagnostic is carried out and a strategy is developed.
