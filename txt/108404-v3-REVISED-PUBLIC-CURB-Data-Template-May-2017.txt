Introduction

Please fill out as much information as possible. The more data you are able to provide about your city, the more accurate the results of the modelling exercise will be. For cities
that have already completed a GHG inventory, most of these data points will already have been collected. At the same time, we understand that certain pieces of information
are more difficult to provide than others. In cases where precise numbers are unavailable, please provide a rough estimate. If a rough estimate is still challenging, please leave
blank and the tool will provide proxy data. Cells to be filled in are highlighted in blue. The column marked "Explanation" provides more detailed guidance for each data point.
The final column marked "Comment/specify alternate units" provides you with space to add any additional comments you feel are important to raise. Please also indicate in this
column if you provided your answer in units other than those suggested in the "Units" column.

City Basic Data
Please provide some basic background data about your city's climate type, population, and employment. This section also asks you to pick a baseline year against which CURB will help you to
compare energy use/emissions in the target year(s).

City Powers Survey

A city's authority, that is, the ability of the city to own and operate physical assets, set and enforce policies and regulation, and set the budget influences the impact
intervetions may have on energy use and emissions. CURB uses information on city authority to help the user prioritize and select intervention areas. For example, CURB can
help users identify sectors and subsectors that the city controls and which provide the most potential emissions reductions and cost savings.
