Rental Support Cash Grant Programs: An Operational Manual is a guide for carrying out relocation programs based on
rental cash grants that was developed by a team of urban, disaster risk management and social specialists at the World
Bank in response to a request for assistance from the Government of Haiti. The objective of the Manual is threefold: (1)
provide a Standard Operating Procedure for all agencies of the Government of Haiti as well as non-governmental actors
implementing relocation programs; (2) provide a blueprint for carrying out similar programs in countries that are
grappling with comparable challenges; and (3) contribute to the policy dialogue on durable solutions to urban, post-
crisis displacement amongst governments, development and humanitarian agencies, civil society organizations and
international think-tanks. This Manual was made possible through the collaboration and support of numerous
professionals and organizations from a broad array of sectors.

The team especially wishes to thank for their continued support: Mary Barton Dock (World Bank Special Envoy to Haiti),

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                   vii
                                  1. Purpose and Scope of the Manual
1.1     Purpose

The purpose of this Operational Manual is to describe Rental Support Cash Grant (RSCG) programs and to explain how
these programs can provide shelter assistance for displaced populations after emergencies. The Operational Manual
provides guidance on the design and implementation of RSCG programs and also advises on the specific circumstances
in which RSCG programs can be an appropriate tool.

The Manual is intended to inform the replication of this methodology in other contexts, but is not intended to be rigidly
prescriptive. The Manual was developed from a single context – Haiti, after the 2010 earthquake – and this limitation is
openly acknowledged. It is hoped that the methodology described here will further evolve and improve through
implementation elsewhere and that improvements will be recorded in subsequent iterations of the Manual.

1.2     Scope

This manual provides guidelines for future RSCG programs, centralises lessons from research and evaluations and adds
practical examples drawn from RSCG interventions. The manual is not intended to suggest that Rental Support Cash
Grant programs can provide a one-size-fits-all solution for disaster-affected communities. Rather, RSCG programs
should correctly be understood as only one tool among many for providing shelter after an emergency.

1.3     Intended Audience

This Operational Manual is written primarily for government officials and humanitarian practitioners who design and
implement emergency responses – both those who are already familiar with RSCG interventions and those who are not.
The Manual will also be useful for senior managers in the field and in headquarters who are involved in approving
operational responses and ensuring that their staff members have the capacity and systems to implement these kinds
of projects. Humanitarian donors, students studying humanitarian assistance and aid agency staff engaged in policy
issues will also find this Manual useful.

1.4     How to Use this Manual

The Operational Manual attempts, broadly speaking, to separate guidance on strategic issues (Sections 3-6) and
Operational Implementation issues (Section 7).

Since it is intended to help practitioners working in future displacement emergencies, the manual has been written in
the form of a non-context-specific recommended methodology. However, acknowledging that recommended
methodologies can often prove difficult to adapt and implement in full, every section of the document also includes a
section on the specific challenges that may arise. For further guidance, each section also includes a description of how
these challenges were overcome in the Haitian context.

For those with concerns about how RSCG programs worked in Haiti, the Frequently Asked Questions section of the Haiti
Case Study in Section 4 may prove a useful summary.

For those wrestling with the strategic question of whether RSCG programs are appropriate in another context, attention
should be directed to Section 6.1 Some Key Questions Before Considering RSCG Programs.

1.5     The Role of the Haiti Case Study

RSCG programs enabled over 500,000 people to leave the unplanned, spontaneous displacement camps which were
formed in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake. The experience of designing and implementing RSCG programs in

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                     8
Haiti is used as a case study throughout the Operational Manual to provide practical illustrations of every step in the
design and operational delivery processes.


A discussion of the strategic decisions and the pre-requisite policy framework required for successfully implementing
RSCG programs in Haiti can be found in Section 5 Context of the Haiti Case Study and in Section 6 RSCG Program Design
and Development.

A discussion of the operational lessons learned in Haiti at every stage of the implementation process is highlighted in
Section 7 Operational Implementation.

This single case study is in no way intended to provide a definitive account of best practice. On the contrary, had other
detailed case studies been available, they would gladly have been included. It is hoped that the RSCG methodology will
evolve through use in other contexts and that this operational manual can in future be updated and strengthened with
further detailed case studies from around the world.


1.6     What is a Rental Support Cash Grant?
A Rental Support Cash Grant is a financial payment given to a family displaced by a humanitarian emergency. The
financial payment is given to a family or individual on the condition that it is used to pay for a fixed-term lease in
accommodation rented from a private-sector landlord. The cash grant guarantees that the beneficiary has access to
safe, cost-free or highly subsidized shelter for the duration of the lease.


1.7      What Constitutes an RSCG program?
An RSCG program describes the mechanism, staff and systems required to administer the provision of cash grants to a
group of beneficiaries and to provide monitoring and oversight of that process. Given the sensitive nature of providing
direct financial support to displaced populations after an emergency, it is necessary to put in place a logistical and
ethical framework around the cash grant.

                                            2. Guiding Principles
All guidance and recommendations given in this Operational Manual should be implemented in accordance with the
principles, standards and frameworks that have been agreed upon by the humanitarian community. (For detailed
references, see Bibliography and Reference Section.)

RSCG Programs are Only One Part of a Holistic Approach to Providing Durable Housing
RSCG Programs should be understood as only one tool in a broader strategy of addressing post-emergency housing
needs. RSCG programs are not an alternative to durable housing solutions. Rather, as outlined in the 2010 IASC
Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs, RSCG programs can provide one building block in an overall shelter assistance
strategy aiming to provide durable housing solutions for displaced populations.

Organisations assisting displaced populations should do so with reference to the standards and recommendations
established in the following guidance:

        UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement;
        Handbook for the Protection of Internally Displaced Persons published by the IASC Protection Cluster;
        The Pinheiro Principles which outline the rights of refugees and displaced persons to return not only to their
         countries when they see fit to do so, but to their original homes and lands as well;
        Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons: Implementing the Pinheiro Principles;
        Additionally, all use of cash as part of RSCG programs should be undertaken in keeping with the
         recommendations of the Good Practice Review: Cash Transfer Programming in Emergencies.

Ten Guiding Principles for Shelter After Disaster
This Operational Manual is intended to assist the design and implementation of Rental Support Cash Grant programs in
a manner consistent with the Ten Guiding Principles for Shelter After Disaster which were presented in the Shelter
Centre’s ‘Shelter After Disaster: Strategies for Transitional Settlement and Reconstruction.’

The Ten Guiding Principles (detailed below) were adapted from and are intended to be consistent with the guidelines
published by the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) in ‘Safer Homes, Stronger
Communities: A Handbook for Reconstructing after Natural Disasters’ (2010).
   i Engage and support communities
   ii Reconstruction begins the day of the disaster
   iii The community should be partners in developing the strategy and leaders of local implementation
   iv Strategies should be realistic in scale and invest in disaster risk reduction
   v Coordination mechanisms must support national institutions in order to optimise response
   vi Responses should contribute to sustainable development and to preparedness for future disasters
   vii Relocating communities is costly and rarely successful, so it should be minimised
   viii The response involves different groups with different roles, capacities and priorities
   ix Assessment and monitoring must be continuous, coordinated, integrated and disseminated
   x Community livelihoods are the basics of recovery

Free Choice for Beneficiaries is Fundamental to RSCG Programs
Finally, it is worth highlighting the importance of free choice in RSCG programs. In order to meet the norms and
standards required when moving populations, it is fundamental for RSCG programs to guard against coercion and
ensure that each family makes a voluntary and informed choice to move out of the camp and back into the property
and the neighborhood of their choice


RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                  10
                         3. Brief Overview of Rental Support Cash Grant Programs
Section by section, this Operational Manual examines each step involved in the process of implementing a Rental
Support Cash Grant program. Before exploring the intricacies of each step, this section gives a brief overview of the
process from start to finish, including a simple process map visually representing the steps described.

The operational steps sketched here are each the subject of a detailed description in Chapter 5. The strategic decisions
required in advance of operational implementation are explored in Chapter 4 including the role of the Government, and
how to ensure access for the most vulnerable families.

Step 1 - Registration and Establishing a Beneficiary List: Once the decision has been taken to implement a RSCG
program in a particular camp, the first challenge is to establish which families are genuinely resident in the camp,
legitimately in need and eligible for assistance.

Given the financial incentives on offer, some families from the surrounding area are likely to attempt to make the false
claim that they live in camp. This is particularly challenging in densely populated urban areas where camps can be ill-
defined with porous borders and many access points enabling a constant flow of people in and out.

Step 2 – Communication: In order to meet the norms and standards required when moving populations, it is
fundamental for RSCG programs to ensure that each family makes a voluntary and informed choice to move out of the
camp and back into the neighborhood. This is only possible if major time, effort and resource are invested in
communication activities.

All RSCG programs must strike a balance between investing in both mass communication and one-to-one
communication. In order for RSCG programs to be successful, all residents of camps must understand the program and
volunteer to participate. Specifically adapted, culturally appropriate communications including material specifically
adapted for the illiterate are essential to achieving this voluntary participation.

Step 3 – Choosing a Rental Property: Step 3 in the process involves each family working individually with an
Implementing Agency staff member to visit a rental property, ensure it meets certain safeguards and sign a formal
contract with the landlord. Each family has the right to choose any house to rent, in any area of the city or country.

To every family the same fixed dollar amount is available – an amount standardized by the Government based on
average rental prices in low-cost private sector housing for a fixed period - often 1 year lease. If families choose to rent
a more expensive property, they can make up the shortfall from their own funds. If families choose to rent a less
expensive property, they can use the remaining funds for any household need.

This “keep the change” approach is critical to empowering beneficiaries to make the most appropriate housing choice
for their family. It is also essential to keep project costs down by harnessing the negotiating power of individual families
to combat possible price inflation in the rental market.

Step 4 – Cash Payment: To protect the interests of families leaving camps, it is critical that the manner in which cash
payments take place is simple, transparent and accountable. Families must understand their rights in terms of payment
and also their responsibilities in terms of moving into the chosen property and vacating the camp within the
contractually agreed timeframe. Implementing Agencies may choose to pay beneficiaries through banks, or through
mobile money applications via mobile phones.

Step 5 – Relocation, Tent Dismantling and Camp Closure: Once both the beneficiary family and the landlord have
received payment, the beneficiary family is contractually obliged to leave the camp within three days. Exceptions are

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                       11
made and special assistance given to vulnerable families, single-parent families, families with disabled family members
and families with other extenuating circumstances being assisted by the Protection Team.

Many families recycle the material from their shelters, but others leave empty structures behind. In large camps it can
take many months to assist thousands of families through the RSCG process, meaning that camps remain home for
many thousands of families even as they are depopulated. Empty tents and unused shelters in camps can become
security and health risks or can be re-occupied by people who have never lived in the camp but wish to fraudulently
benefit from a RSCG program. As a result, dismantling abandoned tents becomes a necessary routine for teams
managing camps. This chapter highlights these and other necessary steps involved in the closure of camps including
cleanup and handover to the legal landowner.

Step 6 – Follow-Up Visit Six - Eight Weeks Later: The final step involves making a surprise visit to each family six - eight
weeks after they have moved out of camp and into their rental home. The goals of this visit are twofold:
     To verify if the family is in fact living in the rental property.
     To trigger (if the family is in the house as expected) the payment of a second, smaller cash grant to be used
        freely by the families for any household needs.

This step in the process enables the collection of data essential for evaluating the program, and at the same time
incentivizes and rewards families who have followed through on the contractual agreement. In great measure, this step
is designed to respond to risks identified during the project design phase:
      How many families living in camps are actually in need? Or, put another way, how many families, hopeful of
         benefitting from a cash grant, have maintained a tent in a camp despite having a housing solution elsewhere?
      How many families, if given a cash grant to leave a camp, will subsequently leave the rental property and move
         into another camp in the hope of benefitting for a second time?

Some programs may include a further follow-up visit after one year to see what housing solutions families find for
themselves at the end of the one year RSCG assistance.

                                  4. Context: When to Consider Using RSCG Programs
This Manual in no way intends to suggest that RSCG programs are appropriate for all families in all situations. Rather,
RSCG programs can provide one building block in an overall shelter assistance strategy that aims to provide durable
housing solutions for displaced populations. Decisions on when to use or avoid a tool like RSCG grants must be
contextually driven and this chapter attempts to raise certain questions which may be helpful in making that
assessment.

Following displacement, RSCG Programs can be a useful tool for achieving a number of strategic aims including:
        4.1 Enabling displaced families to choose a housing solution appropriate to their needs
        4.2 Supporting improvements in rental housing stock
        4.3 Responsibly closing camps

4.1 Enabling Displaced Families to Choose a Housing Solution Appropriate to their Needs
Displaced families should be given a choice of housing solutions so that they can choose the type of support which best
suits their particular circumstances and shelter needs.

The housing solution chosen by each family will in large measure depend on their housing status prior to the
emergency:

           Owner-Occupiers
           Displaced persons who own housing which was damaged or destroyed in an emergency, or who own land on
           which transitional or durable housing can be built, can be offered assistance with repair or rebuilding. This
           group will tend to choose to participate in programs that offer Transitional Shelter (T-Shelter), housing repair or
           construction of new housing.

           Renters / Tenants
           Displaced persons who were tenants in rented accommodation before the emergency do not own housing or
           land and therefore cannot access Transitional Shelter (T-Shelters) , housing repair or new house building
           solutions1. The RSCG option ensures that access to land is no longer a pre-requisite for families to access shelter
           solutions and leave camps.

           It is particularly important that RSCG programs enable support to be given to renters since 50% of families living
           in urban environments worldwide are renters.2 Moreover, displaced populations in camps often contain a
           disproportionately high number of renters since renters are likely to be less financially secure and therefore less
           able to cope with the shock of an emergency event.

           Owner-Occupiers Waiting for Durable Solutions to be Built
           RSCG programs can be useful as an interim solution when the timetable for reconstruction and rebuilding of
           durable solutions is slow and displaced families face a long wait. If Owner-Occupier families are forced to wait
           months or years for durable solutions to be completed, RSCG programs providing rented accommodation for a
           fixed period can offer families an alternative to waiting in displacement camps.

         Displaced Families Who Wish to Live with Host Families
         Many families who leave camps through RSCG programs choose to rent a house or a room from a family
         member.

         Taking a flexible approach to RSCG programs which allows families to freely choose any safe rental property –
         including the option of renting from a family member – has the effect of blurring the lines between private
         landlords and host families. This should not be seen as problematic, but rather beneficial since:

                 RSCG programs are thereby able to support both displaced populations and host families without any
                  additional cost or administrative burden.
                 Giving displaced families the choice to move in with a host family moves away from a model of top-
                  down control and instead empowers beneficiaries to make the financial choices which best benefit their
                  family.

4.2 Using RSCG Programs to Support Improvements in the Rental Housing Stock
After an emergency which has damaged or destroyed housing on a large scale, it is the affected population themselves
who fund and do the majority of rebuilding. RSCG programs represent one mechanism for Governments, Donors and
Implementing Agencies to provide assistance to owners of the kind of low-cost private rental properties that need to be
rebuilt in order to re-house the displaced population.

RSCG programs in some contexts have been seen to encourage private-sector rebuilding and repair when landlords
become aware of the increased demand created when families living in camp are given the financial resources to re-
enter the rental market.3

This contribution notwithstanding, RSCG programs must be understood as only a small part of the solution for
replenishing housing stock. RSCG programs should be complemented by other programs offering strategic technical
support to families and businesses involved in reconstruction. The standard and safety of housing will only be improved
in the long term if training programs and technical assistance standardize the use of sound building practices.4

4.3 Using RSCG Programs to Support the Closure of Camps
After some emergencies, Governments may specifically aim to achieve camp closure. The desire to close camps can be
driven by a number of factors including: the public health dangers often associated with unplanned spontaneous camps;
the need to return public and private land to its pre-emergency utility; or perhaps, that governments can more
efficiently deliver public services once displaced families return to their neighbourhoods. RSCG programs can be a
critical tool for successfully and responsibly achieving this aim of closing camps.

Camp closure programs are problematic unless 100% of displaced families in the camp are provided with an alternative
housing solution. By helping former renters who do not own property or land, RSCG programs can fill a strategic need
which is not addressed by other types of shelter assistance.

3
  In an independent report on Haiti’s RSCG programs 77% of landlord s responded that they had made upgrades and investments in
their property to meet the standards required by the program. The report concluded that “this impact cannot be underestimated as
it affected economic, safety, and quality of life issues at all levels. It appears that landlords reinvested about 2/3 of their rent monies
from grantees in immediate upgrades and their planning for the next year included about that amount again as a potential
investment.”

Communities (World Bank 2010)
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                                      15
As discussed above, it is often the case that displaced families in spontaneous camps after an emergency are offered
only three main shelter solutions for leaving camp:
     Re-locatable Transitional Shelter (often referred to as a T-Shelter)5
     Repair of a damaged house
     Construction of a new house

All three of these shelter solution options require the family living in camp to have access to a house (in need of repair)
or land on which a T-Shelter or permanent house could be built. The problem therefore is that families who have no
access to land cannot access the shelter solutions on offer. These families have little choice but to remain in camps.

In contexts where some displaced families do not own their own land, shelter assistance programs which do not include
Rental Support Cash Grants as an option will not be able to assist all families and will therefore fail to bring about camp
closure, as shown in Diagram 1.

Furthermore, if some but not all families are given assistance to leave camps, the camp will not necessarily shrink
accordingly. The chaotic nature of spontaneous camps (particularly large camps containing thousands of families) often
means that government and camp management agencies cannot keep a constantly evolving record of who lives in each
tent. Therefore when a family living in a camp does receive one of the three housing solutions listed above, their tent is
often filled very quickly by another family. (This is shown in the third box of Diagram 1 below.)




                 Diagram 1 showing that house repair, new house construction and T-Shelter programs help some families but not
                                                 all. So camps reduce in size, but remain open.

By contrast, when Rental Support Cash Grants are introduced as another shelter option for families – one which
addresses the needs of families who do not have access to land and those who were renters before the emergency – it is
possible to close entire camps responsibly, as shown in Diagram 2.

Once 100% of families have accessed their chosen shelter solution, it becomes possible to decommission entire camps
and return the land to its pre-emergency utility.

In addition to the generic methodology presented in this Operational Manual, one case study is presented to illustrate
and enrich each section of the document. The case study is based on the experience of the Government and
Implementing Agencies in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. This was the context where the methodology was developed
and refined into its present form. A short description of the situation in Haiti from 2010 to 2013 follows in order to
provide necessary context for the case study.

This single case study is in no way intended to provide a definitive account of best practice. On the contrary, it is hoped
that the RSCG methodology will evolve through use in other contexts and that this operational manual can in future be
updated and strengthened with case studies from around the world.

This Chapter is presented in three sections:
        5.1 Context of RSCG Programs after 2010 Earthquake
        5.2 Frequently Asked Questions about RSCG Programs in Haiti
        5.3 Future Usage of RSCG Methodology in Haiti


5.1 Context of RSCG Programs after 2010 Earthquake

The scale of urban displacement in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake was overwhelming. At the height of the
displacement crisis, more than 1.5 million people were living in over 1,500 camps. As of March 2013, there were still
over 320,000 people living in 385 camps. Graph 1 shows the evolution of the camp population since the January 2010
earthquake.

Options for Providing Shelter Solutions to the Displaced Population
During the earthquake response, housing solutions to help families leave camps fell, broadly speaking, into four
categories:
     Transitional Shelters (T-Shelters): As the charts below show, this was by far the most common housing solution
        provided. While there are many designs, these are generally wooden structures with plywood walls and a tin
        roof designed to offer medium-term shelter for between three and five years. After reviews of the cost-

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                      18
        effectiveness and fitness for purpose of T-shelters beyond the emergency response phase, the Haitian
        Government made the decision to stop any new funding for this housing solution beyond 2011.
       Yellow House Repair: Repairing or retro-fitting damaged houses proved technically complex and therefore time
        consuming and costly, but once standard methodologies were developed this solution proved increasingly
        successful.
       Permanent Housing (Re) Construction: Programs were created to build new housing and to replace houses so
        badly damaged that they were in need of demolition. The vast majority of permanent housing built to this point
        has been built in peri-urban and rural areas outside of Port-au-Prince. Building was extremely problematic in
        the dense, disorganized urban environments where land tenure was unclear.
       Rental Support Cash Grants: Offering families the chance to rent a safe property of their choice in the
        neighborhood of their choice for one year, the grant gives each family $500 US Dollars to cover the cost of one
        year of rent. The grant can be supplemented by the family's own funds to rent a more expensive house. Or, if
        the family finds a rental property costing less than $500, the family "keeps the change" and is free to spend the
        remainder in whatever way they judge appropriate.




           Graph 2 shows the housing solutions which have been provided by Government and Non-Government agencies working
                                     in Haiti since January 2010. [Source IASC E-Shelter CCCM Cluster]

The speed at which families can be assisted using the RSCG approach meant that despite these programs starting later,
RSCG programs have now provided housing assistance for more families than any option apart from T-shelters.

When compared to the number of housing solutions provided by the international aid response, it is striking to note
that the vast majority of Haitian families in camps after the earthquake left camp without any assistance. However, the
fall in camp populations was not uniformly positive news since the figures include families who were forced to leave
camps because of flooding, landslides, cholera or other natural risks. The fall in camp populations also includes families
who were given no housing assistance because they were evicted from camps against their will by landowners.

The Strategic Role of RSCG Programs in Response to the Earthquake
After the 2010 earthquake, RSCG programs proved to be an essential tool for providing housing solutions. The
Government of Haiti lent its support to this approach for several reasons:
     Conditions in camps continued to deteriorate as funding for essential services dried up.
     Unlike house repair or T-Shelter construction, RSCG programs provided housing assistance to all families living
        in camp, not only to those families who owned a house or property where a new home could be built. The
        poorest of the poor who did not own land were provided for by the RSCG.

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                          19
       Only RSCG programs assisted 100% of families to leave camps. As a result, it was only once RSCG programs
        started that it became possible to re-open public spaces which had been used as camps since the earthquake.
       Surveys of the Haitian public have shown that these programs are enormously popular. The Wolf Group
        reported in their independent review that a statistically remarkable 100% of respondents believed closing
        camps to be a good thing.6

    As a representative from the Government of Haiti’s Unite de Construction des Logement et Batiments
    Publics (UCLBP) put it: “97% of people living in Camp Place Saint Pierre didn’t own a house or land. To help
    every family and close the entire camp, Rental Support Cash Grants were essential.”

                                                   97%



Limited Aims of RSCG Programs
In Haiti, it has not proven possible to provide durable housing solutions for all families in camps, due in part to the huge
scale of the displacement.

Rather than providing permanent housing or other durable housing solutions, RSCG programs in Haiti had the more
limited aim of closing the cycle of displacement and helping families out of camps and back into living conditions
comparable to those in which they were living before the earthquake. Therefore, for those who were renters prior to
the earthquake, the aim was to help them back into rented accommodation for one year.
When assessed against these reasonable, somewhat-limited goals, independent reports and beneficiary feedback has
proven extremely positive7. When surveyed at the end of the Place Saint Pierre and Place Boyer program, 24% of camp
residents judged their circumstances as “Better”, and 76% of respondents described their situation as “Much Better”.8

Camps (2012)

RSCG Programs are Only One Part of Haitian Government’s Housing Policy
Using Rental Support Cash Grants to help families leave camps is only one pillar of a broader policy agenda being
implemented by the Government of Haiti. The Government established under the Prime Minister's office a new Unit of
Construction, Housing and Public Buildings (French acronym UCLBP) with convening power across all the Government
Ministries involved in post-earthquake reconstruction and the displaced population in camps.

The financial and organizational structure of the UCLBP's flagship 16/6 program, developed in partnership with donors,
UN agencies and International NGOs, showcases the broader agenda. Along with closing six camps using Rental Support
Cash Grants, the 16/6 Program dedicated considerable financial resources to long-term development activities
including:
     Repair and reconstruction of neighborhood housing;
     Rehabilitation of neighborhood infrastructure;
     Disaster risk reduction activities focused on mapping environmental risks in neighborhoods;
     Creation of formal community groups "Community Platforms" which enabled residents to decide how funds
        should be spent in their neighborhood;
     Livelihood programs to re-invigorate the local economy of targeted neighborhoods; and
     Professional training programs for neighborhood residents.

   Livelihood and Other Development Programming Should be Delivered in Communities, Not as Part of RSCG Programs:
   With the exception of the Rental Support Cash Grants given to families in camps, all 16/6 Program activities were
   focused in neighborhoods. Benefits in neighborhoods were provided without discrimination between families returning
   from camps, and those families who had remained in the neighborhood after the earthquake.

   This neighborhood approach to improving social service proved far more efficient and effective than early programs
   which attempted to provide livelihood assistance, education assistance and other services only to those families who
   were leaving camps as beneficiaries of RSCG programs.

   On the basis of the Haiti experience, RSCG programs proved to be an ineffective vehicle for providing further services.
   Rather than choosing one camp and providing social services for its population once they had dispersed across
   neighborhoods, it is far more efficient to provide social services to an entire neighborhood without discriminating
   between long-term residents and those families who have recently arrived in the neighborhood with the assistance of
   an RSCG.

5.2 Frequently Asked Questions about RSCG Programs in Haiti

FAQ 1. What happens to families after one year?

Since RSCG programs in Haiti only paid the rent for families for one year, one of the most frequently asked questions
about the RSCG programs was ‘what happened to families after one year?’ Were families forced to leave their new
homes and did they find themselves back in the street or in camps?

The independent report commissioned to examine the impact of RSCG programs on the lives of grantees after one year
provided extremely encouraging results. 9

             “The results are extremely promising: one year on, no grantees have returned to camps and
             100% have autonomously found an accommodation solution. The evaluation was unable to
             find evidence that the rental support approach is contributing to the development of new
             informal settlements. Grantees enjoyed a year’s support in secure housing of their choice,
             using any extra money to pay down debt, pay school fees, help other family members, start
             small businesses, and other activities that were extremely important at the household and
             community levels. The evaluation finds that 25% of grantees remain in the same rental
             accommodation for a second year. Those that choose to change their rental solution are
             continuing to exercise their free choice to find accommodation solutions that reflect their
             financial means and personal priorities. Of the 75% that moved, 49% reported being unable
             to pay the rent, while 26% attributed their move to problems with the landlord.”


FAQ 2. Does one year of rent represent a durable solution to displacement?

A RSCG does not provide a permanent housing solution since it provides accommodation only for a duration limited by
the lease agreement. However, for families in certain circumstances, it may be entirely appropriate that a RSCG
represents the only housing solution provided in the aftermath of displacement.

For example, providing a rental property for one year to a family who were renting before their displacement can in
some circumstances legitimately be considered a housing solution which has closed the cycle of displacement and
therefore fulfilled the duty of care of responsible authorities with specific regard to the emergency event which
precipitated displacement.

In the case of Haiti, the scale of the displacement was enormous, leaving hundreds of thousands of people living in
displacement camps more than two years after the earthquake. Additionally, Haiti had huge problems with insufficient
housing stock even before the earthquake.10 Therefore, as well as those in camps, there were huge numbers of people
living in precarious circumstances outside camps with an equally legitimate claim to needing assistance with durable
housing.

Providing durable housing on this scale could not be achieved in the short-term as a response to the earthquake.
Rather, it was a question of long-term housing policy – a question which the Government of Haiti will need to actively
address over many years as part of its long-term development policies.

Since the challenge of providing durable housing on a national scale was one which will take many years to address, the
Government of Haiti recognized that other housing solutions were required in the shorter term to assist those living in
displacement camps.

It was this strategic issue which the RSCG programs sought to address.

The RSCG approach does not attempt to provide a permanent housing solution for families living in camps. Rather,
these programs aim to close the cycle of displacement and help families back into living conditions comparable to those
in which they were living before the earthquake.

Once returned to their neighborhood in a rental property, displaced families who were owner-occupiers of damaged
housing can subsequently be assisted with a durable solution to repair or rebuild their properties through neighborhood
reconstruction programs.

RSCG programs cannot deliver a durable housing solution for displaced families who did not previously own housing or
land. Instead, these programs offer a helping hand, returning the family to a rental situation similar to their life before
the earthquake. (See Diagram below)

Implementing Agencies delivering rental support programs sought to be assessed against these reasonable, somewhat-
limited goals, whilst at the same time advocating for Government leadership in creating programs which addressed the
broader needs of the Haitian population.

This approach is in keeping with the “differentiated approach” recommended by Walter Kaelin in his capacity as the
Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for the Human Rights of Internally Displaced People. Kaelin
endorses an approach which differentiates between addressing “humanitarian needs which are displacement specific”,
and “other humanitarian needs faced by the affected population at large – livelihoods, education, health, water and

FAQ 3. Is sufficient rental stock available?

One of the biggest risks identified before the program concerned whether there was sufficient rental stock to
accommodate families moving out of camps using Rental Support Cash Grants. A related risk identified was whether the
Government-backed RSCG program was such a large-scale intervention in the rental market that it would cause rental
price inflation.

Initially, a small-scale analysis of the rental sector was conducted in three key neighborhoods. However, the small
sample size, as well as the number of necessary assumptions and extrapolations left considerable questions. Even those
who produced that report were keen to stress that it was a best guess rather than methodologically water-tight,
particularly since an INGO survey turned up a certain amount of available rental space, but once the RSCG programs
began, Haitian people did a much better job of finding places where there was rental capacity and at lower prices. As a
result, the decision was taken that the only way to know with any certainty if there was sufficient rental stock was to
start pilot programs and track progress. With the support of the Government, the CCCM/Shelter Cluster collected data
from all Implementing Agencies around the city of Port-au-Prince.

The key to mitigating the risk of insufficient rental accommodation and possible rental inflation was to track the amount
each family was paying for one year of rent and to then use basic market principles: If there was insufficient housing
supply, families would be unable to find a property; and if RSCG programs were causing supply of rental housing to
decrease relative to demand, average rental prices would rise.

The data collected over more than a year by the CCCM Cluster indicated that rental property capacity was not an issue,
nor was there any evidence of price inflation in the rental market.

As of June 2013, more than 40,000 families had left camps and moved into rented accommodation in neighborhoods
around Port-au-Prince. Average rental prices stayed stable and remained below the $500 USD which was given to
families.

One absolutely key feature of the program which, undoubtedly, helped combat the threat of rental inflation has been
the “keep the change” approach. The strategic decision to allow beneficiaries to negotiate their own rent and to benefit
financially from the savings has exerted downward pressure on the average rental price in a way which would not have
been achieved if organizations had negotiated for camp residents or if beneficiaries had seen no material advantage to
securing a price below $500 USD.

The evidence clearly suggests that rental supply kept pace with the demand. This has led to speculation, as yet
unproven, that the RSCG program in fact had the effect of stimulating supply by encouraging landlords to build extra
rental capacity in the knowledge that there was likely to be demand. It is to be hoped that subsequent evaluations of
the Haiti response will shed light on this hypothesis.

FAQ 4. Is the rental accommodation safe?

There were valid concerns about the quality and safety of housing in the neighborhoods to which families are returning.
There is detailed discussion of this issue later in this Manual: Firstly, there is a discussion of the role of the Government
in establishing safety standards not only for renters from RSCG programs, but for all renters and owners in Haiti (see
Section 6.2 Role of Government.) Secondly, there is a discussion of the very practical procedures which were put in place
to minimize the risk to renters (see Section 7.3 Choosing a Rental Property).

The first thing to highlight is the efforts which were made to ensure, as far as possible, that the rental properties were
safe. Implementing Agencies sent a member of staff to inspect each family’s proposed rental property to check that
certain conditions were met: the property could not be in an unsafe “Red Zone”12; and it could not be marked as
unsuitable for habitation with a Red or Yellow stamp13 by Government engineers who assessed all buildings after the
earthquake.

However, it was not always feasible for trained engineers to re-assess every property as part of RSCG programs. A
certain amount of common sense risk assessment from Implementing Agency staff and beneficiary families was
required in cases where buildings did not have a technical assessment stamp. This was not ideal, but in the absence of
better options, it was the approach agreed upon as a feasible solution.

12
     For the full definition of a “Red Zone” see Section 6.2 on Role of Government and Section 7.2 Choosing a Property.
13
     For a full description of the colored stamps see sub-section 6.2.4 in the Role of Government Section.
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                        27
On this very sensitive issue, it is important to highlight that the quality and safety of housing was not a problem unique
to RSCG programs, but is a broader problem for renters and owners throughout Haiti, a country where construction
standards were unregulated for decades.

As a result, RSCG programs must be understood as only one part of a broad reconstruction agenda which included
programs designed to drive a longer-term improvement of building standards across the construction industry in Haiti.
Through initiatives including the Government‐led 16/6 program, newly-established building standards were widely
advertised and large‐scale programs trained masons and other construction workers on safe housing materials and
building techniques.

Initially, there were suggestions that RSCG programs should be directly linked to these programs – with families from
camps moving only into homes which had been verifiably repaired by trained engineers as part of the rebuilding
program. However, this proved unworkable because the complexities of repairing houses and the contrasting speed of
RSCG programs meant that the number of families receiving RSCG assistance quickly dwarfed the number of houses
which had been verifiably repaired.

In terms of scale, it is important to recognize that repair programs are complex and expensive and that a program which
was sufficient to accommodate even a small proportion of the hundreds of thousands of people living in camps would
have involved financial resources on a scale which was not available to the responders in Haiti. Moreover, any large-
scale repair program would also need to address not only the rental market but the even larger numbers of owner-
occupiers whose houses were in need of repair.

Fundamentally, one of the key reasons for the success of the RSCG programs assisting more than 40,000 families to
move into rented accommodation was predicated on the decision to harness the power of the private sector to rebuild
the necessary rental capacity.

The key for the Government and international community therefore is not to be responsible for the building or repairing
all units directly, but to invest in programs which improve building standards across the country in a long-term manner
which benefits not only renters who move out of camps, but renters and owner-occupiers across the country.

If there is sufficient time, funding and technical capacity, it would be ideal to technically assess each prospective rental
property, and to run large-scale retro-fitting and technical assistance programs in the communities of return. These
retro-fitting and technical assistance programs should be available not only to families leaving camps, but also to
families living in unsafe housing in the communities of return. The most efficient approach is not to directly link the
RSCG and rebuilding programs, but to run these programs independently with RSCG programs focused on ensuring
camp residents move into safe housing in the short term, and other programs raising the standard of all housing in the
neighborhood of return in the long term.

FAQ 5. Is closing camps a legitimate policy goal?

For reasons established in Section 4.3, it was clear in Haiti that RSCG programs were an essential tool for camp closure
in Haiti. However, it is worthwhile to examine questions which were raised regarding whether camp closure was an
appropriate or legitimate policy goal.

The conclusion in Haiti, from a policy, beneficiary and societal perspective, was undoubtedly yes.

From a policy perspective, camp closure programs responded to the humanitarian need: the humanitarian mandate
after the earthquake was to help close the cycle of displacement by helping families move into living conditions
comparable to those in which they were living before the earthquake.


RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                       28
The camps in Haiti formed spontaneously, were unplanned and were incredibly insecure environments where
conditions deteriorated considerably below humanitarian standards as defined in the Sphere guidelines. Closing camps
by giving every family an improved housing solution therefore had inherent value. Of course, it is important to look at
long-term housing solutions for the vulnerable and to invest in longer-term development activities to improve overall
conditions, but in the short term it is necessary to help families out of camps.

From the beneficiaries’ perspective, the level of approval is very clear. An independent satisfaction survey conducted in
2012 interviewing beneficiaries of RSCG programs implemented by a variety of agencies found almost universal support
both for RSCG programs and the aim of closing camps.14

          families still living in camps.




Finally, from a societal point of view, these programs have been very positively received by the Haitian press and
population. Some camps were and are impeding expansion of factories and other businesses. Finding a responsible and
popular mechanism for closing camps allows these businesses to expand and potentially increases economic activity
and employment. Less quantifiable is the feeling of life returning to normal as public parks and open spaces in Port-au-
Prince are returned to their pre-earthquake utility for public recreation.

5.3 Future Usage of RSCG Methodology in Haiti

The RSCG approach to assisting families with relocation has the potential to be useful in Haiti beyond the 2010
earthquake response. A standardized methodology has now been developed and staff members from mayors’ offices,
the Civil Protection Department (DPC) and the UCLBP have been trained to deliver RSCG programs. As a result, there is
now Government capacity to help large numbers of families relocate in a way which respects rights and addresses the
displaced population’s protection needs.

While the details of the compensation package for families may vary, the fundamental framework of the process can be
adapted to other circumstances. For example, the Government of Haiti may in future consider using a variant of the
same process in the following circumstances:
     After Future Emergencies: Given the frequency of major storms during the hurricane season, the Government
        of Haiti will continue to face the challenge of large populations displaced by emergencies. If any future
        emergency results in displaced populations, there is now capacity to respond quickly and efficiently.
     Disaster Risk Reduction: After considerable investment in DRR programs, including early warning systems, the
        Government now has access to increasing data mapping environmental risk in neighborhoods. Some risk areas
        can be addressed through mitigation work, but there will likely be parts of Port-au-Prince which are deemed

        unsafe for habitation. When such areas are identified, RSCG programs could form the framework for assisting
        families to relocate. Families losing their homes will require compensation greater than $500 USD for one
        year’s rent, but the methodology will provide the framework even if the amount of compensation is different.
       Planned Urban Redevelopment: As Port-au-Prince and other cities in Haiti continue to develop, the
        Government will invest in basic infrastructure. As roads and other infrastructure are built, some homes will
        inevitably need to be demolished to make way for essential services to serve the population in general. Here
        again, the RSCG methodology offers a pre-existing process which can be adapted by the trained staff in Mayors’
        offices, the DPC and Central Government departments.

This chapter focuses on program design and describes the mechanisms which must be established and the strategic
choices which must be taken before the implementation phase which is described in Chapter 7. This chapter is divided
into the following sections:
        6.1 Some Key Questions to Consider before Implementing RSCG Programs

6.1 Some Key Questions before Considering RSCG Programs

When considering the use of an RSCG program, it will be useful to review the following list of questions. When
examining these questions, it is essential that participatory involvement and feedback from the displaced population
play a significant role in driving the strategic decision making on how to prioritize resources.

Establish the Profile of the Displacement
 Has the population been displaced in a rural or an urban environment? Urban environments where land is in short
    supply will be more likely to require an RSCG program to complement durable housing solutions.
 If given technical support, can the population return to their original homes, or is return impossible in the short
    term? If large numbers of the displaced population do not have access to their homes or land, then this will likely
    increase the number of families for whom the appropriate housing solution is rented accommodation supported
    through an RSCG program.
 How long will it take to deliver durable housing solutions? If durable solutions will take a long time coming on line
    and conditions in camp are below Sphere standards, an RSCG program may be an appropriate tool for providing
    interim housing solutions.
 At what level should the RSCG be set? The grant given to families should be based on an analysis of average rent for
    low-cost housing in the relevant area. (See Section 6.2 Role of Government)
 Are sufficient low-income rental housing units available? A survey of available rental stock is a useful tool to
    establish the feasibility of an RSCG program. However, the most effective way of monitoring the availability of
    rental stock is to establish a pilot program and track the average price of rent paid to landlords by beneficiaries of
    the RSCG program. (See Haiti Case Study FAQs in Section 5.)
 Will the RSCG program cause rental inflation? (See Haiti Case Study FAQs in Section 5.)

Establish the Housing Profile of the Displaced Population
 What was the housing profile of the displaced population prior to displacement?
        o What percentage were owner-occupiers?
        o What percentage were not owners but had access to a piece of land for construction?
        o What percentage were renters with no access to land or property?

Establish the Housing Solution Preferences of the Displaced Population
 When surveyed and offered a choice of housing solutions, what percentage of families indicated a preference for:
        o New house reconstruction
        o Housing repair


RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                     31
        o   Technical support for owner-driven repair
        o   Host family support
        o   Rental Support Cash Grants
        o   Other (for a full list of housing options see Shelter After Disaster: Strategies for Transitional Settlement and
            Reconstruction)

On the Basis of the Information Assessed Above, Analyze the Need for an RSCG Program
 If large numbers of families have no access to land or a home in need of repair, then an RSCG program may prove
    necessary to provide a viable housing solution outside the camp for the displaced population.
 By contrast, if large numbers of families in camp were owner-occupiers, can return to their homes and express a
    preference for repair and reconstruction, then in order to close camps it may be necessary to concentrate on
    durable solutions. However, even in this case, if closing camps is a strategic goal, the remaining families cannot be
    left behind in camp, so a small RSCG program may be required as a complement to housing repair and
    reconstruction programs.
 For more on the role of RSCG programs in closing camps, see Section 4 Context and Section 5 Haiti Case Study.

Where Do RSCG Programs Fit in the Broader Housing and Development Strategy?
 There will always be tension between, on the one hand, helping families out of camps in the short term and, on the
  other hand, building durable solutions to address a housing shortage. (See Section 6.2 Role of Government.)
 Is closing camps a strategic priority? In some circumstances, the goal of closing entire camps is a legitimate
  humanitarian priority. (See FAQ 4 in Section 5 Haiti Case Study.)
 How much funding is going to be available for housing solutions? If funds are limited, it may be that durable
  solutions (which are relatively expensive) can only be provided for a small percentage of the displaced population.
  In this case, it may be judged preferable to offer a less-expensive, shorter-term housing solution such as an RSCG to
  a larger number of beneficiaries. Helping more families for a limited period may prove a more equitable use of
  funding than providing durable homes for only a small proportion of those in need.

6.2 The Role of Government
Leadership from national and local Government is central to the success of RSCG programs. National Governments are
best placed to make many of the key strategic choices and lead the coordination of Implementing Agencies in
standardizing elements of RSCG programs.

When planning RSCG programs, consideration might be given by Governments to the following issues:
            6.2.1.    Defining and standardizing the cash value of the RSCG given to each family
            6.2.2.    Defining and standardizing the duration of rental contracts
            6.2.3.    Standardizing ‘keep the change’ approach

6.2.1. Defining and Standardizing the Cash Value of the RSCG Given to Each Family: Families living in camps may
prove resistant to working with one Implementing Agency if they believe that another Implementing Agency will
provide a larger cash grant. The value set by Government should be calculated with reference to average rental prices



RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                       32
for low-cost housing. Once fixed, the cash value of the rental grant should be standardized across all Implementing
Agencies and publicly advertised.

6.2.2. Defining and Standardizing the Duration of Rental Contracts: The Government should standardize the rental
contract signed by renters and landlords as part of RSCG programs. Included in the standard contract should be a
standardized fixed term rental (commonly fixed at one year).

6.2.3. Standardizing ‘Keep the Change’ Approach: The Government should ensure that all Implementing Agencies
agree to allow families to ‘keep the change’ if the families are able to negotiate a rental price below the value of the
rental support cash grant. If families are not given the opportunity to benefit from price negotiations, rental markets
can be negatively affected and inflationary pressure caused because a flat price is paid by all families regardless of the
standard of the accommodation. To combat inflation in rental property prices, the ‘keep the change’ approach
harnesses the bargaining power of individuals to exert downward pressure on prices.

6.2.4. Standardizing Rental Housing Safety Standards: The third step of the operational process described in Section
7.3 involves Implementing Agency staff visiting each family’s proposed rental property. One goal of that visit is to
undertake an assessment of the building to establish if it is safe. At a Governmental level, decisions are required to
establish minimum standards for the quality of housing into which families can move. There are valid concerns about
the safety standards of rental accommodation in the private sector rental market, but the task of technically assessing
the safety of every building into which camp residents move may be too technically great to be financially feasible.

In some contexts, it may be more appropriate to use a model of safety assessment which puts the emphasis on personal
responsibility and provides information for families to check for themselves on the safety of the building – just as they
would if they were renting a property with their own funds, without external financial support. This issue of safety and
responsibility is a difficult one on which Government should provide clear guidelines and which Implementing Agencies
should not make independently.

6.2.5. Identifying and Enforcing ‘Red Zone’ Areas Where No Buildings are Safe for Rental: One step Governments can
take to simplify questions of housing safety is to perform (or direct international partners to provide) environmental risk
assessments. Risk assessments bring together assessments on the likelihood of damage from flood earthquakes and
other environmental risks. On the basis of these assessments, houses in areas of high risk ‘Red Zones’ can be excluded
wholesale, reducing the burden on RSCG programs to assess individual houses in those zones.

6.2.6. Prioritizing Beneficiaries – by Family or by Camp: In cases of large-scale displacement, it is highly unlikely that
all families living in camps can be helped straight away. The Government will need to lead a discussion about how to
prioritize which families will be targeted first. The first step in this prioritization is to choose either families or camps as
the unit of analysis:
          Family by Family: Analyze the vulnerability of individual families and prioritize first the most vulnerable
              families within camps. Some families in a camp will be assisted while others are not.
          Camp by Camp: Analyze the vulnerability of entire camps as a whole. Prioritize first the most vulnerable
              camps and assist 100% of the population in the selected camps.

The family by family approach tends to be slower and more labor-intensive. Family by family assessments can be locally
unpopular since neighbors in the same camp will receive different treatment. The vast majority of RSCG programs
studied adopted the second approach: selecting priority camps and assisting 100% of families in those camps.
Logistically, it is far easier to scale up and achieve economies of scale if rental solutions are made available to the entire

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                           33
population of a camp at the same time. Moreover, if closing displacement camps is a goal, this is only possible if 100%
of a camp’s population is offered a housing solution at the same time.

6.2.7. Standardizing Vulnerability Criteria: Regardless of whether families or entire camps are the unit for analysis,
there must be agreed criteria for assessing the vulnerability of families. Given the sensitivity of deciding which families
will and will not receive assistance, the Government will need to be heavily involved in establishing and publishing the
vulnerability criteria.

6.2.8. Preventing Illegal Evictions: In circumstances where displacement is likely to be protracted because of the scale
of the emergency or other factors, there is likely to be an eventual strain on the relationship between IDPs and the
owners of the land on which they have settled. The government has a responsibility to ensure that the rights of the
displaced are respected, while also acknowledging that these rights can compromise the right of landowners to free and
unrestrained use of their property.


The government’s first role is to stress the importance of the rule of law and that no extra-legal methods of eviction are
acceptable. Any eviction of persons from public or private land must be enacted through the appropriate legal means.15

Governments should consider establishing a forum or some other mechanism for directly engaging with landowners to
discuss their valid concerns – in some cases, landowners have legitimate fears about whether they will ever get their
land back. This forum can be used to educate landowners on the rights of the displaced persons on their land.

RSCG programs can prove a very useful advocacy tool during these discussions because these programs demonstrate to
landowners that there is a legitimate and legal method for closing camps and returning land to its owner. (See Section 5
Context of the Haiti Case Study and Section 6.2.8 in the Haiti Case Study.)

However, it is essential to stress to landlords that it is not acceptable to initiate their own bastardised rental support
programs by simply offering IDPs on their land cash in exchange for leaving. As this Manual demonstrates, RSCG
programs are defined not by the cash provided, but by the legal, operational and protection steps which frame the
process.

6.2.9. Standardizing Data Collection: In order to successfully coordinate, monitor and evaluate the successes and
failures of RSCG programs across a city or a country, there is some data that should be collected in standardized form
and centralized by the Government or an agency deputized on their behalf. Key data points to be collected for every
grant includes:
          Name and National ID number of beneficiaries. This information can be used to minimize the chances of
             beneficiaries moving from one camp to another in an attempt to receive multiple cash grants.
          GPS coordinates of every rental property and the price paid for one year of rent. This information can be
             used to track rental prices in each area of the city and identify possible inflationary trends in rental prices.

For an example of the categories of data useful to collect, see Annex 1. RSCG Registration Data Collection Spreadsheet.


HAITI CASE STUDY

This section gives some detail on how each of the strategic choices listed above was addressed by the Government of
Haiti and its partners implementing RSCG programs in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

15
     Note that legal eviction procedures are sometimes necessary as part of RSCG programs. See Section 7.5 Camp Closure
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                        34
6.2.1. Defining and Standardizing the Cash Value of the RSCG Given to Each Family: Initially, several agencies
implementing RSCG programs were offering different cash grant amounts. The Government of Haiti’s UCLBP stepped in
and established standardized amounts.
                 $500 USD per family (local value 20,000 Haitian gourdes)
                 $25 USD per family for transport and moving costs.
                 $125 USD per family if the family is still in the rental property six-eight weeks later when the team
                    makes a surprise visit. This cash grant is unconditional and can be spent as the family chooses.

6.2.2 Defining and Standardizing the Duration of Rental Contracts: All rental contracts signed as part of RSCG
programs in Haiti were signed for a standard rental period of one year. At the end of the year, families were responsible
for providing their own housing solution, as they had done prior to the earthquake.

An independent report found that after one year, 25% of grantees remain in the same rental accommodation for a
second year using their own funds; 75% choose to move to alternative accommodation. Of the sample of families
interviewed, “no grantees have returned to camps and 100% have autonomously found an accommodation solution” 16.

6.2.3 Standardizing ‘Keep the Change’ Approach: A key concern raised in the program design stage was that if the
Haitian Government and big international donors were seen to be involved in renting property, there would be an
inevitable spike in rent prices. To limit as much as possible this potential rental inflation, the natural self‐interest of each
family was engaged as a tool. If the rent negotiated was $400 – the family received the remaining $100 in cash to spend
as they deemed most appropriate for their family. Some families spent the remainder on food, education or household
improvements. Others, no doubt, spent in other ways, as was their free choice.

6.2.4 Standardizing Rental Housing Safety Standards: One of the frequently asked questions about this part of the
Haiti RSCG programs was about the safety of rental housing. There were valid concerns about the quality of the housing
in the neighborhoods to which families are returning.

As a first step, RSCG programs relied on assessments of each rental property which had been conducted as part of a
previous program of housing safety verification by Government engineers after the earthquake. Most buildings in Port-
au-Prince were assessed and a stamp painted on the walls with green, yellow or red paint defining the building as safe,
in need of some repair, or in need of major repair or demolition.

During the RSCG visit, each rental house was checked for a Government engineer’s Green stamp. For houses that had
no stamp, or had been repaired or painted, it was difficult to make an assessment, so the staff members involved were
given some flexibility to use common sense. The best practice was from agencies which hired engineers to re‐assess
each house, though this took longer and was therefore more costly. For other Implementing Agencies, the staff visiting
each house was not technically qualified to assess the risk, but made a best assessment. If families proposed to move
into a house with a yellow or red stamp, the Implementing Agency denied the request and instructed the family to find
another property.

As time went on, more and more houses were encountered with no stamp at all – either because the walls had been
repainted or because an unofficial and technically unverifiable repair had been done by the family. While it was not
encouraged, there were undoubtedly some cases where no stamp was visible and staff exercised their judgment, rightly

or wrongly, on the safety of the house. Ideally, these borderline calls would be checked by an engineer, but some
programs did not have the resources to achieve that.

All programs entailed risk management decisions and some programs made the decision to allow buildings that did not
have a green stamp if they ostensibly looked safe. This involved devolving some risk management responsibility on to
the families themselves after clear communication on the possible risks. A short film to communicate these risks was
created and shown to all beneficiaries of the Government-led 16/6 program (see Section 7.2 Communication).

As well as trying to ensure that families move back to safe housing, there was a concurrent, longer-term effort to
improve building standards across the construction industry in Haiti. Through initiatives, including the Government‐led
16/6 program, newly-established building standards were widely advertised and large‐scale training programs were
established to train masons and other construction workers on safe housing materials and building techniques.

6.2.5 Identifying and Enforcing ‘Red Zone’ Areas Where No Buildings are Safe for R ental: The Government of Haiti’s
UCLBP worked with UN Agencies to produce an environmental risk mapping of key areas of Port-au-Prince. These maps
overlaid data on a street-by-street level showing the risk of flooding, landslides and earthquakes. On the basis of these
and other analyses, the Government established ‘Red Zones’ of the city where no properties could be rented by families
using rental grants.

6.2.6 Prioritizing Camp by Camp (not Family by Family): In Haiti, a decision was made early on to assess the
population's vulnerability and needs using camps as the unit of analysis. In other words, if a camp was judged to be a
priority for assistance, 100% the families inside that camp would benefit from a RSCG program.

It proved far easier to analyze priorities camp by camp than family by family. The approach of assisting 100% of families
in a chosen camp and thereby being able to close the camp was found to exponentially reduce the logistical and
financial costs of RSCG programs.

A small minority of small-scale programs targeted vulnerable families within camps without providing support for other

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                      36
families in the camp. However, identifying and assisting the most vulnerable among such a large displaced population,
almost all of whom were extremely poor, proved difficult, time-consuming and unpopular with camp residents who
were not selected for assistance.

6.2.7 Standardizing Vulnerability Criteria: The Government decided to assess vulnerability and prioritize the
vulnerable on a camp by camp basis, rather than family by family. The family by family approach was far slower,
unfeasibly labor-intensive to assess and was locally unpopular since neighbors in the same camp did not accept the idea
of some people in the camp receiving assistance to leave while others were left waiting. The Government and
Implementing Agencies therefore drew up together a list of criteria for prioritizing camps. The process of analysis used
four measures:
     Risk: vulnerability to environmental risks such as landslides and flooding.
     Security: level of security risk to the camp population. Initially, some camps were judged to be too dangerous
        to work in. Later, once the RSCG methodology was robust and large numbers of staff had more training and
        field experience, it was then possible to bring RSCG programs to larger camps and camps with greater security
        risks for staff.
     Public Utility: camps on public parks were prioritized initially to allow parks to re-open and thereby increase the
        benefit of camp closure to the population more broadly.
     Eviction List: some camps were prioritized because the displaced population was under an elevated threat of
        forced eviction by landlords.17

On the basis of a weighting of these four factors, a list of over 100 priority camps was drawn up. The Government
encouraged humanitarian agencies and donors to work first in these camps and required Implementing Agencies to
seek approval through the UCLBP before starting an RSCG program in any camp.

6.2.8 Preventing Illegal Evictions of IDPs: The decision to prioritize camps under threat of eviction was a sensitive
one. There was a concern that if the threat of eviction was one of the criteria used to prioritize camps for closure
through RSCG programs, this might encourage landlords to threaten eviction in order to elevate camps on their land to
the top of the priority list.
However, the evidence from Haiti points in the opposite direction – illegal evictions from camps were considerably
higher before rather than after RSCG programs began to scale up in summer 2011.

  The decision to prioritize camps under threat of eviction was a sensitive one. There was a concern that if the threat of eviction
was one of the criteria used to prioritize camps for closure through RSCG programs, this might encourage landlords to threaten
eviction in order to elevate camps on their land to the top of the priority list. However, some evidence from Haiti points in the
opposite direction – illegal evictions from camps were considerably higher before than after RSCG programs began to scale up in
summer 2011. (See Section 6.2.8 )
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                                    37
                                Source: CCCM/Shelter Cluster Report on Evictions in Haiti August 2012


RSCG programs may in fact have helped reduce illegal evictions because they provided a legitimate legal mechanism by
which entire camps could be closed. By giving a housing solution to 100% of families in camps, they finally provided a
legal mechanism for camp closure which could be scaled up sufficiently to offer the realistic prospect to landlords that
their land would be returned through legal means.

Indeed, there were several cases of wealthy landowners who had threatened and carried out evictions on some plots of
their land who subsequently approached the Government of Haiti offering to co-fund RSCG programs in order to
responsibly participate in a legal camp closure.

6.2.9 Standardizing Data Collection: In order to successfully coordinate, monitor and evaluate the successes and
failures of RSCG programs across a city or a country, the Government insisted as far as possible that Implementing
Agencies collected and submitted some key data.

The most important data collected was the GPS coordinates of every rental property and the price paid for one year of
rent (as discussed in FAQ 2 in Section 4 Context.) This allowed the Government and its partners to manage the possible
risk of rental price inflation by tracking average rental prices overall and in specific areas of Port-au-Prince. If average
rental prices had ever risen above $500 USD, the Government and its partners were willing to consider increasing the
standard value of the rental support cash grant. However, this did not prove necessary as average rents remained
consistently below $500 USD. In fact, average prices slightly decreased in 2013 compared with 2011 and 2012.

Further study is required to establish whether RSCG programs have stimulated private sector investment in low-cost
rental property, contributing to the increase in supply which has allowed prices to remain low despite over nearly
40,000 families moving out of camps into rental housing with the help of RSCG programs.

6.3 Protection and Assistance for the Vulnerable
Given the sensitivities involved in any displacement of large numbers of people, issues of protection are core to any
RSCG program. Protection is mainstreamed into all steps of the process, starting with the very first interaction with each
family at registration when heads of households are asked if they have any members of their family in need of extra
assistance either to access the RSCG program or in general. Health, psychosocial support and protection teams work
actively in the camp to assess family needs and either offer direct assistance or refer families to local service providers.

The work of the Protection Teams achieves two goals: Firstly they provide a bespoke service for a small minority of
families in order to ensure that 100% of families can access RSCG programs. Secondly, the Protection Teams take care of
all unusual and complex cases, which allows the process to be significantly streamlined for all other families to maximize
efficiency, minimize waiting times and reduce the overall cost of the program.


Methodology
When implementing RSCG programs, consideration might be given to the following:
  i.  During the registration process, families are asked if one or more family members has special needs. After
      families self-identify during the registration process, a trained Protection Team member then carries out a visit
      to the family’s tent to establish what assistance is required. A tailored solution is agreed so that the family has
      access to the RSCG program and to any additional services they require. The Protection Team assists families
      with a wide variety of needs which may include:
           an elderly family member
           a family member with reduced mobility
           a blind family member
           a family member with an acute or terminal illness
           a family member suffering from psychological trauma

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                       39
             single parent families with a large number of children
             families with children who display risk indicators of malnourishment
             pregnant women
             unaccompanied minors
  ii.   Families who need assistance are assigned to a trained Protection Team to ensure that they get equal access to
        the RSCG program.
 iii.   Families with chronic or terminal health needs are referred to a dedicated Health team.
 iv.    Families with psychosocial needs are referred to a dedicated Psychosocial Support team.
  v.    Families in need of women or child protection services are referred to that dedicated team.
 vi.    Assistance continues even after the relocation either in the form of direct support, or through ensuring that
        vulnerable people are connected to service providers in their new neighborhood.

Challenges to Consider

1. Finding the right solution for each family takes time and effort: One of the undeniably expensive elements of the
   program, but one which is absolutely essential, is that case work is required to adequately respond to the individual
   needs of each family. Tent by tent, family by family, unique circumstance by circumstance, finding the right housing
   solution takes time, effort and resources.

2. Identifying and overcoming impediments for a family completing the RSCG process: To ensure RSCG programs
   achieve universal access it is necessary to give extra support to some families. Some of the most vulnerable families
   encounter impediments to accessing RSCG programs and these impediments must be overcome through
   personalized care if the program is to succeed in providing even the most vulnerable with a rental housing solution.

3. Protection issues beyond the RSCG program: The basic needs of some of the most vulnerable families extend well
   beyond the need for housing. While RSCG programs cannot address every issue for every family, there is a duty of
   care to do as much as possible to assist vulnerable families. This can be done directly or by connecting families to
   third parties who can provide assistance across a range of issues. This may involve offering or connecting to services
   such as:
        Training on the rights of the displaced living in camps
        Replacing lost identity documentation
        Healthcare support for chronic illness
        Psychosocial support


HAITI CASE STUDY

Actors Involved in Protection and Assistance for the Vulnerable:
    Affected Population
    Implementing Agency Protection, Health and Psychosocial Teams
    Haitian National Police
    A wide variety of third party service providers including local women’s groups; counseling services; women’s
        safe houses; nutrition programs; counter-trafficking organizations; local organizations supporting the elderly.

The work of the Protection Teams in Haiti fell into three categories. Firstly, they provided a bespoke service for a small
minority of families in order to ensure that 100% of families can access RSCG programs. Secondly, the Protection Teams
managed all unusual and complex cases, which allowed the process to be significantly streamlined for all other families
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                     40
to maximize efficiency, minimize waiting times and reduce the overall cost of the program. Thirdly, Protection Teams
endeavored to provide or find a third party who could provide ongoing services even after the relocation.

1. Ensuring 100% Access
The first role of the Protection Teams is to provide assistance to families with a family member who is elderly, disabled,
chronically unwell or psychologically traumatized. One of the simplest, but most important roles of the Protection
Teams was ensuring that families understood the process. Despite the best efforts at beneficiary communications, there
will always be people who are left confused until a team member personally explains and guides them through the
process. This commitment to finding the right solution for each family is the defining characteristic in the Haitian model
differentiating these programs from past examples of one-size-fits-all cash transfer programs.

Implementing Agencies specifically trained Protection Teams to accompany families on the visit to verify the safety and
suitability of each rental property. Beyond the standard safety checks the team also assessed the property in light of the
specific needs of the vulnerable family. For example, some properties chosen by families which would generally have
been acceptable were rejected if the family had failed to consider that access was difficult for a disabled family
member.

Helping Single Parents: Single parents found it difficult to leave camp in order to search for accommodation because of
a lack of child care options. Protection Teams offered to find a property on behalf of families or arranged visits in a
larger car which could accommodate bringing the children.

Large Families: The protection team had a budget to assist families with large numbers of children. If the family unit
was larger than seven people, a double grant ($1,000 US Dollars) was given so that the family could find a house large
enough to accommodate them.

2. Providing Protection Assistance Beyond the RSCG Program
Even after families had identified a rental property, Protection Team members stayed involved for the time needed to
assist vulnerable families with other needs. This was done in some cases through direct assistance, but most often by
connecting the family to third parties who provided services such as those described below.

Training on the Human Rights: Some Rental Support Cash Grant and camp closure programs addressed the need for
increased rights awareness by training camp residents to improve their understanding of their rights. Heads of
households and at least one person in each household who could read and write were offered training on their rights.
The training included information on rights in general, the rights of displaced populations, the specific rights of
beneficiaries within framework of the camp closure program, and finally their rights as renters in the future.

Replacing Lost Identity Documentation: Working in the camps, the teams encountered a large number of people who
lost identification documents in the earthquake, or never owned them to begin with. Families who did not have
identification documents and were unable to receive a cash grant from a bank were shepherded through a specialized
service by a member of staff. These people were also referred to services run by third party organizations which
specialize in helping people get access to Haitian Government identity documentation.

Sexual Health Education and Family Planning: The average age of the population in camps was extremely low, a
situation driven in part by a phenomenon of teenagers and other young men and women leaving their family home
earlier than was usual before the earthquake and moving into camp in order to live alone or set up home with a
girlfriend/boyfriend. As a result, camp populations and RSCG beneficiaries were particularly in need of education on

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                     41
sexual health and family planning.

Livelihoods and Building Soft Skills: There is a growing recognition of the importance of “soft skills” in helping people to
be successful in finding and retaining a paying job. Soft skills increase a person’s capacity to make choices and translate
them into desired actions and outcomes. This promotion of increased agency can be especially effective when working
with vulnerable populations such as young women in fragile settings.

Through the Adolescent Girl Initiative (AGI) pilot program run by the World Bank and partners in Haiti, young women
belonging to households targeted by the Rental Support Cash Grant program18 receive training in eight core soft skills
modules which are specifically tailored to the Haitian context. The topics include self-esteem, professional development
and work ethic, civic engagement and leadership, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence, disaster
preparedness, financial literacy, and living with a disability.

The soft skills training was provided in parallel with technical professional training and a monthly stipend of around
USD$40 to cover the cost of transportation and food. Upon completion of the technical and soft skills training, the
young women participated in a one-month long internship in a company to further refine their skills and boost their
professional experience to facilitate entry into local labor markets.

Early results of this limited pilot suggest that adding soft-skill training to traditional technical training led to higher
satisfaction and well-being measurements as well as a three-fold or four-fold reduction in drop-out rates.

Health and Psychosocial Support for the Vulnerable: As part of the Government-led 16/6 Program, IOM Health Team
staff worked in camps providing health services including: preventive health; health education and information; medical
assistance; and psychosocial assistance to families identified as particularly vulnerable through the camp closure
program.

Health and Psychosocial teams were present from the start of the registration process reviewing each family’s
application to identify vulnerable families and later working pro-actively in camp to identify any other vulnerable
families. Once vulnerable families had been identified, they were assessed by qualified staff able to recognize
psychological distress symptoms, as well as identify people who might require additional assistance to find a new home
such as the elderly and those with chronic disease.

After the distress of the earthquake, many camp residents had very real fears about moving back into a permanent
structure. The idea of sleeping under a concrete roof was terrifying to many people who had lost family and friends, or
been trapped themselves in the rubble. Psychological support groups helped individuals to process and mentally and
emotional prepare for a return to permanent housing structures.

The health team provided medical consultations, wound care and referral to medical facilities including through
transportation allowance, medication and payment for laboratory tests. For a very limited number of beneficiaries
(fewer than 1%) medical insurance could be provided.

The team was also able to provide non-food items (NFIs) such as mosquito nets, blankets, mattresses, solar torches,
hygiene and kitchen kits, mops and chlorine water purification tablets to the most vulnerable families.

  The AGI program was coupled with a RSCG program through a World Bank funded project targeting displaced populations in the
Petion Ville Golf Club Camp in Delmas, Haiti.

Families who required it received some form of psychosocial assistance, either one to one or as part of support groups
created for camp residents. Through RSCG programs, hundreds of families have received some form of psychosocial
support and a number of the most acute patients have been referred for treatment at a local psychiatric center.

Using RSCG Programs to Improve WASH: RSCG programs can provide a framework upon which complementary
programming such as increased access to WASH facilities can be built. In Haiti, given the cholera outbreak, it would have
been particularly desirable to return families to homes with access to water and sanitation. Ideally, access to WASH
would have been one of the eligibility criteria for the rental properties. Yet, this integration of WASH and RSCG
programming was rare. WASH activities were already underway before RSCG programs were instituted and were often
focused on camps, rather than areas of return.

However, there were small-scale examples of successful RSCG programs such as the IOM program for Jean-Marie
Vincent camp which included the building, repair or retrofitting of latrines at or close to rental homes chosen by
families. With better coordination between RSCG and WASH actors, programs to improve WASH could usefully be
included in RSCG programs from the start in future emergencies.

3. Increasing Overall RSCG Program Efficiency
Protection activities were essential in and of themselves to ensure access for all. However, when used strategically, the
protection activities described above also proved extremely successful in creating greater speed and efficiency for the
program overall.

By identifying families in need of extra assistance early in the process it was possible to provide them with bespoke
services through a dedicated team. This helped individual families with special needs, and allowed the Implementing
Agencies to streamline the main RSCG process for all the families which did not have special needs.

For example, when IOM began implementing RSCG programs in Haiti in 2010, the wait time for each beneficiary was
four weeks between filling out the application form and moving into a new home. By June 2013, the process for families
receiving special treatment from the Protection Team was 18 days. This allowed the team to streamline the process for
all other families and reduce the same process to an average seven days.

Providing a Feedback Loop to Help Implementing Team Understand Beneficiary Concerns: Finally, it is worth noting
that Protection Team members, through their conversations with the most vulnerable families in camps, had the most
contact with beneficiaries. Protection Team members provided an essential feedback loop to make the program
management team aware of problems or beneficiary concerns.


6.4      Grievance and Appeal Procedures
There are weaknesses to any beneficiary registration process, no matter how well-planned and executed. Even if every
possible precaution is taken, there will always be cases of families who were longstanding residents of a camp, but who
for quite legitimate reasons were not in the camp on the morning of the registration. As a result, Grievance and Appeals
mechanisms are essential to give families the chance to plead a case and dispute their exclusion from the Beneficiary
List.

The absolutely essential feature of any Grievance and Appeals process is that, wherever possible, Government
authorities rather than Implementing Agencies should be responsible for distinguishing cases of families in genuine
need from those who are seeking to benefit fraudulently.

Methodology
When implementing this element of RSCG programs, consideration might be given to the following steps:
    i. The Grievance and Appeals Process begins as soon as the Beneficiary List is published in a public place after the
       registration process. (For a detailed description of the process of creating this initial list, see Section 5.1
       Registration.)
   ii. Families who are not on the registration list and wish to appeal their case can sign up at the designated office
       for Grievance and Appeals.
  iii. A deadline is set for all applications and clearly communicated in the camp.
  iv.  The Grievance and Appeals decision process will ideally include input from local government, central
       government and the Implementing Agency with staff in the camp.
   v.  After the deadline has passed, an Arbitration List is published showing all families who are not on the Initial
       Beneficiary List but are now part of the Grievance Process.
  vi.  The Implementing Agency interviews the family, helps them to fill out a standardized form detailing the
       circumstances of the appeal and documenting any evidence.
 vii.  The Implementing Agency makes an initial recommendation.
viii.  All paperwork and evidence are sent to the appropriate central and local government representatives.
  ix.  If there is a disagreement or any outstanding questions, the case is discussed in a meeting of all members of the
       Grievance and Appeals team (Central Government, Local Government, Implementing Agency).
   x.  The team makes a final decision.
  xi.  The Arbitration List is republished with the decision for each family marked.
 xii.  An Agency member of staff informs each family individually of the decision.
xiii.  A new Final Beneficiary List is published which now includes those families whose cases were successfully
       appealed.

Challenges to Consider

    1. Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion from the Beneficiary List: Creating a final beneficiary list can be an
       overwhelming challenge. This is particularly the case if RSCG programs are being set up in camps in a dense
       urban setting where camps have porous borders, people move in and out freely and where it can prove very
       difficult to distinguish between, on the one hand, the urban poor and, on the other, families who were actually
       displaced by an emergency.
       It is essential that all stakeholders agree in advance on the criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Ideally, these
       criteria should be publicly displayed in the camp.
    2. Communicating with Every Family: It is the job of the Implementing Agency and the local authorities to ensure
       that every individual who appeals should have their decision personally communicated to them. In the case of a
       rejected appeal, it is essential that each person is provided with the reason that the decision was made.
    3. What Happens to Those Whose Appeals for Inclusion are Rejected: The most sensitive moment in a RSCG
       program is often the moment at which the camp is almost entirely empty because all families on the Beneficiary
       List have left. It can be the case that there are families who had their appeal rejected (for any one of the
       reasons above) but who still refuse to leave camp. At this point, it is likely the case that these families are now
       illegally occupying the land in the eyes of the law. As a result, legal proceedings will be initiated by the local
       authorities to remove the family and their tent. Implementing Agencies have no jurisdiction, but may in some
       cases choose to be present as observers to document that the legal eviction takes place in accordance with legal
       norms and human rights standards.

HAITI CASE STUDY

Actors Involved in Grievance and Appeals Procedures:
    Affected Population
    Mayor
    UCLBP
    Implementing Agency
    Justice of the Peace
    Department of Civil Protection
    Police

To give an indicative idea of the numbers of families using the Grievance and Appeals mechanism in Haiti, below are the
figures from the grievance process which was set up as part of the RSCG program which helped every family in one of
Haiti’s largest camps, Champs de Mars.
     4,684 families were registered in Champs de Mars and their names published on a Beneficiary List at the start of
          the program. By the end of the program all these families had left the camp after receiving assistance to find
          rental accommodation.
     215 families initially excluded from the Beneficiary List registered their case with the Grievance and Appeals
          process. Of those,
     180 cases were rejected after arbitration by a joint team including the Mayor’s Office, the UCLBP and the
          Implementing Agency IOM.
     35 cases were accepted. These 35 families were added to the Beneficiary List and were then assisted as normal
          through the process to find rented accommodation.
     16% of families who registered their case with the grievance process were granted access to the program.

Government Leadership of the Process
In Haiti, after several iterations, it was found that the most successful organizational structure for the Grievance and
Appeals process involved three complementary organizations working together: The central Government’s Housing and
Reconstruction Unit (UCLBP), the Mayor and the Implementing Agency.
Role of the Mayor’s Office: As the elected local representative, the Mayor was accepted by the population as an
appropriate final arbiter on each family’s eligibility for the RSCG program. Seven Mayors governed areas of the city of
Port-au-Prince where substantial displaced populations were being assisted using RSCG programs. As a result, each
Mayor’s office needed separately to build capacity and assign staff to take on the responsibilities required.
Role of Central Government - Building Capacity to Manage the Grievance Process: Recognizing the financial and
staffing challenge this represented for each Mayor, the UCLBP hired staff and built a central capacity to deal specifically
with the grievance and appeals process. These staff members had hands on experience of successfully running the
grievance process for the Champs de Mars program and were therefore perfectly placed to offer capacity-building
support to Mayors’ offices.

Criteria for Inclusion: Balancing a Systematic Approach with Common Sense Flexibility
The criteria for a successful application through the process of mediation were relatively strict, but were not 100% fixed
in order to empower the grievance and arbitration teams on the ground to make common-sense decisions.

In general, families had a better chance of success in the arbitration process if they had a registration card showing that
they had been present for previous registrations in the months prior to the final registration. These families had at one
time been living in the camp, but were not therefore present on the day of the registration. These families were
required to provide a feasible explanation for their absence on the day of the registration. Some families were also
asked, as part of the process, to show the tent where they currently live in the camp since it is relatively easy to tell with

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                         45
a practiced eye if a tent has only recently been occupied or has been occupied long term.

A degree more flexibility was shown for particularly vulnerable families (such as the handicapped). To take one
example, there was a family in Champs de Mars camp with a large number of children who were quite obviously
malnourished. Even though this family could not prove that they had lived in the camp prior to the registration, the
decision was made to include the family in the program given their severe level of vulnerability.

Ineligible Families
The most difficult aspect of the Grievance Process is dealing with families whose appeals were not successful. These are
people who have been found to not truly be resident in camp who were attempting to fraudulently benefit from a
RSCG.

The tents occupied by these families are marked with paint and notice is formally served in writing that the tent must
be dismantled and vacated. The official notice paperwork delivered to each family includes:
     The reason for the rejection of the appeal.
     The stipulated timeframe within which the tent must be vacated.
     Options for further legal recourse against the administrative decision taken.

Legal Eviction Procedures
The vast majority of families were willing to accept the final decision of the Mayor on their appeal for inclusion in the
RSCG program. In a small minority of cases, the judiciary and police finally became involved in enforcing a legal eviction
procedure. The eviction process followed the legal norms and standards established in the 2004 legislation, PORTANT
SUR L’organisation et Le fonctionnement des COMMUNES.

As part of building capacity, the UCLBP organized special refresher training on the legal process of eviction for Mayoral
staff and staff from the Department for Civil Protection. This formed part of the broader training on the Grievance and
Appeals Process.

                                       7. Operational Implementation

To give a full explanation of the RSCG process, this section details the operational steps involved. For each step, there is
a recommended methodology, an indication of challenges to consider and a detailed case study based on the Haiti
experience where this methodology was developed.



7.1     Registration and Establishing a Beneficiary List
Once the decision has been taken to implement a RSCG program in a particular camp, the first challenge is to establish
which families are genuinely resident in the camp, legitimately in need and eligible for assistance. Given the financial
incentives on offer, some families from the surrounding area are likely to attempt to make the false claim that they live
in camp. This is particularly challenging in the middle of densely populated urban areas where camps can be ill-defined
with porous borders and many access points enabling a constant flow of people in and out.



Methodology
When attempting to produce an accurate list of the families actually living in a camp, consideration might be given to
the following steps which have been developed iteratively in a number of country contexts:
     i.  Registration is not announced in advance. It takes place before dawn to ensure surprise and to minimize the
         possibility that camp residents have already left for work. Starting before dawn also minimizes the chance of
         erroneously registering people who are not camp residents but who might seek to fraudulently claim residence.
    ii.  Security is provided by local police or appropriate Governmental forces.
   iii.  To the extent possible, the camp is cordoned off so that people from the surrounding neighborhood cannot
         enter. This is almost invariably a challenge in an urban context because the porous borders between camps and
         neighborhoods are blurred.
   iv.   Once inside the camp, registration teams move as quickly as possible from tent to tent. These mobile teams do
         not record names or any other details. Instead, for speed, the teams wake up families and give the head of each
         household a wristband and numbered registration card.
    v.   Every head of household is then asked to report to a registration station just outside camp where a full
         registration takes place.
   vi.   The names and ages of every member of the family are recorded along with neighborhood of origin and other
         demographic data. For an example of the categories of data useful to collect, see Annex 1. RSCG Registration
         Data Collection Spreadsheet.
  vii.   During registration, each family is asked to self-identify if there are any protection needs for one or more family
         member. A member of the specially-trained Protection Team is then sent to their tent at a later date to
         interview the family and identify any protection or special assistance needs. (For details, see Section 6.3
         Protection and Assistance for the Vulnerable.)
 viii.   After all families with wrist bands have been registered, a full Beneficiary List is published by the Mayor’s office.


Publication and Validation of the Beneficiary List by Local Authorities: To secure support among the population, it is
critical to do everything possible to make the program transparent, fair and publicly perceived as fair. A prerequisite is
for the responsible member of local government to publish the list of beneficiary families in a public place. The
government must also play the lead role in providing a fair and transparent Grievance and Appeal process to provide for
families who feel they have been unfairly excluded from the RSCG program. (See Grievance and Appeal Section.)


RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                         48
Challenges to Consider
   1. Registration Comes before Communication: If people hear in advance that a RSCG program will be starting in a
       camp, the number of people living in the camp will likely increase considerably. Non-residents move in from
       houses in the surrounding area with hopes of being registered as IDPs and therefore receiving a cash grant. As a
       result, registration is done without warning or prior consultation. This surprise approach can cause frustration,
       anxiety and confusion in camps and in surrounding communities.
   2. Creating a Pull Factor into Camps: Even after registration has taken place, there can be a considerable pull
       factor towards camps where people know an RSCG program will take place. Many camps see an increase in
       population after an RSCG program is announced, even if communication teams are stressing that only those
       present during the registration will be eligible for support.
   3. Camp Committees and Other Powerful Interests: Problems with the beneficiary list can be especially acute if
       powerful people such as camp committee members are found to live outside the camp and are therefore
       excluded from the list. This is why it is critical that a local government authority (rather than the Implementing
       Agency) is the final arbiter of who is and who is not on the beneficiary list. (See Section 6.4 Grievance and
       Appeals Process.)
   4. Leadership from Local Authorities on Creating Beneficiary Lists and Grievance and Appeals Processes: The
       success of RSCG programs is incredibly dependent on the willingness of local authorities to make the hard
       decisions on who is and who is not eligible to be on the beneficiary list. If local leadership is not strong, there
       are considerable risks to the success of the program. If local authorities are too lenient in the Grievance process,
       there can be severe budget issues for Implementing Agencies which find they have far more beneficiaries than
       initially expected in each camp.

    RSCG Implementing Agency

Developing New Technology
In response to the extraordinary task of registering tens of thousands of families and subsequently tracking them
through the process, teams in camps developed new methods using the latest technology. Innovations included using
computer-programmed drones fitted with digital cameras to get detailed maps of camps to help plan registration
activities. Some Implementing Agencies also experimented with making grant payments via the mobile phones (see
Section 5.4 Cash Payments).

The innovation which most revolutionized the process was design of bespoke smart phone applications which could be
used by staff in the field to instantly locate, browse and update an individual’s records.

            IOM’s smartphone application was used to access and update databases remotely by teams all across Port au Prince .

Using Data to Drive Efficiency: Once staff in different teams working in different locations could feed the Data
Management team real time information on daily activities, this allowed the Program Management Team to grow the
team and drive considerable economies of scale. For example, when IOM began RSCG programs in 2011, for the first six
months, the team was able to help 150 families per week to relocate from camps into rental properties. By June 2013,
the IOM team was able to relocate 2,500 families in a month with an average family’s wait time reduced from four
weeks to one week. This efficiency was driven by a combination of good data management and streamlining processes
with help from the Protection Teams. (See Section 4.3 Protection)

Early Registration in Small Camps: Initially in 2010, Implementing Agencies working in small camps (around 200 families
or fewer) developed registration methods based on getting to know every family over time. Some agencies had success
in clarifying which families were really living in the camp by doing multiple registrations, or by taking lists of residents
through distributions and other activities in camp.

One of the first programs involving Rental Support Cash Grants was implemented in Camp Oscar by Concern
Worldwide. This camp had the advantage of being relatively small (192 families) and having a strong camp
committee who took an active part in the process, helping to establish an accurate beneficiary list. One member of
the committee was hired to work as part of the team verifying application forms and highlighting those which came
from families who did not live in the camp.

While the approach in Camp Oscar was successful, it was not possible to replicate the same methodology in other
camps. The approach in Camp Oscar relied on three factors which were not common in other camps: the Implementing
Agency worked in the camp every day for one year as to develop strong community relationships; there was strong
leadership from the camp committee; and there was no insecurity.

Registration in Large Camps: To work at larger scale, the RSCG programs in Haiti required a robust registration
methodology which could be replicated across all camps regardless of their size or level of insecurity. The Standard
Registration Methodology detailed above in steps i to viii was developed from 2010-2013 through cooperation between
the Haitian Government and Implementing Agencies.

       Example of Registration Process - Champs de Mars Camp (4,600 families)
       Goal: The goal was to register the name of every head of household, the names, ages and health status of
       every member of the family and a variety of other contact and identification details.
       Challenges: The ‘camp’ known as Champs de Mars in fact comprises 11 separate camps with porous borders,
       spread over six or seven city blocks, dissected by major roads with hundreds of points of access in and out of
       the camp. This camp was also a known security “red zone” with heightened security risks.
       The process of filling in the form with each head of family takes around ten minutes, so more than a day and a
       half was required to register all the families in camp. That delay left the opportunity for hundreds more
       people to enter the camp and pose as residents during registration.
       Team: 50 staff of the Civil Protection Department of the Haitian Government, 20 staff of the Port-au-Prince
       Mayor, dozens of Haitian National Police, 50 UN Peacekeeping troops and over 150 IOM staff working as part
       of the Government’s 16/6 program.
       Technique: Given these challenges, the technique used involved using the element of surprise and moving
       quickly from tent to tent at 4am while families were asleep. The teams only paused briefly at each tent to
       issue the head of each family with a registration card and a plastic bracelet. The team member then asked the
       head of household to come later that day to register in full at one of five color-coordinated registration sites
       set up in areas in and around the camp.
       Planning the Teams’ Route Through the Camp: In order to ensure full and efficient coverage of the camp by the
       team during registration, aerial and/or satellite imagery of the camp was used in advance to organize the paths
       and establish areas of responsibility for each team.
       Follow Up: At a later date within the next week, a team member marked every tent in the camp with a unique
       number and re-verified the details of the family living in that tent.




     Satellite and drone imagery of Jean Marie Vincent Camp was analyzed by IOM to count the number of tents and divide the camp
            into areas of responsibility for the teams on the ground in preparation for the morning of the RSCG program registration

Publication and Validation of the Beneficiary List by Local Authorities
In Haiti, it was often the case that the most successful and efficient programs were those which benefited from the
strongest leadership and accountability from the elected Mayors. The Mayor’s office was the final arbiter of whether a
family was accepted or not into the program. Mayors, having made the decision on each family, then publicly published
the final list of beneficiaries at the Mayoral offices, as well as then actively lead the grievance process for families who
were not included on the initial list. (See Grievance and Appeals Procedure Section for more detail.)

Evolving Methods to Guard Against Illegitimate Claims of Camp Residency
After a certain amount of time, the population of Port-au-Prince became familiar with the registration methodology.
Some people attempted to illegitimately register for RSCG programs by counterfeiting the wrist band and registration
card handed out during the first moments of the registration process (step iv in the process described above). Using
scanners and color printers and matching the paper type, sophisticated forgeries were made and successfully used to
illegitimately gain access to cash grant programs.

Given the size of the cash grant given to each beneficiary family, any duplication of registration cards and inflation of
beneficiary figures was extremely costly. To combat this problem, the Government developed a simple, inexpensive
methodology which ensured that registration cards could no longer be duplicated.

The Government provided their project team with newly-printed, sequentially-numbered Haitian bank notes. The notes
were of the lowest denomination 10 Haitian Gourdes (worth around 25 US cents). Every registration card handed out
during the registration process was stapled to a Haitian bank note and marked with the same serial number. Attempts
to photocopy or otherwise reproduce the registration cards were now useless because the forger would also need to
counterfeit currency with a matching serial number.

7.2     Communication
In order to meet the norms and standards required when moving populations, it is fundamental for RSCG programs to
ensure that each family makes a voluntary and informed choice to move out of the camp and back into the
neighborhood. This is only possible if major time, effort and resources are invested in communication activities.

All RSCG programs must strike a balance between investing in both mass communication and one-to-one
communication. In order for RSCG programs to be successful, all residents of camps must understand and voluntarily
participate. Specifically adapted, culturally appropriate communications including material specifically adapted for the
illiterate are essential.

In post-emergency displacement contexts, it is particularly necessary to focus on two-way communication in order to
receive feedback from the affected population. This feedback is essential to improve the appropriateness of the
programs to the needs; to provide a mechanism for accountability; and to facilitate conflict resolution – both conflicts
within the population and conflicts between the population and those assisting them.


Methodology

When designing and implementing a RSCG program, it is important to consider which methods of communication will
be the most effective. A variety of messages will be conveyed during the program cycle, and in each case, choosing the
right channel is important.
    i.  Two-Way Communication is essential to ensure every family understands the program sufficiently well to
        participate. This involves training camp-based staff to work one on one or in small groups with families.
             Community mobilizers
             Public meetings
             Information kiosks
   ii.  Mass Communication channels should be used at the start of the program in each camp. The goal is to
        introduce people living in each camp to the basic concepts of RSCG programs before and in parallel with the
        personal interactions described above.

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                   53
               Newsletters
               Cartoon newspapers for the non-literate
               Radio broadcasts
               Short informational films shown at public meetings

Adapt and Target Communication Content
Regardless of the medium chosen, it is essential that the messages disseminated are simple, clear and suitably adapted
for the audience in the camps. Messaging in neighborhoods of return is also an important activity which helps mitigate
the risk that returnees are stigmatized or not accepted in their neighborhood of choice.

Communication messages may include:

        1. The basic goals of the program:
               o Housing support is available for every family registered as living in this camp.
               o Every family can choose a house to rent in the neighborhood of their choice.
               o Financial support will be given of up to $500 USD for one year of rent.
               o If the rent in the chosen property is less than $500 USD, the family “keeps the change.”
        2. The steps each family needs to take before coming to the project implementation team:
               o Identify a house which is structurally safe and located outside of identified environmentally
                   vulnerable “risk zones.”
               o Negotiate with the landlord to fix the rental price for one year.
               o Agree on a time for the project team to visit the property when the landlord will be present to sign
                   the contract and verify the safety of the building.
        3. The rights of each participating family such as:
               o Where to access further information or ask questions.
               o How to get access to the Appeals and Grievance mechanism to register a grievance of any sort.
        4. The responsibilities of each participating family:
               o To vacate the camp and dismantle the tent within one week of the payment being received by the
                   landlord.
               o To remain in the rental property for one year and not return to the camp.

Challenges to Consider
1. Communication Cannot Begin in a Camp until the Registration Has Already Taken Place. Since the registration
   process is not announced in advance, it can leave some camp residents surprised, anxious and confused. RSCG
   communication teams need to be aware that they will be always be starting their work after the population has
   been through registration and after some people who had hoped to benefit have been excluded from the
   beneficiary list. As a result, communications need to start during and ramp up immediately after the registration in
   order to address and overcome any confusion and frustration.
2. Rumor: As in any program, rumor and misinformation have the potential to cause difficulties for teams
   implementing RSCG programs. This can prove particularly problematic because programs which involve cash or
   displacing camp populations are highly visible and are therefore often the subject of press attention. Discussions of
   the program by third parties in the press may result in the dissemination of false information, causing complications
   for project implementing teams.
3. Literacy Rates: RSCG programs involve multiple steps and require beneficiaries to actively participate in ways which
   can be quite confusing. Communicating the rights and responsibilities of beneficiaries is further complicated if large
   numbers of the target population are unable to read communication material.

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                    54
4. Coordination of Messaging: The high profile nature of RSCG programs and the need for highly visible
   communication can prove challenging. Firstly, communication can become confusing if two agencies are
   implementing programs in camps close to one another. Secondly, given the need to use mass communication
   media such as radio, there can also be problems of overlapping, or confused messaging between agencies working
   in different parts of the city.




HAITI CASE STUDY

Actors Involved in Communication:
    Affected Population
    Implementing Agency
    Central Government
    Mayor’s Office

The diverse tools developed in Haiti have proven to be among the most innovative and exciting elements of RSCG
programs. In Haiti, the most important aspect of the communications strategy involved adapting to the country’s strong
oral tradition. The telling and re-telling of stories is an essential part of the culture, so teams needed to adapt messaging
to suit oral re-transmission.

Government Leadership in Communication
Given that RSCG programs were implemented in Haiti by multiple actors, ranging from Government departments to
international aid agencies, the coordination of communications became critical. The Government’s Housing and
Reconstruction Unit (UCLBP) took an active role in standardizing some key communication materials. The UCLBP
encouraged implementing agencies to use consistent messages and to use the same visual material to create a
consistent visual signature for RSCG programs. Each implementing agency’s logo and the camp name could be imposed
on the same posters and leaflets so that the programs could be consistently explained and communicated across a
variety of camps and neighborhoods.

The Challenges of Haiti’s Rumor Mill
Perhaps as a byproduct of the strong story telling tradition, there was an extraordinarily high incidence of false rumor
and misperception of the RSCG programs and many other humanitarian and development programs. Rumor is so
powerful a part of the culture that passing information (true or false) is commonly said to be quicker via the rumor mill
known as “Tele Haiti” than by telephone or television.

Unreal though they were, these rumors had very real consequences. For example, there were incidents of the
populations of entire camps initially refusing to participate in RSCG programs because of the incorrect rumor that
anyone who signed up would be denied any future chance of receiving a US Visa. Addressing the problems caused by
this sort of rumor and misinformation was a particular challenge which required coordinated effort by Government and
Implementing Agencies. It was essential to use both two-way and mass communication activities:




RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                        55
Two-Way Communication
In “Let them Speak”, a 2011 report written about communication with disaster-affected communities after the Haitian
earthquake, the authors correctly stressed the importance of two-way communication; the necessity to engage in
conversations, not passive messaging. It is essential to offer the chance for an interactive dialogue with those in camps
and surrounding communities. RSCG Programs adopted this approach in a variety of ways:
     By hiring community mobilizers to work in camp answering questions;
     By meeting regularly for discussions with camp residents and camp committees;
     By setting up information kiosks inside the camps and neighborhoods of return;
     By creating a telephone hotline based in a call center to answer questions.

The Importance of Community Mobilizers: There is no more effective way of getting messages across than through the
work of well-trained, motivated community mobilizers. Repeated interactions between beneficiary families and trained
staff who were able to explain, answer questions and re-explain the program were consistently shown to be the most
effective communication tool. Using the capacity of local people to communicate during the long, hot Caribbean days
with their fellow Haitians was the clearest way to engage the population in two-way communication and thereby
increase understanding of the program.

Mass Communication
As Rental Subsidy Cash Grant programs moved up in scale, effective mass communication with beneficiaries and the
general public became essential. While community meetings and one-to-one interaction is ideal, it is one thing to
communicate complex ideas to 200 families, and quite another to be faced with the challenge of communicating the
essential elements of a program in a camp like Champs de Mars with 4,600 families. With just over 17,000 people in the
camp, organizing one-to-one discussions with each family was only possible once the family was already engaged in the
process of renting a house, not in advance. Hence the importance of the following mass communication methods:

Newsletters: J/P HRO distributed newsletters in the Petionville Club Camp on a regular basis to communicate critical
information. This tool was used to educate the population at-large about relocations of certain sections of the camp
and to dispel rumors about the relocation process.

Text Messages: Through the registration process, agencies were able to collect the mobile telephone number of every
head of household in the targeted camp. Although residents of camps were generally among the poorest people in
society, an overwhelming majority owned a mobile phone and were able somehow to keep it charged some of the time.
As a result, mobile telephones proved extremely useful for targeted, direct communication between the program and
the beneficiaries. For example, text messages were used to notify families and landlords when their cash transfer
became available at the bank. Any beneficiary who did not collect their cash grant within a few days received further
messages making them aware of the two week deadline at the bank.

Cartoon Newspapers: Given the low literacy rates of the population, cartoon style stories distributed for free to camp
populations proved very effective for communicating on a range of subjects. Hundreds of thousands of copies of the
comic newspaper Chimen Lakay (The Road Home) were distributed on subjects such as cholera, gender-based violence
and hurricane preparedness. Chimen Lakay quickly became the publication with the largest circulation in Haiti. Using
the same model and the same central character, an edition of Chimen Lakay was produced to explain the RSCG
program.

Short Films Shown at Public Meetings: Screening movies in or near camps was a highly popular initiative, which
provided agencies with the opportunity to screen public information messaging. This approach was adapted as a tool to
help families in the target camps understand RSCG programs. The key to increasing understanding was to adapt to the
Haitian audience by using comedy, fun characters and a simple sense of narrative to tell a story about one family who
was leaving a camp.
In this example video, Let’s Go Home, Sandra and her husband Marcel discuss their choice of housing option and the
importance of choosing a rental property which was assessed by the Government as safe.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4l0AQWPnL8

All the short communication films made that star Sandra discussing in comic ways the following subjects, are available
on the IOM Haiti YouTube channel:
      Helping families understand the Yellow House repair program;
      Sensitizing families on the special needs of vulnerable family members when choosing rental accommodation;
      Helping people understand the nature of the 16/6 program in general;
      Telling the story of a much-improved area in Cite Soleil called La Difference. This film promotes the need for
         self-sufficiency and concerted action from communities to improve their own situation, without waiting for
         external support.

Soap Opera / Situation Comedy - “Tap Tap”: The very noticeable cultural difference in how Haitian audiences reacted
to the different film styles was central to the decision to hire a Haitian film maker to produce a more ambitious product
– a two episode pilot of a soap opera or situation comedy.



RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                                           57
Funded as part of the Government’s 16/6 RSCG project, the Tap Tap films had a broader goal than specific messaging
only on camp closure or RSCG programs. Tap Tap was intended to convey positive images of Haiti; to show the color and
diversity of the country. The first episode tells the story of a positive interaction which changes the perceptions of a self-
employed businessman who has negative preconceptions about people living in camps. Finding himself stranded, he is
helped by an honorable man who has been forced to live in camp since the earthquake.

Noted for its production values and shown repeatedly on Haitian National Television, as well as through new media and
mobile phones, Tap Tap was an interesting experiment attempting to weave program messaging and communication
into a narrative while also examining broader issues in contemporary Haitian society.

7.3     Choosing a Rental Property
The communication team’s aim is for all camp residents to understand the process and to make an informed decision
about whether or not to participate in the RSCG program. All families on the published beneficiary list have the right,
but are not compelled, to participate in the RSCG program and must voluntarily choose to sign up.

This step in the process involves each family working individually with an Implementing Agency staff member to visit the
chosen property, ensure it meets certain safeguards and sign a formal contract with the landlord.

Each family has the right to choose any house to rent, in any area of the city or country. To every family, the same fixed
dollar amount is available – an amount standardized by the Government based on average rental prices in low-cost
private sector housing for a one year lease. If families choose to rent a more expensive property, they can make up the
shortfall from their own funds. If families choose to rent a less expensive property, they “keep the change”.




Methodology

Once a family chooses to participate in the RSCG program, there are several steps for them to understand and navigate
before they are able to leave the camp.

  i.    Find a rental property: The families interested in participating are asked to find for themselves an available
        property in the neighborhood of their choice.
  ii.   Fill out an application form: When filling out an application form, each family provides the location of the
        property and contact details for the landlord.
 iii.   Safety verification visit with Implementing Agency staff member: Each family accompanies a staff member for
        a visit, during which there is a necessary process of verification. The house (or room) chosen must meet safety
        standards (see below). Also, the purported owner’s right to rent out the property is verified and witnessed by
        neighbors.
 iv.    Sign contract: Once these standards have been met, GPS coordinates are taken and a standard contract is
        signed between the landlord and beneficiary family.

Challenges to Consider
1. Safety of Rental Accommodation: In developing nations, and particularly in dense, urban settings, the quality of
   low-cost accommodation can often be questionable. If building standards do not exist, or are not routinely
   followed, this can lead to complex issues of ethical and legal responsibility for the safety of families moving into
   rental accommodation. RSCG programs must endeavor to ensure that families are not at risk in their new
   accommodation. At the same time, it may not be financially or logistically possible for every property to be given a
   technical examination by an engineer as part of the RSCG program. (See Haiti Case Study below for more.)
   If there is sufficient time, funding and technical capacity, it would be ideal to technically assess each prospective
   rental property, and to run large-scale retro-fitting and technical assistance programs in the communities of return.
   These retro-fitting and technical assistance programs should be available not only to families leaving camps, but
   also to families living in unsafe housing in the communities of return. The most efficient approach is not to directly
   link the RSCG and rebuilding programs, but to run these programs independently with one focused on ensuring
   camp residents move into safe housing, and another focused on raising the standard of all housing in the
   neighborhood of return.
2. Standardization of the Cash Value of the RSCG Across All Agencies. Confusion or anger among camp populations is
   a risk unless there is standardization of the package of assistance being offered by all Implementing Agencies. If one
   agency is offering more support – either financially or through additional benefits – camp populations may refuse to
   participate in an RSCG program with Agency A if they have heard that they can receive more support from Agency
   B. Coordination of all agencies led by Government is essential, as discussed in Chapter 4.1.
3. Inflation in the Rental Property Market: There is a risk that large-scale intervention in the rental market by
   Implementing Agencies backed by Government and international donors may cause an increase in prices in the
   rental market. To combat this risk, it is essential to:
        a. Empower camp residents to find their own property and negotiate the lowest price possible. This is why it is
            essential to allow families to “keep the change” if they choose to rent a property for a price lower than the
            value of the RSCG.
        b. Allow camp residents the option to keep 100% of the RSCG even if they choose to move into the home of
            family or friends (host families) where they are not required to pay rent.
        c. Collect and monitor data on the rental price paid by all families leaving camp to track price increases or
            decreases. Average prices should be tracked both overall and in each area of the city to which camp
            residents are moving.


HAITI CASE STUDY

Actors Involved in Choosing a Rental Property:
    Affected Population
    Implementing Agency
    Ministry for Public Works Engineers

Each family involved in an RSCG program in Haiti was given a standardized $500 USD of rental support. If the family
chose to rent a house costing more than $500 per year, they were free to supplement with their own income. If the
family instead chose to make a saving, they were free to negotiate a lower price and “keep the change”. People were
therefore empowered to make the best financial choices for their family.

Freedom to Choose the Right Housing Solution: Families were free to move anywhere and their choices fell broadly
into three categories:


RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                    59
       Families who entered into a formal rental agreement with a house owner. (This category represents the
        overwhelming majority of cases.)
       Families who moved in with a host family (family or friend). The financial assistance has been broadly termed
        rent, though in the case of a beneficiary moving back into a parent’s home, the family may have come to an
        informal arrangement about how the funds were divided.
       Families who moved out of Port-au-Prince and back to the provinces. These families were assisted to leave the
        city in keeping with the effort of decentralization. Once arrived at their chosen destination outside Port-au-
        Prince, these families either used the received funds to rent or moved in with a host family.

Combating Rental Price Inflation: Given that over 90% of families chose to move into formal rental agreements with
private sector landlords, one key concern raised in the program design stage was that if the Haitian Government and big
international donors were seen to be involved in renting property, there would be a spike in rent prices.

To limit as much as possible this potential rental inflation, the natural self-interest of each family was engaged as a tool.
If the rent negotiated was $400 – the family received the remaining $100 in cash to spend as they deemed most
appropriate for their family. Some families spent the remainder on food, education or household improvements.
Others, no doubt, spent in other ways, as was their free choice.

Standardized Rental Contracts: In order to safeguard the rights of families becoming renters, a standardized rental
contract was established in coordination between the UCLBP-led Returns Working Group and the Logements Quartiers
Working Group. This contract was made available to all implementing agencies, some of whom made minor changes to
adapt it to their particular needs.

The Safety of Rental Homes and the Practical Limitations of Property Safety Checks
One of the frequently asked questions about this part of the program was, “Are the rental houses safe?” There were
valid concerns about the quality of the housing in the neighborhoods to which families moved when they left the camps
and a risk that some families wanted to rent unsafe houses.

Pressures of time, cost and a limited number of technically competent engineers meant that it was not feasible to
provide a detailed technical safety assessment for every rental property chosen by each one of hundreds of thousands
of families leaving camps. The approach taken focused on empowering families to make responsible decisions.
Communication to beneficiary families in camps focused on the necessity of picking a rental property which was safe.

Firstly, beneficiaries were told to avoid “Red Zones” which had been designated by the Government as areas of the city
where environmental risks from flooding or landslides were too great. All properties in these areas were deemed unsafe
and families were not allowed to rent properties in those areas.

Secondly, beneficiaries were taught to avoid houses marked by a Government engineer as unsafe. After the earthquake,
almost every house in the affected area was assessed by engineers working with a Government agency. Safe houses
were painted with a green stamp; houses in need of repair were stamped yellow; and houses in need of major
reparation or demolition were stamped red.

Once families had chosen a property, the Implementing Agencies sent a member of staff to inspect each family’s
proposed rental property to check that the conditions above had been met. If the property was marked as yellow or
red, it was not an acceptable rental option. For houses which had been repaired, had never been stamped, or had the
stamp painted over, it was difficult to make an assessment but the staff was given some flexibility to use common

Driving Down Program Overhead Through More Efficient Visits to Rental Properties
When the first programs started, one staff member was assigned to a group of families who lived beside one another in
an area of the camp. Huge amounts of time were necessary for that staff member to visit each family’s chosen rental
house since the houses were spread out across the four corners of the city.

Very quickly it became clear that it was far more efficient to assign staff members to areas of the city rather than to a
specific group of families. Then, any family who wished to move to a given neighborhood would be assisted by the staff
member who was responsible for all families moving to that community.

However, it was only efficient data management which enabled economies of scale. Given the number of
neighborhoods in the city, assigning staff members to each neighborhood only became efficient once families from any
camp could be grouped together for visits on a given day. This was not possible until Agencies moved from paper-based
registration and sign-up procedures to smart phone enabled data management tools.

7.4     Cash Payments
To protect the interests of families leaving camps, it is critical that the manner in which cash payments take place is
simple, transparent and accountable. Families must understand their rights in terms of payment and also their
responsibilities in terms of moving into the chosen property and vacating the camp within the contractually agreed
timeframe.

Methodology

When implementing this element of RSCG programs, consideration might be given to the following steps:

  i.    Once the landlord and the camp resident agree on a price and the house has been verified as meeting
        specifications, a standard rental contract is signed on site.
  ii.   Arrangements are then made for the landlord to be paid directly via a bank transfer within one week. The
        amount paid to each landlord varies depending on the price agreed between the landlord and tenant. If the
        rent agreed is below the value of the cash grant, the family moving out of the camp receives the remainder.
        (The design of the program deliberately allows beneficiary families from camps to “keep the change”
        empowering them to make the best financial choice for their family.)
 iii.   The remainder of the RSCG is paid to the beneficiary family leaving the camp via direct bank transfer.
 iv.    The beneficiary family also receives an additional amount of cash (paid as part of a single bank transfer) to
        cover the costs of transportation and other moving costs.



Challenges to Consider
1. Security: In environments where many people are living on less than a dollar a day, the amount of cash being
   provided is very significant and can make beneficiary families a target. The primary challenge of this step in the
   process is to ensure to the greatest degree possible that the financial transactions taking place are safe.
2. How much to pay: It is important that the value of the grants paid is standardized by Government, as explained in
   Chapter 4.1.
3. Who to pay: It is usually best for Implementing Agencies to pay landlords directly. This reduces the amount of
   money passing through the hands of beneficiary families and thus reduces their vulnerability to crime. It also
   ensures that any landlord who does not fulfill his contractual obligations is in conflict with the Implementing Agency
   rather than an individual family. On the other hand, paying the landlord (as well as the beneficiary family who
   always receive some direct cash), does double the administrative burden on the Implementing Agency and thereby
   increases costs. Therefore, in certain circumstances, it may be more appropriate to pay the entire cash grant to the
   renter and allow them to subsequently pay the landlord.
4. How to pay: Displaced populations, particularly the poorest, are unlikely to have safe access to banking services.
   Many displaced families will also likely be without suitable identification documents to open a new bank account.

    Generally, the best solution is to provide each family (and each landlord) with a personalized, pin-protected
    financial transfer which can be redeemed at a local bank, even without an account. RSCG programs also provide a
    good opportunity to encourage and assist those without identification documents to seek them, in order to simplify
    the process of paying the RSCG.

    Some programs have trialed innovations such as Mobile Phone banking. Thus far, these trials have proven
    problematic and been discontinued in favor of bank transfers (see Haiti Case Study below). However, in future,
    particularly in contexts where phone banking is already in common usage, there could be opportunities to
    overcome the current problems.

Actors Involved in Cash Payments:
    Affected Population
    Implementing Agency
    Banks
    Mobile Phone Operators (in programs using Mobile Money solutions)

In Haiti, the decision of the largest Government-led program was to pay all cash grants using a personalized, pin-
protected transfer which could be redeemed at a local bank. Each family was given a cash grant in local currency with of
the value of roughly $500 USD. Once beneficiary families had chosen a property, agreed on a price and signed a
standard contract with a landlord, the Implementing Agency paid the landlord directly. If the rent agreed was less than
$500 USD, the family moving out of camp received the remaining amount, plus a further $25 to cover transportation
and any other moving costs.

The first table below shows an example of the payments to be made in the case of a family finding a property to rent for
$300 USD per year.

                            Remainder                               $200 USD

Working in Partnership with Banks
The vast majority of landlords and beneficiary families in Haiti did not have bank accounts. Therefore the funds were
made available via a cash transfer; temporary accounts were created at local banks for the one-off transaction. To
withdraw cash, the beneficiaries needed a formal ID and a pin code which was provided individually to each family by
the Agency. Some families required extra help with this process, including those who had no form of identification.

After difficult early experiences, agencies paying large numbers of families on the same day made special arrangements
with their bank to ensure extra bank tellers were available and there was sufficient cash on hand.

Technology Innovations: Using Mobile Phones for RSCG Payments
Some Implementing Agencies experimented with mobile telephone banking as a method to make RSCG payments. In
the largest trial, 2,700 families in a single camp were provided with a new mobile telephone by Concern Worldwide in
partnership with Haiti’s largest mobile phone network. The entire cash grant was transferred to the family’s phone (not
to the landlord) and it was the responsibility of the beneficiary family to redeem the cash from a local vendor and pay

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                        63
their new landlord in cash.

Issues encountered included:
      Confusion caused by the novelty of mobile banking which had only recently been introduced in Haiti.
      Only families in camps were given phones, not landlords. This meant that the entire cash grant was paid to the
         beneficiary who then paid landlords in cash. Implementing Agencies had no involvement with landlords.
      The system was designed for small transactions which caused worrying problems because grants of $500 USD
         were too large for the digital “wallet size”. It was therefore necessary to transfer the grant payment in tranches
         with the family “cashing out” $250 USD then waiting for a day or two before receiving the second tranche , at
         which time they could pay the landlord. This put families in a situation of having to hold on to large sums of
         money for a day or two while still living in a tent with no safe place to keep money.
      Also, the program encountered logistical difficulties initially when the local street vendors and small shops used
         by beneficiaries to “cash out” did not have sufficient cash on hand to provide for multiple families receiving
         large transfers.
      Initially, there were technical problems with phones which deactivated. Assisting all 2,700 families took over
         nine months but SIM cards deactivated if they were not used for three months.
      Many phones were lost or stolen, which proved problematic even though there was a pin number system in
         operation to safeguard the transfers.

In these trials, the significant technical issues encountered meant that the bank payment method proved far more
successful and Concern Worldwide has reverted to this option. However, this Mobile Money method may prove
successful in another context, particularly in countries where mobile telephone banking is already in widespread use.

Creating Bespoke Identification Documents for the Relocation Process:
To expedite and simplify the process, J/P HRO and World Vision created identity cards for each head-of-household for
the relocation process, using the LMMS (Last Mile Mobile Solutions) Identification Card System. Banks agreed to accept
this form of identification for all beneficiaries in place of a national ID document.

The Implementing Agencies found the unique ID card system to be useful. The photo and the difficulties of forging the
cards proved useful for organizing and identifying beneficiaries in the program, particularly since high illiteracy levels
meant that names were not always spelled consistently when heads of households interacted with the program teams.
The cards may also have helped to reduce fraud because the card was instantly generated by the team in the camp and
included a photo taken at the time of registration.

However, after two years, the Government began to discourage Implementing Agencies from issuing their own ID cards
and instead encouraged beneficiary families without ID to seek National Identification Documentation. While the
National ID office was understandably overwhelmed in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake when hundreds of
thousands lost their IDs if their homes were destroyed, the agency was subsequently strengthened to cope with
increased demand. The Government of Haiti was keen to use the RSCG programs as an incentive to help boost the
number of citizens using National ID in order to strengthen broader efforts to improve national census data collection.


7.5 Relocation, Camp Decommissioning and Closure

Once both the beneficiary family and the landlord have received payment, the beneficiary family is contractually obliged
to leave the camp within three days. Exceptions are made and special assistance given to vulnerable families, single-

parent families, families with disabled family members and other families with other extenuating circumstances being
assisted by the Protection Team.

Many families recycle the material from their shelters, but others leave empty structures still standing. In large camps it
can take many months to assist thousands of families through the RSCG process, meaning that camps remain home for
many thousands of families even as they are depopulated. Empty tents and unused shelters in camps can become
security and health risks or can be re-occupied by people who have never lived in the camp but wish to fraudulently
benefit from a RSCG. As a result, dismantling abandoned tents becomes a necessary routine for teams managing camps.

This chapter highlights some activities necessary if camps are closed as a result of RSCG programs. For a full description
of methods, norms and standards for closing camps, see Guidelines on Camp Closure published by the IASC CCCM
Cluster (www.cccmcluster.org).


Methodology

When implementing this element of RSCG programs, consideration might be given to the following steps:

   i.   After receiving the cash grant, each family independently arranges transportation to the rental property for all
        family members and all belongings.
  ii.   Each week, the Implementing Agency’s Data Management Team provides the camp-based teams with a list of
        all families whose landlords have been paid and who have received their rental grant. These families are
        notified door to door that they have three days to leave the camp.
 iii.   The camp-based team visits the tent after three days to check on progress.
 iv.    During this visit, if the family has left any remaining tent or structure, this is marked with paint and the tent
        number passed on to the dismantling and clean-up team.
  v.    If the family’s tent has been re-occupied, the new residents are informed that this is not allowed. Most
        newcomers are trying to benefit fraudulently and leave voluntarily once they understand that there is a process
        in place to identify fraud.
 vi.    Any family who wishes to dispute the process, or register any kind of grievance, has recourse through the
        Grievance and Appeals process explained in detail in Chapter 4.3.
 vii.   Once all cases of grievance have been resolved, the camp should be empty. Any remaining persons who have
        been unsuccessful in their appeal are again given notice to leave by Implementing Agency staff and the
        appropriate local authority. The period of notice depends on local municipal laws.
viii.   If an individual family continues to refuse to leave then a legal eviction procedure is initiated by local authorities
        through the local judiciary system.
 ix.    Once all Grievance and Appeals cases are resolved and there are no more families living in the camp, the camp
        is decommissioned. This involves all tents, shelters and other structures being demolished and removed,
        latrines removed in a sanitary manner and the land officially handed over to either the private landlord, or to
        the appropriate local authority in the case of public land.

Challenges to Consider
1. Security: Managing security can be particularly difficult as the population of a camp decreases. As some families
   receive their cash grants and move out of the camp, their neighbors who are still waiting are left increasingly
   isolated which can lead to increased crime and anti-social behavior.



RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                         65
2. One family leaves camp and is replaced by another: There can be challenges, particularly in large camps with
   several thousand families, in keeping tabs on which tents/shelters are occupied and which should be empty after
   the family has left to move into a rental property. It takes a considerable effort of data management and
   coordination with teams on the ground every day to ensure that once tents/shelters are empty, they are
   immediately dismantled.
3. Empty tents become dangerous: If tents are not dismantled, they can also become venues for anti-social or unsafe
   behavior as they become public spaces used for consuming drugs or alcohol, or as dumping grounds for garbage, or
   as venues for sex, including transactional sex.

Actors Involved in Relocation, Camp Decommissioning and Closure:

    Implementing Agency
    Police

Security for Families Left in Camp
There were very real concerns about security for those families whose applications were last to be processed and who
were therefore left isolated in camps without neighbors to provide community and group security. Initially, this led
Implementing Agencies to close camps section by section, processing all the families living in the first section of the
camp and closing it before moving on to process the RSCG applications from families in other sections of the camp.
However, after trials, this approach proved incredibly inefficient. (See Section 5.3 Choosing a Rental Property.)

Covering Travel Costs: Since many families in camps had very little access to disposable income, it was necessary to
provide them with some cash to cover incidental costs of moving. The beneficiary family was therefore paid an
additional $25 US Dollars to pay for transportation and moving costs.

Dismantling Tents
Once per week, joint teams of staff from Implementing Agencies, Mayors’ offices and national sanitation staff worked in
the targeted camp to identify and dismantle tents which were no longer inhabited. These tents were proving to be
hazardous for the remaining population of camps since the empty tents were misused in a variety of ways disturbing to
neighbors: as places for gangs of young men to gather; for consumption of drugs and alcohol; as venues for sex,
including transactional sex; as dumping grounds for garbage; or as unofficial latrines.

After Failed Appeals
If at the end of the appeal process a case was turned down and the family were not included in the RSCG program, the
family then had a period of three days to leave camp. Working to convince those families to leave camps became a
delicate, time-consuming process managed by the Mayor’s office, with the assistance of the implementing agency and
the Department of Civil Protection. Oversight was provided by a Justice of the Peace.

Fair but Firm: If camp residents saw flexibility in the process, there were some who tried to take advantage
inappropriately. For example, particularly at the start of the program, a small number of families did not respect the

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                            67
agreed three day limit and stayed in camp even after being paid. These were not cases of vulnerable families, for whom
special assistance was available, nor of families in unforeseen circumstances. These were families who were delaying
without valid reason.

Program managers dedicated teams of community mobilizers to verify whether shelters were taken down after each
group of families had been paid. Once camp residents saw that there were teams following up and checking on their
departure, the number of families delaying reduced considerably.
Community Mobilizer staff member were very successful in convincing families to leave without any recourse to threats,
simply by reminding families that they had voluntarily signed a contract to leave and appealing to their sense of fair
play, one Haitian to another.

Camp Closure and Decommissioning
Each week, a team from the Department of Civil Protection, carrying relevant paperwork and witnessed by a Justice of
the Peace, ensured that all tents owned by families who had received the RSCG were empty, and that empty tents were
dismantled.

When every registered resident in a camp had been assisted with a rental housing solution, the camp could be closed
and returned to its pre-earthquake utility. Once there were no families living there, there was a process to
decommission camps by appropriately dealing with latrines and other hazards. The land was then officially handed back
to the landlord (either private land owner or the local Mayor in the case of public land).

To guard against the risk that camps which had been emptied were then repopulated, it was essential to hand over the
land officially to the landowner. An official Camp Closure and Handover form was created, documenting that the camp
was now closed and that all responsibility for the land now passed to the landowner. Any families erecting tents or
structures on the site after this time were not registered as earthquake-affected IDPs.

Guidelines for camp closure and decommissioning are available from the IASC CCCM Cluster.

7.6     Surprise Follow-Up Visit and Second Cash Grant

The final step in the process involves making a surprise visit to each family six-eight weeks after they have moved out of
camp and into their rental home. The goals of this visit are threefold:
     To verify if the family is in fact living in the rental property.
     To trigger (if the family is in the house as expected) the payment of a second, smaller cash grant to be used
        freely by the families for any household needs.
     To follow-up with families with ongoing protection needs which persist after leaving camps or emerge once the
        family is in the return community. (This third aspect has been covered in Section 6.3 Protection.)

This step in the process enables the collection of data essential for evaluating the program, and at the same time
incentivizes and rewards families who have followed through on the contractual agreement. In great measure, this step
is designed to respond to risks identified during the project design phase:
      How many families living in camps are actually in need? Or, put another way, how many families, hopeful of
         benefitting from a cash grant, have maintained a tent in a camp despite having a housing solution elsewhere?
      How many families, if given a cash grant to leave a camp, will subsequently leave the rental property and move
         into another camp in the hope of benefitting for a second time?




Methodology

When implementing this element of RSCG programs, consideration might be given to the following steps:

   i.   In order to establish whether families are still living in the house as per the contract, the Implementing Agency
        send staff to each property six-eight weeks after the family moved out of camp.
  ii.   The visit is unannounced.
 iii.   If families are living in the property as expected, they received a second livelihood grant which they are free to
        use for any purpose.
 iv.    Families who changed rental property and informed the Agency staff of the change were still entitled to the
        supplementary payment if they were found to be living at the new address.
  v.    If the family is not present at the time of the visit, Implementing Agency staff make an assessment of whether
        the property is in use and attempt to contact the family by phone. If the family claims that they are living in the
        property but are not home at that time they are informed that another surprise visit will take place over the
        following weeks.
 vi.    If after three visits the family is still not found and there is no sign that the property is occupied, the family is
        not entitled to the second livelihood grant.
 vii.   A further verification visit after one year provides very useful indicators of the long-term success of the program
        in assisting families to sustainably re-establish themselves in the rental market even after the one year RSCG
        has expired.

Challenges to Consider
   1. Verification visits are a retrospective check but cannot guarantee the family will stay: There is the risk that
       after receiving the second cash grant, a family could then negotiate a refund with their landlord and move back
       into a camp. While this is undoubtedly a risk, data from RSCG programs suggest that the overwhelming majority
       of families who are in a rental property after eight weeks remain in place for the duration of the one year

RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                        70
         contract. However, it is worth considering the possibility of further verification visits later in the project cycle.
         [For further details, see Haiti CCCM Cluster report Helping Families, Closing Camps.]
    2.   Choosing whether to openly advertise the verification visit process: There is a valid debate in the design phase
         on whether or not to publicize the verification visits (and the associated financial benefits for families who were
         still where they agreed to live). On the one hand, the success rate figure may prove to be less reliable if families
         know that they only need to stay in the house for a couple of months and can leave immediately afterwards
         with no financial consequences. However, despite this concern, the consensus from past programs is that
         verification visits must be widely advertised from the start of the program since the over‐arching priority is to
         encourage people to stay in their new homes. The hope is that having moved in for two or three months, the
         family was more likely to stay long term.
    3.   Verification visits are very resource intensive: One of the key lessons during this phase of the projects was the
         resource intensive nature of verification visits which necessitated considerable human and logistical resources
         and management focus. Not only do program managers need to budget for enough staff to visit each of the
         houses, they must also plan for an initial failure rate of up to 30% with second and third visits required.
    4.   Logistics of verification visits require assigning staff geographically: To reduce the logistical burden, it is
         essential to keep the same team members in place. Even if field teams take addresses and GPS coordinates, the
         dense, confusing and anarchic nature of the neighborhoods made it almost impossible to find a property if you
         had not been there before. Given that the visits were by their very nature unannounced, it was not possible to
         ask the family to guide the team to the property as it had been during the first visit to sign the contract and
         check the safety of the property. Therefore, from a human resources point of view, it is essential to keep the
         same team throughout the project for the infuriatingly simple reason that in order to find the properties, there
         is no substitute for having been there before.
    5.   What happens to families after one year? Include a verification visit one year on: Although a further
         verification visit one year later is time consuming and resource intensive, it is essential. Many Implementing
         Agencies had difficulty in securing funding beyond one year, however, a survey of a representative sample of
         households was funded by some agencies and the CCCM Cluster and provided very useful longer-term data on
         outcomes for families.


HAITI CASE STUDY

Actors Involved in Surprise Follow-Up Visit and Second Cash Grant:
    Affected Population
    Implementing Agency

If a verification visit showed a family to still be living in the rental property which they had rented through the RSCG
program, they were transferred $125 USD using the same method of payment as was used to deliver the first grant.

The overwhelming majority of families – more than 90% – were in real need.
Before RSCG programs started in Haiti, there was considerable skepticism at the idea of giving support to all families in
camp. There was a fairly widely-held belief that many families were in the camp by choice; that they had a home but
chose also to occupy a tent to receive benefits. One great risk of the program was that huge numbers of families would
claim to move into a rental house, but subsequently take the cash grant and move back into an existing home, leaving
the rental properties empty.

To give an indication of how widely-held this view was, it is worth noting that some programs agreed with their donors
a management target of 70% occupancy for the verification visits. Mindful of the desperate need of the majority living
RSCG Programs – Operational Manual                                                                                  71
in camps, it was calculated that even if 30% of families were falsely claiming to be in need of housing, 70% presence
would still represent success.

The follow-up visit was designed in part to mitigate these risks, and to ensure the detailed data collection necessary for
effective monitoring and evaluation of the program. Through this verification visit process, RSCG programs were able to
provide data showing that in fact the overwhelming majority of families living in camps were in genuine need of
housing.

All RSCG programs in Haiti achieved a minimum of 90% occupancy in the rental properties when the unannounced
validation visit took place. This strongly suggests that the anecdotal claims of large numbers living in camps out of
choice proved false. The overwhelming majority of families were in real need of housing. As examples, see below the
results from the IOM 16/6 program.

What Happened to Families after One Year?

What happened to the families after one year of rental support comes to an end and they were left without further
support? Were these families forced to leave the homes rented during the program? If families left their rental
property, where did they go? Did they find themselves back in the streets or in camps?

The independent report commissioned to examine the impact of RSCG programs on the lives of grantees after one year
provided extremely encouraging results. 19

             “The results are extremely promising: one year on, no grantees have returned to camps and
             100% have autonomously found an accommodation solution. The evaluation was unable to
             find evidence that the rental support approach is contributing to the development of new
             informal settlements. Grantees enjoyed a year’s support in secure housing of their choice,
             using any extra money to pay down debt, pay school fees, help other family members, start

           accommodation for a second year. Those that choose to change their rental solution are
           continuing to exercise their free choice to find accommodation solutions that reflect their
           financial means and personal priorities. Of the 75% that moved, 49% reported being unable
           to pay the rent, while 26% attributed their move to problems with the landlord.”
