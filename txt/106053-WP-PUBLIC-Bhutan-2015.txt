                                The World Bank interviewed a representative sample of the private sector in 4 of the most active economic regions
                                in Bhutan. The sample consisted of 253 business establishments surveyed from May 2015 through July 2015. The
                                Enterprise Survey (ES) covers several topics of the business environment as well as performance measures for
                                each firm. Below are the main highlights from the survey.
                                 Despite its small size, the Bhutanese private sector reports strong annual sales and employment growth
