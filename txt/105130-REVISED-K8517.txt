High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                     v
Executive Summary

The impacts of climate change will be channeled primarily through the
water cycle, with consequences that could be large and uneven across the
globe. Water-related climate risks cascade through food, energy, urban, and
environmental systems. Growing populations, rising incomes, and expanding
cities will converge upon a world where the demand for water rises exponen-
tially, while supply becomes more erratic and uncertain. If current water
management policies persist, and climate models prove correct, water scarcity
will proliferate to regions where it currently does not exist, and will greatly
worsen in regions where water is already scarce. Simultaneously, rainfall is
projected to become more variable and less predictable, while warmer seas
will fuel more violent floods and storm surges. Climate change will increase
water-related shocks on top of already demanding trends in water use.
Reduced freshwater availability and competition from other uses—such as
energy and agriculture—could reduce water availability in cities by as much
as two thirds by 2050, compared to 2015 levels.
   Economic growth is a surprisingly thirsty business. Water is a vital factor
of production, so diminishing water supplies can translate into slower growth
that cloud economic prospects. Some regions could see their growth rates
decline by as much as 6 percent of GDP by 2050 as a result of water-related
losses in agriculture, health, income, and property—sending them into sus-
tained negative growth. Economic modeling described in this report suggests
that bad water-management policies can exacerbate the adverse growth
impacts of climate change, while good policies can go a long way towards
neutralizing them (map ES.1). Some regions stand to see growth accelerate as
much as 6 percent with better water resource management. The impacts of
water mismanagement are felt disproportionately by the poor, who are more
likely to rely on rain-fed agriculture to feed their families, live on the most
marginal lands which are more prone to floods, and are most at risk from
contaminated water and inadequate sanitation. Ensuring a sufficient and con-
stant supply of water under increasing scarcity will be essential to achieving
global poverty alleviation goals.
   Changes in water availability and variability can induce migration and
ignite civil conflict. Food price spikes caused by droughts can inflame latent
conflicts and drive migration. Where economic growth is impacted by rain-
fall, episodes of droughts and floods have generated waves of migration and
statistical spikes in violence within countries. In a globalized and connected
world, such problems are impossible to quarantine. And where large inequi-
ties prevail, people move from zones of poverty to regions of prosperity which
can lead to increased social tensions.
   This is why water management will be crucial in determining whether
the world achieves the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and aspira-
tions for reducing poverty and enhancing shared prosperity. Water is the
common currency which links nearly every SDG, and it will be a critical

                      determinant of success. Abundant water supplies are vital for the production
                      of food and will be essential to attaining SDG 2 on food security; clean and
                      safe drinking water and sanitation systems are necessary for health as called
                      for in SDGs 3 and 6; and water is needed for powering industries and creating
                      the new jobs identified in SDGs 7 and 8. None of this is achievable without
                      adequate and safe water to nourish the planet’s life-sustaining ecosystem ser-
                      vices identified in SDGs 13, 14 and 15.
                        Water is to adaptation what energy is to mitigation, and the challenges
                      the world will face in adapting to water issues are enormous. It calls for

recognizing the interlinkages between water for food, energy, cities, and the
environment through an “expanded water nexus,” which acknowledges that
the fortunes of these sectors are tied through a common dependence on water.
The costs of policy inaction are high, and prudent stewardship of water
resources will pay large dividends. Although significant challenges exist,
the  right actions need not be costly. Thoughtful policies and well-placed
investments can yield large benefits in improved welfare and increased
­economic growth.
    There are three overarching policy priorities that can help lead countries
 down the road to a water secure and climate resilient economy. None of these
 will be a panacea, however, just as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. In
 practice, hybrid solutions will be needed, determined by country and regional
 risks and circumstances.
••      Optimizing the use of water through better planning and incentives.
        Building climate-resilient economies that can develop and grow in a
        warming world will require better ways of allocating scarce water resources
        across sectors to higher-value uses. This could be achieved through plan-
        ning and regulation, or using market signals through instruments such as
        prices and permits. In both cases there would need to be adequate safe-
        guards to assure access to poor households and farmers as well as the
        environment. None of this will be easy. It will call for establishing credible
        institutions, policies and legal systems that can facilitate transfers of water
        in ways that benefit all parties to the transaction. Economic instruments
        such as water permits and prices can be valuable for promoting improved
        environmental stewardship of water resources, but they are also the most
        misunderstood due to anxieties of elite capture, denial of services to the
        poor, and the complex social and cultural values of water. Much depends
        upon how such policies are implemented and enforced. In countries
        where water is deemed to be free, the poor are unserved or under-served
        and are compelled to pay a much higher price than the rich for each drop
        of water. As a consequence, free water is typically costly for the poor as
        well as harmful to the environment.
           Water efficiency must also increase within sectors. This calls for the cre-
        ation and adoption of new water saving technologies, incentives, educa-
        tion, and awareness. Approaches are already available, such as Climate
        Smart Agriculture (CSA) or Sustainable Agricultural Intensification
        (SAI), that allow farms to maintain or even increase yields, while reduc-
        ing their energy and water footprint. Similar approaches exist for signifi-
        cant water savings in the energy sector through improved efficiency.
        However, the adoption of these solutions is slow, hesitant, and below
        desired levels. The constraints most often lie in misaligned incentives. For
        instance, a large proportion of the benefits of approaches such as CSA are
        public, while technology adoption costs are private. This requires sharper
        incentives for technology uptake that might require a change in the sub-
        sidy regime, public investments in infrastructure or extension services,
        selective forms of crop insurance, and increasing access to credit. There

viii	                         High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
     are opportunities to alter behavior and change thirsty consumption pat-
     terns through education, contextual cues, and using social norms to sig-
     nal consent or disapproval. The tools based on these behavioral nudges
     do not displace existing policy approaches that target incentives; rather,
     they complement and enhance them. Some of these approaches may cost
     little to implement because they depend on nuances in messaging and
     policy design, while others may entail longer periods of engagement,
     especially when changes in attitudes and values are involved.
••   Where appropriate, expand water supply and availability. This includes
     investments in storage infrastructure such as dams that makes water
     available when it is needed; water recycling and reuse; and where viable,
     desalination. While expanding the water supply will be vital in some
     countries, particularly the driest regions, these tools must be used with
     caution. Other tools like groundwater recharge and wetlands preservation
     may offer lower risk, lower costs, and higher returns than other policy
     approaches. Historically, when supply is increased without corresponding
     safeguards to manage use, demand rises to meet the new level of s   ­ upply,
     resulting in a higher level of water dependence in often arid areas. To be
     effective, these interventions must be accompanied by policies to promote
     water efficiency and improve water allocation across sectors.
••   Reducing the impact of extremes, variability, and uncertainty. A final
     set of interventions require “water proofing” economies to limit the
     impact of extreme weather events and rainfall variability. Increasing
     storage capacities and water reuse systems will go a long way towards
     ­
     building resilience. Better urban planning, risk management, and citizen
     engagement will likewise reduce the exposure of cities to flood risk. In
     rural areas, expanding crop insurance programs can protect farmers
     against rainfall shocks. Large capital investments such as seawalls, levees,
     and dams, meanwhile, can protect coastal cities from storm surges and
     floods. As the precise impacts of climate change are uncertain and large
     investments are costly and irreversible, their siting and design must be
     carefully chosen to minimize regret.
  Smart water policy is fundamental to smart climate policy and smart
development policy. While adopting policy reforms and investments will be
demanding, the costs of inaction are far higher. The future will be thirsty
and uncertain, but with the right reforms, governments can help ensure that
people and ecosystems are not left vulnerable to the consequences of a world
subject to more severe water-related shocks and adverse rainfall trends.

Shocks and Trends:
Uncertain Water Supplies
Meet Unquenchable Thirsts
Water is on the frontlines of climate change. It channels the main impacts of
climate change to all aspects of the economy, society, and environment—
through precipitation, storm surges, floods, droughts, rising seas, and ground-
water recharges. Harnessing the productive potential of water and limiting its
destructive impacts are important even in the most advanced economies.
Doing so requires coming to grips both with shocks—water-related extreme
weather events like severe droughts and floods—as well as trends that will
change rainfall patterns and increase the demand for water.
   About 1.6 billion people—almost a quarter of humanity—live in countries
with physical water scarcity, and in just two decades this number may double.
Some regions of the world already suffer from significant water scarcity and
excessive variability. Climate change will only magnify the challenges of man-
aging such a complex natural resource. Indeed, in a recent survey of almost
900 leading decision-makers from business, academia, and the public sector,
the World Economic Forum identified water crises and failures to adapt to


High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                        1
climate change as two of the greatest global risks to economic growth and
social stability.1
   The world will face significant challenges adapting to a future where
demand for water is ever increasing, but supply remains fixed and more vari-
able. Addressing these problems will be critical in achieving the new and
ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United
Nations in 2015. SDG Goal 6 relates to water, and includes targets for improv-
ing access to sanitation, reducing water pollution, improving water use effi-
ciency, and making water use more sustainable. Water with its cascading
impacts across the economy will impact the achievement of other SDGs too;
such as those relating to food security, cleaner energy; sustainable cities; cli-
mate action and the protection of ecosystems. The vision articulated in the
SDGs is high on ambition and will call for a fundamental shift in the way
water is managed, far beyond business-as-usual remedies. It will require
greater coordination between sectors that are impacted by a nexus that
emerges through the use of water as the common factor of production.
   The purpose of this report is to document the drivers of the changing pat-
terns in supply and demand for water in a climate change impacted world,
and to offer solutions which ensure that water does not become a constraint
on prosperity. In order to do this, the report takes a holistic view of water
needs, recognizing that expanding water uses in one sector often involves
trade-offs with other sectors. These inter-relationships are represented by
what is referred to as “the expanded water nexus” which includes the major
water consumers of the planet: food production, urban areas, energy produc-
tion, and the environment. The rest of this chapter will examine the physical
impacts that climate change will have on the planet’s water supply, and intro-
duce the expanded water nexus. Chapter 2 then investigates the macroeco-
nomic impacts that this changing water supply will have, as well as implications
for poverty reduction. Chapter 3 dives deep into each of the four sectors of the
nexus, describing the constraints that they will face, and offering solutions.
The report ends with policy conclusions.



Droughts, Storms, Floods, and Changing
Water Supplies
The consequences of climate change for the hydrological cycle could be strik-
ingly uneven across time and space. The projections used in this report come
from models that track 235 river basins and span the range of uncertainty—
wet, dry, and normal.2 The results are consistent with several other global cli-
mate models and do not significantly change across emission scenarios.

Uneven Impacts across Time and Space
On a global scale, the total volume of runoff will be relatively stable, suggest-
ing that the amount of surface water globally remains fairly fixed throughout
the next decades—a consequence of the global water cycle being a closed

                      dynamic system.3 But while changes in runoff will vary significantly across
                      regions, and are subject to significant uncertainty, the spatial distribution of
                      runoff will become more uneven across the globe (map 1.1). Many regions
                      already experiencing water stress will experience even more scarcity, includ-
                      ing much of the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, and Central
                      America, all of which exhibit a consistent trend toward diminishing runoff.
                      Other parts of Africa present a larger variation in runoff, with East Africa
                      showing a significant decline by 2050, while southern latitudes do not exhibit
                      significant changes until the second half of the century.
                         The declines in runoff matter most in areas with low baseline runoff and
                      water availability. For instance, a 100 mm reduction in runoff is of less conse-
                      quence when average rainfall is 3,000 mm a year, as in Colombia, than when
                      it is about 300 mm a year, as in Chad.
                         No major variations in runoff are projected through parts of  North America,
                      the northern parts of Western Europe, and East Asia (excluding China).
                      Notably, much of the decline in runoff is projected in the least developed
                      countries, where access to water is most crucial for agriculture and energy.
                         Temperature changes are especially important in snow-dominated regions,
                      determining the timing of snowmelt and the seasonality of water availability.
                      Glaciers are expected to shrink and will store less water for release during
                      warm periods, making water supplies less dependable. The effects on snow-
                      fed rivers has been widely documented and publicized.

                      More Frequent Natural Disasters
                      Variable precipitation and extreme events are among the more disconcert-
                      ing  aspects of the climate challenge. The toll of water-related extreme
                      events  and  natural disasters is high and growing in both frequency

     Box 1.1  Regional Risks of Climate Change4
     Sub-Saharan Africa: low institutional capacity and high dependency on subsistence agriculture
     makes this one of the most vulnerable regions. Rainfed agriculture contributes nearly one-quarter
     of GDP and employs about 70 percent of the population.

     East Asia and the Pacific: large concentrations of populations on coastlines and a large number of
     small islands leave this region one of the most exposed to water-related climate shocks.

     Eastern Europe and Central Asia: poorly-designed infrastructure leaves this region ill-equipped
     to handle increasing flood risks, desertification, and changes in the flow of major rivers.

     Latin America and the Caribbean: warming will dramatically affect ecosystems in the LAC region,
     especially the Amazon rainforest, threatening the livelihoods of those who depend on ecosystem
     services.

     Middle East and North Africa: already the world’s driest region, MENA will experience lower
     water availability and higher temperatures. The dependence on water intensive modes of employ-
     ment such as irrigated agriculture are a concern in the context of further drying and increasing
     water demands.

and intensity (box 1.1).5 With warmer surface temperatures, seas fuel more
violent storms, increasing the risks of floods and droughts. Severe storms,
such as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, can generate storm surges over
coastal seas and extreme rainfall over land. The frequency of future tropical
cyclones remains uncertain, but most models project higher precipitation
rates and wind speeds.6
   Flood hazards are projected to increase in more than half the world’s
regions, although this varies greatly for individual river basins. Disaster
hotspots are magnified by the growth of coastal cities, where vulnerability to
floods is high. While there is agreement across models on the broad regional
and global trends, there is uncertainty about impacts at smaller spatial scales.
Some models predict increasing flood hazards in parts of South Asia,
Southeast Asia, East Africa, Central and West Africa, Northeast Eurasia, and
South America.7 In contrast, floods are projected to be less frequent in parts
of Northern and Eastern Europe, Anatolia, Central Asia, Central North
America, and Southern South America.8,9

Impacts on Groundwater
The planet’s aquifers are a vast natural reservoir, containing about 30 percent
of the available freshwater.10 Groundwater storage provides a natural buffer

4	                               High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
against climate variability; it is thus vital not only for the economy but for a
country’s sustainability.
   Climate change is expected to affect groundwater reservoirs, directly
through changes in recharge patterns, and indirectly through increased
demand, especially from irrigation, which today takes 70 percent of global
groundwater withdrawals.11 Groundwater recharge varies considerably,
depending on prevailing climatic conditions. In general, in regions where
total runoff is expected to decline (map 1.1), groundwater resources will also
decrease.12 Similarly, reduced surface water flows in regions that suffer from
changes in snowmelt may be exacerbated by falling groundwater levels due to
a shorter recharge season.
   Climate change also brings risks to the quality of water in aquifers. Regions
with higher temperatures may suffer from greater groundwater salinity as
more water evaporates before it can reach deeper levels. Rising sea levels push
seawater inland, and coastal aquifers shrink as rising demand drops ground-
water tables. Although difficult to quantify, these trends suggest that coastal
groundwater reservoirs will be under the most pressure in regions with
declining runoff, where they will be needed the most.
   The increased variability that comes with climate change will inevitably
raise reliance on underground freshwater supplies. If protected and managed
along with surface water, groundwater can do much in adapting to climate
change. Its widespread availability and typically large volumes—and thus long
retention time and slow response—make it more naturally buffered against
seasonal and inter-year variations in rainfall and temperature. Unlike surface
storage, aquifers lose negligible amounts of water through evaporation and
transpiration.



The Drivers of Demand: The Nexus of Farms,
Cities, Energy, and the Environment
The coming decades will see a convergence of growing populations, rising
incomes, and a changing climate. Demand for water will increase throughout
all sectors of the economy, while, at the same time, water supplies will become
more variable and less predictable. Indeed estimates suggest that within the
next 3 decades, the global food system will require between 40 to 50 percent
more water; municipal and industrial water demand will increase by 50 to
70 percent;13 the energy sector will see water demand increase by 85 percent;
and the environment, already the residual claimant, may receive even less.
   The expanded water nexus is a way of conceptualizing and promoting more
effective risk management and cross-sectoral climate policy to ensure water is
utilized most efficiently (figure 1.1). The concept of studying the inter-­linkages
between water, climate, and economic sectors is not a new one. Indeed, the
scientific community has been studying the “Nexus of Food-Energy and
Water Systems” for nearly a decade.14 This report takes a more expansive view,
by extending the nexus to two other critical and integrated sectors- the urban
sector, and the environment.

Dividing the Same Water between More Straws
The weight of evidence suggests that the problem of water allocation will
become increasingly acute for governments across the globe. These growing
pressures stem both from the direct effects of climate change as well as popu-
lation growth and economic development that increase competition for a lim-
ited resource. Overall, barring significant increases in water efficiency
(especially in agriculture), the world may face a shortfall in water availability
of approximately 2,700 billion cubic meters by 2030, with demand exceeding
current sustainable water supplies by 40 percent.15
   In many regions, the gap between water demand and availability will exac-
erbate already severe stresses on water resources. Large portions of the world
(virtually the whole of South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa), exist
in a state of near-permanent water stress, in which net withdrawals of surface
and groundwater meet or exceed the available supply, meaning that no addi-
tional water is available for ecosystem use, or to meet future demand.16 About
4 billion people—60 percent of the world’s population—reside in these basins.
Such stresses are clearly unsustainable and in the long run would threaten the
integrity and productivity of aquatic ecosystems. At the same time there is
much wastage in the system. Some cities, even in arid areas, lose more water
through leaking pipes than they deliver to households.17
   The challenge of managing water resources under climate induced stresses is
therefore one of reconciling the mismatch between escalating demands for
water and a finite and more spatially and temporally variable supply of water in

                ways that do not degrade the natural resource base upon which human and
                ecological systems depend. The remainder of this report is focused upon this
                fundamental issue.


                An Uncertain Future
                There is considerable uncertainty about long-term climate projections.
                Global circulation models have not been designed to project changes in the
                hydrological cycle, which is treated as just one element of a larger climate
                system. And this imprecision is compounded when models are extended to
                finer spatial scales. Forecasts and projections of extreme events are even more
                challenging, reflecting the statistical complexities of projecting extreme events
                and the limitations of the data.
                   Even so, there is broad agreement on the overall global trends across mod-
                els. The primary challenge for decision makers is to plan for a more uncertain
                and hazardous future, where general trends are known with greater certainty
                than the precise nature and timing of the changes. Such circumstances put a
                high premium on adaptable and flexible approaches that can respond to new
                information and changing circumstances (box 1.2).



Box 1.2  Decision-Making under Uncertainty
Uncertainty is intrinsic to climate change: there is ample evidence that the climate is changing
but less confidence on precisely how fast or in what ways. Nor is there a full understanding of the
social and economic consequences of these changes. Furthermore, the uncertainty about these
issues is not always easily quantifiable in probabilistic terms: climate change brings deep uncer-
tainty rather than known risks.

Despite these challenges, a number of methods have evolved to assist in decision-making under
uncertainty. Uncertainty places a high premium on options that minimize regret across a range of pos-
sible outcomes. The robust decision-making process is one such approach. Applications begin with an
existing or proposed project plan, explore vulnerabilities and sensitivities, and rank options for their
sensitivity to changing conditions. Another is a decision-tree approach that uses judgments and sensi-
tivity analysis to guide the process through various “decision nodes.” It begins by assessing the relative
performance and vulnerabilities of alternatives, using that information to describe scenarios, and then
applying the information to answer specific questions arising during the decision-making process.

Other common approaches include “no-regret” measures that yield benefits even if forecasts are
proven to be wrong. For example, controlling leakages in water pipes is a sound policy, regardless
of how the climate changes. Another approach emphasizes reversible and flexible strategies. It is
prudent to keep options open when the future is unknown. Urban planning falls into this category.
A plan can adapt with the arrival of new information on risks. The option value technique is one vari-
ant that provides a more formal and rigorous way of assuring greater flexibility in decision-making.

In general, there is no universally accepted general methodology for assessing the significance of
climate risks, and choices are often guided by pragmatism, available resources and information.

A Brake on Prosperity
and Progress?
Growing Populations, Growing Economies,
and Growing Water Needs
In 50 years there may be two billion more people on this planet, and the
world’s population may exceed nine billion. And as countries grow more pros-
perous, their thirst for water rises. In many basins, especially in arid parts of
the world, water is already over-allocated for much of the year and the basins
are effectively closed to new users. Even where large water-storage facilities
have been built, demand is so great that storage seldom reaches the desired
capacity. Climate change is set to compound such challenges, intensifying
extremes and accentuating scarcity when runoff declines. So it is no surprise
that there are growing concerns about water’s availability in the future.
  The problem is not the adequacy of available water—it is the distribution
and stewardship of water. Much of the world’s water is used inefficiently by
industry, agriculture, and cities even in arid areas; and much of it is wasted
without economic benefit, often with negative environmental impacts.


High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                          9
Climate change is not expected to alter global supplies. Instead, the challenges
are regional, due to the uneven distribution of water, and economic due to
poor management of water resources. Without substantial reforms, water-­
related shocks and trends will converge to produce growing scarcity in some
regions of the world and growing excess in others.
   Water scarcity has commonly been seen as a technical issue. If water is in
short supply in one region, the obvious solution is to obtain it from another
where it is more abundant. But what is obvious may not always be prudent,
and such supply-side solutions face economic and ecological limits.
   Water has a low value-to-bulk ratio, which makes its transport across vast
distances expensive and economically wasteful. So with climate change
increasing the hydrological challenges, water management will require greater
care and efficiency, recognizing not only the local needs for water but also its
multiple values—as an economic resource, a human right, and the lifeblood
of ecosystems. This chapter focuses on how water-related shocks and trends
in water use under climate change is likely to affect regional economies.



The Pathways through which Water Scarcity
and Stress under Climate Change Can Affect
the Economy
Could a lack of water act as a brake on prosperity and economic progress
under climate change? There are four primary pathways through which cli-
mate induced water shocks could impede development: First, if water is a
scarce factor of production and is poorly allocated or inefficiently used, there
could be impacts on broad economic performance—captured through met-
rics such as GDP growth, trade balances, and industry structure. Somewhat
surprisingly there is limited understanding and knowledge of these links. In
addition, water related natural disasters directly destroy lives and assets. The
likely toll of future natural disasters is well documented with a litany of pro-
jected damage estimates. Next there are longer term impacts of water related
diseases on health, nutrition, education and human capital with consequences
for poverty and economic growth. These have been well documented. Finally,
the conjecture that water related shocks ignite conflicts warrants closer scru-
tiny, especially because of its implications for water management. The remain-
der of this chapter examines these issues.


Water, Climate Change, and Economic
Performance
A global economic model was developed for this report to shed light on pos-
sible impacts of water related climate impacts on the economy.1 The model
considers two scenarios that correspond to the Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways (SSPs) that have been developed in the ­ climate-change modeling
literature (box 2.1). The SSPs are highly-stylized depictions of alternative

10	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
Box 2.1  Climate Change and the Economic Effects of
Water Deficits
Projecting future economic performance is a complex and hazardous endeavor. Future changes in
economic structures, technological innovations, policies, political priorities, and consumer pref-
erences cannot be known. Nor can the future path of greenhouse gas emissions be predicted with
accuracy.

Recognizing the prevailing uncertainties, climate change scientists have constructed highly styl-
ized development scenarios based on narratives termed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).2
The SSPs describe changes in demography, policy, institutions, technology, economy, and life-
styles. The narratives are intended to serve as a general description of alternative futures that
span a wide range of outcomes. The modeling described here considers two extreme scenar-
ios as points of comparison. SSP1, “Sustainability,” represents an optimistic outlook, and SSP3,
“Regional Rivalry,” embodies a rocky road in a world of high emissions, low adaptation, and
limited economic progress.

Climate change will have impacts that encompass all areas of development—ecosystems, human
health, agricultural yields, among others—all of which have been examined in the burgeoning
modeling literature. The focus here is on the largely overlooked issue of the economic impacts of
climate change through changes in water supplies.

Since economic growth spurs water demand in rough proportion to the income it generates, there
are legitimate concerns that expanding water deficits in some regions could constrain growth. To
explore this issue, projections of water supply from a range of hydrological models underlying the
projections in map 2 are incorporated in a conventional Computable General Equilibrium model
for the SSP 1 and SSP 3 scenarios.

The analysis considers economic impacts under various broad policy regimes. The first is
“­business as usual,” where water allocation policies remain largely unresponsive to changing ­levels
   scarcity. This is modified by allowing for increasing shifts in allocation within and between
of ­
industries to reflect the implicit value (shadow price) of water in the economy.

Simulations are performed using a Computable General Equilibrium model. The model approx-
imates how economic sectors are inter-related, and can therefore estimate how a shock in one
sector would reverberate through the entire economy. Water is treated as an input that is used in
fixed proportions based upon exogenous allocations, that are varied to assess how economic per-
formance changes with different allocation policies. It is assumed that water efficiency improve-
ments that have been observed in the past in developed economies apply globally and continue
through the simulation period. The model computes counterfactual equilibria for the world econ-
omy based on water supply and demand estimated for the SSPs shown in figure B2.1, resulting
in estimates for future production, consumption, investments, trade flows, and many other econ-
omy variables.

  Such models are not designed to forecast the future. As with all modeling exercises, the analysis is
  based on a litany of assumptions, driven by data availability and computational constraints. The
  exercise provides projections—the consequence of hypothesized scenarios in a stylized depiction
  of the economy, not predictions and forecasts. Nevertheless, such ­   modeling  exercises serve to
  improve understanding of the magnitude and direction of changes and to project whether alter-
  native policies can either accentuate or mitigate the adverse impacts.

  Regardless of which scenario is considered, the results demonstrate that a scarce water supply
  remains a significant obstacle to growth and development in the context of a changing climate.
  They also forcefully illustrates that prudent management of water resources is likely sufficient to
  neutralize some of the undesirable growth impacts.

the scenarios represents a world of sustainability and optimism with low

population growth rates, buoyant per capita GDP, low emissions, and thus
little need for adaptation (SSP1). This is contrasted with a world of regional
rivalry and high emissions that warrant greater adaptation (SSP3).

    The model developed here is not intended to provide forecasts of GDP
growth decades into the future—a seemingly impossible task. Instead,
it  seeks to improve understanding of the role of water in the context of
a  changing climate in a more populous world. It is based on a simplify-
ing framework designed to isolate the role of water as a productive input in
the economy.
    Increasing water demands resulting from increases in population, coupled
with changes in the water supply, are projected to accentuate shortages in
regions already experiencing some scarcity and water stress. The largest
increases in water deficits are in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia,
and parts of South Asia.
    With water in short supply, there will be changes in what is produced,
where it is produced, and the efficiency of production and water use. So, even
local changes can be transmitted across the globe.
    The impacts will depend on the policy regime, and effects can either be
neutralized or exacerbated by policy responses. The analysis first considers
a business-as-usual scenario where water is managed and allocated as it is
under current regimes. In this scenario, water allocation does not respond
to the growing shortages and changing comparative advantage of different
sectors across the globe. The resulting changes in GDP are shown in the
lower bounds of figure 2.1, which presents the worst projected outcome of
SSP1 and SSP3.3
    The economic consequences are highly unequal with the worst effects in
the driest regions. The expected global damages are small relative to the
expected global GDP in 2050: about 0.37 (SSP1) to 0.49 (SSP3) percent of
global GDP in that year. But the global loss is a highly misleading estimate
because, as the lower bounds of figure 2.1 illustrate, significant variations exist
between regions. Western Europe and North America, where much global
GDP is produced, experience negligible damages in most scenarios. The bulk

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                                                                      13
of losses are in the Middle East, the Sahel, and Central and East Asia, and the
magnitude of losses is largely driven by the level of the water deficit. In the
most arid regions, the projected percentage losses are large and imply that
baseline growth projections cannot be met.
   Other impacts are less visible, such as changes in trade patterns that cloud
economic prospects in subtle ways.4 The projections suggest that trade
becomes distorted when countries in arid areas continue to produce water-­
intensive goods at ever-increasing financial and social cost, contrary to their
natural comparative advantage.
   But there is a silver lining. When governments respond to water short-
ages by boosting efficiency and allocating water to more highly-valued
uses, losses decline dramatically and may even vanish. This is illustrated in
the upper bounds of changes in figure 2.1 (note that the larger value
between SSP1 and SSP3 is displayed). The upper bounds depict a world in
which 25 percent of water is allocated to higher value uses. In most cases
the losses from climate stress vanish and better water management even
leads to growth rates that could be higher than those that would prevail in
the absence of climate change and changes in policy. Improved water stew-
ardship thus pays high economic dividends. There are however some
regions of the world where more far-reaching actions would be needed.
These are the extremely dry regions where scarcities are intense and the
current allocation is far removed from the economically efficient outcomes,
and hence require stronger policies and reforms to cope with deepening
climate stresses.
   The overarching message is that outcomes are driven by policy decisions,
suggesting that prudent water-management policies can do much to secure
growth, making people richer and thus more resilient to climate stresses. This
often, but not necessarily, requires using market forces and prices to guide
water allocation decisions.
   The implication is that the benefits to managing water resources as a valu-
able economic resource are considerable. Water pricing can do much in this
regard. Even if only a part of water use is allocated based on a price that brings
supply and demand into balance, many of the problems of climate and
socio-economic scarcity can be resolved.
   Water that is provided free, promotes and condones overuse and waste.
Countries that price water more cheaply also consume it more freely. Often,
the most inefficient users of water are found in countries with the highest
levels of water stress, where incentives are also lacking for prudent water
use. More efficient water pricing, coupled with policies that safeguard the
most marginal members of society, can therefore ensure that sufficient water
is conserved and guarantee enough water to meet basic needs. As the
Australian experience has demonstrated, market-based solutions, when
complemented with policies that secure essential allocations for the envi-
ronment and the world’s poorest, can do much to assure greater efficiency of
water use, higher levels of equity in its allocation, and long-term sustainabil-
ity of the resource base.

A Brake on Economic Growth Will Mean a Brake
on Poverty Alleviation
The model described in the previous section suggests that unless significant
action is taken, water challenges due to climate change will significantly
impair global economic growth. And even under favorable assumptions,
some of the most fragile regions are expected to see growth declines, includ-
ing the Middle East, the Sahel, and Central Africa. This is troubling not only
from a wealth and prosperity standpoint, but also for the effect that this slow-
down will have on poverty alleviation.
   Past studies have shown that economic growth and poverty alleviation are
closely tied, with the latter highly dependent on the former. Indeed, across all
nations, a 1 percent increase in mean income has been associated with a 2 to
3 percent reduction in the poverty headcount ratio5 (that is, the percentage of
people within a country living below the poverty line). There is considerable
heterogeneity in the magnitude of this link. It is known that poverty allevia-
tion is much slower in economies that are more unequal, or have higher initial
levels of poverty.6 There are regional differences too. For instance, Sub-Saharan
Africa tends to exhibit poverty rates that decline at a slower rate relative to the
rest of the world, during periods of economic expansion.7 It has been sug-
gested that this may be due to SSA’s heavy reliance on mining, which is a highly
capital intensive industry and tends to benefit investors and managers near the
top of the income distribution, rather than laborers at the bottom.8 Nevertheless,
it is clear that the large reduction in GDP growth that could occur due to
increased water scarcity and variability, in the absence of prudent policy
responses, will prevent millions of people worldwide from escaping poverty.
   Of course, climate change will not only affect poor households via reduc-
tions in aggregate GDP, or through other economic benchmarks. Direct
impacts on poor households, including an increase in prices, the destruction
of assets, and a reduction in labor productivity, may impact the well-being of
the poor significantly more than a slow-down in aggregate economic growth.
Box 2.2 highlights the insights from a recent World Bank report, Shockwaves:
Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty, which analyzes the spe-
cific challenges that climate change will inflict on the world’s poor.



The Growing Economic and Human Impact of
Extreme Events
Variability and rainfall extremes are hard to manage. Too much rain at once
can generate storm surges and floods, capable of taking lives, destroying
property, and through lingering effects, bring pestilence and diseases. In
the other extreme, droughts can destroy entire harvests, wiping out the
livelihoods of rural farmers, increasing food prices for urban residents,
and making it more difficult to apply basic hygiene rules. Natural disasters
often disproportionately affect poor households whose homes and assets

   Box 2.2  Climate Change’s Effect on Poverty
   The World Bank’s recently released report Shockwaves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change
   on Poverty explores the interconnected goals of ending poverty, and addressing climate change.
   Climate change’s impact on water distribution will affect the poor in three major ways: though its
   effect on agriculture, health, and natural disasters.

   Nearly 78 percent of the world’s poor, approximately 800 million people, live in rural areas and
   rely on agriculture, livestock, or aquaculture to sustain themselves and their families. With cli-
   mate change expected to have dramatic effects on rainfall variability in many regions, farmers
   will be impacted more than perhaps any other group of people. Under high emissions scenarios,
   changes in rainfall patterns are projected to negatively affect crop yields globally, reducing them
   by up to 10 percent by 2030, and up to nearly 35 percent by 2080.9

   If these projections are realized, agricultural production shocks will trigger significant increases
   in the price of food and food insecurity, for both rural and urban inhabitants. As poorer house-
   holds spend a significantly larger share of their income on food (figure B2.2), they will be the most
   impacted. The magnitude of the changes in food prices due to climate change is highly uncertain.
   Without CO2 fertilization, estimated food price changes due to climate change ranges from a
   3 to 84 percent increase by 2050. With CO2 fertilization however, the estimated range moderates
   significantly, changing to between a 30 percent decrease in food prices to a 45 percent increase.10
   Some farmers may benefit from these increases in food prices, increasing their profitability.
   Additionally, some agricultural laborers may see wages increase due to the increases in profit.

   Increased water scarcity and variability will also lead to greater exposure to contaminated waters,
   less water available for sanitation, and increased disease burdens. These impacts will dispropor-
   tionately affect poor households who may already lack adequate sanitation and reliable water
   supplies. Climate change will increase incidences of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases.

Box 2.2  Climate Change’s Effect on Poverty (continued)
Diarrhea often occurs after the consumption of water which is contaminated due to flooding.11
One case of diarrhea can cost a family $2 to $4, on top of the days lost at work or school, and it is
unexpected healthcare costs such as these that are very often cited as the reason why households
fall into poverty.12

Finally, floods, droughts, and storm surges will increase with climate change, and the world’s
poor will be the most exposed to their damage. As part of the Shockwaves report, a study was
conducted on poverty-related exposure bias, and found that poor households tend to be more
exposed to droughts and urban floods than their more wealthy counterparts.13 Exposure bias to
droughts is primarily due to the fact that the poor disproportionately rely on agricultural income,
which is most at risk from droughts. Urban flood exposure bias likely occurs because urban space
is scarce and so urban land markets will value flood-prone land lower, making it more affordable
for poorer families. These exposure biases are expected to persist well into the future, with total
exposure projected to increase due to climate change.

In addition to being more exposed to extreme events, poor households tend to lose a relatively
higher share of their assets due to storms or floods.14 This is partially because poorer households’
assets tend to be more vulnerable to loss. In rural areas, much of household wealth tends to be in
the form of livestock, which are highly vulnerable to droughts, storms, and floods. Housing stock
also tends to be of lower quality, and more easily damaged or destroyed during storms.



               are less robust and more vulnerable, and also tend to be located in higher
               risk areas. This vulnerability discourages investment in physical assets,
               which have the potential to be destroyed, and it can cause nutritional,
               health, and income shocks which tend to reduce human capital invest-
               ments, particularly in children.
                  Whatever the projected frequency and intensity of floods and droughts,
               their economic impacts will almost certainly rise as the density of economic
               activity and people increases in areas of greater climate vulnerability. While
               the threat of more frequent and severe droughts looms large under climate
               change, floods are arguably exacting a more visible and perhaps an even more
               rapidly growing toll. Between 1960 and 1990, floods in Europe destroyed, on
               average, assets worth about $7 billion per year. If the trend continues—and
               trends may change—the damage under most climate scenarios is expected to
               double in Europe by 2080.15
                  Some extreme events directly linked to the hydrological cycle can have eco-
               nomic effects that are much greater and persist longer than expected. A recent
               study used meteorological data to reconstruct every country’s exposure to
               tropical cyclones during 1950–2008.16 It finds that national incomes decline
               after a disaster and do not recover within 20 years. This conclusion holds for
               both developed and developing countries. Income losses arise from a small
               but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the 15 years
               following a water-based disaster. The results suggest that future cyclone activ-
               ity would result in costs of about $10 trillion larger than previous estimates

(in discounted present value). Another study found that it is the largest, most
damaging natural disasters which have lasting impacts, but that these impacts
can be subdued with better institutional quality, higher openness to trade,
and higher financial openness.17


The Long-Term Economic Effects of Rainfall Shocks
on Human Capital
There has been much research on the contemporaneous impacts of water
scarcity and variability, climate change, and the intersection of the two; that is,
how an increased future propensity for rainfall shocks will impact economic
growth. However, there is also growing evidence that these water shocks may
have much longer-term effects. This is particularly true when water shocks
cause nutritional deficits or health impacts in young children, or income
shocks which prevent families from investing in their children.18
   As an example, in rural Vietnam, most families engage in rain-fed crop
production- mainly irrigated rice production. Income is therefore heavily
dependent on favorable rainfall conditions, and rainfall shocks often lead to
significant income reductions for families. These income shocks can lead to
nutritional deficits for developing fetuses and infants, which has dramatic
consequences later in life. Children in Vietnam who experienced these shocks
were shown to have delayed school entry, slowed progress in school, and
lower height than their peers that did not experience this shock.19 Similar
effects have also been observed in rural India20 and Mexico.21
   This exposure to malnutrition and childhood illness as a result of drought
can help perpetuate the cycle of poverty. Illnesses and chronic malnourish-
ment can impact educational attainment, reducing future employment pros-
pects. Where they impact childhood development and the central nervous
system (such as severe cerebral malaria), they can have an impact on lifelong
cognitive ability, leading to reduced future wages. Childhood stunting, which
can be caused by repeated bouts with diarrheal diseases, is associated with
long-term health and economic risks including reduced educational attain-
ment, lower earnings, increased morbidity rates, and higher mortality rates.22
   The idea that in-utero or infancy shocks like extreme drought could have
long-term impacts was most prominently posited by David J. Barker23, a British
epidemiologist, and is now known as the fetal origins hypothesis. Mounting
evidence shows the important role that early-life conditions can have on future
success. A survey of rural farmers in Indonesia has shown that individuals,
and particularly females, who experienced rainfall shocks during the first year
of their lives achieved less education, earned less money, and married spouses
who earned less money.24 Recent evidence extends these results to middle class
workers in Ecuador, where it has been found that individuals that experienced
rainfall shocks, as well as hotter temperatures, while in-utero, had reduce for-
mal sector earnings 20 to 60 years later in life.25 These results show that climate
change may have as yet underappreciated impacts on not only rural farmers,
but also middle class workers from middle-income countries.

18	                        High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
The Thirsty Origins of Migration and Conflict
Throughout history, humans have waged war to gain access to natural
resources, including land, minerals, and even water. The first recorded water
war occurred more than 4,500 years ago in modern-day Iraq, near the conflu-
ence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Fought between the neighboring
ancient city-states of Lagash and Umma, the conflict erupted when Lagash
diverted the water supplies of its neighbor. History records other instances of
violence over water. Drying events are thought to have fueled transboundary
invasions in ancient China and political instability in historical Egypt.26
Colonial conquests were often driven as much by a quest for territory, as nat-
ural resources.
   Though much has been conjectured about a future of resource wars, today
states rarely, if ever, fight over water alone. Arguably, this should come as no
surprise. Wars are a costly endeavor with uncertain consequences, which ren-
ders dialog and cooperation a more attractive way to resolve disputes. As a
result, cooperation and dialog over transboundary water resources is more com-
mon today than Malthusian resource conflicts. This is not to deny that water
scarcity could act as a conflict risk multiplier in some cases. But more typically if
disputes arise, they are mediated in ways that facilitate peaceful resolution.
   While resource wars between countries may be uncommon today, tensions
over water resources within countries are much more widespread. Episodes of
drought and floods are often followed by spikes in violence, civil war, and
regime change in developing countries. The strongest evidence is from Sub
Saharan Africa where civil wars tend to erupt following periods of low rain-
fall.27 In rural Brazil, land invasions are more common during drier years with
more intense conflict in areas where land ownership is more unequal.28 In
India property related violence increases by about 4 percent when there is
below average rainfall and communal riots become more frequent following
episodes of floods.29
   There are sound economic reasons to expect rainfall anomalies to cascade
into violence. Droughts and floods typically generate poverty and accentuate
deprivation especially in countries where agriculture remains an important
source of employment. Poverty in turn alters the calculus of participating in
conflict. Combatants have less to lose when customary sources of livelihood
have been dwindled by droughts or floods, and they have more to gain by
participating in violence that might beget a better future. The conflict vulner-
ability of a country to rainfall shocks typically depends upon the rainfall sen-
sitivity of its income and its ability to provide protection and alternative
sources of employment.
   Rainfall shocks ignite conflicts in other ways too. Evidence from Africa
suggests that by straining government budgets, their capacity and popularity
decline, making regime change more likely.30 Migration within and between
countries, which tends to increase in areas facing water shocks, remains a
potent and widely documented source of friction between locals and new
arrivals across much of the world. Indeed, a decline in precipitation has
been found to act as a “push factor” inducing much of the migration to cities.

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                             19
The impact is particularly strong in Sub-Saharan Africa where a 1 percent
reduction in precipitation is associated with a 0.59 percent increase in the
urbanization rate.31 The effects are more pronounced in cities with a manufac-
turing base that can absorb economic migrants seeking employment.32 Similar
trends have been observed elsewhere. In the Indian state of Gujarat when
groundwater irrigation became less available or more expensive due to a
declining water table, farmers migrated to cities instead of seeking alternative
adaptation strategies such as shifts in cropping patterns or more efficient irri-
gation technologies.33
   The increases in water variability and expanding water deficits that are pre-
dicted to occur due to climate change have the potential to increase the pro-
pensity for conflict. Building resilience to the more extreme precipitation
events of climate change will become a more urgent priority especially in
rainfall vulnerable areas.


The Way Forward: Implications for Policy
Water Allocation
Getting the distribution of water right will go a long way toward decoupling
water use from economic growth. In many regions, water resources have been
over-allocated, and climate change will compound the scarcity. If but a small
part of water use were allocated to bring supply and demand into balance,
many anticipated problems of climate and socio-economic scarcity could be
resolved. Today, the marginal value of water for different uses varies greatly
because the prices paid by industry, agriculture, and residential users are
often unrelated. For example, in Arizona, water prices vary from $27 an acre-
foot for agriculture to $3,200 an acre-foot for urban uses—so there is much
suppressed demand in the cities.34 While some of the gap could be explained
by the difference in the nature and quality of the product delivered, most of it
is a function of institutions that do not allocate water on the basis of explicit
and transparent economic, distributional, or political criteria.
   A fundamental rethinking of water rights and appropriate governance
mechanisms is also needed. The focus could be on how water rights could be
used not as a declaration of inviolate ownership, but as a flexible instrument
to resolve water conflicts at the community, basin, regional, national, and
global levels, while still protecting the needs of the poor. Adequate manage-
ment and regulation— particularly of common groundwater aquifers—is
essential to ensure that there is a mechanism for efficient allocation across
water sources and uses. In this context, the emergence of sophisticated tech-
nologies to monitor, measure, and disclose water “performance” using objec-
tive metrics is an opportunity not yet realized.
   The gains from addressing scarcity through markets, prices, or other eco-
nomic instruments would be immediate. But the task will not be easy. It will
often call for a fundamental reform of institutional and legal structures to
address the impediments to allocating water to sectors and uses where
demand and value added is greatest. It involves developing systems that are

20	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
credible, trusted by all parties and assure fair compensation for transfers.
This, in turn, requires an administrative entity with the capacity, knowledge
and authority to monitor and measure water use and ensure compliance with
the agreed rules of the game. In addition any change must overcome inher-
ent political challenges. On the one hand, political leaders may be hesitant to
expose the poor and key constituents like farmers to price increases. However,
these challenges can be partly addressed through carefully-targeted assis-
tance such as subsidies or block tariffs structures. But the past weighs heavily
on the present, and the (often) wealthier water users who benefit from low
water prices will naturally resist price reform. At times it may be necessary to
directly compensate those who loose from new tariff structures, as in the
case of Australia’s reforms. This reality calls for transparent and equitable
systems for compensation that may be needed to build a political consensus
for reform.
  Finally, to prevent increases in food insecurity, policies should be put in
place which make it easier to import food, especially in countries with no
comparative advantage in food production where water resources are being
degraded in the attempt to force increases in food supply.

Water Proofing through Investment
While improving water allocation is essential to satisfying trends in future
water use, providing security against water-related shocks requires invest-
ments in adaptation, especially if mitigation is limited. Adaptation will require
both private and public action, with the public initially at least as large as the
private to catalyze the process. In developing countries, the infrastructure gap
for water storage, flood control, and energy supply is massive. Compounding
the lack of infrastructure is inadequate investment in maintaining costly
assets. Short-term savings on operations and maintenance are a false econ-
omy and can be counterproductive if they shorten the life of the asset. This
is  especially important in the water sector, where assets are expensive,
capital-intensive, and long-lived (can last more than 100 years).
­
   To protect the world’s poor against natural hazards, developing countries
need to be better able to predict when they will occur. This means investing
more in hydro-meteorological, and early-warning systems, and putting the
institutions in place which are capable of transforming a forecast into an
actionable warning. Increasing the lead time of a forecasted storm or flood
even by a few hours can help households mitigate the damage to their assets
and can even help to save lives. Having more spatially granular forecasts is
also important to help individuals determine the appropriate damage mitigat-
ing action they should take.35

Policy Choices under Uncertainty
But where uncertainty is high, as in projecting extreme events, it is wise to
leave options open (box 1.1). Sinking all adaptation efforts into a single
and  costly project can prove wasteful, if the anticipated climate events do
not  eventuate. No-regret measures that provide benefits under a range of

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                          21
outcomes increase flexibility, as do modular approaches that can tailor
responses to evolving circumstances. Soft policies, such as economic instru-
ments and climate-informed plans, can be especially useful in such contexts.
Some studies suggest that if Australia had introduced adequate water tariffs,
water demand might have been managed to a level that no longer required the
investments in costly desalination plants that now risk lying idle due to the
expense of the water they produce.36

Dimensions of the
Water-Climate Nexus:
The Drivers of Demand
The future will be thirsty. Growing populations, rising incomes, and a chang-
ing climate will converge to create unprecedented strains for the world’s water
resources. On the one hand, the world will experience a surge in demand for
water; but on the other hand, under climate change it will experience a less
reliable supply. Meeting the simultaneous increases in demand for water for
food production, energy generation, urban growth, and ecosystem services
will be impossible under business-as-usual.
   Within the next three decades, demand for water from agriculture
could increase by 50 percent, and for urban uses by between 50 percent and
70 percent.1 Meanwhile, by 2035, the energy sector is projected to consume
85  percent more water.2 These increased strains will create unprecedented
conflicts between different water uses, and inter-connected risks between
them. This chapter examines trade-offs between water uses and the key driv-
ers of demand: food production, urbanization, energy, and the environment.

Meeting Food Security Challenges
Sustainably feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 is perhaps the greatest
global challenge of our time. By most estimates food production will need to
double over this period. At the same time, the demand for meat, which con-
sumes and pollutes large amounts of water, is increasing with income growth
and rising nutritional standards. The agricultural sector already consumes
over 70 percent of the available freshwater, and is the single largest anthropo-
genic water user. But over the next few decades, these already high water
requirements are set to expand still further.3 These demands will have to be
met against the backdrop of shifting and often shrinking water resources, and
amidst rapidly growing competition for water use in other sectors, including
energy, environmental, and urban.4 Nowhere are the trade-offs between these
different water uses more acute than in the case of the global food system
under climate change.

Climate Change Will Exacerbate Food Security
Challenges
The basic challenge facing the global food system is that current approaches
to increase food production, which rely on ever-greater inputs of land, water,
and fertilizer, appear to be much less viable and suitable under climate change.
The intensification of food production since the 1970’s has achieved great suc-
cess in feeding a rapidly growing global population. But this has often been
achieved through methods and policies that lacked incentives for prudent use
of inputs, resulting in the degradation of the natural resource base upon
which future growth depends. There is also growing evidence that these
impressive gains in yields are beginning to plateau in some areas.5
  Even without climate change, meeting increasing water requirements
would pose a substantial challenge for the global food system. In order to
feed an additional 2 billion people by 2050 using current practices and tech-
nologies, the global food system would have to increase irrigation water
withdrawals by about 5 percent annually. This is the equivalent of building a
new dam about one-and-a-half times the size of the Aswan Dam every
year.6,7 Climate change will increase these already-high water requirements.
Higher temperatures generally increase water requirements for both crops
and livestock, in turn resulting in disproportionate impacts in areas domi-
nated by rain-fed agriculture. Estimates suggest that in the South Asia
region, farm-related income could decline by as much as 25 percent due to
diminishing crop yields.8
  Dependable water supplies are the single most important climactic fac-
tor in agricultural production,9 and climate change will alter the amount of
water available both in particular geographic regions, and seasons. While
the magnitude of these effects is uncertain, estimates suggest that the cycle
of flooding and drought associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation
events—which is similar to the type of increased variability that we
might see due to climate change—likely results in crop yield variability of
15 to 35 percent, suggesting the potential for significant disruption.10

24	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
Models indicate that this effect is most pronounced in major river basins,
including the Yangtze, the Ganges, and the Indus, that depend on seasonal
meltwater from snowpacks and glaciers for the majority of their flow.11


Old Strategies for Increasing Food Production Will
Become More Difficult
Traditional methods of increasing food production that have relied upon
expanding land, water, and other inputs will become less viable under climate
change. Land extensification, or the increase in land under cultivation, is
quickly becoming unsustainable as the forest margin is exhausted and the
risks to ecosystems accelerate.12 And in a climate change context, significant
extensification in areas of high rainfall is especially undesirable as it lowers
the carbon sequestration potential of the world’s tropical forests, thereby
exacerbating climate change.13
   Increasing irrigation from surface water offers a more direct means of
adapting to the effects of climate change, but must compete with other human
and environmental water requirements. Supplying more water to crops can
help to ameliorate the effects of warming and buffer disruptions caused by
increased variability in rainfall.14 However, in many parts of the world, little
additional surface water is available for irrigation, especially if environmental
flows are taken into account. Increasing diversions of surface water is impos-
sible in the increasing number of “closed basins” where virtually the entire
annual flow is already appropriated for human use. In these and other
highly-stressed basins, irrigation competes with other critical water uses,
­
including energy production. Irrigation already accounts for about 90 percent
of water use in many developing countries.15 This creates difficult trade-offs.
In the Blue Nile basin, for example, drier conditions mean that more water
must be stored in reservoirs for hydropower production, leaving less water
available for irrigation, despite increased agricultural water requirements.16
Optimized dam management can ameliorate but cannot eliminate these
trade-offs. Even in areas where additional water exists and can be stored for
irrigation, the costs of doing so will inevitably increase over time as the more
efficient and cost effective options are exhausted.
   Where surface water supplies are unavailable, irrigators have turned to
groundwater, where it is available.17 Globally, groundwater accounts for
approximately one-third of total water withdrawals, and approximately
50 percent of irrigation water withdrawals. However, much like surface water
flows, much of the world’s groundwater aquifers are already heavily exploited.
Critically, from an integrated nexus perspective, groundwater abstraction
requires approximately 30 percent more energy than surface water irriga-
tion,18 resulting in significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions. According
to one estimate, groundwater pumping accounts for no less than 4 to 6 ­percent
of India’s total carbon emissions.19
   While land and water constraints limit opportunities for increasing food
production through extensification in some regions, techniques which
increase food production through intensification can be damaging, if the

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                         25
off-farm impacts are ignored. Intensification, which involves increasing yields
on a given plot of land, typically requires soil nutrients to be replenished with
phosphorus or nitrogen based fertilizers. While these are essential for enhanc-
ing agricultural productivity, even small amounts of leeching are deemed to
be harmful to water supplies intended for human consumption.20 In some
regions, particularly the great plains of North America, Western Europe, and
East Asia, levels of phosphorus and nitrogen biochemical flows have already
reached unsafe levels.21


The Geography of Vulnerability
Climate change will have the biggest impact on food security in regions
which are already amongst the most insecure. Countries which have placed
most available arable land under cultivation, face high demand for irriga-
tion as well as other water uses relative to supply, and are already heavily
dependent on groundwater, are likely to face the greatest challenges.
Countries with large populations of smallholder farmers and weak institu-
tions are also likely to be highly vulnerable.22 On these measures, the coun-
tries of the South Asia and Middle East – North Africa regions are likely to
face the most difficult trade-offs with respect to the food system and the
other demands of water users. Because of its already high reliance on sur-
face and groundwater irrigation,23 South Asia has little additional water
available to increase agricultural production or compensate for predicated
climate-related shifts in the monsoon and runoff from the principal
Himalayan rivers.24 Across the Middle East and North Africa, meanwhile,
the lack of surface flows and reliance on non-renewable groundwater
reserves for irrigation makes agriculture especially vulnerable to predicted
warming across the region.25



Changing Cities and Changing Climate
Cities are arguably the economic success story of this century. Accounting for
over half the world’s global population, they have been the engines of eco-
nomic growth and generate about 80 percent of global GDP.26 While cities
offer immense opportunities for development and growth, they also bring
risks and challenges. Today these areas account for about 30 percent of water
used and return a large share of it to the system as wastewater, in a degraded
state.27 Globally, 456 million hectares of farmland can be found within a
20 kilometer radius of urban centers, an area about the size of the European
Union.28 But this is also a radius of resource depletion—with declining
groundwater levels, polluted and “dead” rivers, denuded watersheds, paved
floodplains, and deserts of natural biodiversity. Such impacts might seem
warranted as an inevitable price for accelerated growth and prosperity in cit-
ies, but risks would emerge if this undermines the resource base that enables
this growth.


26	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
   As the world continues to urbanize the demand for water in cities is pro-
jected to increase by 50 to 70 percent within the next three decades, and urban
residents—particularly the urban poor—become more vulnerable to the
effects of climate change. One in four cities worldwide already experiences
water insecurity.29 Climate change adds to demographic and supply-chain
pressures on cities, leading to fears of a perfect storm in which water short-
ages combine with periodic climate disasters to produce major social and eco-
nomic disruptions.30 The social and economic consequences of climate shocks
on cities can be particularly devastating in low- and middle-income coun-
tries.31 The annual global costs of adaptation for 2010–50 are estimated to
range between $71.2 billion and $81.5 billion, depending on the climate sce-
nario, and urban areas could bear more than 80 percent of these costs.32
   In cities, as elsewhere, the effects of climate change are mediated largely
through water. Cities are especially vulnerable to water-related climate shocks,
even as the increasingly common pattern of fixed water supplies and rising
demands is gripping cities across the world. Flooding events can degrade the
quality of surface and groundwater, cause the loss of human lives and prop-
erty, and disrupt the urban economy. Heat waves and variable precipitation
reduce the availability and quality of water while increasing demand. Rising
seas reduce groundwater availability due to salt-water intrusion and can per-
manently damage urban infrastructure.33

Impacts from Extreme Events—Slow and Rapid
The population affected by river floods is growing substantially, driven by
both climate change and socio-economic change.34 There are a litany famil-
iar projections of urban vulnerabilities. The additional urban flood dam-
ages that take account due to climate change are projected to reach between
$0.7 and $1.8 trillion by 2080.35 In 2005, global flood losses were approxi-
mately $6 billion. These are projected to increase to $52 billion by 2050 due
to projected socio-economic changes alone (increasing populations and
incomes). With climate change, these losses may reach at least $1 trillion
per year.36 Sea-level rise can multiply the impacts of storms by creating
devastating tidal surges,  often aggravated by land subsidence caused by
­
urban construction,  groundwater extraction, and the alteration of sedi-
mentation ­dynamics.37 Jakarta illustrates what these threats could mean for
coastal city populations (box 3.1).
  Cities are also vulnerable to slow-onset droughts, whose frequency and
intensity are expected to increase with climate change in many regions.38
Droughts may reduce the availability of water for municipal and industrial
use, energy (due to cooling water restrictions), and food (resulting in reduced
crop yields). They may also contribute to heightened urban migration pat-
terns and localized conflicts over scarce water. At the same time, urban water
demands are likely to increase with higher temperatures as a result of increased
demand for cooling. In California, the average annual cost of urban water
scarcity (in forgone benefits) is estimated at $1.6 billion a year.39

  Box 3.1  Jakarta Faces Multiple Urban Water Challenges40
  The city of Jakarta in Indonesia suffers from many water-related issues, including chronic flood-
  ing every year and extreme floods every few years. Despite these severe challenges, it still attracts
  a quarter of a million new residents every year. The 2007 flood, reaching 25 percent of the city,
  caused financial losses of $900 million.

  Flooding has been blamed on deforestation in the nearby mountains, but the main causes lie
  closer to home: wetlands and rice fields have been paved over in defiance of urban-planning
  regulations. Drainage canals are blocked by garbage, the result of an ineffective disposal system.
  And while the city confronts a sea-level rise of 60cm or more over this century, unregulated and
  unsustainable groundwater extraction has already sunk coastal areas of the city by up to 4.5 m
  over the past 50 years. Northern parts of Jakarta are predicted to be 4 to 5m below sea level within
  20 years, and floods would affect up to 5 million people. But Jakarta is not alone—this situation is
  shared by Bangkok and many other coastal or growing cities.




Water Availability and Urban Growth
The world is urbanizing at a rapid pace, and the most dramatic transforma-
tions are in low- and middle-income countries. By 2050, the number of urban
dwellers is projected to grow by 2.5 billion people, with nearly 90 percent of
the increase in Asia and Africa.41 Without adequate urban planning, regula-
tion, and development capacity, cities often expand through informal settle-
ment into flood-prone areas, where dwellers are deprived of municipal water,
sanitation, and flood protection (box 3.2).
   With population growth, and to less extent climate change, the number
of  urban dwellers who live with seasonal water shortages is forecast to
grow from close to 500 million people in 2000 to 1.9 billion in 2050.42 This
estimate may be a lower bound, since increasing competition between
agricultural, industrial, and municipal water users will further strain cities.
­
Urban populations are set to more than double by 2050 in the Middle East,
North Africa, and South Asia. But modeling for this study shows that reduced
freshwater availability and competition with other uses will reduce municipal
water consumption per capita between 31 percent and 66 percent com-
pared with the situation in 2015 under the SSP3 scenario (or 15 percent and
47 percent under SSP1).43



Water for Energy
The energy sector is a significant water consumer, especially for power
plant  cooling, mineral extraction and processing. In addition, return flows
from energy processing and production facilities are a major source of water
pollution. Overall, water withdrawals for energy production are expected to

Box 3.2  Urban Adaptation Strategies Can Be Economically
Beneficial
Few studies have rigorously analyzed the economics of urban resilience to water-related crises.
But whether in Casablanca,44 Copenhagen,45 or Bangkok,46 adaptation programs are less expen-
sive than the damages they avoid.

Inexpensive strategies with high benefit–cost ratios could be priorities. They include early warn-
ing systems and more generally measures to improve access to flood-risk information, which
can help urban planning, penalize investors supporting real estate development in unsafe areas,
and facilitate the development of insurance markets. While the costs and uncertain benefits of
adaptation may complicate the task of decision makers, many measures that contribute to climate
change mitigation are also highly relevant in a pro-poor sustainable urban policy agenda, regard-
less of climate issues.

The paradigm shift that climate change imposes on cities will require large-scale political, techni-
cal, and financial mobilization. Three factors will be instrumental to achieving long-term water
security objectives in cities. First is enhancing awareness among high-level policy makers about
climate risks and the availability of economically sound adaptation options. Second is developing
knowledge sharing and collaboration platforms for stakeholders managing or affecting the urban
water cycle. And third is assuring adequate investment funding from multilateral development
banks, governments, and the private sector. It will also be essential to support decision-making
and demonstrate project relevance with robust economic analysis applicable to complex adapta-
tion packages that include non-structural measures and cross-sectoral approaches.




               increase by 20 percent by 2035.47 Additional demands are imposed by the
               significant energy inputs required to transport and purify water.48
                  Some cleaner sources of energy are surprisingly thirsty and utilize
               large  amounts of water (figure 3.1).49 Hydropower plants, which provide a
               reliable supply of low-carbon electricity for economic development, require
               ­
               large quantities of water to be stored in order to generate electricity. While inte-
               grated management can ease trade-offs, the objective of maximizing hydro-
               power production sometimes entails lower water deliveries to farmers and
               disruptions to the flow of water to downstream ecosystems.50 Carbon ­      capture,
               utilization, and storage, meanwhile, is regarded as one of the most cost-effective
               mitigation strategies, but requires large quantities of water in the process of
               sequestering carbon.51
                  These inter-relationships create distinct trade-offs between the use of water
               and energy. In water-stressed regions, water withdrawals for energy competes
               with agricultural water uses, and may reduce the amount of water available to
               support ecosystem function.52 Conversely, limited water availability may
               ­
               constrain the operation or expansion of thermal plants.
                  When surface flows become unavailable or insufficient, farmers are often
               compelled to increase their dependence on groundwater for irrigation, which

generates associated increases in energy use. Groundwater pumping requires
about one-third more energy than conventional surface irrigation and relies
on dirty sources of power like diesel-fueled pumps or coal-­         generated
­electricity.53
                Alternative technologies  such  as  solar-powered  pumps    can
reduce the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with ground-
water pumping, but do nothing to ease the growing pressures on aquifers
worldwide. These trade-offs between energy and water production are usually
hidden, and rarely do they figure into cost-benefit assessments. However,
integrated planning and management of infrastructure and investment proj-
ects can identify synergies that reduce trade-offs between the uses of water for
energy and other requirements.
    Desalination and water recycling have emerged as important strategies
for augmenting water supplies especially in cities in areas of low rainfall.
But with current technologies these are not economically feasible options
for lower value added uses. While there are significant variations, desali-
nation typically requires up to 23 times as much energy as water with-
drawn from surface sources such as lakes and streams and this translates
into higher costs.54 On average desalinized water costs about 4 to 5 times
more than treated surface water (figure 3.2). As an example the total annu-
alized cost of desalinated brackish water in Phoenix, AZ, is estimated at

                                                     water as is left over from agricultural and other human uses and much of this
                                                     is polluted. As the world grows thirstier and the global water footprint
                                                     increases, it is often the planet’s ecosystems which are the first to lose out.
                                                     Estimates suggest that 20 to 50 percent of the total available water in each

                                                     water needs to increase.57 In large basins, such as the Yellow, Colorado, and
                                                     Murray-Darling River Basins, humans already utilize virtually all available
                                                     water for irrigation and urban use, leaving little available to maintain environ-

problem is that of measuring and determining environmental water
requirements. Each waterway has a distinctive flow regime with a similarly
unique set of floodplain, riparian, and instream ecosystems that often vary
considerably along the length of a waterway.59 Defining environmental
water requirements is a complex and arduous process that includes model-
ing, experimental data collection, and habitat surveys along the length of
the waterway.60 Even more challenging, streamflow regimes and habitat
types for many waterways are changing and are expected to change further
as a result of temperature increases and river inflows changes (amounts and
variability) as a result of climate change.61 Box 3.3 summarizes the Australian
experience which is often held as an exemplar of environmental steward-
ship. Decisions are further complicated by the need to vary environmental
flows seasonally. The most important functions of environmental flows,
such as maintaining water quality, triggering fish spawning, sediment
transport, groundwater recharge, and wetland inundation, require periodic
high flows.62
   Balancing ecosystem needs with economic pressures remains amongst
the  most challenging tasks for water management decisions, particularly
when it comes to determining what water infrastructure will be built, how it
will be operated, and how much water can be abstracted for consumptive
purposes. Some promising approaches do exist to alleviate these trade-offs.63
Carefully-timed releases of water from storage dams and reservoirs, known
as “pulses,” can help maintain downstream ecosystems while providing suf-
ficient water to meet irrigation and hydropower production requirements.64
In other cases, infrastructure (for example, gates/regulators or pumps) are
used to deliver water to floodplains at river flows below bankfull. These
strategies illustrate that smart water resource management can partly miti-
gate the environmental impacts.
   Almost 40 percent of the world’s people reside in 275 transboundary
river  basins that span almost half of the Earth’s land surface (map 3.1).65
Accounting for 60 percent of the world’s freshwater flows, transboundary riv-
ers are ­ubiquitous. As a result the management of environmental flows is
often ­further complicated by the need for international agreements to main-
tain environmental flows.



Policy Implications of the Nexus Approach
The primary message of the water-climate nexus is that trade-offs between
water requirements for food and energy production, the environment, and
urbanization under climate change are significant, and will require careful
assessment by policymakers. However, the impact of these trade-offs can be
ameliorated by taking several important steps.
   The solutions in each sector largely fall into three categories: First there is
a  need to recognize the trade-offs across sectors to allocate water more
wisely  across sectors, Second to bring the burgeoning water deficits under
control, incentives are required that reward prudent use and stewardship.

                            —The Australian Experience
Box 3.3  Environmental Flows­
Attention has been given to environmental water requirements in Australia for over thirty
years and the legal and institutional architecture has continued to evolve and strengthen.
Environmental flows were a key element of the national water reform process formalized in the
mid-1990s as part of broader micro-economic reforms across the country.66 These recognized
the environment as a legitimate user of water and required environmental water requirements
to be determined “on the best scientific information available” and with “regard to the inter-
temporal and inter-spatial water needs required to maintain the health and viability of river
systems and groundwater basins.” In 2004 these principles were reinforced through a National
Water Initiative67 that provided a national blueprint for water reform that was endorsed by all
state governments. It called upon state governments to return of all rivers to sustainable levels
of diversion, agreed actions for managing, measuring, planning, pricing, and trading water.
The environment aspects of the reform were informed by a national assessment of the state of
the rivers.68

Despite the far-sighted nature of the reforms, they failed to deal with the significant over-­allocation
of water in the Murray-Darling Basin—the heartland of irrigated agriculture in the country span-
ning four states and the Australian Capital Territory. The seriousness of the situation was high-
lighted by the decade-long “millennial drought” when the basin’s extensive terminal lakes dried,
the connected estuary suffered an ecological collapse, and iconic trees that were over 200 years
old died due to a lack of water.

The Murray-Darling crisis catalyzed attention and willingness for new governance arrange-
ments and a new approach to environmental flow determination, given the scale, complexity
and economic and social significance of the problem. A new national authority for manag-
ing the basin replaced the prior cooperative arrangement. The authority has the responsibility
to prepare a basin plan to ensure the return of all rivers and aquifers to sustainable levels,
through the specification of “sustainable diversion limits”. This required a major analytical
effort over several years and extensive and difficult stakeholder consultations69. The science was
contested and various independent reviews were used to assure quality and build stakeholder
confidence70. Ultimately trade-offs were made to balance environmental outcomes with social
and economic outcomes and the final aggregate sustainable diversion limits was set at about a
25 percent reduction in the average levels of water diversion. To make this feasible it was nec-
essary to compensate losers and US$10 billion was made available. Around two-thirds of the
money was used to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers on the water market, and
one third was invested in water efficiency improvements in both public and private (on-farm)
water distribution systems. The analytical approach used to guide this reform has now been
recognized as new environmental flow method application to large scale regulated river basins,
with diverse aquatic environments.71

Third, technological remedies have an important role to play. New approaches
and technologies (such as Climate Smart Agriculture), and infrastructure can
ease supply constraints, protect assets and people as well as facilitate better
demand management.

Food
Approaches that maximize benefits which cut across multiple dimensions of
the water-climate nexus are needed to address water deficits. A smarter allo-
cation of water across sectors will go a long way towards ensuring ­ sustainable
economic growth. Perhaps the most challenging but effective approach to
enhancing efficiency and promoting more efficient water use is  to provide
incentives for more prudent use of water. The laws of demand and supply
dictate that when water is provided more cheaply, it is used more wastefully.
In many countries, pervasive and perverse subsidies promote the cultivation
of water-intensive crops like rice and sugarcane72 in arid areas. The increasing
competition for water calls for policy i­nstruments to signal scarcity and pro-
mote more prudent and sustainable water uses.
   Water pricing is one, albeit often unpopular, mechanism for promoting
more efficient water use. Water rights and water permits that give users the
right to “rent” water is another instrument that recognizes the economic value
of water and can provide incentives and signals to eliminate waste. The use of
a water permit system in Australia has been credited with creating a system
that endured a decade-long “millennium drought,” for example. A policy of
permits or prices coupled with safeguards to prevent regressive effects on the
poor, and to provide for environmental water use would create the much

needed incentive to promote more efficient73, equitable, and sustainable pro-
duction techniques.
   Second, governments can help to close the large gap in agricultural produc-
tivity in some parts of the world where yields are often no greater than they
were almost half a century ago; and in realizing the unexploited potential for
better water management through improved allocation and better incentives
for reducing wastage, over-use, and pollution. A related and critically impor-
tant approach is Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA). CSA is an integrated
approach combining policies, financing, and technologies designed to help
food systems achieve a “triple win”—increasing productivity, enhancing resil-
ience, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.74 CSA techniques range from
planting crops suited to higher temperatures and longer droughts, to adopt-
ing practices such as alternate wetting and drying that minimize energy and
water use while improving crop yields.75
   CSA practices are aimed at simultaneously improving agricultural pro-
ductivity while reducing vulnerability to increasing water scarcity. In the
African Sahel region, where droughts are expected to intensify as a result of
climate change, afforestation of degraded farmland improved crop yields by
15 to 30 percent while reducing the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to
water scarcity.76 CSA can be further enhanced through investments in new
technologies such as heat-resistant crops, and can simultaneously reduce
energy and water use while maintaining or increasing yields.77 CSA is an
example of the growing popularity of sustainable intensification strategies
that seek to increase food production from existing farmland while mini-
mizing pressure on the environment. It emphasizes that any efforts to
intensify food production must be matched by a concerted focus on mak-
ing it sustainable since failing to do so could undermine the capacity for
future growth.
   A challenge with these and other approaches that rely on training and
information strategies is that adoption tends to be slow and erratic in the
absence of incentives that induce changes in behavior. This is an old
and familiar problem in development economics and is especially true of
CSA-type technologies. Adoption of new methods are often slow when
part of the benefits of the new approach are largely public while the costs
(of adoption) are private. Policies are needed that can incentivize the
­
adoption of new technologies, and create the impetus for adoption. The
required approach would vary with circumstances. It may entail public
investments, access to credit, insurance to address risk aversion, or pay-
ments for ecosystem services (PES) in the agricultural sector, or changes in
input tariffs.78

Cities
Innovative approaches are needed to water-proof growing urban areas from
both flood and drought risks. Projected changes in water availability during
the lifetime of major infrastructure projects can no longer be based on histor-
ical trends.79 To improve the robustness of system design, cities need a clear

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                       35
grasp of the available surface-water resources at basin level, the characteristics
of local aquifers, and the associated climate-related risks. They can manage
uncertainty and variability by diversifying water sources (if needed, with
transfers from adjacent basins) and improving water utilities’ preparedness.
This would entail a variety of approaches such as increased water-storage
capacity, insurance pricing, reducing water losses, reusing stormwater and
greywater, and heightening awareness.80 Adaptation to flood risks can reduce
both the scale of events and their impacts on the city. The former can be
achieved through improved land planning within the city and at basin level,
balancing densification and impervious areas.
   To mitigate the impacts of flooding, early warning systems can comple-
ment structural measures, such as drainage systems and dikes, and more
restrictive enforcement of land use in flood-prone areas. Those structural
measures need to take into better account a range of climate uncertainty in
their design. Sustainable solid-waste management is essential to prevent
clogging of drainage systems and catastrophic consequences from otherwise-­
benign rain events. When impacts are inevitable, insurance or safety nets
should be considered, such as the Pakistan Citizen Damage Compensation
Program.
   Such approaches, referred to as integrated urban water management,
function best when collaboration is strong among the state, local, and
municipal governments in the metropolitan region, given their different
purviews over the necessary interventions. Its application can also be
facilitated in institutional settings by integrating the administration of key
­
urban services (water supply, sewerage, drainage, wastewater treatment,
solid-waste management, and slum upgrading) and water-resource and
land-use planning (ecological zoning, protected areas, and public spaces).81
Integrated water resource management (IWRM) approaches can also
help  to ensure that urban and agricultural water allocations provide for
environmental flows.


Energy
Integrated planning is needed to assess the water supply implications of vari-
ous forms of energy production. Trade-offs between water uses for low-­
carbon energy sources like hydropower can be partly mitigated by integrated
management strategies to maintain minimum environmental flows and stor-
age levels for irrigation. However, some renewable energy technologies, like
concentrated solar power, consume significant quantities of water and
­
intensify trade-offs. The rising water requirements of energy may also render
what many perceive as a future panacea for water scarcity, desalination,
counter-­
­         productive: current desalination technologies produce a substantial
environmental impact, both in terms of brine production and greenhouse gas
emissions, and are also significantly more expensive than traditional water
provision. Given current technologies and costs, desalination is unlikely to be
an economically feasible option for the large and expanding water demands
of irrigated agriculture.

Environment
Unless environmental flows are protected critical ecosystem services may be
irreparably degraded. Despite their importance, they remain the last claimant
in the competition for water. Stewardship of natural assets calls for concerted
efforts to assess and protect environmental water requirements in major water
basins. As the Australian experience demonstrates, this task is both
resource-intensive and politically challenging. Political will and recognition
of the challenges is required to balance the needs of both current and future
generations whose natural assets and resources are threatened by declining
environmental flows.
   The trade-offs between different water uses require difficult and conten-
tious decisions, and most if not all countries will face considerable political
obstacles to adopting these measures. But while adopting these reforms will
be difficult, the costs of inaction are far higher. The future will be thirsty, but
with the right reforms, governments can help ensure that people and ecosys-
tems are not left high and dry in a more water-constrained world.

Conclusions and Policy
Implications: Mitigating
Water Shocks and
Addressing Trends under
a Changing Climate
The coming decades will see significant challenges in the water sector from
both water-related climate shocks as well as trends. Changing trends in water
availability, as well as an increase in extreme climate events, will coincide with
a backdrop of an ever increasing thirst for water for productive, health, and
environmental purposes. How the world responds to these water challenges
will be pivotal in determining the planet’s future growth path, and whether or
not the world achieves the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although
water only explicitly comprises one of the seventeen SDGs, the expanded
water nexus framework demonstrates how all sectors of society are inter-
linked through the common currency of water, and how achieving nearly
every one of the SDGs is dependent on solving the water problem.



Responses to the Water-Climate Challenge
Nearly a quarter of humanity already reside in water-scarce countries. If cur-
rent water management policies persist, and climate models prove correct,
water scarcity will proliferate to regions where it currently does not exist, and
greatly worsen in regions where it does. These hydrological changes will have
significant impacts on agricultural productivity as well as on cities where peo-
ple and economic activity are concentrated. As water scarcity increases, ever
more energy is needed for its extraction, treatment, and transport; while some
sources of clean energy are often more water-intensive than dirtier alterna-
tives. The primary message of the water-climate nexus is that trade-offs
between water requirements for food and energy production, the environ-
ment, and urbanization under climate change are significant, and will require
careful assessment by policymakers. However, the impact of these trade-offs
can be ameliorated by taking several important steps.
   Meeting these challenges will, in many regions, require unprecedented
actions, significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and knowledge,
and a radical rethinking of policies and institutions. There is no one-size-fits-
all solution, and regional plans will require a flexible geometry which can
adapt to the topology of the hazard, and local realities and characteristics.
   In general, solutions can be categorized into three buckets: those aimed
at  increasing the supply of water; those designed to decrease the demand

40	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
of water; and those which aim to reduce risks from water extremes by “climate
proofing” valuable investments from natural hazards. There is no one-size-
fits-all solution, however, and in practice, hybrid solutions will be needed,
determined by country and regional risks and circumstances.


Increasing the Supply Of Water
Historically, the solution to increasing water scarcity was to increase the sup-
ply. The Ancient Romans, for instance, used enormous networks of aqueducts
to move water hundreds of miles from areas of abundance, usually high up in
the mountains, to their cities. The Ismailia Canal, built along the Suez Canal,
was constructed in 1863 to bring freshwater from Lake Timsah to the city of
Suez. Today, however, solutions like these are rare. Even though we only uti-
lize a small fraction of the available freshwater on the planet, areas of abun-
dance tend to be very far from, or inaccessible to, regions of scarcity.
   Nevertheless, advancing technologies do offer opportunities for water sup-
ply expansion, and water resource recovery, in some regions. One such oppor-
tunity, particularly for large cities, is wastewater recycling. Wastewater
recycling plants typically have two major drawbacks: they tend to be extremely
energy intensive—in the U.S. they consume 2 percent of total electricity1—
and they also generate a byproduct, known as sludge, which is difficult to dis-
pose of in an environmentally safe way. Recent technologies, however, show
promise for greatly alleviating these problems, making wastewater recycling a
much more viable prospect for addressing water scarcity in cities. It has been
shown that wastewater recycling can be accomplished at net-zero energy use.
Biogas, a byproduct of the water treatment process, can be captured and used
to offset the energy consumption of the treatment facility, resulting in net zero
energy consumption.2 At the same time, new uses for the sludge byproducts
are being developed, including the processing into fertilizer, cement, or fuel.3
These advances offer exciting opportunities not just for closing the water cycle,
but also for mitigating carbon, reducing energy costs, and reducing environ-
mental contaminants. Greater research is needed to determine the commer-
cial viability and opportunities to scale up these new technologies.
   Another means of increasing the water supply is desalination. Desalination
has the potential to create a virtually limitless source of drought-proof, clean
water in coastal areas. As detailed in Chapter 3, desalination is currently not
economically viable, in many instances, for lower value uses. However, the
cost of desalination, both in financial terms and in energy requirements, has
fallen dramatically in the past decade, and as renewable energy technology
advances, these costs may continue to fall. Desalination has the potential to
offer back-stop protection against rainfall variability, while ensuring contam-
ination-free water. Indeed, desalination may have the potential to revolution-
ize the water sector, but first there is a need to address the economic and
ecological impacts of brine, the byproduct of desalination, and the impact of
water intake on fisheries and aquatic biomes.
   Finally, by far the most widely used method for increasing water supply is
water storage, through the use of dams. Dams allow for the capture of runoff

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                         41
during periods of excess, which can be stored for release during periods of
deficiency. They also have the added potential benefit of generating power,
and flood protection. Globally, the stage is set for a tremendous and unprece-
dented increase in the number of dams, with numbers expected to swell
by  16  percent by 2030, and storage volume expected to increase by about
40 percent.4
  Supply side interventions, while essential, will not on their own resolve
water management problems. History has consistently shown that when the
amount of water supplied is increased and provided cheaply, this simply
induces new demand. The laws of demand and supply dictate that when a
productive, useful resource is provided for free (or almost free), it will inevi-
tably be consumed in its entirety. As an example, new storage and irrigation
infrastructure in arid areas, though essential, has spurred the cultivation of
water intensive crops such as rice and sugarcane. The end result is an increased
level of water dependence in arid areas that does little to ameliorate underly-
ing scarcities or build upon natural comparative advantages. Investments in
increasing water supplies must therefore be coupled with policies which pro-
mote efficiency and better allocate water resources.


Optimizing the Use for Water through Better Planning
and Incentives
Growing populations and rising incomes are creating ever-increasing
demands for water. In many parts of the world this growth in demand for
water has been unchecked, with policies that have stimulated the over-use of
water. This trajectory is unsustainable, however, and the supply of water is
already approaching its ecological boundary in some regions. Ensuring water
security in the future will therefore require more prudent demand side
management.
   Accomplishing this will require a significant shift in the way water is viewed.
It will call for recognition that water is a scarce resource with significant pro-
ductive value. This can be achieved through administrative decree or through
economic instruments the deliver water to where it is most productive.
   Allocations through water permits is one such instrument that gives users
the right to “sell” or “rent” the water that is available to them. The result would
be a win-win for both buyers and sellers as a transfer will occur only if the
buyer and seller both anticipate a benefit from the transaction. The challenge
with establishing such systems is the complex legal and institutional architec-
ture that must accompany a credible system of water trading. Understanding
how much water can be sustainably withdrawn in a certain region is a chal-
lenging task. This difficulty is multiplied many-fold in regions where climate
change will vastly increase rainfall variability.5 Determining the initial alloca-
tion of permits can also be a contentious process, particularly in countries
with weak institutions where allocation may be (or have the perception of
being) politically determined. Reforming water allocation in the agricultural
sector faces even greater capacity issues.6 Efforts to introduce water markets
even in countries like Chile and Australia, where institutional capacity is

42	                        High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
               generally high, have encountered substantial difficulties as a result of the need
               to establish total water availability, environmental water requirements, and
               provide clear legal entitlements to water use.7
                  Pricing is another instrument that could be used to guide the allocation of
               water for commercial uses. For municipal use, water pricing tends to be the
               simplest and most effective tool for moderating water use. Households are
               connected to a utility which can keep track of water use via a meter. High
               water prices tend to be effective at reducing municipal demand, and targeted
               subsidies or block tariffs can be strategically employed to ensure that the most
               vulnerable retain access to water and are not priced out of the market (see
               box 4.1). They could also provide the incentives for utilities to prevent wast-
               age. When utilities are required to recover costs, they have a greater incentive
               to prevent revenue losses by fixing leaks in the system.8 In fact, a staggering 32
               billion cubic meters of treated water is lost to urban supply systems around
               the world each year through physical leaks in the pipes. Half of these losses
               occur in developing countries where customers already frequently suffer from
               interrupted supplies and poor water quality.9
                  Nevertheless, municipal water use is only a small fraction of total water use.
               Significantly more water is used for commercial purposes, particularly irri-
               gated agriculture, where pricing is more complex. Water use for these pur-
               poses tends to be more inelastic than municipal water, making pricing less
               effective in reducing demand.10 Further, agricultural water use is much more
               difficult to track than municipal water, particularly when farmers can drill into
               an aquifer and access groundwater, thus circumventing the higher prices.11
                  Attempts at water tariff reform face tremendous political, distributional,
               and institutional challenges. In many countries, providing free or low-cost
               access to water is seen as a basic responsibility of government, especially
               toward under-served rural and urban constituencies.12 As a result, water price
               reform also requires extensive safeguards to avoid regressive effects on the
               poor. Under these circumstances, tradeable water permits can be a useful way




Box 4.1  The Promise of Urban Water Price Reform
The experience of several countries and urban regions show that price reform can be a powerful
driver of water use efficiency and conservation. Denmark instituted full cost recovery for urban
water consumers in 1992, so that water prices were increased to reflect the full cost of providing
water to end users. As a result, the real price of water increased by 54 percent from 1993–2004,
reducing water demand from 155 liters per person per day to 125, one of the lowest levels in the
developed world. The success of Denmark’s price reform relies heavily on institutional capacity;
the regressive effects of large water price increases for disadvantaged urban residents are buff-
ered through the country’s extensive social welfare system.13 This example helps to illustrate the
efficacy of demand-side responses to increasing water pressures under climate change. However,
they also illustrate that substantial institutional capacity is required to implement demand-side
measures in a way that protects the poor and promotes overall economic development.


               High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                                 43
of ensuring that water use remains below a certain threshold, and for reward-
ing those farmers who limit their water use.
   Water price reforms such as these can also go a long way towards incen-
tivizing the creation and adoption of water saving technologies. Climate-
smart agriculture (CSA) has the potential to revolutionize the way food
is  produced. However, adoption tends to be slow largely because of mis-
aligned  incentives; the costs of CSA are borne by the farmer, but many of
the benefits—including a reduced water footprint—are primarily public.
   Finally, there are also opportunities to alter behavior and change thirsty
consumption patterns through education, contextual cues, and using social
norms to signal consent or disapproval. How people act and think often
depends on what others around them do and think. The tools based on these
behavioral nudges do not displace existing policy approaches that target
incentives; rather, they complement and enhance them. There is limited use
of these approaches in the sector and many of the emerging policy implica-
tions require further study.


Reducing the Impact of Extremes, Variability,
and Uncertainty
Finally, the last challenge for ensuring a water secure world is reacting to and
reducing the impact of extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and
storm surges, and increased rainfall variability that is expected due to climate
change. Opportunities for meeting these challenges often overlap with poli-
cies and investments which address water supply and demand. Indeed, reduc-
ing the amount of freshwater demanded relative to supply, and increasing the
amount of water stored, will go a long way towards increasing resilience
against highly variable rainfall, and the droughts and floods that the variabil-
ity creates.
   Mitigating the damage caused by extreme events will require large invest-
ments in technology and infrastructure. For coastal cities, such investments
include seawalls and levees, and for cities along rivers, dams can also be effec-
tive tools for regulating river flows and preventing floods. These capital inten-
sive investments come with significant risks, however. Once built, the
investments are irreversible, and much uncertainty surrounds where they
should be optimally placed and how large they should be. These investments
must therefore be carefully researched and designed before commitments are
made. Where uncertainty is high, modular options that allow for additions
and reversals would be more suitable.
   Other important investments include upgrading hydro-meteorological and
early-warning systems. Increasing the lead-time of a storm can have tremen-
dous benefits by allowing households to evacuate an area and move their
belongings to higher ground. Better medium-term and seasonal forecasts can
also help farmers make cropping and irrigating decisions, which can counter-
act some of the added uncertainty climate change will bring.14 Nevertheless,
forecasts are only useful if users have the ability to understand and incorpo-
rate them in decision-making. In some cases this will require building the

44	                       High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy
institutions which have the capacity to transform a forecast into an actionable
warning, and can communicate it to the local populations. In other cases,
local communities must work with the relevant weather authorities to help
them better understand what information is relevant and useful for local
decision-making.
   Another important, yet under-utilized tool in developing countries for
responding to growing rainfall variability is crop insurance. Increasing farm-
ers’ access to crop insurance will not only protect households against falling
into poverty or becoming food insecure when climate impacts destroy har-
vests. It will also incentivize farmers to invest in higher value crops and mod-
ern technologies by eliminating the catastrophic risk of losing a large
investment if the harvest fails. In 2007, agricultural crop insurance premiums
were less 0.3 percent of agricultural GDP in developing countries, signifi-
cantly less than the 2.3 percent of agricultural GDP found in developed coun-
tries.15 This gap suggests that developing countries are severely underserved,
especially when accounting for the fact that rain-fed agriculture, a much risk-
ier venture than irrigated agriculture, is much more common in developing
countries.
   Adaptation goals can often be achieved through better management of eco-
systems and investments in natural capital, and at a fraction of the cost of
physical and engineering solutions. Natural infrastructure (for example, for-
ests, mangroves, flood plains, and rivers) not only serves as a source of protec-
tion and resilience, but is also required for sustainability—to assure future
supplies of water. As the residual claimant, ecosystems receive the water that
is left over from other uses, and water that is often polluted. This in turn dis-
rupts river health, the ability to flush pollutants, and a host of other ecosystem
services. As the world grows more crowded and thirstier, these problems and
threats to ecosystems will escalate and investments in their protection will
become more urgent.


But Will this Be Enough?
The solutions suggested here can go a long way towards preparing much of
the world for a future of changing water trends, increased water variability,
and increased scarcity. While there is indeed significant room for progress
throughout much of the developing world, the question must be asked
whether these prescriptions will be enough in some of the driest parts of
the world.
   Much of the Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel, and Central Asia, already
extremely arid regions, are expected to become even drier in the coming
decades. And some of these regions may see a decline in GDP due to a signifi-
cant water deficit, even under positive water-policy regimes. Investments in
new technologies for expanding water supplies and using water more effi-
ciently will be vital, but may not be sufficient. These regions will need to take
more robust measures to address water scarcity. The efforts would need to
include policies that reduce the dependence on shriveling and more uncer-
tain water supplies and de-couple water use from economic growth. Policies

High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy	                          45
that anticipate the consequences of observed climate trends will be better pre-
pared to respond to the complex challenges.
   To a large extent, each country must also make its own decisions regarding
the value of allocating water to different uses. Reacting to a changing environ-
ment and increased demographic pressures on water will be challenging but
necessary for development. It will require large investments in infrastructure
and technology, new policies to bring the cost of water in-line with its value,
and better institutions, capable of managing this process in a fair and efficient
manner. The costs of inaction will surely be greater than the challenges of
more prudent water stewardship, particularly in the poorest and most water
stressed regions of the world. Eliminating poverty, increasing prosperity, and
meeting the Sustainable Development Goals will hinge on whether or not we
solve this water problem.
   This report highlights the relationship between climate change and the
global water challenge, and offers several recommendations for how policy-
makers might adapt to a world shaped by water-related shocks and trends,
and balance competing water use priorities. But in order to meet these chal-
lenges, all stakeholders in the global water sector, including governments, the
private sector, and civil society, must join together to emphasize that every
individual water user has a part to play. We all must become advocates for a
more sustainable water future, and raise awareness to ensure all stakeholders
understand their part in the global water challenge, and are empowered to
play a role in addressing it.
