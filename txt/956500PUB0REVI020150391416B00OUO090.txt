Recent Economic Developments and Prospects

The Global Outlook
The global economy will grow by between 3 and 3.5 percent this year, about half a percentage point
higher than last year’s 2.6 percent, and surpassing the average growth rate of 3.1 percent during 2000-
08, prior to the financial crisis (Figure 1.1). Major forces behind the recent recovery are better-than-
expected growth in the United States, United Kingdom, and some countries in the Euro area, and--most
important—the sharp fall in international oil prices. Low oil prices have contributed in net terms to the
global recovery, but the impact varies widely across countries, particularly between oil exporters and
importers. Lower oil prices have increased oil importers’ real GDP growth, improved trade balances and—
to the extent that they subsidize fuel—eased their fiscal pressures. The magnitude of the gains, however,
will depend on, among other factors, the share of oil imports in GDP. Oil exporters (including Russia) could
see a sharp fall in their growth rates; their fiscal balances will deteriorate, with significant regional
consequences (Mottaghi, 2015).

Next year, World GDP is estimated to grow by between 3.3 and 3.7 percent (Figure 1.1). Most
international forecasters expect a continued recovery in the U.S., with a slower one in the Euro area in
2016. High-income countries of the G7 are likely to see growth of 2.3 percent in 2015 and 2016 and the
Euro area by 1.2 and 1.6 percent in the same years. Growth in developing economies is expected to
increase to 4.8 and 5.3 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively. But risks continue to be on the downside.

In the meantime, after falling by more than 60 percent since their peak in June 2014, oil prices (Brent
crude) have been fluctuating at around $50 per barrel in late March.1 Oil prices are extremely volatile and
notoriously difficult to predict, but the futures market points to a Brent crude price of about $61 for
delivery in December 2015, increasing to $67 for December 2016. The pace of growth in oil prices is so
slow that they are unlikely to revert to $100 or above any time soon. Thanks to the weak economic
recovery in the Euro area and moderate growth in China and India, demand is not growing fast enough to
absorb the continued excess supply.

The Middle East and North Africa Regional Outlook
Whereas the global economy is set for a gradual pick up, economic prospects in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) remain flat. Growth in MENA is expected to slow down in 2015 and range between 3.1 and
3.3 percent according to the World Bank and consensus forecasts respectively, and continue on the same
path in 2016 (Figure 1.2). If the security situation in Libya improves and oil exports increase, the regional
average could surge to 4 to 5 percent in 2016. The main reasons for the continued, sluggish growth are:
prolonged conflict and political instability in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen; low oil prices that are dragging
down growth in oil exporters; and the slow pace of reforms that is standing in the way of a resumption of
investment. The continuation of this situation will significantly hurt the overall unemployment rate, now
standing at 12 percent, and poverty in the region. Fiscal deficits are mounting, leaving the region with a
deficit of 8 percent of GDP in 2015, after 4 years of surpluses. At this point, the overall economic outlook
for MENA remains tepid, though longer term forecasts, if the regional conflicts subside and necessary
reforms are implemented, could be more optimistic.

The group of oil exporters are estimated to grow by around 2.8 percent in 2015 with growth stagnating in
developing oil exporters at less than 1 percent. Growth for the group of high-income Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) oil exporters is estimated to range between 3.2 to 3.8 percent in 2015, predicted by the
consensus forecasts and the World Bank respectively, about half a percentage point lower than last year
(Figure 1.3 and Annex table). The World Bank estimates that growth in developing oil exporters in MENA,
pinched by cheap oil, is expected to drop to 0.9 percent compared to 6.3 percent prior to the oil collapse
(Figure 1.3, left panel). The impact on fiscal savings from the oil price collapse has outweighed the uptick
in consumption due to a spending increase.

Growth in developing MENA countries as a whole will stay at 2 percent in 2015. While still low, this figure
is about half a percentage point higher than the previous year, owing to better-than-expected growth in
oil importers--estimated at 3.9 and 4.1 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively, about one and a half
percentage points higher than the previous year. Furthermore, fiscal deficits are expected to improve in
the group of oil importers in 2015, partly due to the fiscal savings resulting from low oil prices (Figure 1.3,
right panel).

Economic growth in all MENA oil exporters is plummeting.2 After surpassing 8 percent in 2011, growth in
Saudi Arabia is set to decline to 4.6 percent in 2015 (Table 1.1). The World Bank has estimated that Gulf
countries could lose about $215 billion in oil revenues, equivalent to 14 percent of their combined GDP,
in 2015. While Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar have managed to withstand the worst effects of low
oil prices through their large reserves, Bahrain, and Oman have less of a cushion. Even those countries
with large buffers are starting to feel the pressure on their fiscal balances. The large fiscal surplus in Saudi-

  Growth in Kuwait is expected to rise slightly in 2015 due to moderate increase in oil production and acceleration in growth of
the non-oil sector.


                                                                             MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR                     APRIL 2015             3
Arabia is disappearing, leaving the country with double-digit fiscal deficits in 2015 and the following year,
for the first time in a decade. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continue their expansionary fiscal policies, financed
partially by their large foreign assets. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, believed to be worth $800
billion, could cushion the impacts of low oil prices on its economy. But these remedies cannot last forever
since fiscal deficits are rising. In December 2014 alone, alongside oil prices, Gulf stock markets plunged,
losing $16 billion in three weeks.

If oil prices remain low for a sustained period of time and the fiscal situation in the Gulf States deteriorates,
it may slow growth in remittances outflows from GCC countries to the rest of the region, mainly Egypt,
Yemen and Jordan (where they are a major source of income). Estimates by the World Bank show that
while remittances are expected to increase, there may be a deceleration in growth rates. Aid flows from
GCC to the rest of MENA may also decline as a result of low oil prices.

Among developing oil exporters, Iran’s economic prospects are contingent on the timing of lifting of
sanctions following a nuclear agreement framework that was reached in early April, as well as on
fluctuations in oil prices. Under this agreement, which is expected to lead to a final deal by end of June, a
comprehensive lifting of sanctions is envisaged. This could significantly boost economic activity and
accelerate growth to an estimated 5 percent in 2016 3, while improving Iranians’ living conditions. Growth
is estimated to continue on the same path for the following year. In this case, however, the Iranian
economy will face a massive oil windfall, which if not managed carefully, could lead to an oil boom, an
overvalued real exchange rate and a loss of competitiveness of the non-oil tradable sector, a major source
of foreign revenues. It could also lead to an increase in unemployment in tradables, as the oil sector does
not create many jobs. In the case of continued status quo, the Iranian economy is expected to slow down
to 0.6 percent growth in 2015 with attendant consequences for unemployment, fiscal deficits and
inflation. In this setting, the government has adopted a contractionary fiscal policy that is reflected in the
new budget. Capital spending is prioritized, the rich are to be excluded from the current cash transfer
system, and an increase in gas prices by 5 percent should keep the budget deficit at 3.4 percent for 2015
and 2016 respectively (Table 1.1).

Growth in Algeria is estimated to fall to half its rate in 2015, standing at 2.6 percent. The country is facing
a doubling of its fiscal deficit (subsidies alone account for 18 percent of GDP) as a share of GDP in 2015
and a widening current account deficit from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 18.6 percent in 2015.
Weakening economic activity has hit the unemployment rate, which is expected to increase from 9.8
percent in 2013 to 10.6 and 11 percent in 2015 and 2016 respectively.

For those countries already in conflict, Iraq -- Libya, Yemen, and Syria -- economic prospects are grim. The
ISIS insurgency and large military expenditures have hit the Iraqi economy hard. Growth is expected to
turn negative in 2015 following a contraction of 0.5 percent in 2014 due to the decline in economic activity
in the areas occupied by ISIS. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is estimated to double and reach
10.6 percent due to high military expenses and the recent government decision to keep fuel subsidies

  The P5+1 and Iran issued a joint statement on general points of agreement on April 2nd. All parties will continue negotiations
aimed at achieving a comprehensive accord in June.

intact, together with low oil prices.4 Current spending is high with wages and subsidies, particularly for
the power sector, constituting almost 70 percent of government expenses. The public sector accounts for
more than 50 percent of Iraqi employment, leaving little room for investment spending. Public
investments are declining and most capital investments are disrupted because of the fiscal shock.

Libya is in recession. In addition to the impact of cheap oil, the violent conflict has interrupted oil exports,
a major source of government and external revenues. The economy is estimated to have contracted by
24 percent in 2014, following a contraction of about 14 percent in 2013. While there are signs that the
political conflict is easing and two oil ports have reopened, a rapid recovery in crude oil supply is unlikely
and growth will remain low in 2015. The budget deficit is estimated at more than 40 percent of GDP in
2014 and 2015. The major forces behind this alarming budget deficit are, in addition to lower revenues
due to low oil prices, the existing wage bill and subsidies estimated at 70 percent of expenditure; capital
spending has fallen to a fifth of it pre-revolutionary period. Libya is counting on its large foreign reserves,
which have declined dramatically. Estimates by the Central Bank of Libya show that foreign reserves stood
at $85.5 billion in December 2014, a 40 percent decline from July 2013.

In Yemen, the conflict among multiple forces vying to rule the country have weighed heavily on the
economy, bringing growth down to zero percent in 2014 from 4.8 percent the previous year. In addition
to the political instability, economic activity is hampered by sabotage of oil fields and weak infrastructure,
which have caused severe fuel shortages and power cuts. The economy is estimated to contract by 2.8
percent in 2015, with growing political and security risks. Oil exports are estimated to drop by 10 percent
in 2015 on top of an 11 percent drop in 2014, to an average of 140 thousand barrels per day. The budget
deficit rose to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2014 as subsidy reforms were reversed and the savings did not
materialize. The trend is expected to continue in 2015. And in Syria, the civil war has caused a sharp drop
in government revenues together with a hike in military spending, increasing the fiscal deficit significantly.
While data are scarce, some forecasters estimate that the rate of economic contraction will slow down.
The EIU, in particular, estimates a positive growth rate of about 2 percent in 2015, largely driven by major
businesses’ moving to more stable coastal areas of an expanded industrial zone. While exports have
begun to increase for the first time since 2011, investment remains stalled due to continued violence and
political instability.

Lower oil prices together with some policy reforms, notably in Egypt and Morocco, have helped the
economies of oil importers recover, albeit slowly. In fact, this group of countries are helping to maintain
MENA’s overall growth at 3 percent. In Egypt, low oil prices have helped contain domestic inflationary
pressures triggered by the subsidy reforms introduced in July 2014. Some estimates show that low oil
prices could reduce the fiscal deficit by about 2 percent of GDP in 2016. At the Economic Development
Conference in mid-March, Egypt raised about $36.5 billion, with the Gulf countries pledging a package
worth $12.5 billion. All of these could help boost growth in the coming years, albeit with some delays if
the pledges do not all materialize. Tourism and manufacturing posted double-digit growth in 2014. The

Suez Canal, construction, and building also observed strong performance in 2014, which should continue
in 2015. Growth is estimated to surpass 4 percent in 2016, approaching the growth rates observed in the
pre-revolutionary period.

Economic recovery in Tunisia has been slow partly due to weak external demand from the Euro area’s
anemic economic stance and slowing domestic demand. The World Bank estimates a moderate increase
in growth of about half a percentage point in 2015, to 2.6 percent and gradually reaching 3.4 percent the
following year. This is likely to happen on the back of a moderate rebound in the manufacturing and
tourism sectors (although the recent attack on the Bardo Museum has affected tourist arrivals5). Low oil
prices together with fiscal consolidation have helped reduce the fiscal deficit from 6.8 percent in 2013 to
4.2 percent in 2016. This will help contain inflation to about 4 percent.

Jordan’s and Lebanon’s economies are recovering slowly but steadily, despite being buffeted by civil wars
in neighboring countries. The Jordanian economy is expected to grow by more than 3 percent in 2015,
slightly higher than the growth observed since 2010. This uptick in growth is mostly due to an increase in
public investment following grants from the GCC, and a narrower trade deficit. In Lebanon, despite a
domestic political deadlock and spillovers from the ISIS conflict, lower oil prices have helped economic
activity pick up, although growth is estimated to remain at a low level of about 2.5 percent in 2015 and
2016. With a break in the political deadlock and some fiscal consolidation, a growth rebound, similar to
that observed in the 2000s, is possible.

The Palestinian Territories, West Bank and Gaza, are still feeling the brunt of the 2014 Gaza war and the
precarious political and security situation. After 7 years of continuous growth, the Palestinian economy
contracted by 0.8 percent in 2014 with a sharp contraction of 15 percent in the Gazan economy. The Gaza
war of July-August 2014, in addition to causing physical damage estimated at nearly $2.5 billion, has had
a severe impact on Gaza’s economy (Box 1.1). The West Bank economy, on the other hand, experienced
4.4 percent growth that was largely driven by investments in construction. As a whole, the Palestinian
economy is expected to grow by less than 1 percent in 2015. The pace of the reconstruction process in
Gaza has been much slower than expected due to inadequate donor funding and Israeli restrictions on
the import of construction materials into Gaza. Around 70,000 households continue to be internally
displaced, which has created an extremely fragile environment that could lead to more conflict.
Unemployment increased to 27 percent in 2014 -- 43 percent in Gaza and 17 percent in the West Bank.
Particularly alarming is youth unemployment in Gaza which soared by about 60 percent in 2014.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the poverty rate in Gaza increased from 28 percent in 2013 to 39
percent in 2014.

Box 1.1 The Long-run Effects of Israeli Blockades and Military Assaults on Gaza

In 2005, a year before the election of Hamas and the imposition of a total trade blockade on Gaza by Israel, the
GDP per capita in Gaza was the same as in the West Bank, $1304, a level higher than many other developing
countries and regions (Table B1). Over the next 7 years, particularly after 2007, GDP per capita in Gaza decreased
by 2.3 percent a year, whereas in the West Bank it increased annually by 8.1 percent, and in other regions growth
rates ranged between 2.2 and 10.8 percent, except in Yemen.

Since 2007, the people of Gaza have experienced a total trade blockade and three, destructive, military assaults,
in 2008-9, 2012 and 2014. The damage to the Gazan economy of each of these events has been considerable.
Using the West Bank (which was not subject to a blockade) as the counterfactual, and using various techniques
for reconciling and smoothing the data, it can be seen that the gap in per-capita income between the West Bank
and Gaza widened significantly after 2006. The gap widened even further after Operation Cast Lead, and
continued to widen through 2012 (Figure B1). The smoothed trends show that in 2006, the year before Hamas
took over Gaza, the estimated long-run GDP per capita in Gaza was 71.5 percent of that in the West Bank (Figure
B1(b)). After 2006, the gap widened further. The chart shows the annual loss to the Gazan economy in terms of
GDP per capita as a result of the Israeli blockade and the Israeli Operation Cast Lead late in 2008, as described by
the vertical distance between the actual ratio (the blue line) and the counterfactual ratio (the red line). The
estimated annual loss to Gazan GDP per capita from its potential level between 2006 and 2008 is 5 percent. After
the Israeli military assault in 2008, this gap has widened to 8.3 percent reaching 15.2 percent in 2012. Between
2007 and 2012 the total loss amounted to 51.6 percent of potential GDP per capita. The results indicate that, in
addition to the short-run damage they cause, temporary Israeli military assaults and blockades have persistent,
destructive effects on the Gazan economy.

Towards a New Social Contract in the Middle East and North Africa

A snapshot of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) today reveals a diverse and discouraging picture.
Syria, Iraq, Libya and now Yemen are mired in violent conflicts that are devastating people’s lives,
infrastructure and national economies, with spillovers to neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan
and Tunisia. The cost of the Syrian war and spread of the Islamic State alone have been estimated at $35
billion in terms of lost output between mid-2011 and mid-2014 (Ianchovichina and Ivanic, 2014). The
transition countries of Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan are slowly but steadily reforming their
economies, albeit in a context of anemic growth, high fiscal deficits and rising youth unemployment
(Figure 2.1).

Meanwhile, the resource-rich developing countries—Algeria, Iran and Iraq—have chronic problems of
unemployment and lack of diversification, the latter being captured by the high concentration of exports

well as those of the high-income GCC countries, all of which are dominated by the public-sector wage bill.

But a longer-term perspective—a movie rather than a snapshot—indicates a more homogeneous region
and a more hopeful future. Despite their current differences, MENA countries have since independence
been following more or less the same development model. The state would provide free health and
education for all. Food and fuels were subsidized, to the tune of 10 percent of GDP recently. The public
sector was the main formal-sector employer (Figure 2.3a). Perhaps in return for the state’s largesse,
citizen voice was limited. From internationally comparable data, all MENA countries were below the
regression line connecting “voice and accountability” with per capita income (Figure 2.3b). Some people
have described this development model as an “authoritarian bargain” (Yousef, 2004) or a social contract.

This common social contract delivered relatively successful results on both economic and social fronts. In
the 2000s, economic growth averaged 4-5 percent a year6. Poverty rates were low and declining. Almost
everyone completed primary school, and enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education—especially
for women—were high and rising (Figure 2.4a). MENA registered the fastest decline in infant mortality
rates in the world (Figure 2.4b). Contrary to perceptions, inequality—as measured by conventional
indicators such as the Gini coefficient—was lower than comparable countries elsewhere and either
constant or declining (Figure 2.4c).

    To be sure, per-capita income growth was slower, and productivity growth quite weak (Schiffbauer et al., 2015).

Yet, by the late 2000s, there were signs that this development model, which had achieved so much, was
beginning to fray. The combination of high subsidies and large public-sector wage bills was too much for
government budgets to bear. Fiscal deficits started growing. To avoid their growing even higher, public-
sector employment slowed down, and the public sector’s share in total employment started to decline.
But the formal private sector did not grow fast enough to absorb the large number of educated young
people entering the labor force. Unemployment rates rose to the highest levels in the developing world.
Informal employment grew, dominated largely by men. In part because of the insecurity associated with
the informal sector, women were discouraged from entering the labor force. MENA today has the lowest
female labor force participation in the world (Figure 2.5).

Meanwhile, although it continued to finance and provide health and education, the public system was
falling short on two fronts--quality and equity. Secondary-school students, including those from high-
income countries like Qatar and UAE, were scoring poorly in international standardized tests (Figure 2.6).
In response to the low quality, people resorted to the private sector, which undermined equity. In Egypt,
over 70 percent of the students used private tutoring (Dang and Rogers, 2008), leaving poor students,
who could not afford it, at an even bigger disadvantage. With doctor absentee rates of 20-30 percent in
public clinics in Egypt, Morocco and Yemen (Brixi et al., 2015), patients, desperate for care, resorted to
private clinics, often paying exorbitant rates. As a woman in Egypt put it, “You can go to the private clinic
and lose your money, or go to the public clinic and lose your life” (World Bank, 2013). Within countries,
the quality of service delivery varied enormously, with the poorer areas being the most disadvantaged
(Figure 2.7).

Perhaps the clearest signs that the social contract was not delivering were the “Arab Spring” revolutions
in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, which were followed by political protests in Bahrain, Morocco and
Jordan. People took to the streets to demand jobs, better public services, and dignity. Even in countries
that had not seen popular protests, such as Algeria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, similar concerns about
unemployment and the quality of education were being raised in multiple forums.

The aftermath of the Arab Spring has been so turbulent, and in some cases so violent, that the underlying
problems remain. Investment and hence growth rates have slowed. Unemployment rates, especially for
youth and females, have risen. And there is anecdotal evidence, such as the garbage not being picked up
in Tunis that public services have deteriorated.

In order to propose solutions to these problems, it is important to better understand why the original
social contract was reaching its limits. Why, when the public sector was cutting back, did the formal
private sector not create enough jobs? Why are public services— that delivered so well the first generation
of outcomes—failing with respect to quality and equity?

Private-sector Jobs
In MENA, as well as in high-growth economies, young firms and startups create the most jobs. Figure 2.9
below illustrates. Almost all net job creation in Lebanon and Tunisia was generated by young firms at their
start-up period; i.e., in the first four years after they were established. For example, in Tunisia, micro-
startups created 580,000 jobs between 1996 and 2010, accounting for 92 percent of all net job creation.
In Lebanon small startups generated about 66,000 jobs between 2005 and 2010, accounting for 177
percent of net job creation. The second largest number of jobs (12,000) was created by young, large firms
with 200–999 employees (Schiffbauer et al., 2015).

The problem in MENA is twofold. First, not enough young firms are created. Not enough firms “die”, to
make room for new firms to enter the market (Figure 2.10a). MENA has among the lowest rates of new
firms entering the market (Figure 2.10b). Overall, the median age of firms is the highest in the developing
world (Figure 2.10c).

Why are there so few young firms and why are they not growing? According to the enterprise surveys,
the top four reasons include macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty, political instability, and
corruption (Figure 2.11). Interestingly, a constraint that is frequently mentioned in the popular
literature—access to finance—does not rank in the top 10. The role of macroeconomic and political
instability are well-known. For instance, Burger et al. (2015) show that instability skews foreign
investment away from firms in manufacturing, which could create jobs and transfer technology, and
towards real estate and extractive industry investments.

As for regulatory uncertainty and corruption, there are many channels through which they impede firm
and therefore job growth. Recent evidence on politically connected firms in Tunisia (under Ben Ali) and
Egypt (under Mubarak) reveals that these firms received preferential treatment that included protection
from domestic and foreign competition (Rijkers et al., 2014). As a result, the sectors with connected firms
were not competitive, making it difficult for new firms to enter them. Sometimes, connected firms
received construction permits faster; and they were inspected by tax officials less frequently. The
dispersion of number of inspections is higher in sectors with connected firms, suggesting that
unconnected firms that compete with connected firms received more inspections.

Not only was it difficult for new firms to enter sectors with connected firms, but—as a result of their
monopoly power--the prices charged by these sectors, which in Tunisia included transport,
telecommunications and banking, were so high that they made the exporting firms that bought these
services uncompetitive. Since exporting is one way for firms to grow, this channel was effectively blocked
in Tunisia.

There is also evidence that energy subsidies, which continue to be prevalent in most MENA countries,
favored larger, older, capital-intensive firms (because these were also energy-intensive firms), again
making it difficult for firms to grow and create jobs. That these subsidies also benefited politically
connected firms may explain why they have been so difficult to remove.

Note that this combination of politically connected firms, monopolistic industries, and a large number of
small firms stagnating is an equilibrium, in the sense that the system has no intrinsic impetus to change.
Politicians and their business allies can continue to earn monopoly profits, while a large number of small
firms stay small, and the private sector does not create many jobs.

Yet, the implications of this low-level equilibrium are huge. Young people, who have finished school,
cannot find a job in the public sector or formal private sector. Those who can afford to, will wait for a
public-sector job to open up, because the combination of salary, benefits and security make it attractive.
This explains why so many of the unemployed are university graduates. The legacy of attractive public
sector wages also bids up the reservation wage in the private sector, often making it harder for the private
sector to be internationally competitive. A particular case is in the GCC countries, such as Kuwait, where
95 percent of Kuwaiti males are employed in the public sector, so that the private sector, in order to be
competitive, hires expatriate workers.

Those who cannot afford to wait for an opening in the public sector join the informal sector, working at
low wages with little security. The share of the labor force in the informal sector has grown substantially
in the past decade to 67 percent (Angel-Urdinola and Tanabe, 2012). The insecurity (in many senses of
the word) of the informal sector has deterred women from entering it. The result is that, without many
options in the formal private or public sectors, a large number of women drop out of the labor force
entirely. Inasmuch as most of these women are educated (and some highly educated), the tragedy is that
their education is not being put to use.

While it is clear that the old social contract, where the government was the main employer, is broken, it
is less clear whether government has been able to replace it with a new one, where government facilitates

                                                          MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR         APRIL 2015       19
a dynamic, private sector that creates jobs. To do so, governments will have to make major changes in
their policies and practices towards the private sector. Among these changes, the most important will be
to promote competition in domestic industries, so that young firms can grow and create productive jobs.

Quality Public Services
The second area where the social contract appears to have broken down is in delivering quality public
services. Why has the quality of public services become so poor? The previous, top-down system could
deliver on enrolment or prevention of childhood diseases because these were easy to measure and
monitor, and required uniform inputs, such as teaching basic reading and writing, and immunization.
Quality education and health care, especially if they are to respond to the global market, require more
tailor-made approaches. Students want to learn different things. They learn at different speeds. Once
childhood diseases have been eradicated, the population’s health problems are non-communicable
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, which affect individuals idiosyncratically.

Addressing these second-generation issues of quality education and non-communicable diseases requires
that the service provider—the teacher or the doctor—know about the student’s or patient’s individual
needs, and be able and willing to respond to them. In short, they require that the service provider be
accountable to the client (World Bank, 2003).

There is plenty of evidence that in MENA the accountability between service providers and citizens is not
working, especially for poor people. Teacher absenteeism is as high as in low-income countries; doctor
absenteeism is lowest in the capital city and highest in remote areas. Students get private tutoring
because the public-school teacher is not teaching them what they want to learn (and poor students, who
cannot afford to get the tutoring, lose out). The high share of doctors in private, or “dual”, practice is
another example of the standard, publicly provided health system failing to deliver, especially to poor
people.

When accountability is weak, services do not meet the needs of citizens who, in turn, begin to lose trust
in government (Brixi et al., 2015). In the Arab Barometer survey, two-thirds of those surveyed said
government performance in improving basic health services was “bad” or “very bad.” Citizens end up
resorting to informal networks and informal payments, further eroding accountability in the public sector
and norms of public service. And without citizen participation, it is very difficult for the state to rebuild
these institutions.

The analysis extends to energy and water, where massive subsidies have led to deterioration in services
(blackouts, etc.) and low agricultural productivity. Subsidies increase demand and, with lags in supply
generation, shortages set in. Moreover, if the utility does not receive transfers from the government, it
underspends on maintenance, deteriorating the grid further. Higher-income citizens opt out of the system
and, as in Lebanon, use high-cost generators, whose suppliers then become a lobby against connecting to
the grid. Significantly, subsidies make it difficult for consumers to hold service providers, such as utilities,
accountable. Meanwhile, diesel subsidies have helped to deplete Yemen’s water table (Devarajan, 2014).
At the same time, raising prices (reducing subsidies) is seen as politically sensitive, especially if citizens
have lost trust in government.

                                                            MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR          APRIL 2015        20
In short, public services are also in a low-level equilibrium, where, because of their inability to hold
providers accountable, citizens are opting out of the public system, and moving towards market-based
systems, such as private tutoring, private doctors, and power generators. And providers are supplying
these services to supplement their public-sector incomes. The citizens’ loss of trust in government is
validated by the government’s inability to serve them.

The advantage of a market-based system is that the consumer is able to hold the provider accountable (if
the teacher is absent, he does not get paid). In the case of higher education, it may also permit a better
match between skills needed in the labor market and what the students learn. The disadvantage is that
it discriminates against poor people, who cannot afford to pay market prices. The key to reforming public
services, therefore, lies in a system where the consumer or client can hold providers accountable, while
ensuring that poor people can get access to the quality services that are typically enjoyed by the non-
poor.

What is to be Done?
In this situation, what can be done? It is clear that the old social contract, although it delivered results in
the past, is not suited to the needs of the current generation of citizens. The public sector can no longer
be the main employer. The private sector has in some cases been captured by politically connected
entities that resist domestic and international competition, even though these are necessary to create
jobs. And public service delivery is not organized in a way that citizens, especially poor citizens, can hold
providers accountable.

Moreover, because these are a series of low-level equilibria, incremental reforms in one area may not
dislodge the system. For instance, if we improve education quality but job creation does not increase, we
may remain stuck. What is needed therefore is a series of changes at all levels. This implies neither
another revolution or nor even “shock therapy”. Rather, it suggests changes in the set of economic
relationships between citizens and the state; in other words, a new social contract.

What would such a new social contract look like? First, instead of providing jobs in the public sector, the
state promotes competition in the private sector and greater equality of opportunity for all entrepreneurs.
Note that this shift signals a very different role for both the state and the private sector. Secondly, instead
of providing free or subsidized, low-quality public services, the state replaces the subsidies with (targeted)
cash transfers, with everybody paying market prices. In this way, poor people can afford to access the
private services that only the non-poor currently consume. And public expenditures are used to finance
public goods, such as infrastructure, and cash transfers (as above).

To be sure, these changes cannot, need not, and probably should not happen overnight. Nor do they
apply in the same way to all countries. Countries in conflict will need to resolve the conflict first. At the
same time, a strategy of “security at all costs” has its limits—the country may end up in another low-level
equilibrium of security with low growth. The transition countries have to modulate changes to
accommodate the political forces that may otherwise destabilize the country. In some of these countries
too, security and stability may be the short-run priorities. But the need to address the inexorable demands


                                                           MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR           APRIL 2015       21
for jobs and better public services will remain paramount. Finally, the oil-rich countries have a cushion in
their reserves, so they can plan the changes with a longer time horizon.

Getting there will not be easy. Many vested interests in the status quo will resist the change. As
mentioned above, citizen trust is limited. Reform champions will have to build coalitions for change. But
the people of the region are demanding jobs and better service delivery; they are demanding change.
And the Arab Spring taught us that they want their voices to be heard.

The old social contract has served its purpose. It is hard to see how the MENA region can solve its long-
standing problems without a new social contract. Inasmuch as MENA countries have shown that, with
the old social contract, they were able to deliver substantial progress to their citizens, they can do the
same with the new social contract.

Country Notes
Algeria
Economic prospects have worsened in Algeria following the crash of oil prices in the second half of 2014.
With the price of oil, Algeria’s main export, projected to average only $US 53 per barrel in 2015 (down
from $US100 in 2014), real GDP growth is projected to decline to 2.6 percent in 2015 from 4.1 percent in
2014. The fiscal deficit rose to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2014 and is projected to more than double to about
14.9 percent of GDP in 2015. The current account deficit is also expected to grow from 4.2 percent of GDP
in 2014 to an estimated 18.6 percent, of GDP in 2015. Weak growth performance has already pushed up
the unemployment rate from 9.8 percent in 2013 to 10.6 percent in 2014.

The situation is made more difficult by declining trends in hydrocarbon output, exports and revenues.
Hydrocarbon production has been on a downward path since 2006 due to a lack of investment in
upgrading existing fields and exploiting new discoveries, in part due to security concerns and in part to an
unattractive business environment. Exports have suffered also because domestic energy consumption
has continued to rise.

A clear policy response has not yet emerged. While the authorities have floated the idea of cutting
subsidies in basic goods (sugar, cooking oil, milk, and petroleum products) and utilities (electricity, gas and
water), which reportedly may cost the state as much as 18 percent of GDP, none of these steps has been
taken yet. And while fresh public sector hiring is to be postponed, statements have also been made that
this may not apply to sectors of “socioeconomic importance.” Furthermore, while the government has
insisted that it intends to maintain its ambitious five-year economic plan for the 2015-19 period, which
includes large investments in roads, housing, and water and energy infrastructure, capital expenditure in
2015 is now projected to rise by only 4 percent (down from over 30 percent year-on-year growth
considered in the 2015 government budget). On the external front, in an effort to reduce import demand,
import licenses have been tightened and the dinar depreciated by about 10 percent against the dollar.
This move may be insufficient as about half of Algerian imports are paid in euros and the euro has recently
depreciated by 30 percent against the dollar. Meanwhile, longer term structural challenges, such as
improving governance and the business climate to create private sector jobs, remain largely unaddressed.

Downside risks prevail in the present outlook. The key downside economic risks include an extended
decline in energy prices and further weakness in European growth. On the political side, internal social
pressures could mount, particularly if youth unemployment problems are not resolved. In addition,
important security risks remain associated with the active presence of radical factions and the threat they
pose to oil operations in Algeria.

Bahrain
Economic growth slowed to 4 percent in 2014 while fiscal pressures continued. After growing by 5.3
percent in 2013, Bahrain’s economy decelerated to about 4 percent in 2014, largely due to weak
investment sentiment. It is continuing to diversify its economy as construction, manufacturing, transport
and tourism and related services expand. The fiscal deficit rose in 2014, in part because oil-revenues
constitute 85 percent of total revenues and prices have been falling since June 2014. The fiscal break-even
price of oil for Bahrain (i.e., the price at which the budget is balanced) has crept up to US$125 per barrel.
Fiscal pressures have also risen due to increased subsidies and public sector wages since 2010. As a
consequence, the public debt has increased from 8 percent of GDP in 2008 to over 45 percent by 2014.
Moreover, the plan to increase diesel prices was suspended following objections by members of
parliament in December 2013.

The current account stayed in surplus despite falling oil prices. Oil and refined petroleum products
accounted for 73 percent of Bahrain’s total goods exports in 2013. In general, the composition and share
of products has not changed since 2000, although the volume of diesel and fuel oil has declined. The BOP
current account remains strong with an estimated surplus of 14.2 percent of GDP in 2013 and slightly
lower (12.9 percent) in 2014.

Bahrain’s banking system is sound and, for the moment, foreign investor confidence remains strong.
Bank mergers, encouraged by the Central Bank of Bahrain, have continued, leading to fewer banks, with
more diversified assets and stronger capital bases. As a sovereign, Bahrain continues to access foreign
credit; nevertheless, the 6 percent yield on recent and anticipated dollar bond issuance is reflective of
political risk.

Going forward, the economic outlook is characterized by moderate growth and higher public debt, with
average annual inflation projected to be subdued in 2015 and over the medium term. On the negative
side, Bahrain is running out of domestically-produced natural gas and soon may need to import gas at
market prices—which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of its energy-intensive
industries, such as aluminum, and manufacturing. The immediate challenges are to correct the fiscal
imbalances and stabilize the government debt. Fiscal sustainability requires a phasing out of subsidies for
the well-off and controlling for the growth in current spending while diversifying the sources of fiscal
revenue, including through an introduction of corporate income tax and value added tax.

Djibouti
Economic growth in Djibouti accelerated in 2014 while the current account deteriorated. Growth
reached 6 percent in 2014, up from 5 percent in 2013, driven mainly by port-related activities, such as
transit trade with Ethiopia and transshipment activities featuring large FDI inflows as well as a surge in
public investment. Meanwhile, the external position deteriorated due to high imports arising from
ongoing infrastructure projects. The current account deficit reached 33 percent of GDP in 2014, increasing
from 23.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and 18.4 percent of GDP in 2012.

Newly contracted debts are exacerbating fiscal and external debt sustainability pressures. In November
2013 the government contracted two non-concessional loans to finance two major water and railway
investment projects. These loans have a combined value equivalent to 60 percent of GDP and their
repayment will severely restrict fiscal space. Construction of the Djibouti segment of the railway is already
underway but the institutional arrangements for managing the project are not clear. Delays in sub-project
implementation will also be costly to the budget. Moreover domestic revenues are expected to fall as a
percentage of GDP in 2016–19 compared with 2013–15 because growth will not be accompanied by a
significant increase in fiscal revenues since the activities driving growth are mostly tax-exempt.

The decision to cancel the MIGA-guaranteed concession of the main port facility poses risks to investor
confidence and growth. On July 2014 the government announced that it had cancelled the concession of
its main container terminal to Dubai Port World. While Dubai Port World is continuing to operate the
terminal during the arbitration phase, the commercial dispute has increased business uncertainty. This
may ultimately affect the perceived quality of the business environment, reduce investor confidence in
Djibouti and undermine the economic progress achieved in previous years that was underpinned in large
measure by high investments in port activities.

The medium-term outlook is favorable but significant risks persist. Aggregate investment is projected to
rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2010–13 to 52 percent in 2014–16 (with public investment rising from 11
percent to 25 percent of GDP). This should support real GDP growth of around 6.8 percent per year. Risks
to growth and macroeconomic stability include: delays in the construction and management of the new
infrastructures; adverse economic or security developments in neighboring areas; domestic social and
political instability; degradation in the fiscal and debt situation and delays in the implementation of a new
ECF program with the IMF. Also, as already mentioned, the commercial dispute with Dubai Port World
could affect the flow of foreign investment.

Egypt
Egypt’s economic performance is improving as political and security tensions have abated somewhat.
Preliminary data for the first half of 2015 show an acceleration of growth to 5.3 percent, compared to 1.2
percent in the same period last year. The recent spike in economic activity reflects in part an ongoing
recovery in tourism and manufacturing. On the demand side, growth benefited from resilient
consumption and government stimulus spending, supported by large financial inflows from the GCC
countries. It is expected that real growth will rise to 4.3 percent in FY15, almost double the rate achieved
in FY13 and FY14. Unemployment is still high but with signs of improvement going into FY15 when the
rate is expected to decline to 12.7 percent.

The underlying fiscal stance has improved, thanks to subsidy and tax reforms. In July 2014, the
government introduced bold reforms including the reduction of energy subsidies and the enactment of
new or additional taxes on real estate, capital gains, dividends, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. At the
same time, budget allocations to health, education, social safety nets and infrastructure increased. The
budget deficit declined to 12.8 percent of GDP in FY14 and is expected to decline further to 11.3 percent
in FY15. This will put the government debt ratio at 94 percent of GDP by end FY15, down from 95.5
percent in end-FY14. The IMF conducted its Article IV consultation in November 2014, and the final report
generally commended the authorities’ medium-term plans while highlighting potential implementation
risks and the persistence of a large external financing gap.

The external account is stabilizing but reserves continue to be uncomfortably low. The balance of
payments was in surplus during the first quarter of FY15 driven by strong remittances, rebounding
tourism, and higher foreign direct investment (with flows rising year on year by 138 percent). Recently,
the repayment of US$3 billion of Qatari deposits and US$2.8 billion of oil companies’ arrears added
pressures on reserves, which reached US$15.5 billion by end-February 2015. Reserves are expected to
reach US$17 billion by end FY15, in part supported by an additional support package pledged by the Gulf
countries in the Egypt Economic Development Conference, held in mid-March 2015. The official exchange
rate depreciated in January 2015 by 7 percent shrinking the parallel market premium from 8 percent to 2
percent.

Sustaining the economic recovery will require continued improvements in security as well as attention
to economic reforms. The security situation, while improved relative to previous years, continues to
feature sporadic small-scale protests and terrorist attacks. Near-term strategy appears highly dependent
on mega-projects and government spending. This carries much uncertainty given the high level of
prevailing fiscal deficits and public debt. Meanwhile, business sector reforms needed to stimulate private
investment have not been clearly articulated yet. These will be critical to medium term prospects.

Iran
The Iranian economy rebounded from recession in 2014. Despite the sharp fall in the price of oil, Iran’s
real GDP grew by an estimated 3.0 percent compared to a contraction of -1.7 percent in 2013. This was
due to the temporary and partial easing of sanctions imposed on Iran’s oil exports, on the supply chain in
key sectors of the economy—such as in the automobiles industry—and on the transactions of
international and domestic banks as well as the rise in consumer and business confidence that a
comprehensive nuclear agreement is within reach.

The fiscal position is sound despite low oil prices. Government revenue shortfalls due to lower oil prices
during the current Iranian calendar year (i.e., March 2014-March 2015) will be partly offset by stronger-
than-expected revenues generated in the first half of the year. The combination of a higher-than-
projected price of crude sold by Iran (which averaged US$105-110 per barrel and exceeded the price of
US$100 per barrel assumed in the Budget) as well as increased export volume (which was 5 percent higher
than predicted in the Budget) explain this outcome. As a result, despite the recent decline in oil prices,
the fiscal deficit, which was estimated at 1 percent of GDP in the Budget, will remain contained at about
1.4 percent of GDP in 2014-15. Meanwhile, Iran’s current account surplus is estimated to have declined
from a surplus of 7.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 3.6 percent in 2014.

The near-term outlook calls for slower growth. Low oil prices will affect the economy much more in 2015
than was the case in 2014. The baseline scenario suggests that growth will decelerate to 0.6 percent in
2015 based on the assumption that the oil sector would grow by only 1.0 percent in 2015, down from
2.5 percent in 2014, and the non-oil sector will actually decline by 2.7 percent, compared to an expansion
of 7.3 percent in 2014.

However, much depends on whether a nuclear agreement is finalized in 2015 and how regional tensions
are resolved. Iran has huge oil and gas resources as well as general economic potential that has not been
fully utilized in recent years due to international sanctions. These sanctions could be removed if a nuclear
agreement is achieved per ongoing negotiations. If so, that would provide a huge boost to Iran’s economic
prospects. At the same time, the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq will also determine how economic
prospects change.

Iraq
Economic growth declined in 2014 due to multiple shocks. During 2014, Iraq was affected adversely both
by the continuing Islamic State (IS) insurgency and the sharp decline in the price of oil, the country’s main
source of public revenues. Real GDP contracted by 0.5 percent. The non-oil sectors of the economy were
also affected by the prevailing insecurity which caused the destruction of infrastructure, impeded access
to fuel and electricity, destroyed business confidence, and disrupted internal trade and transport. Non-oil
GDP growth declined by 5.2 percent in 2014.

The current account balance worsened during 2014 while the fiscal deficit stayed high. The current
account balance deteriorated from a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to a deficit of 2.8 percent in
2014 mostly due to falling oil prices. Reserves declined from over US$78 billion at end-2013 to about
US$65 billion at end-2014. Iraq operated without an approved budget for 2014. Instead, spending was
funded on the basis of 2013 actual disbursements plus ad hoc additional commitments approved by the
Cabinet. As the year progressed, security spending took precedence over all other discretionary items,
which were frozen. By year end, the fiscal deficit amounted to 5 percent of GDP, lower than in 2013 but
still quite high.

Near term prospects are challenging. The ongoing insurgency will keep disrupting economic activity and
diverting resources which could have been spent on poverty and development objectives to military ones.
Meanwhile, high dependence on oil revenues renders the economy vulnerable to low oil prices. Based on
these two factors, we expect real GDP to decline further by 1 percent in 2015. We expect the current
account deficit to grow considerably larger, reaching 8.3 percent of GDP, and the fiscal deficit to more
than double to 10.6 percent of GDP.

In addition to economic and security challenges, Iraq also faces a humanitarian crisis. As a result of the
ongoing conflict with the insurgent IS group, 17,073 Iraqis died and 23,126 were injured in 2014―the
highest levels since 2006. In addition, 2.1 million persons have been displaced and some 250,000 Syrian
refugees have flooded into the country. All this poses a major humanitarian crisis which the Government
is hard pressed to meet. The standard of living has deteriorated and a noticeable share of the population
has fallen into poverty or is vulnerable to falling into poverty.

Jordan
Jordan’s economy continues to grow slowly amidst regional tensions. These tensions include conflict in
Syria which has sent more than 620,000 refugees into Jordan and the fight against the Islamic State (IS)
which recently claimed the life of a Jordanian pilot. Jordan’s real GDP grew by 3.1 percent in 2014, up 30
basis points over 2013. Growth was led by construction, wholesale and retail trade, and a recovery in the
mining and quarrying sector. Demand side highlights include higher public investments, mostly due to
grants from the Gulf Cooperation Council, and a narrower trade deficit through the third quarter of 2014.
Unemployment declined to 11.9 percent in 2014, mostly due to a drop in the labor force participation
rate, while inflation fell to 2.8 percent, mostly due to lower oil prices.

The fiscal deficit declined modestly but public debt remains high. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) narrowed by 0.6 points to an estimated 13.5 percent of GDP respectively in 2014. This was driven
by a (mostly) cyclical improvement in revenue collection and restrained spending. Gross public debt
increased to 88.6 percent of GDP by end-November 2014. The recently approved 2015 budget (consistent
with the IMF SBA) and reshuffled cabinet (March 2) augur well for continued fiscal consolidation as key
policy makers (e.g., prime minister and minister of finance) remain unchanged.

The current account deficit narrowed significantly. The current account is estimated to have narrowed
from 10.3 to 7.1 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2014 due to higher travel and government receipts.
The trade deficit (on CIF basis) widened by 1.3 percent largely due to a 9.2 percent rise in energy imports
to offset the disruption in (cheap) gas supplies from Egypt. Security incidents in Iraq, Jordan’s largest
export partner, had an adverse impact.

Momentum exists for near term growth acceleration though regional security presents downside risks.
Real GDP growth is forecast at 3.5 percent in 2015 due to carry over effects, a lower oil price and
investment projects notably in energy. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be reduced given the growth
pick-up and continued fiscal consolidation. Risks include exacerbation of the Syrian and Iraqi crises and
the IS threat. Oil prices carry both a positive and negative risk. Persistently low oil prices in the medium
term could reduce GCC grants and remittances while higher prices would affect growth and
macroeconomic balances adversely.

Kuwait
The economy grew modestly in 2014 as oil prices fell sharply. Falling oil prices (since June 2014) and flat
oil production kept overall real GDP growth at 1.6 percent. The non-oil sector grew by 3.5 percent in 2014,
driven by domestic consumption and some pickup in government capital spending and private
investment. In keeping with low oil and commodity prices worldwide, the inflation rate stayed low at
about 3.1 percent in 2014.

Despite weak oil prices, the fiscal and external position remained strong. A fiscal surplus of 21.1 percent
of GDP is estimated for 2014 down from about 31.4 percent in 2013. Wages and salaries constitute 50
percent of total expenditure in the FY2014/15 budget. Total spending is projected to rise by 9 percent
between 2013 and 2014, reflecting both increased current (by 7 percent) and capital expenditures (by 15
percent). The current account surplus is estimated to have remained high at about 35.6 percent of GDP
in 2014.

The near-term economic outlook is positive. Non-oil GDP growth in Kuwait is expected to accelerate to 4
percent in 2015, and is projected to further increase gradually to 4.5–5 percent in the medium term in the
baseline scenario, on the strength of public spending in infrastructure and the oil sector, private
investment, and consumption. Inflation is projected to fall to 2.4 percent in 2015. A moderate increase in
oil production is expected to further support overall growth. The external current account and fiscal
surpluses are projected to remain high over the medium term, but on a declining trajectory, amid rising
government spending and continuously low oil prices.

High current spending poses a downside risk. The breakeven oil price—the price needed to balance the
budget at current expenditure levels—has risen over the past few years and is currently estimated at
US$75. While large reserves accumulated in previous years will allow the government to smooth public
spending in the medium term, in the event of a sustained oil price drop, this would come at the cost of
lower savings for future generations. Some steps have been taken recently to contain current spending.
The cabinet has decided to increase diesel and kerosene prices from 55 fils per liter to 170 fils per liter
(with potential saving of 0.5 percent of GDP). Some allowances for Kuwaitis travelling for healthcare
abroad have been trimmed. A proposal to reduce electricity subsidies is to be considered by the cabinet
soon. This could generate revenues of about 1 percent of GDP each year and a reduction in power usage
by 20 percent.

Lebanon
Lebanon continues to be highly exposed to regional turmoil. The border with Syria remains menacing as
coordinated attacks by ISIS and Al Nusra are frequently launched from bases in Syria. While the influx of
Syrian refugees decelerated significantly in 2014 after the Lebanese government imposed entry
restrictions, Lebanon continues to host around 1.18 million UNHCR-registered refugees from Syria
amounting to 26 percent of the population. Partly as a consequence of the regional turmoil, Lebanon has
also been in a state of domestic political paralysis as symbolized by the failure to reach agreement on a
new president since May 2014.

Economic activity picked up in 2014 albeit from a low level and macroeconomic balances improved.
Stronger economic performance and lower oil prices pushed real GDP growth to an estimated 2.0 percent
in 2014, compared to 0.9 percent in 2013. The fiscal deficit declined to an estimated 7 percent of GDP
with the primary balance reverting to a surplus after two years in deficit. Declining imports led to an
improvement in the current account balance though the overall level is still high at 22.2 percent of GDP.

Near term prospects are mixed. On the positive side, security conditions within Lebanon’s border have
improved so far in 2015 and a dialogue has been launched between opposing political parties. This is
likely to have a positive impact on consumer and investor confidence. In addition, oil prices are expected
to stay low and this will help improve the county’s current account balance. Overall, we expect real GDP
to grow by 2.5 percent in 2015, up slightly from 2014. We also expect the current account deficit to
narrow further to 16.7 percent of GDP. We expect the fiscal deficit to stay roughly constant at 7.2 percent
of GDP as reduced transfers to Electricite du Liban from falling oil prices are likely to be offset by higher
debt servicing due to rising interest rates.

On the negative side, it is hard to predict how regional turmoil will evolve beyond Lebanon’s borders. And,
on the economic side, with reasonable prospects for Fed tightening this year, Lebanon is likely to follow
suit and raise domestic interest rates to maintain the margin on USD and LBP deposits in Lebanon. This
will negatively impact lending to the private sector and raise Lebanon’s debt service costs, as new debt
will need to be contracted at higher interest rates given the short average debt maturity of the current
portfolio and the ongoing large gross financing needs

Libya
 Ongoing armed strife reduced oil output and drove the economy into deeper recession in 2014. A series
of strikes and security breaches at oil production sites led to a drop in oil production from 1 million barrels
per day in 2013 to an average of 0.5 million in 2014. The ongoing strife has severely disrupted other
economic activities as well. As a result, GDP is estimated to have contracted by 24 percent in 2014,
following a 13.6 percent drop recorded in 2013.

The collapse of economic activity is putting enormous strain on the budget . Revenues dropped by 61
percent in 2014 reflecting mostly low oil tax revenues but also a halving of the normal level of revenues
from other sectors. On the spending side, while capital expenditures declined sharply, current
expenditures (comprising mostly salaries and consumer subsidies) remained high. Consequently, the
fiscal deficit in 2014 climbed to an estimated 43.5 percent of GDP, the highest ever recorded.

The current account deficit has grown substantially as oil exports have fallen. The crisis that developed
in the oil sector since mid-2013 took a toll on exports, while consumption driven imports remained high.
The high current account surplus recorded in 2012 (29 percent of GDP) was more than halved in 2013 and
has since proceeded to turn into a huge deficit of 32.8 percent of GDP in 2014. To finance the deficit, the
Central Bank drew US$24.8 billion from its reserves, which fell to US$83 billion by end- 2014.

Near term prospects are highly dependent on how the political and security situation evolves. At the
moment, the country is divided between rival armed groups. Until the armed conflict dies down, a return
to normal economic activity based on the country’s enormous oil potential is not possible. We expect
weak economic growth in 2015, based on oil production staying at the 2014 level of 0.5 million bpd and
some rebound of non-oil economic activity. However, both public finances and the balance of payments
are projected to continue running high deficits due to low global oil prices and low oil exports.

Over the medium term, political stabilization and economic reform could release substantial growth
potential. In the event of a conflict resolution by the second half of 2015 and a rapid resumption of oil
production, the growth rate could jump in 2016 and beyond. Both the budget and current account
balances will significantly improve, eventually turning into surpluses, allowing foreign reserves to stabilize
around US$65 billion during 2015-2017. Within this context, the implementation of economic policy
reforms aimed at private sector development and job creation could boost Libya’s economic performance
significantly over the medium term.

Morocco
Morocco’s economic performance was below potential in 2014. Economic growth decelerated from 4.4
percent in 2013 to 2.6 percent as a result of declining agricultural output due to insufficient rainfall and
lackluster performance outside agriculture, especially in manufacturing. Unemployment rose to almost
10 percent and reached close to 40 percent and 20 percent among the urban young and educated,
respectively.

Despite the weak economy, macroeconomic balances improved due to policy measures. Measures
initiated in 2013 to reduce fuel subsidies and cut selected recurrent expenditures were continued in 2014.
As a result, the budget deficit decreased from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 5 percent. Consistent with
the fiscal tightening, the current account deficit shrunk to an estimated 5.8 percent of GDP from a peak
of 9.7 percent of GDP in 2012. On the capital account side, financial inflows were buoyed by relatively
high foreign direct investment, corporate and sovereign bond issuances, support from the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), and financial assistance from development partners, including the World Bank
Group. At more than US$20 billion, foreign exchange reserves recovered to their 2011 level.

Near term prospects are promising. This year, real GDP growth is expected to recover to 4.6 percent due
to good rainfall and the sharp decline in international oil prices. The 2015 Budget Law confirmed the
Government's resolution to solidify the tax base, rein in expenditures and launch the reforms of the
pension system, and the recent adoption of the Organic Budget Law should enhance central and local
governments' budget design and implementation for better public service delivery and efficiency over the
medium term. To improve further the investment climate, the Government announced its intention to
proceed with justice reform, improve access to financing, especially for the SMEs, and address access to
land constraints. Assuming full implementation of these reforms, including the commitment to reduce the
budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2017, growth should pick up to around 5 percent over the medium
term, with inflation kept below 2 percent.

Morocco’s external position is also expected to strengthen over the medium term. The emergence of
new growth drivers in higher value-added export industries (such as car manufacturing and aeronautics)
and the expansion of Moroccan companies in Western Africa are potentially creating the conditions for
Morocco to become a regional hub for trade and investment between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.
External financing requirements constitute a moderate concern in the medium term, given the relatively
low external debt, financial support from the GCC countries, and access to international markets. Any
remaining financing gap would be filled by tapping international markets given Morocco’s investment
grade ratings. The IMF’s Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) in the amount of US$5 billion will continue
to serve as insurance against external shocks until mid-2016.

Oman
Oman’s economy continued to expand in 2014 as government spending offset the effect of falling oil
prices. Real GDP grew by an estimated 4.1 percent, slightly above the rate achieved in 2013. While the
oil sector weakened, the non-oil sector grew by an estimated 6.5 percent, driven mainly by
petrochemicals, large-scale infrastructure projects (airport, port, water systems, roads, housing and
tourism), social infrastructure (health and education), and financial services. Lower revenues (due to
lower oil prices) and higher spending pushed fiscal balances into deficit in 2014 (-1 percent of GDP). The
current account balance was in surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP, down considerably from 8.6 percent in
2013. Inflation was contained at 2.2 percent.

Capital spending plans may have to be revisited as fiscal constraints tighten. The 8th Five-Year
Development Plan currently under implementation featured high rates of capital spending of about 10
percent of GDP a year over 2011-2015. Despite this occurring in tandem with higher current spending,
buoyant revenue growth from high oil prices helped to contain the impact on public debt. With fiscal
constraints tightening as oil prices have dropped, the planned rate of spending may have to be re-
examined both in 2015 and under the next Plan which is currently being prepared.

Lack of jobs for youth is the chief economic and social concern. Census data suggest that total
unemployment reached 24.4 percent in 2010. The working age population is growing at over 3 percent a
year. To absorb new labor force entrants and significantly reduce unemployment, the economy will have
to generate some 45,000 new positions for Omanis each year, a pace that has only be reached in the past
by hiring into the public sector. However, this is not a sustainable option for the future, both for its fiscal
impact and its low contribution to national productivity.

The short-term macroeconomic outlook depends on oil prices and public spending. Our central forecast
is that real GDP will grow by 3.7 percent while the fiscal and current account balances will deteriorate
sharply. The 2015 budget envisages a deficit of 8 percent of GDP due mainly to the steep fall in oil
revenues. However, if public spending continues at recent rates, the budget deficit could reach 17 percent
of GDP. The current account deficit could rise to 10 percent of GDP unless measures are taken to restrain
growth in imports which are largely determined by public and private spending. The inflation outlook
remains moderate but inflationary pressures might emerge due to higher wages and aggregate demand.

Palestinian Territories
More than 6 months after the Gaza war, the political and security situation in the Palestinian territories
remains precarious. The pace of the reconstruction process in Gaza has been much slower than expected
due to inadequate donor funding and the Israeli restrictions on importing construction material into Gaza.
The ongoing rift between Hamas and Fatah has also hindered efforts to rebuild Gaza. So far, the two
Palestinian parties have not agreed on governance arrangements in Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority
(PA) is yet to station its officials at the border crossings with Israel and Egypt as agreed in the ceasefire.
Peace talks with Israel have completely stalled.

After 7 years of continuous growth, the Palestinian economy contracted in 2014. The Gaza war of July-
August 2014 caused physical damage estimated at nearly USD2.8 billion and led to a contraction of nearly
15 percent in Gaza’s real GDP. Consequently, despite growth of 4.4 percent in the West Bank economy,
the overall Palestinian economy contracted by about 1 percent in 2014. Given that population growth in
the Palestinian territories is 3 percent, real GDP per capita contracted by about 2 percent. Unemployment,
already high, increased even further (by 2 points) to 27 percent in 2014: 43 percent in Gaza and 17 percent
in the West Bank. Preliminary estimates suggest that poverty in Gaza increased from 28 percent in 2013
to 39 percent in 2014.

The Government of Israel’s (GoI) decision to withhold Palestinian taxes has triggered a fiscal crisis. The
recurrent deficit (before grants) was reduced by about 1 percentage point of GDP in 2014 as a result of
strong revenue performance. However, in early 2015, the GoI decided to withhold customs and VAT duties
it collects on behalf of the PA after the latter submitted an application to become a member in the
International Criminal Court (ICC). Since this affected as much as 70 percent of its revenues, the PA has
resorted to cash rationing, paying only 60 percent of staff salaries, delaying expenditures and increasing
its stock of arrears to the private sector and the pension fund.

Near term prospects are poor. The overall real GDP growth rate is projected at 0.9 percent in 2014. The
economy of the West Bank is expected to contract by 1.8 percent due to the fiscal and liquidity squeeze
brought about by the Israeli decision to withhold Palestinian taxes. The economy of Gaza is expected to
grow by 10 percent as economic activity recovers and the reconstruction process accelerates. However,
downside risks remain significant. First, if donor pledges for Gaza do not materialize, the pace of
reconstruction will be slower than expected. Second, while the expectation is that Israel will resume the
payment of Palestinian taxes by May/June, this is by no means certain and further delays in the payment
of these revenues could lead to an even larger contraction in the West Bank.

Qatar
The economy grew strongly in 2014 despite falling hydrocarbon prices. Qatar managed to maintain GDP
growth of about 6 percent in 2014, a level comparable to the previous year, largely because of high levels
of public and private spending. The rate of economic expansion is expected to decline to 3 percent in 2015
due to sharply lower oil prices and oil-indexed LNG prices. However, the large public investment program,
a generally expansionary fiscal policy, and population growth will continue to drive domestic demand and
non-hydrocarbon sector growth over the medium term. Services are projected to contribute heavily to
GDP growth over the next few years, as are manufacturing and construction, while the hydrocarbon
sector’s contribution may well be negative.

Qatar’s fiscal and external positions remained comfortable in 2014, although downward pressure is
expected in 2015 as low oil and gas prices reduce government revenues and exports. Qatar recorded a
fiscal surplus of 9.7 percent of GDP and a current account surplus of 21.2 percent in 2014. As oil and
related gas prices are projected to remain low in 2015, Qatar is revising its capital investment plans to
ease pressure on the budget. However fiscal policy is still expected to be expansionary as the government
races to meet its FIFA World Cup 2022 preparation schedule. Consequently, the fiscal balance is projected
to drop to 6.5 percent of GDP while the current account records a low rate of 2.3 percent for the first time
in many years. Qatar continues to maintain a steady exchange rate pegged to the US dollar and pressure
for revaluation is unlikely. Its cushion of foreign reserves declined to 13.8 billion USD (6 percent of GDP)
in 2014 and is expected to stabilize around that level.

Medium-term prospects in the gas market are unclear due to the expansionary trend of global supply .
This trend encompasses higher production of shale gas in Europe and the United States as well as higher
LNG exports from Australia, Russia, Canada and other producers. At the same time, geopolitical
considerations could make Qatar’s access to additional gas sources from the North field questionable,
should its current fields prove insufficient. However, the Ukraine crisis is only the latest of a series of major
shocks that have boosted the economics of LNG and particularly for incumbent players like Qatar.

Qatar has announced measures to ensure better treatment of expatriate workers. An international
outcry over the treatment of expatriate workers involved in the preparations for the FIFA 2022 World Cup
in Qatar has galvanized government action to reform labor policies. In May 2014 Qatar announced
reforms to its sponsorship system (to allow expatriate workers flexibility to switch between employers)
and to ensure wage payments and occupational health. The reforms have yet to be enshrined in national
legislation and implementation timelines and enforcement mechanisms have yet to be announced.

Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia’s growth weakened in 2014 in line with sharply lower oil prices during the year. Real GDP
growth slowed to 4.3 percent in 2014, much below the 5.1 percent registered in 2013 and 6.8 percent
recorded in 2012. This was not surprising as economic performance in Saudi Arabia is much affected by
the price of oil which plunged by more than 50 percent since June 2014. However, the overall economy
is well-placed to cope as close to $786 billion dollars of reserves have been accumulated in recent years
(when oil prices were high) and the government is in a comfortable position to engage in counter-cyclical
fiscal spending. Inflation (year-on-year) stood at 3 percent in 2014, a little lower than the level of 2013.

The 2015 budget aims to stimulate the non-hydrocarbon sector and boost social spending. Education
and health remained the focus of government spending accounting for 38 percent of total spending. The
2015 budget envisages a reduction of investment spending by 13 percent compared to 2014 budget.
Despite this decline, investment spending will still be 81 percent higher than its level five years ago. Due
to the fall in oil prices and to the increase in wages and social benefits, the 2015 budget is forecast to have
a deficit of more than 16 percent of GDP compared with a fiscal surplus of 6 percent in 2014. The current
account balance is expected to behave in similar fashion by moving to a deficit of 11.8 percent of GDP in
2015 from a surplus of 12.4 percent in 2014.

Longer term challenges include generating adequate jobs for nationals. According to the latest labor
force survey by the Ministry of Labor, unemployment among Saudis declined slightly to 11 percent in 2014
from 11.5 in 2013. While improving, the level of unemployment is still considered very high and is higher
still among such groups as youth and women. To combat unemployment, the government has been
actively implementing education and skills measures as well as a quota-enforcement scheme called
Nitaqat and an unemployment assistance scheme called Hafez. However, other measures such as the
award of salary bonuses to public sector employees work at cross-purposes to the employment objective.

The outlook remains broadly positive despite weak oil prices. GDP is expected to grow by 4.6 percent in
2015 despite weak oil prices because of counter-cyclical spending. Furthermore, a smooth leadership
transition has taken place recently. Crown Prince Salman ascended the throne upon the death of King
Abdullah and quickly appointed a new a leadership team. The general impression is that while the leaders
have changed the thrust of economic policy will remain unchanged. Of course, the economic outlook also
depends on how regional security matters play out.

Syria*
The humanitarian impact of Syria’s civil war worsened in 2014. The estimated death toll has exceeded
220,000 people (UN); 840,000 were injured and many more held in custody. Half the Syrian population
has been forced to leave their homes (7.6 million internally displaced, 3.8 million refugees, and more than
1.5 million non-refugee migrants). More than 12.2 million in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid,
including 5.6 million children (UNOCHA, Syrian Center for Policy Research-SCPR). Lack of access to health
care and scarcity of medicine have led to a catastrophic health situation. Poor food availability and quality
and successive cuts in subsidies on bread has exacerbated nutritional deprivation. An estimated 25
percent of schools were not operational by Q3-2014. Unemployment was estimated at 58 percent and
overall poverty incidence at 83 percent at end-2014 (SCPR).

Available estimates of growth are wildly divergent. SCPR and ESCWA project that economic contraction
significantly slowed in 2014 to -9.9 and -14.3 percent respectively, bringing GDP to 38 percent (SCPR) or
48 percent of 2010 GDP (ESCWA). EIU, on the other hand, projects that the economy bottomed out, with
growth averaging a modest 0.5 percent, driven by the economy’s adjustment to the military stalemate
and the considerable migration of businesses to more stable coastal areas. The EIU estimates growth of
1.9 percent in 2015 and 2016, whereas ESCWA projects a 2015 growth rate of -4.7 percent, bringing Syrian
GDP to a mere quarter of the 2015 GDP projected by the IMF before the crisis.

The crippling civil war has caused a drop in government revenues and a spike in spending. ESCWA
estimates a 2013 budget deficit of -26.3 percent of GDP. EIU estimates a deficit of -12.9 percent in 2013
and projects deficits of -10.7 percent and -9.2 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015. SCPR estimates a deficit
close to 20 percent during 2013 and 2014 and almost doubles its estimates to 35.7 percent and 40.5
percent after adding off-budget subsidies. SCPR projects foreign debt increased tenfold from 7 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 71 percent at end-2014, whereas domestic debt increased from 16 to 76 percent of GDP.
This implies a total debt of 147 percent of GDP by end-2014. Meanwhile EIU estimates external debt in
2014 at a much lower 40 percent of GDP.

Large current account deficits persist and the currency has depreciated. Depressed export revenue
caused by the impact of the conflict (declining output and international sanctions), and declining
international reserves have caused a significant depreciation of the Syrian pound from 47 pounds per USD
in March 2011 to an estimated 176 pounds per USD at end-2014 (EIU).. Continued reliance on imports to
satisfy food and fuel needs, weak exports, and absent tourism (Syria’s second largest source of foreign
exchange pre-crisis) will result in the persistence of a high current account deficit of over 12 percent in
2015 (EIU).

Tunisia
Economic performance stayed weak in 2014. Real GDP grew by only 2.3 percent, matching the subdued
performance of 2013. On the production side, a short-lived rebound in mining and continued expansion
in the services and administrative sectors were offset by declining activity in the extractive industries and
stagnating manufacturing. Industrial production has steadily decelerated after its 2012 rebound and grew
by only 0.2 percent in 2014. Overall, the recovery in external demand is slow, reflecting the weak
economic recovery in the EU, while domestic demand is increasingly affected by tighter macroeconomic
policies, notably translating into slowing public and private consumption. Inflation declined to 5.5 percent
in 2014 as food and energy prices decelerated. Unemployment remained high, hovering between 15 and
16 percent.

The current account deficit widened despite weak domestic demand and exchange rate depreciation.
The trade balance deteriorated markedly (to 16 percent of GDP) as exports grew slowly (+2.6 percent)
and the import bill rose sharply (+6.3 percent), the latter driven by a worsening energy balance (expressed
in domestic currency). This drove the current account deficit to an estimated 9 percent of GDP. Security
concerns had an adverse impact on tourism and FDI, with tourism receipts growing only by 1.7 percent
during the year, and FDI not recovering from its 2013 downturn. The exchange rate depreciated by 15
percent vs. the US$ and 5 percent vs. the Euro in 2014. Reduced interventions helped preserve somewhat
the level of reserves in 2014 at US$7.7 billion, after a drawdown of a 1 billion US$ in 2013.

The fiscal balance improved due to lower spending on subsidies and better revenue performance. The
fiscal deficit declined from 5.9 percent in 2013 to 4.3 percent in 2014. Capital spending was kept at only
4.8 percent of GDP, subsidies at 7.2 percent and the wage bill at 12.7 percent, the last- mentioned only
marginally exceeding the target of 12.6 percent agreed with the IMF. Tax revenues outperformed
expectations due to improved collection administration but also one-off tax measures that will not be
sustained in 2015. Foreign financing fell short of expectations but was compensated by a smaller deficit
than programmed and additional recourse to domestic financing. In early 2015, the Government raised
financing on the Eurodollar market by floating a 10 year US$1bn bond (priced at 5.875 percent), without
any guarantee.

Medium term prospects are mixed. On the positive side, broad adherence to the ongoing transition by
the major political parties should boost domestic and foreign investor confidence as should low energy
prices. On the negative side, security tensions remain high both within the country and in neighboring
Libya while Europe is mired in anemic growth. Overall, we expect real GDP to grow by about 2.6 percent
in 2015 based on a moderate rebound in manufacturing and the agro-food sector.

United Arab Emirates
Despite falling oil prices, the UAE economy performed well in 2014 as non-oil sectors grew strongly.
Overall, the economy expanded by 4.7 percent even though oil prices fell by almost 50 percent after mid-
year. Such resilience was due to the fact that non-oil growth, especially in the services sector, continued
to accelerate. The real estate market, which had hindered growth since the 2009 crisis, has mostly
recovered albeit unevenly as Dubai has done better than Abu Dhabi.

 Internal and external balance positions remained in surplus. The progressive unwinding of the stimulus
initiated in response to the 2009 crisis led to a surplus of 5.7 percent of GDP in the fiscal account in 2014.
This is expected to shift to deficit in 2015. Likewise, the external current account recorded a surplus of
5.7 percent of GDP in 2014 but is expected to run a deficit in 2015 as the demand for imports continues
while overall export revenues slacken due to low oil prices. Gross foreign inflows to the banking sector
also remained steady, reflecting the UAE’s perceived safe-haven status.

Dubai’s successful debt restructuring of government-related enterprises (GREs) was tested as some
extended repayments came due. The common element to the restructurings was extensions of bank debt
maturities, with terms depending on creditor priority (i.e. secured creditors got better terms than
unsecured). Cash to meet immediate GRE needs was supplied by a US$20 billion loan backed by Abu Dhabi
in 2009 (half of the money was on the balance sheet of the Central Bank, the other half with two
commercial banks). This loan was due for repayment this year, but has now been extended to 2019 with
an interest rate of 1 percent (in contrast to 4 percent on the original loan).

Abu Dhabi is generally focused on completion of existing initiatives. The tourism/culture megaprojects
remain on their revised track, and various sovereign development entities continue their mix of strategic
investments at home (e.g., Masdar solar) and abroad (European and East Asian energy and finance). The
government has struggled to maintain a fully arms-length relationship from public commercial companies:
Etihad (the airline) and Etisalat (telecom) were both revealed to be in receipt of large, and apparently one-
off, financial transfers.

Medium term growth will come largely from public spending and the non-oil sector. Growth in tourism,
real estate, construction, and services is likely to strengthen further in 2015. The non-oil economy is
projected to expand by over 4 percent per annum in the coming years on the back of Dubai’s strong core
services sectors and Abu Dhabi’s diversification efforts. The still-uncertain global economic and financial
environment could pose external risks to this favorable outlook, although the UAE’s sizeable foreign assets
provides a buffer. The debt overhang may limit growth in bank lending.

Yemen
Yemen’s economy deteriorated sharply in 2014 due to political turmoil. The key political event of the
year was the progressive take-over of the government and the capital city of Sana’a starting in September
2014 by the Houthi rebel group from the northern part of the country. Presently, military and
administrative control in Yemen is divided between two main groups, one around Sana’a under the
Houthis and the other around Aden under elements opposed to them. In addition to this conflict,
numerous other skirmishes took place during the year involving other groups as well. Indeed, throughout
the year, there was repeated sabotage of oil pipelines and facilities which led in turn to fuel shortages and
power outages. One consequence of this extended turmoil and insecurity was the collapse of economic
growth from 4.8 percent in 2013 to only about 0.3 percent in 2014. This bodes ill for the alleviation of
poverty in the country which, at 54 percent, is among the highest in the world. Indeed, given the prevailing
circumstances, there is a risk of even greater political and economic deterioration in 2015.

Fiscal performance reflected the growth collapse. The fiscal deficit (before grants) increased to 8.7
percent of GDP in 2014, compared to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2013, due mainly to a decline in tax and nontax
revenues. Tax collection was hindered by the slowdown in economic activity as well as by the general
insecurity. Savings from the fuel subsidy reform initiated in July were limited due to late implementation
and also because the subsidies were partially restored by the government under pressure from the
Houthis. Mobilizing domestic financing proved difficult—net domestic financing to the Government
amounted to about 2.6 percent of GDP compared to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2013—due to tight liquidity
conditions in the economy and the reluctance of Islamic banks to purchase more sukuks at the prevailing
yield of 10 percent. To keep expenditure within the available financing envelope, the government had to
reduce capital expenditures and accumulate arrears. The overall fiscal deficit estimate (inclusive of grants)
stood at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2014, compared to 6.9 percent in 2013.

Current account performance would have been much worse without Saudi grants. Yemen is a small net
exporter of oil and so falling oil prices reduced foreign exchange inflow on this account. Capital outflows
also increased, mainly from oil companies. On the positive side, remittances remained stable and large
Saudi grants totaling about US$1.2 billion were received. This helped improve the current account deficit
from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2014. Gross foreign exchange reserves declined
by about US$800 million to reach US$4.1 billion at the end of 2014, but remained broadly adequate
covering four months of imports. Despite the decline of international reserves, the nominal exchange rate
has remained stable since July 2012, at 214.9 Yemeni Rials per US dollar.
