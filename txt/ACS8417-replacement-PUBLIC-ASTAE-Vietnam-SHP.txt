The hydropower plants all have virtually the same layout,
as shown in figure 3.1. All plants divert water from the
river to the powerhouse by channel, tunnel, and pen-
stock. In most cases, the rivers are diverted over sev-
eral kilometers. The generated electricity is supplied to
the national grid through transmission lines. Most dams
also involve a reservoir, although most reservoirs are
quite small in volume compared with mean annual runoff
and capable only of daily regulation (providing power for
peak needs). The projects also include the construction
of new roads and auxiliary resources, such as a power-                   © Deltares/World Bank. Used with the permission of Deltares. Further

      BOX 4.1 LAND AND WATER INTERACTIONS IN RIVER BASINS

      Human processes shaping land and water use within a river basin affect its geophysical processes, such as water
      quantity and quality as well as erosion, and thus affect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems (Loucks, Bain, and Pen-
      dall 1999). Consequently, the amount of, and rate of change in, forested areas versus agricultural and urban areas
      affects these parameters. In three of the study basins (Ngoi Xan, Chien, and Sap) this change occurred largely before
      development of the SHP cascade, albeit in Ngoi Xan and Chien especially, the cascade exacerbates the impact. In
      Nam Tha, most of the cascade development is within pristine forest areas so the land use change stems mainly from
      the SHP cascade development.

      As a general rule of thumb (derived from Loucks, Bain, and Pendall 1999), an acre of foresta yields, on average, 12 per-
      cent of the precipitation falling on that land as surface runoff, and negligible soil is lost. An acre of typical agricultural
      land, like a corn field, yields 42 percent of the precipitation as runoff, and this surface flowing water typically carries
      away 73 tons of soil per year with the associated nutrients, fertilizers, chemicals, and animal waste. Urban land yields
      even greater runoff (Dunne and Leopold 1978). The rerouting of water overland due to different developments in river
      basins can, therefore, change stream flow or hydrological regime affecting the flow variability and the magnitude
      and frequency of floods. Furthermore,

 BOX 4.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTIVITY IN RIVERS

 River basin connectivity is affected by dams and associated works, either as the result of direct dam impoundment
 or of ecosystem and forest clearing. Dams affect connectivity laterally, longitudinally, and vertically (Stanford and
 Ward 2001). Superimposed on these three space dimensions is the impact on ecological processes and functions in
 time (Ward 1989). Connectivity affects both ecosystem (functions and community structure) and population dynam-
 ics (migration, dispersal, fragmentation, and so on). Connectivity is illustrated in figure 4.3.

 Healthy ecosystems depend on connectivity and also on the width of corridors. Thus, connectivity is a measure of
 how spatially continuous a corridor or a matrix is (Forman and Godron 1986); width is the distance across the stream
 and its zone of adjacent vegetation cover. A stream corridor with connections among its natural communities pro-
 motes transport of materials and energy and movement of flora and fauna (Loucks and van Beek 2005).

 The connectivity issue relates especially to the potential population fragmentation, imposed by the dams, of the
 various fish species in the studied river basins. Fragmentation is related to both the downstream dispersal and the
 upstream migration of adult fish. Fragmentation of the adjacent terrestrial and riparian ecosystems may occur from
 the construction of roads, transmission lines, and other hydropower-related infrastructure.

 BOX 4.3 DEFINITION AND ASSETS OF LIVELIHOOD

 Various definitions of “livelihood” have emerged that attempt to explain its complex nature. This report embraces the
 definition suggested by Chambers and Conway (1992):

     A livelihood comprises the capabilities, assets (stores, resources, claims and access) and activities required
     for a means of living: a livelihood is sustainable which can cope with and recover from stress and shocks,
     maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets, and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the next
     generation; and which contributes net benefits to other livelihoods at the local and global levels and in the
     short and long term.

 Livelihood assets can be categorized into the following five main groups (UNDP/IRP/ISDR 2005):

 1.	 Human capital: Skills, knowledge, health, and ability to work

 2.	 Social capital: Social resources, including informal networks, membership in formalized groups, and relationships
     of trust that facilitate cooperation and economic opportunities

 3.	 Natural capital: Natural resources such as land, soil, water, forests, and fisheries

 4.	 Physical capital: Basic infrastructure, such as roads, water and sanitation, schools, information and communica-
     tion technologies; and producer goods, including tools, livestock, and equipment

 5.	Financial capital: Financial resources including savings, credit, and income from employment, trade, and
    remittances

 SHP cascade development can have positive and negative impacts on livelihoods and thus on project-affected peo-
 ple (PAP). For simplicity, the focus in this study has been on two negative impacts—loss of land (natural capital) and
 changes in customs and traditions (human and social capital); and on two positive impacts—improved infrastructure
 (physical capital) and improved job opportunities (human and financial capital). Their impacts on PAP and their liveli-
 hoods are portrayed in figure 6.4.

 BOX 6.1 SUMMARY OF CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR STUDIED CASCADES

 Although each cascade has unique characteristics, this study shows that small-scale hydropower development in the
 four cascades has the following effects:

 •	   Requires minimal resettlement of people
 •	   Requires land take comparable to that of large hydropower as measured by power density
 •	   Is not in competition with irrigation
 •	   Does not significantly alter flows downstream from the cascade (because of small reservoirs)
 •	   Has little scope for multifunctional use (reservoirs are too small)
 •	   Has a significant impact on habitat fragmentation and reduces connectivity
 •	   Risks opening and disturbing pristine areas, leading to additional cumulative impacts from deforestation (as
      shown in the case of Nam Tha).

BOX 7.1 MINIMUM FLOW OR ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW?

River ecosystems are, to a large extent, the result of natural variation in the discharge regime. The magnitude, tim-
ing, duration, frequency, and rate of change of both high and low flow events are important. The required flow regime
will depend on the requirements of the ecosystem components that are valued in a specific river and also implies
a trade-off with other river functions, such as hydropower generation. It can be assumed that any alteration of the
flow regime (topping off of high peaks, increasing low flows) leads to changes in the river ecosystem. Whether
these changes can be accepted because the benefits—in this case hydropower generation—are considered more
important cannot be answered with a generic rule. Instead, site-specific assessments, for which several methods
are available, are required. The approaches developed in various countries around the world can be divided into four
categories (Acreman and Dunbar 2004):

•	       Lookup tables
•	       Desk-top analysis
•	       Functional analysis
•	       Hydraulic habitat modeling

The last two groups are the most advanced and require more resources and data. Functional analysis builds on an
understanding of the functional links between several aspects of the hydrology and ecology of the river system.
These methods cover many aspects of the ecosystem and some of them also incorporate societal aspects, such
as the Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformations methodology (King, Brown, and Sabet 2003). Per-
haps the best known is the Building Block Method (BBM), developed in South Africa (Tharme and King 1988; King,
Tharme, and de Villiers 2000). The basic premise of the BBM is that riverine species as well as other river functions
are reliant on basic elements (building blocks) of the flow regime over the year, including low flows (which provide a
minimum habitat for species and prevent invasive species), medium flows (which sort river sediments and stimulate
fish migration and spawning), and floods (which maintain channel structure and allow movement onto floodplain
habitats). An environmental flow regime can thus be constructed by combining these building blocks (see figure
B7 .1.1). It should be clear that a seasonal fixed minimum discharge, such as the Q95 or Q50 (see figure 7  .1) eliminates
most of the natural variation in discharges, and is unlikely to be able to sustain all relevant ecological processes.

      1.	 MONRE [the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment] shall lead and coordinate with related ministries to
          regulate the determination of the minimum flows to be maintained in river basins.

      2.	 Determination of the minimum flows:

         •	 MONRE shall survey, investigate and determine the minimum flow requirements for the river/river section,
            or for each water source, in the river basins named in the Major River Basin List and the Inter-provincial River
            Basin List;
         •	 For international river basins MONRE shall, on behalf of the Government, negotiate an agreement with other
            countries sharing that international river basin regarding the maintenance of minimum flows in the main
            stream of the river basins;
         •	 The Provincial People’s Committee shall survey, investigate and determine the minimum flow requirements
            for the river/river section, or for each water source, in the river basins listed in Provincial River Basin List;
         •	 The requirement for minimum flow levels in the river/river section must be publicized and comments sought
            from economic organizations involved with the exploitation and use of water, and representatives of com-
            munities living in the river basin.

      3.	 The authority to promulgate the minimum flow in river:

         •	 MONRE shall promulgate the minimum flow requirements for the river/river section, or for each water source,
            in the river basins named in the Major River Basin List and the Inter-provincial River Basin List;
         •	 The Chairman of the Provincial People’s Committee shall promulgate the minimum flow requirements for the
            river/river section, or for each water source, in the river basins named in the Provincial River Basin List.

      4.	 Related ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government agencies, and state companies and corporations shall
          adjust their programs, plans, projects and regulations for water exploitation and use to ensure that the minimum
          river flows for the promulgated river/river section are maintained.

     BOX 9.1 BENEFIT SHARING FOR HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT

     Benefit sharing is a promising concept in sustainably implementing hydropower and water infrastructure projects,
     and is emerging as a supplement to the standard requirements of compensation and mitigation. Benefit sharing is
     being driven by a societal responsibility to ensure that local communities end up with something better than pre-
     project economic conditions. For benefit sharing to work, certain core mechanisms must be in place: policies and
     the regulatory framework (government), corporate social responsibility policies (project proponent), and community
     acceptance of the project. Cooperation among these three parties enables tripartite partnerships (Lillehammer,
     Martin, and Dhillion 2011).

     Mitigation measures are normally anchored in commitments related to the environmental impact assessment and
     licensing processes, either in international guidelines or more specifically in national legislation and regulatory pro-
     cesses. Benefit sharing goes beyond these commitments and focuses on enhancing community development
     related to opportunities created by the projects instead of only mitigating impacts. Figure B9.1.1 illustrates the rela-
     tionship and differences between traditional compensation and mitigation measures compared with benefit sharing.

     Vietnam has been developing and piloting benefit sharing for local communities affected by hydropower projects
     since 2006. The A’Vuong hydropower project was selected as a pilot study for benefit sharing in Vietnam, where the
     government of Vietnam and the Asian Development Bank were involved. As part of the technical assistance, a draft
     decree on benefit sharing was prepared in 2008, for pilot testing for the A’Vuong project. The pilot was completed
     in 2010 and implemented by the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam in close cooperation with the Provincial
     People’s Committee of Quang Nam Province. The pilot included a wide range of actions such as direct involvement of
     communities and payments for ecological services (Lillehammer, Martin, and Dhillion 2011). Such a benefit-sharing
     framework can be similarly utilized in small-scale hydropower development in Vietnam for future sustainability of the
     planning process.
