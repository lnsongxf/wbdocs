legal structures, as well as clearly defined stakeholder   well as information networking, innovative research,

The historical development of the legal framework for
flood risk reduction in Japan—specifically the River           Land use planning is key. Rapid urbanization,

   revisions) and the Flood Control Act (1949). The
   River Law focuses on river management (comprising
   flood risk reduction, water resources management,
   and environment creation and preservation). The
   flood management aspect of the River Law includes
   planning and implementation of flood risk reduction
   along with a regulatory framework that prevents an
   increase in flood risk. The Flood Control Act focuses
   on two complementary components, flood risk
   communication (hazard mapping, flood forecasting,
   and warning) and emergency response. There is a
   designated river management authority that manages
   each of Japan’s rivers and that acts as the first
   respondent for early recovery and reconstruction of
   river infrastructure in case of a disaster. In principal,
   Class A rivers are managed by MLIT and Class B
   rivers by prefectural governments. Water resource
   management, including flood management, is
   conducted by river managers.

   the time of implementation, structural measures were
   given priority, resulting in a shortage of available
   funds for nonstructural measures and an unsatisfactory
   outcome. Implementation of the plan was later shifted
   to MOF, which prioritized nonstructural measures
   and gave the hydrological system and related plans

   people, especially informal settlers on the floodplains,
   see floods as an opportunity to receive donations and

   encourages people to continue building on floodplains
   illegally. Jakarta is increasingly adopting advanced
   technologies to counter floods, including early
   warning systems.

Super embankments have mounding in more extensive urban areas than existing embankments.
The advantages of super embankments are:
1) no collapse at ﬂoods,
2) no collapse against inundation, and
3) earthquake-resistant.

River bank land development is strictly restricted pursuant to the River Law. However, the whole slopes at the
back of super embankments are designated as the special areas, for which land development is deregulated.

   TDD Follow-On Support for Ho Chi Minh City,
   Vietnam (June–September 2016)

   In June 2016, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam—a TDD
   client—requested support in enhancing the quality
   of the terms of reference for a flood control center
   as part of a larger-scale investment in flood risk
   management. The DRM Hub and TDLC worked
   together to solicit key inputs for the client,
   engaging MLIT, JICA, the University of Tokyo,
   Toyo University, and GFDRR. The DRM Hub also
   engaged Japanese private sector firms to provide
   supplemental information on the solutions these
   firms currently offer.

   In September 2016, the DRM Hub and TDLC
   supported the Vietnam DRM team’s Flood Risk
   Consultation Workshop in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Together, the teams worked to bring expert
   practitioners from the City of Yokohama to the
   workshop to advise Ho Chi Minh City officials.
   The workshop focused on monitoring and data
   capture, institution and capacity building, and the
   importance of setting operational competencies
   during the implementation phase. It brought
   together experts from Japan and the United States
   to discuss their countries’ flood operations centers
   and the centers’ role in influencing investment
   design and implementation.

The World Bank Disaster Risk Management Hub, Tokyo supports developing countries to mainstream DRM in national
development planning and investment programs. As part of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and in
coordination with the World Bank Tokyo Office, the DRM Hub provides technical assistance grants and connects Japanese and
global DRM expertise and solutions with World Bank teams and government officials. Over 37 countries have benefited from
the Hub’s technical assistance, knowledge, and capacity building activities. The DRM Hub was established in 2014 through
the Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in Developing Countries – a partnership between Japan’s Ministry of
Finance and the World Bank.
