Abstract: Drawing on three sources—a 2013 qualitative study in four districts of Punjab
province; a targeted analysis of the baseline and endline surveys of the Family
Advancement for Life and Health (FALAH 2007–2012) project; and the Pakistan
Demographic Health Survey (PDHS) of 1990–1991 and of 2006–2007—this study
explores Pakistani (especially Punjabi) couples’ dynamics during their decision processes
on fertility intentions and practices, along with community perceptions of male-focused
interventions as well as men’s suggestions for future intervention strategies.
It finds that men in Punjab seem now more concerned about their fertility intentions and
practices due to the financial challenges of raising large families. This concern has not only
increased spousal communication about family size and contraceptive use but has also
encouraged Punjabi men to practice family planning. Most men now realize that either they
or their wives should use family planning. It is the next step, however, of translating
intention into practice, which is a challenge. Supply-side issues, including absence or
paucity of family planning services as well as poor quality of services (including service
providers’ lack of capability to manage side effects) are the main factors hindering
couples’ adoption of family planning. Perceived or experienced side effects of
contraceptive methods are other factors.
Men’s positive attitudes and their readiness to be involved in family planning programs
suggest that the efforts of convincing men to use contraceptives have been effective and
this it is now time for direct reproductive health interventions for men in Punjab. Yet
heavy spending on media campaigns may not be as effective as interpersonal interventions.
A focused effort to mobilize men through male-specific interventions is likely to increase
the demand for contraceptives. These interventions have to be backed up by improved
supply of contraceptives and availability of family planning services in accessible
facilities.

This study aims at exploring couples’ dynamics during their decision processes on their
fertility intentions and practices, along with community perceptions of male-focused
interventions as well as men’s suggestions for future intervention strategies.
The findings are based on three data sources. The primary data source is a 2013 qualitative
study in four districts of Punjab province. The second is a targeted analysis of the baseline
and endline surveys of the Family Advancement for Life and Health (FALAH 2007–2012)
project. 1 The third is the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (PDHS) of 1990–1991 2 and
of 2006–2007, which were used to assess trends over two decades.
The four districts of the 2013 qualitative study were Bahawalpur, Jhelum, D.G. 3 Khan, and
Okara. (The first three were FALAH districts in which interventions were tested, the fourth
the control district.) Twelve focus group discussions were conducted with men only, and
in-depth interviews were conducted with 26 couples, in these four districts in 2013.
Data from 2,649 men and 638 couples from the FALAH baseline and endline surveys in 14
selected districts of the FALAH project were reanalyzed to assess the impact of FALAH
male-directed interventions on fertility intentions and behavior.
Changes in men’s attitudes towards family planning:The study points to a real change in
men’s attitudes toward family planning in the Punjab and their readiness to be involved in
family planning programs, through increased access to information and services. Punjabi
men appeared to be more concerned about their fertility intentions and behavior than they
were in the early 1990s. Since men are considered the primary earners and decision-makers
in households in Pakistan, their primary motivating force is the growing economic
challenge leading to an inability to meet household costs. Both qualitative and quantitative
data confirm this change.
Increasing spousal communication aids decisions on fertility issues: Economic concerns
also provide leverage in improving communication between husbands and wives on family
size and contraceptive use. This pattern suggests it is no longer wives’ exclusive
responsibility to initiate discussions on their fertility intentions. Although there may be a
divergence in opinion on ideal family size and contraceptive use or choice of method,
increasing spousal communication makes it easier for women to convince their husbands
of the need for family planning. Follow-up discussions may be necessary, however, for
women to convince their husbands before they both reach full agreement.
Supply-side issues impede men from using contraceptives: The study emphasizes that
supply-side issues, including lack of availability of family planning services and
contraceptive methods, method failure, and contraceptive costs impede men from using

contraceptives, despite men’s increasing acceptance of family planning and spousal
communication. In addition, limited knowledge of specific family planning methods,
perceived or experienced side effects of modern methods, and lack of provider skills for
managing side effects, also act as barriers to family planning method use.
Definite receptiveness toward male group meetings: The study shows strong interest
among men for involvement in male-focused interventions in family planning programs. It
is evident from the FALAH endline survey that male group meetings have the greatest role
among FALAH interventions in changing couples’ fertility intentions and practices. Male
group meetings are suggested (by men and women) as the most appropriate intervention
for providing men with method-specific knowledge and for underlining the importance of
family planning use. Men see male group meetings as having potentially more impact than
women’s meetings, since educating and convincing the primary decision-makers
(husbands) results in concrete steps to be taken by men themselves for practicing family
planning. A suggested male group meeting strategy includes involving local persons to
organize meetings and an educated and skillful outsider (preferably a doctor) to conduct
them. The strategy also includes immediate provision of contraceptives after the meeting
so that men who want to start using contraception can do so.
Women favor involving religious leaders as an intervention more than men: Similar to
FALAH endline results, the 2013 qualitative study shows mixed opinions on involving
religious leaders in family planning programs, with women more in favor than men. Those
favoring this approach further suggest that religious leaders should be trained and should
discuss family planning with reference to the Quran and Hadith. Generally, this suggests
that religious leaders can and should play a supportive role by communicating and
endorsing the message that family planning is permitted in Islam.
The role of the media is limited: Men rarely appreciated the role of broadcast media in
communicating family planning messages, mainly due to the impression that neither
television nor radio can fulfill men’s need for details on contraceptive methods, which are
not deemed appropriate for these media. Women showed greater interest in interventions
through broadcast media and proposed that drama series on the topic should be broadcast
in local regional languages.
Demand for male health workers: Appreciating the role and effectiveness of the
government’s Lady Health Worker program, men suggested recruiting male health workers
in communities, with roles similar to lady health workers, providing services to men at
community level.
                                       CONCLUSION

Men in Punjab seem now more concerned about their fertility intentions and practices due
to the financial challenges of raising large families. This concern has not only increased
spousal communication about family size and contraceptive use but has also encouraged
Punjabi men to practice family planning. Most men now realize that either they or their
wives should use family planning. It is the next step, however, of translating intention into
practice, which is a challenge. Supply-side issues, including absence or paucity of family
planning services as well as poor quality of services (including service providers’ lack of

capability to manage side effects) are the main factors hindering couples’ adoption of
family planning. Perceived or experienced side effects of contraceptive methods are other
factors.
Men’s positive attitudes and their readiness to be involved in family planning programs
suggest that the efforts of convincing men to use contraceptives have been effective and
this it is now time for direct reproductive health interventions for men in Punjab.
Yet heavy spending on media campaigns may not be as effective as interpersonal
interventions. A focused effort to mobilize men through male-specific interventions is
likely to increase the demand for contraceptives. These interventions have to be backed up
by improved supply of contraceptives and availability of family planning services in
accessible facilities.
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS

•   In Punjab, men need to become the primary focus of family planning programs. Male-
    specific interventions are urgently required, and should be introduced, in order to
    augment men’s lack of knowledge of family planning methods, to encourage timely
    decisions on fertility issues, and to increase contraceptive use.
•   Men express the need for frequent male group meetings with full geographic coverage,
    facilitated by a local or community resident. They should be conducted by an “outside”
    health professional (preferably a doctor). Also, to minimize delay in contraceptive
    uptake, contraceptives should be made available at the end of these meetings.
•   Interventions involving religious leaders should play a supporting role in increasing
    acceptability of family planning among men. Such leaders should be trained to deliver
    messages that birth spacing and family planning are allowed in Islam.
•   Given the supply-side barriers to family planning use, regular supplies to clients should
    be assured.
•   Service providers should be knowledgeable and skillful, and should receive training on
    managing side effects.

             CHAPTER 1 — INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY
                                       BACKGROUND

Fertility in Pakistan has been above replacement level for most of its history, with levels
approaching seven births per woman in the 1960s, declining to around six in the 1980s and
then to its current level of 3.7 (Sathar, Royan and Bongaarts 2013). The declining trend has
been leveling off over the last five years, however, and Pakistan’s slackening in its fertility
transition is a cause of concern internationally, as well as within the country. High levels of
unmet need for family planning (FP) at 37 percent, coupled with a low contraceptive
prevalence rate of only 30 percent, are believed to be closely linked to both demand and
supply factors (Sathar, Royan and Bongaarts 2013). Concerns related to supply-side issues
range from the unavailability and inaccessibility of FP information and services to the
quality of the services themselves, including provider-client interactions (Sathar and Zaidi
2012). Decision-making within households—particularly the low levels of female
autonomy that hamper women in making decisions, and poor communication between
spouses, who may not necessarily agree on fertility intentions—may be an important
constraint for couples seeking FP services (Bongaarts et al. 2012).
Pakistan has a society that generally subordinates women to men. Studies repeatedly
identify the husband’s agreement as one of the most influential contributors to acceptance
of an FP method in rural and urban areas (Mahmood and Ringheim 1996; Tuloro et al.
2006). In male-dominated societies such as Pakistan, the decision-making power of the
husband—or his mother—may be critical for FP outcomes (Agha 2010). Whether actual or
perceived, men’s views and decision-making powers are important in seeking reproductive
health care ranging from delivery, antenatal care, immunizations, and especially FP
(Bongaarts et al. 2012; Khan et al. 2012; Agha 2010).
Assessing men’s views is difficult due to the dearth of data and infrequent use of men as
informants in health surveys and consultations. Although demographic health surveys
(DHS) have provided the worldwide public health community with comprehensive data on
knowledge, attitudes, and practices for reproductive health, only women of reproductive
age are usually interviewed for these surveys, except for the Pakistan DHS (PDHS) 1990–
1991, which had a special module for men (NIPS–Macro 1992). Men were not interviewed
in PDHS 2006–2007.
There are a few notable studies on the topic of men’s and couple’s decision-making in
Pakistan, largely based on PDHS 1990–1991 (Mahmood and Ringheim 1997; Kiani 2003)
and male data from two studies in Punjab in the 1990s (Casterline et al. 2001; Ali 1999).
All these studies emphasize the significance of involving men in FP programs and
enhancing spousal communication to increase contraceptive uptake. Furthermore, studies
on couples’ behaviors are especially illuminating, as differences between husbands and
wives may often be reasons for either inaction or inability to use contraception effectively
over time (Kazi and Sathar 1997; Population Council 1997; Mason and Smith 2000).
Considering the fact that “men’s participation and sharing of responsibility in the practice
of FP” was a recommendation of the 1994 International Conference on Population and
Development, the lack of practical and programmatic implementation of this


                                              1
recommendation within Pakistan needs to be addressed (Lasee and Becker 1997). A study
in southern Ethiopia creates a backdrop to our research interest when it states that “Family
planning programs should not only focus on women, but they should also address men…
Until recently, family planning programs have mainly focused on women’s attitudes and
behaviors” (Tuloro et al. 2006, p. 152).
The reason that researchers argue for this behavioral paradigm is the perception of women
as child bearers, and consequently, the primary recipients of information and education on
contraceptive knowledge and use. The attention given to them is not only considered their
prerogative, but also seen as more relevant than men’s contraceptive practices. Thus men’s
roles (who strongly influence the family’s decision-making in patriarchal societies) end up
ignored (Tuloro et al. 2006). Therein lies the weakness of most FP programs: an essential
center of agency in the dialectical process of decision-making is ignored because little or
no attention is paid to understanding men’s roles in the “effective utilization of
contraceptives.” The authors’ conclude, “Men also play a considerable role in the decision-
making process, which is a good argument for involving them in family planning
activities… Family planning programs should not focus only on women, but also address
men as principal stakeholders” (Tuloro et al. 2006, p. 158).
Studies have shown that one reason women give for nonuse (of FP methods) is the
husband’s disapproval. This sentiment is echoed in other developing societies where it has
been shown that the husband’s desires have an important effect on a couple’s fertility (e.g.,
Lasee and Becker 1997). A study on Pakistan published in 2006 sought to determine the
number of children considered “ideal” by husbands and the factors associated with that
view (Avan and Akhund 2006). The study was an attempt to specifically study male
perspectives on intended fertility. Furthermore, it urged that “Family planning programs
should focus on families as a whole unit of intervention rather than just focusing on wives”
(Avan and Akhund 2006). The authors cited an excessive focus on women as one of the
reasons for Pakistan’s slow progress in FP and an only slowly declining population growth
rate. Their study was cross-sectional and hence the respondents’ husbands could not be
followed up to see whether their view on the ideal number of children had translated into
reproductive behavior. Moreover, while the study focused on rural villages within
Khairpur district in Sindh, the authors indicated a need for a separate study that could
present an urban perspective as well.
Similarly, Agha (2010) highlighted the need to have complementary “target audiences,”
such as mothers-in-law and husbands in FP behavior change campaigns. He further
emphasized that programmatic investments in the future would prove futile without steps
to assess the “successes and failures of specific interventions”.
On male involvement, a qualitative study conducted by the Population Council, Islamabad
in 1997 gauged the perceptions, concerns, and needs of men in their involvement in
reproductive health in five districts of Punjab. The study highlighted that men were not
opposed to FP. However, their actual resistance seemed to exist mainly due to ignorance
(Ali 1999). The study also suggested a split between men’s awareness and knowledge of
FP: men had some awareness of FP topics but did not actually know about the variety of
methods available, or their use. Therefore, the need to provide information on side effects
and modes of action, and correct male misconceptions, was felt strongly (Ali 1999).


                                             2
Mahmood and Ringheim (1997) used data from PDHS 1990–1991 to identify factors
associated with desired fertility in Pakistan. Their findings led them to conclude that well-
planned efforts to educate men in reproductive and child health and to expedite inter-
spousal communication would help couples achieve their reproductive goals. Whereas the
attainment of a sustainable level of fertility presupposes an improvement in the status of
women—through education or otherwise—the authors felt that male involvement cannot
be ignored, and that “a lack of attention to men’s role in fertility is a shortcoming of
[PDHS].” They highlighted and reiterated the vantage point that needs to be adopted by
local organizations working in FP: “in the cultural context of Pakistan…all efforts in
promoting family planning require involving men” (Mahmood and Ringheim 1997).
The same authors in another study asserted that communication between a husband and
wife “has been found to be associated with favoring a fewer number of children and with
enhancing the practice of contraception” (Mahmood and Ringheim 1996). The authors also
discussed changes within the “family norm” that may be induced by an open discussion of
personal aspirations for children by couples. The importance of focusing on male agency is
clear since: “…many forms of contraception require partners’ participation or
concurrence… Past research also shows that the role of husbands in household and
reproductive decision-making is significant” (Mahmood and Ringheim 1996).
After establishing that greater husband–wife communication on FP among a range of
topics with gender dimensions can be conducive to advancing couples’ contraceptive use,
the authors highlighted certain areas that need to be examined in future demographic
studies. One of these was the “empirical examination” of the question as to whether
communication between husbands and wives promotes mutual agreement in family size
desires or not. The same authors pointed out a gap in the academic literature (pertaining to
FP) that needed to be addressed: “While it is true that interpersonal and community-based
communication approaches have not been widely tested in the field of FP in Pakistan,
small-scale studies have shown the potential for success and invite further exploration”
(Mahmood and Ringheim 1996).
In a qualitative study, exploring the choices of contraception and abortion among couples
living in a rural Punjabi village of Pakistan, Kamran et al. (2011) found a virtual absence
or very infrequent communication between husbands and wives on their fertility intentions,
particularly early in their reproductive lives. They emphasized that the lack of spousal
communication results in one spouse’s inability to understand fertility intentions and
desires of the other. This late initiation of discussion leads to later uptake of contraception
and unwanted pregnancies because of the delay in getting the husband’s approval. Spousal
communication appeared to have a close relationship with decision-making on
contraceptive use or with seeking abortions. The authors recommended promoting spousal
communication on family planning to encourage couples to discuss fertility intentions in
their early reproductive lives (Kamran et al. 2011).
Over a decade earlier, Lasee and Becker (1997) felt that previous studies had defined
communication in different ways while very few had used all three dimensions properly.
They problematized the notion of inter-spousal communication by introducing three
subvariables touching on different dimensions of effective communication leading to
agreement: approval; discussion between partners; and spousal perception of the partner’s


                                              3
approval of FP. They assumed that communication between spouses on FP discouraged
couples from having unwanted children and encouraged contraceptive use. Their study
results showed that both approval of FP and knowledge of sources of contraception had the
expected significant positive association with contraceptive use in bivariate analysis.
However, when the variables were analyzed in conjunction with the communication
variables in a multiple logistic regression, they found that the wife’s perception of her
spouse’s approval of FP was statistically significant, and emerged as the most powerful
variable in explaining contraceptive use—thus emphasizing the need for spousal
communication. These authors, too, argued that all FP communication efforts should target
men.
                                       OBJECTIVES

Most research on couples’ dynamics and reproductive intentions and behavior for Pakistan
dates from the 1990s—as just seen—underlining the need for a clearer grasp of current
realities. In particular, the views of men are required to assess whether men are a hindrance
for women wanting to use FP services and whether their assumed resistance is still real.
Fresh evidence is required on the differences between intentions and the future desire for
children, and views of contraception, between men and women and husbands and wives.
Also, as Pakistan sorely needs to reduce unmet need by improving contraceptive
prevalence, there is a need to assess whether men themselves require certain interventions
to improve their approval and uptake of family planning.
The four main objectives of this study were therefore to explore and analyze:

•   Differences between men and women regarding fertility intentions and practices;
•   Decision-making processes among couples regarding fertility intentions and practices;
•   Local community perceptions about male-focused interventions;
•   Local community suggestions and critiques for intervention strategies in the future.
This study seeks to explore the decision-making process of couples in the move from
fertility intentions to behavior. It also examines the readiness of men to be involved in FP
programs through different male-centered interventions. In-depth interviews (IDIs) with
couples are especially direct in gauging spousal perception of the partner’s FP approval or
disapproval. The study focuses on urban and semi-urban areas of Punjab and can be used,
at least indicatively, for interregional and temporal analyses within the Pakistani context.

                                      METHODOLOGY

Study Tools
The analysis uses data derived from the Population Council–led and USAID-funded
Family Advancement for Life and Health (FALAH 2007–2012) project, and data generated
through primary qualitative research for this study. The fieldwork was carried out in 2013.
FALAH was a national initiative to increase adoption of birth spacing (BS) behavior and
practices—with a new focus on men among other socially influential people. It ran in 15
districts in total. FALAH focused on communications interventions which included male


                                             4
group meetings, religious leaders’ (RLs’) involvement, and the media. Baseline and
endline surveys were carried out to assess the effect of the interventions.
In Punjab, FALAH implemented interventions in the districts of Bahawalpur, Rajanpur,
and D.G. Khan from southern Punjab and Jhelum from northern Punjab. Three of these
districts (Bahawalpur, D.G. Khan, and Jhelum) were selected for this study and a fourth,
non-FALAH district, Okara from central Punjab, was randomly chosen as a comparison.
Two rural communities and one urban community were chosen from every district.
Results of male interventions of FALAH provided the background for conducting this
qualitative study. These include insights and evidence of the impact of interventions
addressed to women (which enable them to communicate better with husbands),
interventions directed through the mass media at both men and women, and above all,
interventions addressed at men alone. Further analysis from the FALAH baseline and
endline data is also included in this report.
At the study design stage two themes were identified: one on inter-spousal communication
(ideal family size; decision-making on family size; and decision-making on contraceptive
use); and one on the role of interventions (whether respondents report knowing about any
prior interventions in FALAH districts; perceptions of male group meetings; involvement
of RLs/Ulema; media campaigns; and the role of lady health workers (LHWs) and male
mobilizers).
The following data collection tools were used to glean information and insights mainly
from men (and a few women) using largely qualitative techniques given the sensitivity
deemed to surround FP issues:
Focus group discussions (FGDs): Twelve FGDs were conducted with husbands across the
four selected districts in Punjab, in 2013. Of these, eight were conducted in rural settings,
and four in urban or semi-urban areas. The men were selected on the basis of their marital
status (married) and age (below 45 years). The discussions were centered on the need to
assess the nature and strength of their fertility intentions; whether they wanted to seek
more information on contraception and FP; whether they were influenced by religious or
community endorsement to uphold certain values; and whether the mass media influenced
their personal beliefs and values. Their views about potential interventions directed at men
were also noted.
The moderators were given guidelines (see Appendix D and E) for the FGDs and IDIs.
Although this gives the semblance of these instruments being formally structured, they
were implemented merely for interpretative purposes. The moderators exercised their
judgment to mold the discussion according to the context. FGDs were given precedence as
they helped to synthesize local community-based suggestions and critiques for intervention
strategies in the future. IDIs were conducted as complementary exercises and helped in an
understanding of inter-spousal decision-making processes on the desired or planned
number of children, contraceptive use, and FP at an experiential level.
IDIs: The research team conducted 26 IDIs with 26 couples (women and their husbands
separately) across the four districts in 2013. The criteria for selection were as follows:


                                             5
respondents had to be married, under 45 years of age, and have had at least one child alive.
Interviews with spouses were conducted simultaneously in different rooms to prevent
interactions that could skew how information was provided.
Key informants: The respondents for IDIs and FGDs were identified by key informants in
their respective communities. These informants belonged to district health and population
departments and nongovernmental organizations working at grassroots level. Their
involvement helped eliminate or diminish any barriers to trust among respondents, given
the sensitive nature of the topics.
Profiling: At the time of the interviews community profiles were created through semi-
structured questionnaires to gauge essential development indicators of the communities.
This profile assessed markers such as population, number of households, health facilities,
general economic situation, and women’s economic activities (Appendix A).
Respondent Recruitment
IDI respondents, as said, had to meet the minimum selection criteria of being married, aged
under 45, and have had at least one child. 4 The need for at least one living child was
essential as the study examined inter-spousal communication regarding the desired/actual
number of children and contraception usage status. Gauging these factors is relatively
challenging with couples who are childless or just married.
FGD participants were identified and assembled by local key informants in their
communities. It would in fact have been impossible to conduct FGDs without them. The
discussions themselves were held at neutral locations in the community where everyone
would be able to assemble without facing external disturbances. On average, 10
respondents took part in discussions. The minimum criterion of at least one child was
eliminated for the FGDs as a generalized community-based response was sought.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations were taken into account while conducting field research to ensure
that respondents would not be at risk at any stage. The protocol was approved by the
Population Council’s Internal Review Board in New York. All participation by
respondents at all stages was voluntary and based on informed consent (Appendix B and
C).
All participants were briefed on the identity of moderators and transcribers, the Population
Council’s background, the purpose and benefits of the study, and the interview process.
They were told that their names would not be used anywhere and that the Council was
merely interested in recording their ideas and suggestions so as to incorporate them in a
potential intervention strategy in the future.
Apart from confidentiality, interviews were conducted after gaining permission from
respondents at a time and place convenient for them. Moreover, keeping in view the local
mores and patterns of interaction between members of the opposite sex, moderators and


4
    Despite the “under-45” criterion, the sample still included some slightly older respondents.


                                                         6
participants always belonged to the same gender. Interviews were held in the local
language.
Data Recording and Processing for Analysis
Raw audio data were recorded with participant consent using digital recorders that allowed
playback for transcription. All transcribers had social science backgrounds and were
present throughout the interactions. They supplemented the audio data with written notes.
Recorded files were transferred to computers daily and managed in a systematic manner by
assigning a unique identification number to each field interview. The research team
transcribed the recordings from Punjabi/Urdu to English immediately after returning from
the field, to ensure that data were preserved and documented while still fresh in the
researchers’ minds. A matrix of responses on the main themes of the interviews and
discussion was constructed in MS Excel after the transcriptions were complete, and was
filled in by members of the qualitative research team for analysis.
Study Limitations
Only two or three couples could be interviewed per community due to funding and time
limitations. Increasing the numbers of interviews would have enhanced the reliability of
the field of responses. Another challenge—inherent to the topic—was participants’
hesitation to talk about certain aspects of fertility behavior: although most showed no
hesitation in discussing the number of children they had or possible intervention strategies,
often a degree of resistance was felt whenever the couple’s decision-making processes
were discussed, or whenever the interviewers probed whether it was the wife or the
husband who initiated the discussion. There was also some general information, especially
on the number of children and their exact ages, which proved challenging to recall—a
problem more pronounced among male respondents during IDIs.

     CHAPTER 2 — FERTILITY INTENTIONS, COMMUNICATION,
              AND DECISION-MAKING ABOUT FP
This chapter focuses on the fertility intentions and the decision-making process leading to
contraceptive use with a special emphasis on inter-spousal communication. It begins with
fertility intentions and behaviors from PDHS 1990–1991 (for men and women in Punjab),
PDHS 2006–2007 (for women in Punjab), and the 2012 FALAH national endline survey.
The main findings, however, come from this 2013 qualitative study in four districts of
Punjab. While FALAH data were used to establish overall reproductive patterns, the
qualitative analysis explains the consistencies and differences observed in the quantitative
analysis among men and women, in reporting their fertility intentions and behavior. The
qualitative data were collected via 26 IDIs and 12 FGDs.

                            FINDINGS FROM PDHS AND FALAH

The findings of the FALAH endline survey suggest that the majority of men and women of
Punjab desired no more children; this figure had risen in two decades from 34 percent to
61 percent for men, and from 41 percent to 53 percent for women, marking a much more
prominent change in men’s desires (Table 1). In 2012 men in FALAH districts of Punjab
actually had a stronger preference than women to avoid additional children, while
women’s desires for controlling fertility were stronger in 1990–91. Surprisingly, PDHS
1990–91 data show higher FP approval among men than women.
Conversely, according to the FALAH endline survey, although men were slightly less
likely to approve of FP than women, more than 82 percent approved when the question
was framed as birth spacing rather than limiting. It was also observed that men, in the
smaller sample interviewed, were more likely to report contraceptive use (43 percent) than
women (37 percent), echoing the 1990–91 pattern. A systematic increase in contraceptive
use is observed among women, from 13 percent in PDHS 1990–91, 33.2 percent in PDHS
2006–07, and 36.7 percent in FALAH 2012.

Although individuals’ fertility desires and intentions may vary among men and women,
convergence between husbands and wives is a prerequisite for converting intentions into
behavior, as it increases the chances of translating desires into reality. Table 2 suggests that


                                                 8
the number of couples for which husbands and wives want the same number of children
has increased.
Another encouraging change is husbands wanting fewer children than their wives: it has
increased from 5 percent to 8 percent. In addition, according to the FALAH endline
survey, about 18 percent of wives did not have a specific number in mind and/or were
unaware of their husbands’ desired number. This proportion was almost half that in 1991,
so this change also suggests a gradual trend of increasing spousal communication. Overall,
52 percent of wives from the FALAH endline survey reported that their desired number of
children was the same as their husbands’ (a small shift up from 47 percent in the PDHS
1991, but down from PDHS 2006–07). Of these couples, two-thirds desired four children
or fewer (data not shown).

                             FINDINGS FROM THE FGDS AND IDIS

The 2013 qualitative study showed a wide divergence in reported ideal family size across
districts. In Jhelum and Okara, the desired family size was about two to four children,
compared with four to seven in Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan. Men and women generally
considered four or five children as a “small family size” in the latter districts. Four children
was the ideal for the majority of the men and women interviewed. Furthermore, there was
no difference in the ideal family size across urban and rural settings of northern and
southern Punjab.
       I think two children are enough; inflation is too high and expenses are not bearable. FGD,
       Rural Okara

Interestingly, desired family size for women was higher than for men in all the Punjab
districts—a result similar to the FALAH endline findings. The main reason driving a
higher desired number of children was the desire to have a son, or to have a pair of sons or
daughters.



                                                   9
       My husband wants four children. He says that if God gives him one son, even that will be
       enough. I have three daughters, and I wanted two more sons. IDI, woman with 3 children,
       Rural Bahawalpur

Respondents also shared their reasons for their ideal family size(s) during FGDs and IDIs.
Both male and female respondents desiring (perceived) smaller family size were driven by
economic concerns.
       Islam generally advises you to spread your seed and have children. However, if we look at
       the conditions of a poor man, I would say that two to three children are okay. FGD, Rural
       Jhelum

The desire to provide good health, education, and other basic necessities to their children
was a strong force leading to the desire for small families.
       Financial problems are a strong reason in the minds of people that convince them to try out
       family planning. Let us suppose that there is a small family comprising two children. They
       will only be able to survive if they earn 500 to 700 rupees daily. The other reason is
       education. IDI, man with 4 children, Rural Jhelum

While these views were generally shared by respondents from Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan,
a few FGD respondents also justified their desire for more children on religious grounds.
The concept of having a pair of boys or girls and having more children due to a fear of loss
of any existing children was also reported by some respondents.
       I think children are blessings from God. I am in favor of having four to five children. FGD,
       Rural Bahawalpur
       Parents think their children would be a support in their [the parents’] old age. God forbid, if a
       person has only one child who becomes ill or has some problem/abnormality or dies, it
       would be very difficult for him to propagate his lineage. IDI, man with 2 children, Rural
       Okara

There was a divergence between husbands and wives over the desired number of children.
In many cases, wives or husbands compromised their reproductive desires and accepted the
desire of their spouses. Men seemed to accept their wives’ wishes quite often, as women
desired more children than their husbands.
       Initially, it was two children [initial planned number of children]. But then the third one came
       along. It was my wife’s wish; she used to say that he did not have a brother [referring to the
       older son]. IDI, man with 3 children, Urban Jhelum
       I think three children are enough. My wife wants to have one more child. She wants to have
       a couple of sons and daughters. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur

The desire to complete a pair of boys or girls and family pressure from mothers-in-law and
relatives were also mentioned as reasons for the differences between actual and ideal
family size.
       When alone, even a tree does not look good. One should have at least a couple of brothers
       who can share happiness and sorrows [dukh such]. And one should also have at least a
       couple of sisters who can share happiness, sorrows, and others’ problems. FGD, Rural
       Bahawalpur
       We wanted only two children but ended up with four because of my mother-in-law. After
       having three children my seven-year old daughter used to weep about not having a sister.
       Even though we were using condoms at that time, one got ruptured, and I became
       pregnant. IDI, woman with 4 children, Rural Okara
       I have two daughters and a son, so I would wish for another son so that I have a pair of
       each. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Okara

Gender Differences in Views on FP
Supporting the findings of the FALAH endline survey, a majority of male FGD
respondents across the four districts (three FALAH and one non-FALAH district) were in
favor of FP. They commonly claimed that all men talk openly about issues pertaining to
FP. This was especially evident when men spoke without hesitation irrespective of their
rural or urban backgrounds. The FGD and IDI findings presented overwhelming evidence
that adverse economic circumstances and reduced purchasing power were the main reasons
compelling men to think about and accept FP.
       Yes, the men are in favor of family planning. Since the condition of our country is very bad,
       men are compelled to think that there should be fewer children. IDI, woman with 4
       children, Rural Okara

During an IDI, a respondent shared his own views about other men in the community.
       I have not seen anyone against it so far. In these circumstances, men are mostly in favor of
       birth spacing. My friends also have the same opinion and they say that it is better to have a
       gap between births. And since girls nowadays are also well aware and educated, they know
       the benefits of birth spacing. Not only is it beneficial for me, but also for my other half. IDI,
       man with 1 child, Rural Okara

Different Motivating Factors for Men and Women
Given that both men and women appeared to be concerned about fertility issues (as the
previous discussion suggests), it becomes important to examine the difference in factors
that motivate them to consider and initiate these discussions with their spouses. Concerns
about poverty were mentioned as major motivating factors in almost all districts by both
men and women for at least temporarily limiting family size and adopting contraception.
       Poverty is the major motivating reason. You must have seen that it is difficult to afford more
       than two kilograms of flour. I am just a laborer, so my income is quite low. Income levels are
       not proportionate to the level of inflation. How are we going to feed ourselves if we have a
       large number of children? IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur

Reduced purchasing power and rising expenses of rearing children and their schooling also
emerged as important motivating factors for both men and women across the districts.
       One needs to take care of the children as well, and that is obvious. It is no use giving birth
       to children if you cannot bring them up properly. FGD, Urban Jhelum
       People think if they have a larger number of children, they will not be able to provide them
       with good educational opportunities and also, they will not have a chance to raise them with
       a good living standard. FGD, Urban Bahawalpur
       The children I already have are enough (five). They will get a good education that way.
       There are problems associated with education. After all, children incur expenses. They will
       have a good education, and if you have a moderate number of children, it becomes easier
       to handle them - it is easier to bring them up. Everything becomes easier. The more children
       you have, the greater the extent of division in your property. These problems carry
       themselves with you for the rest of your life. IDI, man with 5 children, Rural Okara

Maternal and child health were mentioned more by women but also by men as a
motivation for FP.
       In poor households, women do not have much food to eat to ensure their own health. When
       a woman produces two or three children, she becomes weak and fragile. In the end, she
       thinks about sterilization; that it is the solution not only for her health, but also for her
       children’s health and their upbringing. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan



                                                      11
Child rearing and women’s health concerns were mentioned more by men during the IDIs
stating their own realities. For example, a male respondent mentioned how his wife had
convinced him to use FP by expressing her concerns:
       She used to talk about routine matters; the children’s cleanliness, bathing them, putting
       them to sleep. She said she was sleep deprived because of the children. When my wife got
       fed up of looking after the children, dressing them properly, ironing their clothes, maintaining
       the house, and keeping them (the children) clean and neat, she used to tell me that we
       should stop having children. IDI, man with 6 children, Urban D.G. Khan

The role of relatives (other than the husband) such as the mother-in-law and other kin was
also mentioned.
       Social pressure comes mainly from relatives. They will consider themselves socially
       stronger if they have more children, and will have an upper hand and look down upon you.
       FGD, Urban Okara

Continuation of the lineage through sons was another driving force for having more
children.
       I wanted about two or three children. We have tried a lot, but these things are not in our
       control. Now we have five daughters. Yes, there is a specific pressure within the household.
       My brother recently had a son and now my parents have started discriminating against me
       and taunting me (that my brother has a son and I do not). FGD, Rural Jhelum
       There is another pressure, that if a couple has a first child and it is a daughter, then they will
       continue to produce (four to five) children until they have a son. … In my neighborhood, a
       couple has six daughters and all of them were conceived with the hope of a son. They say
       they will stop having children as soon as they have a son. FGD, Urban Okara

Initiation of Discussion about FP Use
The above motivating factors compel men and women to think about their fertility
intentions. Their intentions cannot be converted into behavior unless they talk about it with
their spouse. The FGDs and IDIs suggest that communication exists between spouses on
family size and contraceptive use in all districts, although there was a mixed response
about who initiated the communication. The nature of this response varied through districts
as well as urban and rural settlements. Most FGD respondents and a few IDI respondents
mentioned that women usually initiate discussions on determining FP or using
contraceptives. Men and women alike said that women are more concerned with family
size and the use of contraceptives because the burden of child rearing falls mainly on
women. They also have the responsibility of managing the household with limited
economic resources, and possess a greater realization about the significance of these issues
as a result of female-focused interventions.
       My wife started this discussion about family planning because she no longer had the will to
       bear more children at this point and said I should use the withdrawal method. IDI, man with
       1 child, Rural Bahawalpur
       I initiated the discussion. I think women initiate the discussion because they know that they
       have to run the house and manage food and clothes for their children. The woman takes
       care of these things; men just earn. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural Jhelum
       My wife initiated the conversation and I agreed with her as we have limited resources. FGD,
       Urban Jhelum




                                                      12
A majority of men and women from IDIs stated that men initiated discussion on family
size and contraceptive use because the responsibility of earning falls on men, and that only
men make decisions on household matters in male-dominated societies.
       I started the discussion with my wife about the number of children because I have to bear all
       the expenses. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural D.G. Khan
       It is a male-dominated society. Women do not have any say in decision-making. FGD, Rural
       D.G. Khan
       The man guides the woman in this situation. He takes her into confidence by discussing the
       issue with her. FGD, Urban Bahawalpur

A third opinion emerged from the FGDs, that: either the husband or the wife can initiate
the discussion; the person who suffers or experiences more problems takes the lead; and
that starting it also depends on awareness and exposure. According to several respondents,
it does not matter who initiates the discussion. Men generally take the initiative if
economic concerns are strong, and women if there is a serious health concern or an issue
with taking care of the children or household responsibilities.
       Couples automatically start thinking about family planning after the first child if they are
       sensible and educated. People should have a planned number of children even if they
       possess (ample) resources. If a man wants to “tease” his family, he will have many children.
       Otherwise, he will think about family planning (The respondent used the word “tease” to
       imply someone causing discomfort). FGD, Urban Okara
       A husband initiates the topic if he gets tired and thinks he is unable to meet the expenses of
       the household. A wife initiates the conversation if she gets tired and cannot take care of the
       children. These are the two common situations (which motivate people to initiate such
       discussions). FGD, Urban Bahawalpur

Although few, some respondents from D.G. Khan (three FGDs) and only one female (IDI)
in Jhelum mentioned that educated couples and those with greater awareness are more
concerned about family size or birth spacing and are more likely to discuss these issues
with each other.
       Those who are aware of family planning do discuss it. Some literate people think we need to
       give a “perfect product” [educated children] to society; such people think about and discuss
       family planning. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan
       Both men and women have the faculty of thought and consider the fact that they want a
       good education and living standard for their children. Whoever [husband or wife] has greater
       awareness initiates the discussion. FGD, Rural Jhelum

A considerable part of the men and women in almost all places stated during the IDIs
(males 9 of 26 and females 13 of 26 IDI respondents) and FGDs (8 of 12 FGD) that they
initiated the discussion about the issue of FP after having their first or second child. A few
IDI respondents (6 of 52, men and women) from Bahawalpur, Okara, and Jhelum said that
they started discussing these plans just after getting married and even before the wife’s first
pregnancy. One man from Bahawalpur said that his wife started using pills just after
getting married in order to delay her first pregnancy and that it was done with mutual
consent.
       Two days after we got married, we had a discussion about having children. We decided not
       to rush into it and wait a year. Then, we got pills from a local doctor. She [my wife] took
       three strips of pills for a gap of nine months. She started taking pills three days after our
       marriage. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur




                                                    13
Still fewer men and women (4 of 52 IDI respondents) reported that they began the
discussion on the issue of FP or desired family size after having three or four children.
       We thought we should practice birth spacing [due to inflation] after the birth of our youngest
       child [the fourth child]. That is why we are now using condoms. IDI, man with 4 children,
       Rural D.G. Khan

The combined responses suggest a pattern: women and even men are now concerned and
plan their fertility even at the beginning of their marital life. Though the gap between
fertility intention and behavior is wide due to many factors, they have started being more
concerned and discussing these issues.
       My wife mentioned that our child was only two and a half years old, and still young. I told her
       that it was up to her [to use FP methods]. I stayed for two to three months, and then
       returned after another one and a half to two years [abroad]. This is how a gap of four years
       was maintained. It was my wife’s desire to increase the gap a bit. IDI, man with 3 children,
       Urban Jhelum

The Road to Contraceptive Use
Further exploration was required to assess whose thoughts dominated the final decision,
and how long it took to actually start using contraceptives. Men in FGDs (6 of 12) and
IDIs (4 of 26) admitted that despite living in a male-dominated society, women often
persuaded them of the woman’s desired number of children and contraceptive methods
when the couple’s thoughts differed. Men further explained that it was not easy for them to
agree, but that women eventually managed to make their husbands agree with them. The
discussions also suggested that if women keep on repeating their point of view, men
eventually agree.
       For two months, she kept on disturbing me by being angry, beating the children, bad
       cooking, and irregularity in performing household chores. Finally, she made me agree and I
       permitted her to get sterilization. FGD, Rural Bahawalpur

Men also reported that the number of living children (particularly sons) empowered
women because children are considered a guarantee against being thrown out of husbands’
houses.
       I told my wife she must not get sterilized. She said she would go to the hospital for the
       procedure anyway. Then I threatened to marry another woman. She said it would not matter
       to her as she already had children which are blessings from God. She gave me permission
       for a second marriage because she knew she had children for support. FGD, Rural
       Bahawalpur

The majority of the IDIs showed that wives convinced their husbands to use
contraceptives. In two cases in D.G. Khan, men reported that their wives did not even
inform them before using contraception: one respondent’s wife consulted her cousin and
started using injectable contraceptives; the other’s informed him after having herself
sterilized. These examples suggest that women can make independent decisions to use
contraception, even if the husband may not fully approve of the decision.
       She did not discuss anything with me before sterilization. She got herself sterilized when
       she was at her parents’ home. After having the operation done, she called and told me that
       she had had herself sterilized. I said to her, “You should have gotten my permission and
       had a discussion with me.” IDI, man with 6 children, Rural D.G. Khan

       She consulted her cousin who is living here. He recommended the injection for my wife. IDI,
       man with 3 children, Rural D.G. Khan

The majority of women, however, require their husband’s consent to use contraception. In
fact, without a husband’s agreement, access to contraceptives is harder. Women usually
initiate discussions, they try to convince their husbands, and most of them succeed—or
contraceptive use is a mutual decision. Either way, the positive and supportive role of the
husband is prominent.
       Without the consent of the wife, a man cannot do anything. If both agree, then they will use
       any method they want. FGD, Rural Bahawalpur
       I think women start it [discussion] first. So, you have to accept your wife’s demands. Women
       convince their husbands. FGD, Rural Okara

Factors Impeding Men: Unmet Need for FP
Still, what about those cases when husbands are not convinced? A common situation
reported in FGDs and IDIs was husbands’ disagreement or non-consensus on a particular
contraceptive method. Moreover, religious concerns, particularly on methods used for
limiting family size, were also mentioned as barriers to FP.
Approving FP does not necessarily mean that all husbands will allow their wives to use
contraceptives. In one of the FGDs in rural Bahawalpur, the husband’s disapproval was
mentioned as an obstacle to using contraceptives as a birth-limiting method. One FGD
respondent elaborated:
       I have told you that the woman [neighbor] did not want to bear more children and wanted to
       get sterilized, but her husband warned her not to go to the hospital for sterilization. She
       discussed the issue with me and forced me [to take her]. Then, I took her to the hospital [on
       a motorbike] for sterilization. FGD, Rural Bahawalpur
       My husband is not against family planning, but he does not like family planning methods
       [due to a fear of side effects]. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural Okara

Religion
Religion was not a strong constraint to men using FP—only a small minority of men (2 of
26 IDIs and 3 of 12 FGDs) reported that it was. One IDI view was against modern
contraceptive methods, while the other IDI view considered FP to be against nature but a
part of social practice and constituting a need—but both respondents were using FP. (One
was practicing the withdrawal method and the other’s wife was using injectable
contraceptives.)
From the point of view of women, two respondents from D.G. Khan and Okara reported
that their husbands were not against FP, but were against modern methods, particularly
sterilization, which they regarded as against their religion.
       I think that FP is against the laws of nature. However, you can say that using contraception
       has more to do with social norms [dunyadari]. IDI, man with 6 children, Rural D.G. Khan
       My husband says that you can use any method but sterilization as it is a sinful act. IDI,
       woman with 6 children, Rural D.G. Khan

Similarly in rural D.G. Khan, respondents said that that most men are against FP on
religious grounds. However, it was stated in later discussions with men in this community


                                                    15
that a considerable number of men and women were practicing FP. During these group
discussions, respondents sometimes shared the views of others who were not in favor of
FP.
       People think that newborns bring bread and butter with them. You were not able to earn
       when you were a child but even then, you have grown up. Similarly, these children will also
       grow. Why should we stop child bearing—it is a sin. People argue that children should be
       produced. It is interference with nature to prevent fertility. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan

FP Services
Other reasons were cited for not using contraceptive methods, including non-availability,
experienced and perceived side effects, contraceptive failure, and cost. Men said that apart
from LHWs, there was no information source for them at community level. According to a
few FGDs as well as IDIs, in recent years the involvement of LHWs in the labor-intensive
polio eradication campaigns has diverted their time and attention and rendered them unable
to fully perform their primary duties as LHWs.
In two FGDs (urban D.G. Khan and rural Bahawalpur), the discussions centered on the
point that most contraceptive methods are for women and thus the burden of use is on
women. Those FGDs also heard that it was stated that all interventions for FP are aimed at
women, as a result of which husbands remain largely unaware and cannot take initiatives
themselves. In addition, they do not value the information their wives give them. The
respondents further explained that due to men’s limited knowledge of methods, arguments
arise between husbands and wives about contraceptive use.
       There should be a man who takes the initiative to start discussions and give information
       about family planning. In our houses, there is usually a clash of opinions (between a
       husband and a wife on contraceptive use) because the wife has a better understanding of
       family planning thanks to the LHWs; men have no such knowledge. FGD, Rural
       Bahawalpur

Issues of uneven contraceptive supply at community level also came up in two
communities of Bahawalpur, one urban community of D.G. Khan, and one rural
community of Okara. According to community members, the diversion of LHWs’ scope of
work from FP services to the polio campaign presented non-availability generally of
contraceptives as a barrier, as was their lack at nearby static health facilities.
       After the birth of my third child, I asked my husband to use something (family planning
       method). He refused (he did not want to use condoms or withdrawal and was also against
       female sterilization) and asked me to use a method instead. Then I asked an LHW to
       provide injectables but she said she received just one injectable every month and had
       already given it to someone else. I tried the hospital (BHU) three times but they said they
       were short of injectables and/or syringes. I could not go there again as it is hard to leave
       house and there is no one to accompany me. [As a result] I am pregnant again. Methods
       should always be available at hospitals so that women never find themselves in these
       situations. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural Okara

Side Effects
Experienced or perceived side effects were highlighted in all FGDs and most of the IDIs,
both in urban and rural areas as barriers to using contraceptives. Male respondents stated
that methods such as pills, injectables, intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs), and




                                                   16
female sterilization all have severe side effects for women. Irregularity in the menstrual
cycle, obesity, and anemia were commonly mentioned.
       Women face bleeding problems due to the injection. After a month, the menses cycle is
       natural, but the injectable disturbs the menstrual cycle. It is very threatening for a woman.
       FGD, Rural D.G. Khan
       She (my wife) faced severe prolonged menstrual problems and it affected her health. She
       was not in good health very often then. IDI, man with 6 children, Urban D.G. Khan
       My friend’s wife used an injectable to avoid unwanted pregnancies, but was surprised to find
       her pregnant some days later. He now believes all such things [contraceptives] are
       ineffective. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan

A few respondents also mentioned the cost of managing the side effects of contraceptive
methods. Participants said the whole experience is useless if they used FP for economic
concerns but then had to bear a heavy cost for treating side effects.
       People faced side effects after using various family planning methods and cannot afford the
       cost for side effect management. People believe that family planning can lead to many
       diseases. FGD, Rural Bahawalpur

       CHAPTER 3 — READINESS AND RECEPTIVENESS OF MEN
            TOWARD MALE-FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS
                                                BACKGROUND

The FALAH project was designed to tackle the major obstacles leading to high levels of
unmet need and low FP use in primarily rural areas across the four districts. Among
FALAH’s major initiatives in its communication and mobilization strategy was a focus on
addressing men and husbands as primary audiences, given that they are major influencers
at community and household levels. The strategy used mass media and interpersonal
communication to provide information to men and to prompt them to use FP services. The
indirect influence of RLs on men was used through the training of local pesh Imams 5 to
include messages in Friday sermons.
Analysis of findings from the quantitative evidence in the FALAH baseline and endline
evaluation and from 2013’s qualitative study—for the impact on attitudes, approval, and
behavior of individual male interventions—suggests that interventions in general and
male-focused interventions in particular played an important role in shaping the fertility
behavior of couples.
The FALAH survey findings related to comparisons of the impacts of, above all,
interventions addressed to men alone; targeted at women (enabling them to communicate
better with their husbands); and directed through the mass media at men and women. Some
relevant results of these surveys of 638 couples are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5
comparing data of couples who were exposed to the interventions with those not exposed
to them.
             EFFECT OF MALE-CENTERED INTERVENTIONS ON FERTILITY INTENTIONS
                         AND BEHAVIOR—EVIDENCE FROM FALAH

The approval of FP increased over four years (Table 3). Male group meetings (MGMs)
seem to be highly effective in increasing approval of FP by men. Unfortunately there were
only 16 men in MGMs. Group meetings for women and visits by LHWs also proved to be
agents for changing couples’ approval of FP. Interventions through the media or RLs’
sermons had less impact on changing couples’ perspectives. (These findings concur with
the findings of the FGDs and IDIs, which strongly endorsed group meetings and person to
person interactions to gain FP approval and to spread information.)

A decline in the desire to have more children was noted in all groups (Table 4). MGMs
seemed to be effective in changing the behavior of men and ultimately helped couples limit
their family size compared with those who did not attend them. The MGMs and attendance
at Friday religious sermons also played an important role in lowering the desire to have
more children among couples. Media interventions, particularly television, did not. (This
again largely ties in with the qualitative findings.)

The role of interventions such as MGMs in increasing contraceptive use was very strong
(Table 5). This paralleled the need expressed in the FGDs and IDIs for men to get direct
information in group settings.

     MEN’S READINESS TO BE INVOLVED IN FP PROGRAMS—EVIDENCE FROM FGDS
                                  AND IDIS

This qualitative study of 2013 was designed to examine some of the responses to these
interventions in three FALAH districts of Punjab and to explore what men require in the
way of interventions directed at them. Similar questions were asked in Okara, which had
no such interventions.
Further exploration of the role of interventions, particularly those that were male focused
(notably MGMs, those involving RLs, and media campaigns) was a main objective of the
qualitative study. Therefore the FGDs and IDIs sought local perceptions and suggestions
on different types of interventions, from men and women, and explored other suggestions
from men and women.



                                                 21
Most men (in 4 of 12 FGDs and 22 of 26 IDI respondents) from all four districts expressed
strong FP desire. Further, they stated the need to be involved in FP programs through
interventions. They believed that women have been the focus of all interventions to date,
which has no doubt raised their awareness of FP but has also shifted the entire burden of
FP adoption and use to them. However, according to women it is essential to involve men
and to ensure that these programs are successful because men are the real decision-makers
in this male-dominated society.
       Motivating men is like word-of-mouth marketing. If I have some information about family
       planning, I can transfer it to other people more easily than women can as they have limited
       mobility. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan
       No matter how much a woman is motivated, there is no way she would willingly adopt family
       planning methods unless her husband agrees to it. A method can only be adopted when
       both concerned parties talk to each other about it. FGD, Urban Bahawalpur

Women also emphasized that such interventions require that a major knowledge gap on
contraceptive methods be filled.
       A program initiated through men will be more effective. Seventy percent of Pakistan’s
       population lives in the rural areas. The remaining thirty percent resides in urban centers.
       Such programs can be initiated through men and women with the same kind of impact. But
       the same success in rural areas can only be achieved if men in those areas are properly
       motivated. FGD, Urban Bahawalpur

Interventions through MGMs
The majority of respondents in FGDs (12 of 12) and IDIs (36 of 52) displayed a strong
interest in intervention through MGMs. Variation across districts and rural–urban areas
was negligible. However, perspectives and concerns varied across communities.
Even in Okara (a non-FALAH district) men, unprompted, mentioned the need for such
meetings. Almost all of them felt that MGMs were the best way to convey FP information
to men. Most of the men stated that MGMs could be very helpful in passing on specific FP
messages.
       I think there should be a gathering of a large number of people and that they should be told
       of the threats of not planning their families. Many people feel shy attending small gatherings
       (or one-to-one meetings). You should arrange the meeting and brief them about the
       possibilities of threats and the cons of not practicing or listening to these instructions which
       are for their own benefit. FGD, Rural Jhelum
       There should be separate meetings for men and women. They should be told everything
       about childbirth and spacing. They should be told about the different facilities and methods
       available for birth spacing. FGD, Rural Okara

In most communities, men highlighted the importance of MGMs by comparing them with
women’s meetings. Men believed that MGMs could be more effective and beneficial than
women’s group meetings because women cannot do anything nor decide on anything if the
men are not persuaded.
       There should be more meetings for men. A woman cannot do anything and is helpless. If
       there will be more meetings with men, this will be useful for their women as well. If you
       conduct a meeting once a month consistently, the message will gradually be conveyed
       effectively. Even if someone does not have any medicine, he can be prescribed that
       medicine which can be obtained from the market. FGD, Rural Okara

Similar to the responses from FGDs with men, the majority of men and women
interviewed in the IDIs from all four districts were in favor of MGMs.


                                                     22
         Yes, we have a male-dominated society. The family planning program will yield excellent
         results and success via a men-to-men policy (men motivating men). FGD, Rural D.G. Khan
         The door-to-door approach is not possible in the case of men. There should be a separate
         place where meetings can be held to educate men. One man should deliver a lecture on the
         topic to a local gathering of men. People should be educated on this matter in the form of a
         group. It would be more effective. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur

They felt that such meetings should be held to educate and motivate men as men generally
lack knowledge on FP methods and do not know how or where to procure contraceptives.
Moreover, they are the main decision-makers at the household level for many issues,
including fertility.
         It is the male who has the decision-making power in our area. Women are not heard from
         until their husbands are convinced. IDI, man with 6 children, Urban D.G. Khan

Men from Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan also said that public gatherings/MGMs would be
effective for people who did not have access to FP information, and that they would
propagate awareness among the male population. These views came across repeatedly
from male respondents in each district during the IDIs. This general perception about the
success of MGMs was also endorsed by male respondents who had already attended such
meetings under the FALAH interventions.
         These meetings proved to be very helpful. My husband’s views were different after
         attending the meeting. It was very helpful for us, and we learnt which methods were easy to
         use. Therefore, we discussed it with one another. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural
         Jhelum
         These meetings are very helpful for men. They (the hosts) put forward suggestions in the
         meetings. They also told us about different methods and how to use IUCDs and condoms.
         Some people learnt the entire procedure from them. My husband’s views were different after
         attending the meeting. We knew which method was easy to use. IDI, woman with 3
         children, Rural Jhelum

Proposed Strategy for Male Group Meetings
Respondents were asked about the ideal strategy for holding these meetings, including how
they should be organized, who should conduct them, and potential outcomes. The most
prominent suggestion during the FGDs with men was to hold these meetings regularly. In
the IDIs, men (20 of 26) suggested that meetings be organized near their localities or
within their villages so that everybody could participate easily. Men were quite specific
and suggested men gather at a prearranged spot to discuss FP and BS.
         There should be a work plan according to which it must be announced that a meeting will be
         held at a specific time and place, where a man would deliver a lecture on family planning
         and the various issues pertaining to it. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur
         The whole point is managing the population. Instead of conducting the meetings in their
         offices twice a week [referring to the Family Welfare Center in the area], they should do the
         same in some village. There should be a list telling them that the meeting next week will be
         in the village so and so. They should proceed by putting a “manji” at the center of the
                   7
         “chowk.” IDI, man with 7 children, Rural Okara)

In comparison, men and women alike from the urban areas of Jhelum district emphasized
the need for having female group meetings parallel to the men’s to promote couples’
communication. Several respondents argued that, even though male meetings are very

crossing.

important, there should be group meetings for women as well. This would simultaneously
bridge the gap of communication and decision-making among couples.
       It would be easier for women who cannot convince their husbands if there is a meeting for
       men on one side and a meeting for women on the other. IDI, woman with 3 children,
       Urban Jhelum
       There should be a program which can be introduced for (both) men and women as this
       problem is faced by both sexes. There would have been no need to ask anyone had it been
       only one gender’s problem. IDI, man with 2 children, Urban Jhelum

In response to the question “Who should conduct these meetings?” the majority of FGD
and IDI respondents from all districts suggested community-level meetings be organized
and facilitated through local people as they know their communities better, and people
trust them.
       A local person needs to be hired to cater to the men’s needs. There should be a meeting
       once a month or once every two months. FGD with rural men, Jhelum
       The team should comprise outsiders, but there must be one representative from our village
       because people trust local persons. IDI, woman with 4 children, Rural Okara

Respondents did, however, feel the need for an educated outsider to conduct the meetings.
       Ideas of people, who belong to same community, are similar. That is why a person who
       comes from the outside will be able to educate the people in a better manner. It would have
       an effect. IDI, woman with 3 children, Urban Jhelum

Generally, male doctors were considered ideal for conducting such meetings as community
men would trust such a knowledgeable person. In addition, men can also share their FP and
general health-related issues with doctors.
       Your strategy of coming here and briefing me on family planning should be done
       everywhere. By this, I mean that I will go to my friends/peer group and gather them in the
       town to convey your message. I will also refer to you for proper guidance. This will prove to
       be beneficial for you as well as the government. This is how campaigners can garner a
       good response. IDI, man with 6 children, Urban D.G. Khan
       A more effective thing will be making the people understand/telling them. Since most people
       listen to doctors, it would be more effective (to involve doctors). IDI, woman with 1 child,
       Rural Bahawalpur
       Education is obtained by almost everyone, but a proper training and education on this
       matter (family planning) can only be provided by the department or doctors. FGD, Urban
       Okara

Another suggestion from half the FGDs (6 of 12) was that merely raising awareness and
providing knowledge on FP would be insufficient; these doctors should provide
contraceptives on the spot as well. These respondents believed not supplying
contraceptives would allow the chances of laziness to take over, preventing men from
buying or accessing contraceptives themselves later.
While talking about possible incentives for men to attract them to the meetings, male
respondents generally stated that medicines and some kind of refreshment should be
provided. Overall, they suggested that the meetings should be informative and interesting
to attract men. Most of the women considered knowledge and information related to FP
techniques to be sufficient incentives in themselves for male participants.
       These meetings are very important. If they [men] do not gain any knowledge about family
       planning, how can they practice it? My husband, for example, does not know anything about
       IUCDs and admits it. If men are told about contraceptive use and the various methods, then



                                                    24
       their minds can be changed. They will think about it. IDI, woman with 2 children, Urban
       Jhelum
       Medicines should be given and the procedures should be accounted for (details about the
       procedures should be given). Providing food, however, is a separate issue. IDI, man with 7
       children, Rural Okara

Some male respondents agreed and said the main incentive of going to MGMs for males
was information and awareness.
       Without the motivation and awareness of the man, a woman cannot pursue the family
       planning program successfully. For example, LHWs can tell only women about birth
       spacing. She [the woman] can use family planning secretly without her husband’s
       permission. That is why the need of the hour is that men should also be motivated and
       convinced about family planning. It will be more effective then. So, a man can convince
       another man properly about using family planning methods. IDI, man with 6 children,
       Urban D.G. Khan

Potential Benefits of Male Group Meetings: Women’s Perspectives
Most women voiced strong opinions about the potential benefits of MGMs. They felt that
male-directed meetings would be very effective and would lead to a positive change in the
mindsets of men on FP. For them, the main benefit was that wives would eventually find it
easy to discuss FP with their husbands and convince them of their merits. Women in
Bahawalpur considered these meetings a source of knowledge sharing.
       Meetings should be arranged for both men and women. But meetings for men are
       necessary. For example, if my husband listens to someone talk about these things, he will
       go and discuss it with another man. It will have an effect. It might not come to his mind
       directly, but at least he will know that the meeting was held and will go and tell a third
       person. I think that it is better this way and that these [meetings] should be organized. IDI,
       woman with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur

Women from Jhelum stated that MGMs would also help men who consider FP to be
against religion.
       These meetings should be effective for men who consider family planning to be a sin. Their
       minds could change. There should be awareness for such men. If men are made aware,
       there would be less population, and they will think over it. IDI, woman with 3 children,
       Urban Jhelum

If men are persuaded and educated in FP, it would sort out half the problems that women
face, many women argued. Their husbands would realize the effectiveness and benefits of
FP and allow the women to visit facilities
       There is a general hold of men in our society. Women cannot do things without the
       permission of men. Since men play an important role, everything will be fine if men are
       convinced. IDI, woman with 1 child, Rural Okara

Potential Benefits of Male Group Meetings: Men’s Perspectives
Men from every district during the FGDs (8 of 12) and IDIs (22 of 26) expressed their
perceptions and understanding of the outcomes of MGMs. Men generally considered
MGMs beneficial.
       It is our opinion that a man will convey the message to ten people and the ten people will
       convey the message to a hundred people. In this way an “awareness chain” will be created
       and it will be easier for your motivators to convey their messages. FGD, Urban D.G. Khan




                                                    25
For these men, MGMs would prove a source of knowledge and information for men and,
as a result, not only would they be able to initiate discussions with their wives, but also be
convinced of the merits of contraceptive use.
       Group meetings are better as they produce better results. Meetings for men will lead to
       fewer children being born. People will get more information about family planning and
       refrain accordingly. Men will also be inclined to go home and talk to their wives about it,
       willing to take the first step. Out of the 50 percent who go home and talk to their wives, 60
       percent will actually use them. It should make a difference. IDI, man with 4 children, Rural
       Okara

This effect can help poor people have as many (or few) children as they can support
according to their resources.
       The people who are overburdened would of course accept it. The poor would appreciate
       this sort of education because it provides a solution to their misery. There are two or three
       men in this locality who want to get themselves sterilized because they already have nine or
       ten children and cannot afford more. IDI, man with 6 children, Rural D.G. Khan

Some men felt there would be less conflict between husbands and wives because men who
were not ready to use any method earlier will try to use FP after attending these meetings.
       In my opinion, if men discuss [or initiate discussions] about family planning, it would be
       easier for women to convince their husbands because both would have knowledge about
       family planning. In this way, they would agree with each other quicker and decision-making
       would be faster as the wives would get information from the LHWs and the husbands from
       group meetings. It will make decisions easier and prevent unnecessary quarrels. Yes, in this
       way there will be equality in their thinking which can lead to easy decision-making. FGD,
       Urban Okara

Interventions through Religious Leaders
RLs are respected figures, highly knowledgeable in religious matters, and considered an
authority on most issues. People also seek help from RLs in many family matters,
including health. RLs are also consulted during decision-making, especially if an issue is
considered to be controversial religiously. If the RL of a community declares an act
permissible, everyone agrees to follow it. The use of FP is also sometimes considered to be
against Islam. Thus if RLs declare that contraception is allowed by Islam, people can use it
more confidently.
FGDs and IDIs discussed the practicality of interventions through RLs, including
perceptions of the involvement of RLs and the feasibility and benefits of involving them to
increase contraceptive use. There was a mixed response across the districts.
Generally, men and women from all districts mentioned the social acceptability and respect
for RLs in their communities. During FGDs in Bahawalpur, an extensive debate was held
on the involvement of RLs in creating awareness and motivation about FP. Almost all
respondents felt that interventions should be made through Ulema. However, a few stated
that they should not use loudspeakers for this purpose and should instead talk about such
matters in private settings.
       People should be convinced on religious grounds because a layman thinks a soul that has
       been destined to come into the world will come. He says that you [the person who tries to
       convince him about family planning], God forbid, consider yourselves gods and that you are
       asking me to stop a soul entering this world. Thus, there should be a counter argument
       against this view in light of the Sharia [Islamic code]. Religious scholars should disseminate
       this knowledge from a Sharia perspective. FGD, Urban Bahawalpur



                                                    26
Respondents from D.G. Khan stated that RLs can address the issue during sermons, but
some also mentioned that, as very few people visit mosques or maulvis (religious leaders),
they cannot approach every man in the community.
       Maulvis can only speak to people who visit mosques. They cannot communicate their
       message to the entire populace of the area. FGD, Rural Jhelum

Some respondents felt that RLs’ involvement could generate awareness among men,
stressing that an RL is more influential and his words carry more weight than any other
person’s. Women were more vociferous than men on the potential benefits.
       The maulvi’s word has an effect on people. In fact, it will be more effective if the (programs)
       are conducted through maulvis. IDI, man with 4 children, Rural Okara
       It would be useful because when religious leaders gather people, people listen to them. IDI,
       woman with 3 children, Rural Bahawalpur
       It would be beneficial when he [the religious leader] talks about the topic from an Islamic
       perspective. People obey them because religious leaders help distinguish between right and
       wrong and legal and illegal. I think that religious leaders can play a vital role in this respect.
       IDI, woman with 2 children, Urban Jhelum

However, the majority from all four districts was not in favor of interventions through RLs
and had four sets of reservations. Foremost was the perception that these leaders are
against FP and that their belief is to support more children. Therefore it was questionable
as to how they can talk about small families. This notion was reported mainly by the men
of D.G. Khan and Bahawalpur during IDIs.
       I think religious leaders will never say that there should be fewer children. They say,
       According to the orders of God, family planning is not the right thing to do. IDI, woman with
       2 children, Urban Bahawalpur
       If someone goes to a religious scholar and is told not to produce children, he would
       obviously think that life is given by Allah. What kind of scholar would say that? IDI, man
       with 4 children, Urban D.G. Khan
       The maulvis say that children are a blessing from God and that contraception is equal to
       murder. That is their opinion. IDI, man with 4 children, Urban Okara

The second dimension was the perception on the possible reaction of the community on
involving RLs. They thought that members of the community would not accept RLs in this
role and would count it as his “bad” deed. This was reported mainly in FGDs in Okara,
D.G. Khan, and Bahawalpur.
       People will have objections. They will say that the maulvi receives bribes [rishwat]. The
       people will not like it if a maulvi talks about these matters after the Friday prayers [Namaz
       Juma] in an open congregation. FGD, Rural D.G. Khan
       He cannot do so. He only gets one day in a week to preach [Friday], and if he starts talking
       about this topic after seven days, the people will make sure that he does not come back to
       the mosque again! FGD, Rural Okara
       They surely listen to him. But people do not like this type of talk at the mosque. Society is
       like this. There should be a program like group meetings. FGD, Rural Okara

The third reason came from respondents in Jhelum, who argued that, because contraceptive
use is more of a young man’s domain, and that RLs are usually older men, the generation
gap can act as a barrier to communication.
       Obviously if the maulvi is older, people will feel ashamed talking to him and discussing such
       things with him. IDI, man with 3 children, Rural Jhelum




                                                      27
The fourth reservation, from urban Jhelum, was that young men do not value RLs
nowadays, so RLs’ involvement would not be effective.
       I think that it is difficult to accomplish it through a maulvi. Maulvis do not agree with it; it is as
       simple as that. As far as the briefing is concerned, they are not convinced much or in favor
       of family planning, in my opinion. The youngsters stay away from maulvis. The reason for
       that is that some people do not usually consult elders. IDI, man with 3 children, Urban
       Jhelum

Still, 18 men and women among 52 respondents in IDIs showed a positive response to
involving RLs in FP interventions, especially in Jhelum and Okara. One female respondent
said that meetings for maulvis would be more effective and beneficial for the community
because they are respectable people and have a special place in the community.
       Religious leaders have a high social status in villages because people are uneducated.
       They do not have knowledge, and they consider a religious leader to be a wise man
       because he is associated with religion. That is why people obey religious leaders. IDI,
       woman with 1 child, Rural Okara
       The cleric’s words carry more weight than the Prime Minister’s. The cleric should deliver a
       speech at least three times a month on this topic according to the Quran and Hadith so that
       people can be educated and motivated. FGD, Rural Jhelum

Another woman explained that members of the rural community relied on maulvis,
especially for health issues. They went to maulvis whenever their children had health
problems:
       These people are most effective. The people of our village obey religious leaders even more
       than doctors. They take them to religious leaders when their children are taken ill. IDI,
       woman with 2 children, Rural Okara

Respondents in favor of involving RLs in FP interventions discussed suitable strategies to
make RLs’ involvement effective. Because men and women from Jhelum and Okara
during IDIs were generally more in favor of the role of RLs than respondents from D.G.
Khan and Bahawalpur, most of the suggestions came from them. The respondents said RLs
should be counseled and trained on the issue and that they should talk about it at Friday
sermons.
       It will be beneficial if the maulvis are trained and counseled. However, they might not agree
       to it. IDI, man with 2 children, Urban Okara

A woman from Okara suggested that RLs give a speech after every Friday prayer. One of
the main suggestions was that RLs should discuss FP with the community’s men with
reference to the Sharia, Quran, and Hadith to make the intervention more effective.
       I think the maulvi of a village should deliver a speech on these issues in light of the Quran
       and Hadith. As he is a religious scholar, he would have a strong impact on the people of the
       community and they would obviously follow him. IDI, man with 2 children, Rural Okara
       The cleric is more influential in persuading any person; one will always prefer the words of a
       maulvi sahib to those of any other person [health worker, friend, or a neighbor]. So, a
       religious leader is important in convincing any person, if necessary. IDI, man with 3
       children, Rural Jhelum

Media Interventions
The next set of interventions discussed were media FP campaigns on radio and television.
Discussions about the role of the media did not reflect any significant regional variations,
but did vary by gender. Women expressed their views in greater detail than men, and often


                                                        28
more enthusiastically, believing that the media could play a positive role in increasing
awareness and knowledge among men and women alike. A few women were concerned
that current advertisements cannot be viewed properly in the presence of elders or children.
       Every home has a television. Dramas should be in the Saraiki language. They will
       understand. They will say that they are watching the dramas, and through the dramas, they
       can understand. IDI, woman with 5 children, Urban D.G. Khan
       Men do not pay attention to the commercials on television. When I watch an advertisement,
       I ask my husband to look at it: “two children are enough.” He just said that people have up
       to six children. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural Okara

Men overall did not appreciate the idea of relying on the media for interventions. (This was
quite different from what was reported by men in the PDHS 1990–91, where the majority
of the husbands who had heard radio or TV messages about FP, perceived the media to be
effective in persuading couples to use FP—NIPS–Macro 1992).
Both male and female respondents mentioned that media campaigns were not effective
because such programs could not be viewed in the presence of other family members.
Perhaps the key point was made during an FGD in Jhelum that, keeping in view the
cultural context, programs with detailed FP messages cannot be covered on television or
radio. Thus, media campaigns would have a very limited effect in giving direct
information. They can create awareness about FP, which was more possibly the need in the
1990s, but as mentioned earlier, men now require more detailed information on FP
methods, which the media cannot address properly.
A few men from D.G. Khan argued that poor people do not have access to a television and
that is why these media campaigns cannot play a positive role (two respondents from D.G.
Khan evidently did not have television or radio at home).
       I do not have a television or radio at home. Sometimes I go out to read a newspaper. IDI,
       man with 3 children, Rural D.G. Khan
       Television is not viewed by everyone. Many laborers who will have children, the people who
       process sugarcane and corn plantations, and people who farm potatoes; a lot of them
       probably do not have televisions. Poor people do not usually have televisions. These are
       the people who will bear the greatest number of children. IDI, man with 7 children, Rural
       Okara
       I have seen advertisements for your pills in the commercial breaks between the dramas that
       are aired on television. There are boys and girls sitting around who are befuddled because
       of it. In my opinion, about 50 percent of society has been rendered corrupt because of this.
       FGD, Rural Okara
       It cannot be properly portrayed by advertising on television and radio. FGD, Rural Jhelum

A minority of male respondents felt that the media could play a positive role; a few men
from Bahawalpur and Jhelum stated they had learned at least something from television
and that it could play a positive role in educating men.
       Televisions are better, because these days, everyone has a television. FGD, Rural Jhelum
       The media can play a better role to educate people about family planning. FGD, Rural
       Bahawalpur

Women were more explicit about the positive role of the media. A general reason for the
lack of interest by men and women’s keen interest (particularly in television) may be
associated with their presence at home. Women spend more time at home than men, and
the television is women’s main source of entertainment; dramas attract them most. Women


                                                   29
respondents generally believed that media can create awareness of FP methods’ advantages
and can be a source of inspiration for their adoption by others.
Some women suggested a strategy involving media as an intervention tool:

   •   FP messages should be conveyed in proper drama serials;
   •   These drama serials should be telecast in local and regional languages, to make
       them more understandable;
   •   Recurring information on FP methods and messages should be shown on different
       channels.
       Dramas should be telecast on the subject of family planning. These dramas should narrate
       a story that will compel people with many children not to have any more. The dramas should
       be in the Saraiki language. IDI, woman with 5 children, Urban Okara
       Tell them through the television about how many children are “enough” for them. Also, show
       them slides related to [the different] family planning methods. If a person is uneducated, his
       or her educated friends can read and tell them. IDI, woman with 3 children, Rural Okara

Interventions for Men through Community Health Workers
LHWs
A few men and women also suggested other intervention strategies to increase FP
knowledge and information in communities. First of all, most women commented on the
performance of LHWs in their areas. Generally, men and women from Jhelum and D.G.
Khan positively commented on LHWs. Men and women in Okara were not satisfied with
their LHW services, however. A common complaint was LHWs’ constant involvement in
the polio eradication campaigns, which compromised their role of providing FP services.
       LHWs’ scope of work has been confined to polio campaigns for many years due to which
       they neither visit women for FP motivation nor provide services at home. Secondly, they do
       not have contraceptive supplies on hand which diminishes their role anyway. FGD, Rural
       D.G. Khan
       The polio teams (including LHWs and male mobilizers) come, give the drops to the children,
       and go away. If we want to ask them anything specific, they will tell us. Other than that, they
       do not provide any information. IDI, woman with 4 children, Urban D.G. Khan

It was generally suggested by women that LHWs should concentrate on FP service
provision and should be more knowledgeable and skillful for addressing women’s needs.
They also mentioned that LHWs should be more educated and informative. In Okara, the
fact that there are no other health services available in their area except LHWs was
particularly mentioned.
       There should be a facility for us in the village. We do not have any facility. The LHW gets us
       free condoms, but she sells each for five rupees. IDI, woman with 4 children, Rural Okara
       LHWs should be humble and polite. If they will not cooperate, people will question people’s
       need to go there [to the health centers, in the face of their non-cooperative behavior]. They
       should have a better attitude [with clients]. IDI, woman with 4 children, Rural Jhelum

These suggestions indicate that women want greater reliance and utilization of existing
sources of LHWs for bettering their communities. Some of the men also emphasized that
LHWs must visit more.




                                                     30
       I think that LHWs must go door-to-door and brief every woman about the current situation of
       the population and guide them on birth spacing and the different methods for this. IDI, man
       with 2 children, Rural Okara

Male Health Workers
During many FGDs and IDIs, men spontaneously compared the greater range of facilities
available to women for FP in communities with limited facilities available to men.
       Just as there are LHWs, there should be male workers as well. They should debate with the
       men and have small corner meetings and should have materials and different services. Men
       should consult these health workers to acquire these services. I want these services to be
       available to men. It should be advertised that these materials are available from this specific
       center. Our women are Eastern, and they feel shy availing these methods. So, a man
       should be aware and he should acquire these methods. FGD, Rural Jhelum
       In the same way as LHWs, there should be a male team for men that can gather them
       somewhere and guide them about what is better for them and how to use different
       [contraceptive]   methods.     Either that, or    they   can   go    door-to-door.
       IDI, man with 2 children, Rural Okara

The majority of male respondents strongly suggested there be male health workers who
provide services at the same scale as LHWs to men at community level.
       Similar to an LHW who guides and discusses family planning with women, a man should be
       there to discuss, guide, and convince men about the importance of family planning. FGD,
       Rural Bahawalpur

They felt that they should provide counseling, arrange “corner meetings,” and provide
contraceptives.
       There are some questions that a woman [LHW] cannot ask a man but a man can ask such
       questions from another man. Therefore, a man’s involvement in this becomes imperative.
       Men should join this field [as male motivators]. IDI, man with 4 children, Urban
       Bahawalpur

In this way, men could use the services of someone who would listen to them and manage
their FP concerns.
       Well, it will cause greater awareness. If you have a problem, you should know that there is a
       person who can be contacted. FGD, Rural Jhelum

     CHAPTER 4 — CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
                                      CONCLUSIONS

There has been a real change in Punjabi men’s attitude toward FP (based on the 2013
qualitative study; baseline and endline FALAH surveys; and PDHS 1990–91 and 2006–
07). They appear more concerned about their fertility intentions and behavior than they
were in the 1990s. Economic stringencies and inability to meet household costs, including
raising children, are men’s primary motivations for approving FP. Our qualitative study is
fully in line with the quantitative survey findings.
Improvement in spousal communication has made it easier for wives to sway their
husbands on fertility issues. Communication is widespread between husbands and wives
on their family sizes and contraceptive use. While there are differences between them on
the desired number of children (higher for women than men in all districts), they talk about
the issue. Given their strong concerns, men sometimes initiate the discussion with their
wives about their fertility intentions. This pattern suggests it is no longer the exclusive
responsibility of wives to think about FP and initiate FP discussions. Due to both men’s
and women’s emerging concerns, they often converge on ideal family size and
contraceptive use. Among couples with a divergence of opinion, women try to convince
their husbands after discussions, as they cannot make independent decisions and their
husbands are the ultimate decision-makers in all household matters.
Regional differences persist in ideal family size, as reported by men and women. The ideal
number of children in Jhelum and Okara is lower than in D.G. Khan and Bahawalpur,
reflecting established northern and southern Punjab differences. Moreover, there is always
a difference between ideal and actual family size, the latter generally exceeding the former,
for a variety of reasons ranging from family pressure and couples’ own desires for ideal
numbers of children for each sex.
Supply-side issues act as a barrier to men using contraception. Despite their positive
attitudes toward FP and frequent reported communication with their wives, a few factors
inhibit men from using FP. Supply-side issues are the most often cited by men, including
lack of FP services or contraceptive methods, along with method failure and contraceptive
costs. Men recognize that their lack of knowledge about specific FP methods is an obstacle
to contraceptive use. In addition, men voice fears of perceived or experienced side effects
of modern methods along with lack of provider skills for managing these effects.
Men are highly enthusiastic about interventions employing male group meetings. Despite
their apprehensions, it appears that men are eager for male-focused interventions that
increase their involvement in FP programs. Men and women in all districts seem to be
really keen on the introduction of male group meetings. Men especially see them as having
potentially more impact than women’s meetings because it would be more effective to
educate and pass on FP messages to them rather than to their wives. One approach would
be to conduct male group meetings includes involving a local to organize the meeting and
an educated and skillful outsider (preferably a doctor) to conduct it. This also includes
providing contraceptives after the meeting to involve men in increasing contraceptive use.



                                             32
Religious leaders’ involvement is a good source of support. A mixed response came
through on the involvement of religious leaders in FP programs—women are more in favor
than men. Regional differences are also apparent: men from Jhelum and Okara favor the
idea more, men from D.G. Khan and Bahawalpur less so. Those in favor suggest that
religious leaders should be trained and talk about FP with reference to the Quran and
Hadith. The overall impression of the interventions through religious leaders suggests that
they should play a supportive role by communicating the message that FP is allowed in
Islam.
The media play a positive but limited role. Men were generally not very appreciative of the
role of media such as television or radio in the effective communication of FP messages.
The reasons for this cited by male respondents were: lack of time to watch television, lack
of availability of television (D.G. Khan), and the inability of television and radio to
provide details on methods according to men’s needs. Women showed greater interest and
proposed telecasting of drama series on the topic in local languages.
Male health workers need to be involved to provide services. Men suggested that a male
health worker on the lines of the Lady Health Worker program would be an ideal way of
providing FP services to men at community level.
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS

This is an ideal time to carry out the following direct interventions aimed at men in Punjab
because the findings suggest that husbands are ready to be involved in FP programs and
are supportive of their wives using contraception. Thus:

   •   Interventions should be designed to provide information on the use and side effects
       of various contraceptive methods available to men.
   •   As a first step, group meetings or alternative channels of interpersonal
       communication should be organized for men. This type of intervention is essential
       to fill the gaps in men’s knowledge of FP methods, and would help to remove any
       fear of side effects—a big hurdle in sustaining contraceptive use.
   •   These interventions have to be backed by an improved supply of contraceptives and
       FP services in facilities nearby. Even for male group meetings, a recommendation
       was that they be combined with provision of some supplies.
   •   In areas where there is a LHW, men generally appreciated her work but the point
       was raised that LHWs had moved away from their focus on FP, often to polio
       vaccine administration. LHWs should regain their focus on FP, balanced with other
       priorities such as polio.
   •   An improved FP service delivery environment is necessary—a demand voiced by
       men themselves.
   •   Additional interventions such as the training of religious leaders to encourage birth
       spacing and maternal and child health issues can have a positive influence. While
       this may not be carried out in each community, there are many settings where such
       an intervention helps to clarify men’s views on Islam and FP.

Greetings. My name is ________________. I am working with an organization called the Population Council

We are interviewing men/women in your community regarding the decision-making process about
reproductive health issues. We also need to know your views about involvement of men in FP

complete the interview with you.
I am going to ask you some personal questions; you do not have to answer any questions that you
do not want to answer, and you may end this interview at any time you wish. However, your honest
answers to these questions will help us better understand the phenomena. Moreover, the
information that is collected during the study will be kept confidential. Data will be stored in a
locked cabinet dedicated to this study that only the study team can access.
If you permit us, we shall tape record the discussion for the convenience of retrieving the
