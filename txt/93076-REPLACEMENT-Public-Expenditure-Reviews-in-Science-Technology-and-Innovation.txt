8           Public Expenditure Reviews in Science, Technology, and Innovation: A Guidance Note
  Box 3.1: Productivity as the Default Development Goal

  As Nobel laureate Paul Krugman said once, “productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.” In
  simple terms, productivity is efficiency in production: how much output is obtained from a set of inputs. Generally speak-
  ing, the higher the productivity of a country—the more a country produces for a given set of inputs—the higher the living
  standards that it can afford and the more options it has to choose from to improve well-being.

  Labor productivity is the most common measure of productivity. Economists have found that labor productivity growth
  depends on two major factors: the accumulation of capital (human, physical, and so forth) and the growth of an unex-
  plained (or residual) portion that arguably reflects advances in production technologies and processes, referred to as total
  factor productivity (TFP) growth (for a review see Shackleton 2013). In fact, because capital is known to have decreasing
  returns, sustained growth in the long run depends primarily on TFP growth.

  In this sense, productivity growth is closely associated with innovation—with the invention of new products, tools, and
  technical processes that not only reduce the cost of extracting or producing raw materials and energy but also reduce the
  cost of transforming those inputs into finished products. In this sense, by promoting innovation, policies may also contribute
  to TFP and labor productivity growth.

     •	 Private-sector nonfarm TFP in the United States, which could be considered the technological frontier, has grown at
        an average annual rate of 1.6–1.8 percent.
     •	 The link between R&D, innovation, and productivity for developed economies has been established in a number of
        studies as described in Hall and Rosenberg (2010).
     •	 In Latin America, it has been shown that product innovation has a positive impact on employment growth, compen-
        sating for the neutral or negative effects of process innovation (Crespi and Tacsir 2010).

  STI policies often involve multiple development goals such as improving international competitiveness, increasing exports,
  raising per capita income, and increasing productivity. Public investment in STI may also have noneconomic objectives, such
  as those related to the environment and social sectors (health, education, basic services, and so forth).

  As the ultimate factor driving economic growth and rising living standards, productivity growth (labor productivity or
  TFP growth) seems a good candidate for the default impact or high-level goal of inputs—against which public expendi-
  tures on STI can be evaluated. While a relatively straightforward concept, a host of measurement issues emerge when
  constructing productivity indicators from actual production data. For a review of the concept, metrics and determinants,
  see Syverson (2011).

  Using micro-level data from manufacturing industries, Saliola and Seker (2011) estimate TFP levels for 80 developing countries
  from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The study also estimates separate TFP values obtained
  at the industry level. These industry-level estimates are the most useful for policy makers in that they reveal comparative
  advantages of specific industries within countries.

     Box 3.2: Three Default Intermediate Outcomes

     Research Excellence. In developing countries, innovation depends to a large extent on the ability to recognize, assimilate,
     and apply the value of new, external information to commercial ends (absorptive capacity).a Given that “knowledge” is a
     public good, public research can play an important role in building the country’s learning and innovative capacity by rais-
     ing the level of extra-industry knowledge. In this sense, public research can have a direct influence on firm productivity.

        •	 Consider the impact of public agricultural research, especially when combined with effective agricultural extension
           services. Recent simulations illustrate substantial gains in agricultural productivity to be achieved by higher R&D
           investments over the next 20 years in East Africa (Nin-Pratt 2011).
        •	 Agricultural research is particularly needed to help developing countries to address the challenges of climate change
           Research plays an important role creating the necessary technologies, and enabling developing countries to adapt
           them to their agricultural systems (Lybbett and Sumner 2010).
        •	 In addition, government investments in research provide training to graduates and scientists, some of whom join the
           private sector, raising its capacity to use new tools and knowledge to solve complex problems.b
        •	 Evidence suggests that university research has a significant effect on corporate patents, innovation, and productivity
           (the latter with a 20-year delay) (Adams 1990; Jaffe 1989).

     Science-Industry Collaboration and Technology Transfer. A second intermediate output through which public research
     can contribute to firm productivity is through efficient commercialization of research outputs and collaboration with the
     business sector—that is, efficient technology transfer from public research organizations (PROs). Sustainable impact of
     public R&D expenditures on economic development depends on the way the research results of public investment are
     transferred to the market through patents, licenses, joint ventures, or spin-off companies. The problem is not so much the
     existence or nonexistence of commercialization activity but whether the conditions for a massive and systemic (as oppose
     to rare and occasional) process of research commercialization are in place (Audretsch et al. 2010).

     Science-industry collaboration, from joint and contract research to training and technical consultancy, is a way to commer-
     cialize research capacity or, more broadly, knowledge that is available in PROs. For example, science collaboration in R&D
     activities can leverage technological spillovers through the stimulation of additional private R&D investment (Rosenberg and
     Nelson 1994). Small firms also use research alliances to gain access to research inputs, which would have been otherwise
     unavailable (Audretsch and Feldman 1996).
                                                                                                            (continued next page)

Box 3.2 (continued)

   •	 Scott (2003) finds that research alliances with universities are a way through which firms improve their absorptive
      capacity. This is particularly true for firms that have downsized their R&D facilities.
   •	 Mueller (2006) uses a cross-sectional time series to find that regions with high levels of entrepreneurship and
      university-industry relationships experience a greater level of economic productivity (and growth).

Business Innovation: R&D, Startup Creation and Technology Adoption. Most productivity gains emerge from day-
to-day introduction of technological solutions and incremental improvements to products and processes of production (as
opposed to new discoveries and patenting) (Trajtenberg 2006). Those improvements can occur routinely, in a structured
way, or randomly. Business investments in R&D are a way to turn innovation into a routine activity for firms. Naturally, firms
can innovative without R&D activities.

   •	 Studies have also shown that business investments in research and innovation have a positive and non-negligible
      impact on labor productivity growth in Latin America (Crespi and Zuniga (2010) and Crépon et al. (1998))

Investments in R&D are fundamental to enhancing a country’s “absorptive capacity.” Prior knowledge gives one the
ability to acquire new information. But firms that have their own R&D are better able to use external information.
Moreover, a firm’s absorptive capacity may be a byproduct of R&D investments; that includes the ability to adapt and
adopt foreign technology, to benefit from spillover effects from foreign direct investment (FDI), and to gain from other
sources of knowledge transfer.

Start-ups, which very often do not result from R&D, are at the forefront of innovation. They introduce breakthrough
technologies, have taken risks in nascent sectors such as the Internet and biotechnology in the past, and are active in
areas such as nanotechnology today. They also play an important role in job creation. Kane (2010) finds that for the
period 1977 to 2005, start-ups on average created 3 million jobs annually while existing firms lost around 1 million
(Kane 2010).

The adoption of modern technology is a way of introducing new products or services to the market. Increasing the amount
of capital per worker (capital accumulation) is known to be a primary source of labor productivity growth. Differences in
technology adoption have been shown to be an important determinant of the gaps in growth and per capita income across
countries (Hall and Jones, 1999; Prescott, 1998). In fact, recent studies have shown that:

      differences in per capita income across countries (Comin and Hobijn 2010).
   •	 About 45 percent of cross-country variation in income per capita can be explained by technology adoption at the
      intensive margin.c.
   •	 Countries that have caught up with the United States have been those that saw an acceleration in adoption of new
      technologies (Comin and Hobijn 2010).
   •	 Technology adoption is also an easy way for firms in a developing country to absorb technology that is being devel-
      oped and used in economically advanced countries. This has become particularly true during the era of globalization
      as there is broader availability of technology and new machinery (Eaton and Kortum 2001; Keller 2004).

Notes:
a. The term refers to “the ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends” (Cohen and
Levinthal 1990). See also Griffith, Redding, and Van Reenen (2003).
b. For instance, the biotechnology industry has seen a sharp increase in the number of firms from the 1970s. Zucker et. al. (1998) show
that that this was due to the diffusion of trained human capital made available through basic research investments in this field.
c. Comin and Mestieri (2010) describe the intensive margin as follows: “Once a technology has been introduced, the intensive margin
of adoption captures how many units of the good embodying it are demanded relative to aggregate demand. The intensive margin is
determined by the productivity and price of goods that embody the technology and the cost that individual producers face in learning
how to use it. Other things equal, these variables produce vertical shifts in the evolution of observable measures of technology adoption.”

point of view, reflecting the interdependence of policy            spending on STI (this point is returned to later in the Guidance Note).




  Box 3.3: The “Policy Mix” Concept

  The “policy mix” concept, borrowed from other economic policy discussions, is defined as the combination of policy
  instruments that interact to influence the quantity and quality of STI investments in the public and private sectors. The
  term implies a focus on interactions and interdependencies between different policies as they affect the extent to which
  intended outcomes are realized. The assumption is that policy makers are underutilizing the full portfolio of instruments
  theoretically available to them.
  The policy mix concept, as intuitive as it may be, lacks clear normative implications. Often the term is associated with no-
  tions such as “balanced,” “appropriate,” or “effective,” qualities that are hard to define. An abstract “optimum” policy
  mix toward which the composition of public expenditures could be benchmarked probably does not exist. Rather, the
  optimum policy—the one that maximizes the impact of public expenditure—must be specific to each country context. This
  understanding is captured with the notion of “relevance.” “Consistency” between public expenditures and the high-level
  goals and “coherence” (for example, avoiding redundancy of programs) complete the attributes that this Guidance Note
  suggests to be used to characterize a balanced police mix.

     Until 2012, Thailand’s exports of dried cassava to China were not subject to any quality or food safety regulation. Only a
     minimum level of starch content was required. By contrast, Thailand’s exports of cassava pellets to the EU are required to
     meet two demanding sets of standards: the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) code, covering sanitary and processing
     procedures, and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), as cassava pellets are an input into animal feeds. Thai-
     land’s successful entry into EC cassava markets required its domestic exporters to develop greater technological capabilities
     than needed for exporting to China.

     Box 4.2: Structure of the Research and Innovation System in Turkey

     At the political level, the Turkish research system is led by the Supreme Council of Science and Technology (BTYK), a
     legally formalized body chaired by the prime minister. The BTYK determines, directs, and coordinates research and innova-
     tion policies, and is composed of relevant ministers, heads of public and private bodies, universities, and nongovernmental
     organizations. The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) is affiliated to the Ministry of Science,
     Industry, and Technology (MoSIT) and acts as the secretariat of the BTYK. The Ministry of Development (MoD) and the
     High Planning Council (YPK) are two other important actors in the design and implementation of STI policies. The Ministry
     of National Education (MoNE) and the Council of Higher Education (YOK) design and implement education policies, and
     integrate them with research policies. The Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) determines and recommends scientific
     priority areas and proposes legislation to the government on issues related to scientists and researchers.

     At the operational level, the leading actor in the system is TUBITAK. It designs and implements programs to increase
     R&D activities of the public and private sectors and universities. The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organi-
     zation (KOSGEB) and the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV) are the other main bodies implementing
     industrial R&D support measures. The Turkish Patent Institute (TPE) carries out the procedures related to industrial and
     intellectual property rights. The Turkish Accreditation Agency (TURKAK) deals with the accreditation of organizations and
     laboratories. The primary research performer in the public sector is the Marmara Research Center of TUBITAK. It provides
     contractual research, testing, training, consultancy, analysis, and certification services in its research centers, and operates
     a technopark. TUBITAK’s institutes are the most active research organizations conducting research in their fields of special-
     ization. For nuclear research activities, the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority is the main body both for strategy preparation
     and for carrying out research activities. There are also the R&D centers operating under universities and various ministries,
     such as the ministries of Energy and Natural Resources, and Food, Agriculture and Livestock.

     Apart from public research agencies, the private sector established R&D centers in the context of Law No. 5746, which
     concerns the support of research and development activities. Moreover, the gains acquired from application of Technology
     Developing Zones Law No. 4691 create potential for private sector R&D.

  Summary

  The objective of the Functional Review (FR) is to describe the flow of funds in the research and innovation sector. It de-
  scribes how much is being spent, by whom, and for what objectives. This includes identifying the intermediate outcomes
  that the spending aims to achieve. Four intermediate outcomes are proposed: (i) research excellence, (ii) science-industry
  collaboration and technology transfer, (iii) business R&D and startups, and (iv) technology adoption.

  Important challenges must be overcome to implement the FR. These include accessing budget and expenditure data, over-
  coming quality issues in the data, and identifying spending on innovation, when innovation is not among the categories
  typically used to categorize government spending.

  The Inception Report provides information on the programs and organizations operating as well as publicly available RDI
  spending data. Additional data comes from:

     •	 Government, including proposed, approved, and actual disbursements
     •	 Policy questionnaires (examples of which can be found on data collection on tax incentive support for R&D expen-
        ditures (OECD 2013b), and STI policies for nanotechnology (OECD 2008b)
     •	 Interviews with selected organizations, including ministries of finance, economic growth, and other sectors

     Box 5.1: Government STI Spending in Turkey According to Implementing Agency and Programs, 2005–08

     The Turkish Government’s investments in public innovation and technology support programs have risen substantially in recent
     years and are projected to continue to increase. During the 2005–08 period, the government allocated a significant amount
     of additional resources (over US$1.5 billion) from its budget, primarily to the Scientific and Technological Research Council of
     Turkey (TUBITAK). Public resources allocated to innovation and technology support programs have more than tripled in the
     last 10 years with public R&D expenditures as a share of GDP rising from 0.67 percent in 2002 to 0.8 percent in 2006. Over
     the same period, the number of full time equivalent researchers grew from 23,995 to 28,000. The main public agencies in the
     Turkish NIS that implement STI support programs are TUBITAK, the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV), the
     Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB), the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), and universities.
     A summary of the main allocation of funds within Turkey’s NIS from 2005 to 2008 is provided in table B5.2.1.

     Box 5.2: GBAORD—Concept, Statistical Description, and Use

     Unlike other statistical surveys carried out in the field of research and development, Government Budget Appropriations
     or Outlays for R&D (GBAORD) data are based on the analysis and identification of all appropriations spent on research and
     development (R&D) from public budgets. This means that the approach is based on the funder of research and develop-
     ment activities (here the state represented by administration), unlike the performance-based approach, which is adopted
     for example in the R&D survey.

     Under definitions provided in the Frascati Manual (OECD 2002), GBAORD covers all appropriations or outlays allocated to
     R&D from public budgets to support research and development, including all contributions to international R&D programs
     or institutions abroad. The data are based on final budget appropriations (figures as voted by parliament for the coming
     year—provisional data) and actual outlays (money paid out during the year—final data).

     Public budgets cover the central government budget and provincial budgets when its contribution is significant. GBAORD
     also covers general university funds, which are narrowly defined in line with the Frascati Manual as a sum of money given
     to universities by the ministry of education in support of their overall research activities. GBAORD includes both current
     costs and capital expenditure.

     Figure B5.2.1 illustrates GBAORD’s share of total general government expenditures. This indicator is commonly used to
     indicate the government’s effective priorities. Data is also available in national currency, at 2000 prices, and per inhabitant,
     among others categories. GBAORD is also broken down in accordance to Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of
     Scientific Programs and Budgets (NABS) at chapter and sub-chapter levels, corresponding to different socioeconomic objec-
     tives, as for example civil versus non-civil R&D. The goal is to help countries decide which R&D fields need more funding.

     Summary

     The objective of the EA is to establish whether programs and funded activities are efficient. In other words, do they lead to
     the expected outputs given a reasonable level of inputs? The EA also aims to determine what design and implementation
     issues are affecting the efficiency of programs and funded activities.

     The EA focuses on a selection of initiatives that are agreed in the Inception Report. These should represent a substantial
     proportion of public expenditures on each of the intermediate outcomes considered. There are a number of challenges in
     reviewing the selected programs, including measuring and valuing outputs. Another challenge is measuring the benefits
     from a program that spill over to institutions that did not participate in the programs.

     The EA uses results from the Functional Review to select programs for more detailed analysis. Sources of data for the EA
     include (i) survey(s) of beneficiaries, (ii) peer and panel reviews, and (iii) focus groups and case studies. Microeconomic
     modelling may also be used.

  Box 6.1: Challenges to Assessing the Efficiency of Programs

  •	 Nature of “success and failure” in research and innovation. The metric of success in some policy domains is fairly
     straightforward. For example, children vaccinated versus children not vaccinated is a clear metric for success and failure
     of immunization programs. In other cases, the failure of a project—scientific or innovation experiment—funded by a
     government is not necessarily a metric that indicates failure of the investment program that funds the project.
  •	 Time horizon. The time lag between the expenditure and the desired effect varies. For example, the impact of public
     support for additional firm R&D may be observable in the short term. Exports, on the other hand, are more likely ob-
     servable over the longer term.
  •	 Measurement. Tangible quantitative results, such as sales growth, are easier to measure than less tangible outputs,
     such as training received.
  •	 Valuing knowledge outputs. Even quantifiable knowledge products may be hard to quantify and compare. For instance,
     the value of intellectual property (and thus of a patent or spinoff company) depends on a number of assumptions and
     subject to debate.
  •	 Addressing spillover effects: Spillover effects are non-market effects on third parties (rather the direct beneficiary of
     intervention). For instance, a series of failed innovation attempts may generate enough information to enable the suc-
     cess of others. Accounting for such effects is not straightforward. For example, studies have argued that traditional
     output indicators—such as patents, sale of new products, and profit margins—fail to capture the full effects of R&D
     programs. Therefore, Buisseret et al. (1995) advocated that it was necessary to account for changes in the breadth of
     innovation activities and corporate business/technology strategies. These ideas became associated with the concept of
     “behavioral additionality.”

     Box 6.2: How the Call for Proposals and the Project Evaluation Stages May Affect Program Efficiency

     Calls for proposals may be open-ended or have a fixed deadline; while selection may be done only by national experts
     or include international experts. In both cases the options involve important trade-offs with different implications for the
     efficiency of the program.

     Open-ended calls impose, for example, less burden on the applicants (and perhaps on program management) but raise
     the risk of selecting projects that perhaps would not rank among the best options (and perhaps do not merit support).
     Close-ended calls improve the selection mechanism toward the best projects—at least among the applicants—and thus
     use public resources more efficiently. Yet, some argue that those administrative deadlines may not be consistent with
     scientific research. Not surprisingly, several top research organizations keep using open-call systems for some programs.

     Selection processes limited to national experts may compromise the independence of evaluations—especially when the
     local scientific community is small. Program managers, however, sometimes argue that access to international experts is
     impractical, costly, and runs the risk of excluding scientists that do not master a foreign language.

     Box 6.3: Assessing the Outputs of STI Program with a Survey of Beneficiaries—Illustration from Poland Mid-
     term Evaluation

     In October 2013, Poland’s National Center for Research and Development (NCBIR) engaged the World Bank to undertake a mid-term
     review of the Applied Research Program. The analysis included an evaluation of program design and implementation and success in tar-
     geting of intended beneficiaries. It relies on the information obtained from interviews with program managers, a survey of beneficiaries
     and applicant non-beneficiaries, and focus group discussions.

     Table B6.3.1 illustrates the results for the Applied Research Program (PBS) programs according to the respondent (leader [LEA] vs. partner
     [PAR]; sub-programs (Path A and Path B) and call for proposals (CF1 and CF2). PBS is a research grant program dedicated to promoting
     research collaboration. Publications are the main output of program beneficiaries, followed by master theses, and lastly new product
     prototypes. A small percentage of beneficiaries announce creation of a new product or upgrading an existing product. These results are
     in line with the fact that most beneficiaries are scientific units. They also demonstrate the program’s poor performance in generating
     outputs with high economic impact.

        •	 Publications appear as the most important output, followed by MA and PhD theses, and new product prototypes.
        •	 Leaders published more and provided more MA theses than partners: 57 percent versus 40 percent, and 19 percent versus 9
           percent, respectively.

     Table B6.3.2 provides some quantitative indicators. It shows that publications are the most important output. The mean of publications
     is higher for leaders, 2.1, than for partners, 1.2. Results in Path A (2.0) are larger than in Path B (1.3). And since innovation takes time,
     the mean of publications in CFP1 is higher than that of CFP2 (2.1 versus 0.8). The mean for the rest of the outputs does not exceed 0.5.

     Other benefits. Yet, a large proportion of participants strongly agree that the program increased firms’ innovative capacity. This includes
     increasing the internal knowledge and capabilities of employees, a better understanding of issues and problems, and better use of existing
     know-how. However, only 10 percent of beneficiaries strongly agree that the program improved companies’ competitive position both
     nationally and internationally. A similar ranking is observed for expected benefits (see figure B6.3.1).

     Box 6.4: Assessing the Impact of Croatia’s RAZUM Program

     RAZUM (Development of the Knowledge-Based Companies) was a conditional loan implemented by Croatia’s Innovation
     Agency from 2007 to 2012 that supported investments in R&D by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Behavioral
     and output additionaility was measured by means of a survey of beneficiaries.

     According to the survey’s responses, the intervention enabled companies to increase their capacity for conducting innova-
     tion and R&D, and to extend knowledge and capability of the staff through hiring of highly educated professionals. In
     most cases these changes promise to be permanent. New product development process was positively affected in a large
     majority of the cases, promising better innovation capability. For most companies that received RAZUM support, work on
     the project generated additional ideas for innovations.

     When asked what would have happened had they not received the RAZUM grant, 6 companies (30 percent) reported that
     they would have abandoned the project entirely. The majority (86 percent) of the remaining firms would have relied on their
     own resources, while some of them would have tried banks and venture capital funds. Three firms would have tried to find
     money through strategic partnerships and some other R&D subsidies. However, the absence of RAZUM money would not
     be without consequences. Most companies would have proceeded on a smaller budget, which would have affected the
     duration of the project (would have been longer), scope of the project (smaller), R&D capacity through additional employ-
     ment of R&D staff (lower), and innovativeness level of the project (also lower) (figure B6.4.1).

     A similar pattern is found in the case of non-beneficiaries. Those firms were either in the evaluation process (passed the
     pre-selection phase) or were approved and waiting for financing. In the hypothetical situation of not receiving RAZUM
     funding, 2 companies out of 14 would have abandoned this project and started another one, whereas all other companies
     would have proceeded with their projects (interestingly, no firm declared that it would not continue with that or any other
     project). However, the absence of th RAZUM grant would have had consequences for the duration, scope, R&D capacity,
     and overall quality of the projects (figure B6.4.2).

        •	 In the absence of RAZUM grant, the vast majority of respondents said that they would have proceeded (i) with the
           project but over a longer timeframe (92.9 percent), (ii) on a smaller budget (85.7 percent), (iii) with a reduced scope
           (85.7 percent), and (iv) with inadequate equipment and/or machinery (71.4 percent).
        •	 In terms of outcomes, many companies would have not hired additional employees (71.4 percent), and the innova-
           tiveness level of the output would have been lower (42.9 percent).

                                                                                                             (continued next page)

     Summary

     The objective of the EFA is to determine whether the expenditure and related outputs are leading to intermediate outcomes,
     such as an increase in the volume and quality of scientific papers, increased licensing by research institutions, and increased
     adoption of technologies in the business sector. The EFA then evaluates what conditions are facilitating or inhibiting the
     intermediate outcomes from being generated.

     The EFA will typically analyze the national innovation system (NIS) by considering four sets of intermediate outcomes: (i)
     research excellence, (ii) science industry collaboration and technology transfer, (iii) business R&D and startups, and (iv)
     non-R&D innovation and technology adoption. These outcomes are measured by analyzing a number of indicators, which
     provides an indication of where the system is working effectively. These findings allow evaluation of the conditions for
     effectiveness, include issues such as the presence of appropriate research infrastructure or the presence of appropriate
     intellectual property regulation.

     The starting point for the EFA is analysis of outputs from the Operational Efficiency Assessment. Additional data for the EFA
     will come from a combination of publicly available sources, surveys, interviews of program managers, R&D statistics, and
     budgetary information. Information on the conditions for effectiveness will largely come from a policy survey, interviews,
     and survey data on the enterprise sector.

i. The presence of and the ability to attract highly motivated and well-trained human resources
 Relevance to      An increase in public investments in R&D may not lead to an increase in research output
 the outcome       and quality without adequate access to quality human resources. This requires the presence
                   of a higher education system that is capable of producing academic talent, and incentives
                   that can attract and retain this talent.
 Assessment        •	 Does the higher education system provide a steady supply of quality academic talent,
 checklist            compatible with the country’s needs?
                   •	 Are the PROs able to attract and maintain top academic talent? Is the share of local
                      scientists abroad significant? Why?
                   •	 Are the opportunities for young researchers fair, transparent, and effective?
                   •	 Do employment regulations provide for the substantive reward of high performance
                      and effective punishment of recurrent underperformers?
                   •	 What is the degree of integration of local research with the international scientific com-
                      munity?


ii. Researchers have access to appropriate research infrastructure for research excellence
 Relevance to      Quality human resources need access to modern infrastructure to conduct excellent
 the outcome       research. This requires investment in research infrastructure that is in line with modern
                   standards and research priorities of the country. In addition, collaboration with interna-
                   tional labs and research facilities allow developing countries to leverage resources outside
                   without costly investments.
 Assessment        •	 Are research facilities and infrastructure (in major fields of the country) up to interna-
 checklist            tional standards and compatible with the country’s needs?
                   •	 Is there a roadmap/strategy for investments in infrastructure research? Are actual invest-
                      ments in research infrastructure in line with the outlined research strategy?
                   •	 Can researchers access research infrastructure anywhere in the country? How is re-
                      search infrastructure regulated?
                   •	 Can researchers access the relevant international research facilities?


iii. Research funds are administered appropriately
 Relevance to      Access to funding in a predictable and stable way is another important factor contributing
 the outcome       to research excellence. The way those resources are distributed (competitively or not) is also
                   crucial. Finally, researchers funded by third parties (specially the business sector) are more
                   likely to engage in results-driven work.
 Assessment        •	 Is the flow of public funding stable and predictable? Is there any source of earmarking for
 checklist            public spending in R&D? If so of what type?
                   •	 Are allocations of funds to different PROs made in a competitive manner? What is the
                      composition between block funding and competitive funding for public research institutes
                      and universities?
                   •	 Are researchers properly incentivized to look for third-party funds? Do researchers control
                      funds mobilized from third parties?

iv. The governance of PROs is effective and geared toward research excellence
 Relevance to            The rules and procedures governing how PROs operate also generate incentives that may
 the outcome             or may not be consistent with reaching research excellence and research productivity. Rules
                         governing the relationship between the government and PROs include those related to the
                         selection and performance of senior managers. Therefore, of interest is the delegation of
                         powers from the government to the PRO, the incentives under which managers operate,
                         and the accountability to the public.
 Assessment              •	 Do PROs have clearly defined missions and research priorities?
 checklist               •	 Are public resources made available through a performance-based method?
                         •	 How much managerial power has been delegated to managers compared to other
                            decision-making bodies of the PRO (for example, scientific committees or governing
                            bodies)? To what extent are the incentives of the different board members aligned with
                            those of the PRO?
                         •	 Do regulations of PROs effectively empower managers to achieve results? How adjust-
                            able are PROs’ budgets (between activities and years)? How much autonomy do PROs
                            have to manage human resources?
                         •	 Are top management positions for PROs filled by a competitive meritocratic process?
                         •	 Are there monitoring systems to measure management targets/goals? How does the
                            government (owner) exercise control?

i. Intellectual Property Regulation
 Relevance to              PROs are not necessarily interested in managing and actively seeking to commercialize
 the outcome               research, as it is a very complex activity with high sunk and transaction costs as well as
                           uncertain returns. Similarly, scientists are rarely interested in commercializing their research
                           results, as investments in strictly academic or administrative tasks tend to yield higher net
                           returns.2 Therefore, without clearly defining rights and obligations of those key stakehold-
                           ers, it is unlikely that an efficient commercialization process will emerge. How is the IP of
                           publicly funded research performed by PROs regulated in the country?
 Assessment                •	 Who owns the IP—government (funding agency), university (or faculty/department), or
 checklist                    researcher? If not the researcher, is there a minimum share of royalties assigned to research-
                              ers? Are regulations for ownership and royalties unambiguous?
                           •	 Is there an obligation for the PRO to manage its research base and actively pursue the
                              development and commercialization of IP? Which organization is supposed to perform
                              this task (faculty, department, university, PRO)? Are there penalties for nonenforcement?
                           •	 Do researchers have the obligation to disclosure their research activity and results to
                              the PRO? If so, to whom and under which confidentiality rule? Are researchers obliged
                              to engage in commercialization efforts? If so for how long? What are the penalties for
                              noncompliance?


2. There are several reasons for this. One is that most scientific results are far from a stage in which they can be commercialized. Additional
research, sometimes for a few years, is needed until a decision can be made about the commercial potential of a discovery. Another difficulty
refers to the matching process, that is, finding an investor interested in nurturing a spinoff or a firm interested in buying the license. Therefore,
except in the cases of breakthroughs with clear commercial potential, technology transfer from PROs will not follow naturally from research.

   Box 7.1: IP Regulation in the United States and Denmark

   As discussed above, altering the incentives of key stakeholders requires changing the expected payoffs of their alternatives.
   One way to do that is by creating a cost of noncompliance with the established rule. In this regard, developed countries have
   sometimes designated a series of legal responsibilities for PROs and researchers that benefit from public funds for research.

   In the United States, the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act transferred to research universities the responsibility for managing IP rights
   related to publicly funded research (originally belonging to the funding agencies).

   In Denmark, the 1999 Law on Inventions on Public Research Institutions established that researchers must disclose their
   inventions and assist in the commercialization process when needed. These regulations have the advantage of clarifying
   roles among stakeholders and are easy to monitor.

ii. Employment Regulation
 Relevance to             Human resources policies have an impact on the performance or researchers not only in
 the outcome              terms of research excellence and productivity but also its commercialization. Criteria for
                          career development of scientists may or may not reward commercialization efforts and col-
                          laboration with industry. Do employment regulations limit the participation of researchers
                          in entrepreneurial activities or research activities with the private sector? More specifically:
 Assessment               •	 Is there a provision for sabbatical years for the researcher employment in the spinoff
 checklist                   company through which her or his research will be commercialized?
                          •	 Is there any equivalence between academic achievement (such as publications) and
                             technology transfer achievements (such as patenting, licensing, and volume of contract
                             research with industry) for career promotion or in terms of financial compensation?
                          •	 Do regulations enable/encourage internships from and to companies?
iii. Other Regulations
 Assessment               Do PROs have the legal mandated and operational flexibility to efficiently manage IP rights
 checklist                (for example, managing a portfolio of spinoff companies)?

                          •	 Is the use of PRO resources (such as infrastructure facility, research material, and re-
                             searchers’ time) in collaborations with the private sector properly regulated? Does this
                             regulation impose excessive financial and nonfinancial costs (red tape) for the private
                             sector?

iv. Technology Transfer Offices
 Relevance to             Technology transfer offices (TTOs) are a particular type of organizational arrangement that
 the outcome              permits specialization and economies of scale. They emerged in the past three decades as
                          one of the models used by developed countries to promote manage research and imple-
                          ment post-research commercialization efforts.3

                             of TTO staff? Are the right skills available in the market? Is the TTO staff appropriately
                             prepared and connected to the PRO researchers and industry? Are PROs aware of the
                             long-term and public nature of TTO activities (that is, that the TTO is not a short-term
                             profit-making organization)? Are PROs committed to support their TTOs in the long
                             term?

v. Science and Technology Parks
 Relevance to             The primary role of science and technology (S&T) parks is to enable collaboration between firms
 the outcome              and research institutions, facilitating the emergence of spin-off and start-up companies. The im-
                          plicit assumption is that knowledge spillovers are location-specific (Link, Scott and Siegel, 2003).
                          Are there S&T in the country? If so, is there evidence that firms installed in the park collaborate
                          more or better with the respective PRO?
 Assessment               •	 Do the S&T parks cover most of the country’s research base? Are S&T parks physically
 checklist                   close to research institutions? What was the motivation for the creation of the park
                             (discuss the feasibility study/demand assessment)? Is it privately or public managed? Are
                             the parks involved in the commercialization effort? Do they provide incubation services?

vi. Science-Industry Collaboration
 Relevance to             Science-industry collaboration in R&D is a major channel of technology transfer. There is
 the outcome              ample evidence of the positive impact of joint research on business innovation in devel-
                          oped countries.3 The positive impact of science-industry collaboration on firm innovation
                          for developing countries is increasingly pointing to this direction (Crespi and Zuniga 2012).

                          There is limited understanding about market or institutional failures causing poor col-
                          laboration between science and industry. One hypothesis points to reputational issues,
                          asymmetric information, and transaction costs (Audretsch, Bönte, and Krabel 2010). Policy
                          instruments to foster science-industry joint research include research grants, matching
                          grants, and tax-incentives.
 Assessment               •	 Are there voucher schemes to promote science-industry collaboration? Is there any
 checklist                   evidence of sustained behavioral change from SMEs?
                          •	 Does the program target the private sector or PROs? Is there a focus on SMEs? What
                             are the goals of the program, eligibility criteria, and selection process? Are there any
                             other non-voucher programs?
                          •	 Are there centers of competence and centers of excellence?




4. For the United States, a study showed that firms taking part in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) with federal
laboratories were significantly superior in terms of technological performance when compared with other firms. According to Hall (2002), these
consortia agreements, backed by real budgets and cost-sharing among parties, allowed internalization of spillovers and maximization of innova-
tion possibilities and patenting.

based on the different net pay-offs embedded in the
governance/institutional regime of a given society.            Five sets of questions for assessing business innovation
When economic incentives for productive strategies             are presented below.




i. A business environment that encourages innovation
 Relevance to         In assessing the impact of public expenditures in STI, it is important to take into account
 the outcome          the business environment in which firms operate. The broad governance regime (including
                      rule of law and contract enforcement), market entry and exit, labor regulation, red tape,
                      and so forth play an important role in ensuring that research can be smoothly converted
                      into innovative products.
 Assessment           •	 Is it easy for new businesses to enter the economy?
 checklist            •	 Can start-ups and businesses readily access financing for innovative products?
                      •	 Do businesses have access to human resources with research capabilities?
                      •	 Is the legal system effective in dealing with contract enforcement issues?
                      •	 Does the government provide support for business R&D?
                      •	 Are failing businesses allowed to exit easily?


ii. Investment Readiness
 Relevance to         Timely access to mentors and networks can be critical in helping entrepreneurs who are seeking
 the outcome          to market new products or penetrate new markets. These resources help entrepreneurs gain ac-
                      cess to advice on strategic planning and marketing, financial resources, technological resources,
                      and so forth. Connection to those networks and mentors is important to avoid the creation of
                      graveyards of ideas, proof of concepts and prototypes.




                                                                                      Effectiveness Assessment        75
 Assessment             •	 Are there funding schemes for the development of proof of concepts and prototypes?

                           opment?
                        •	 Are there mentoring services for the preparation of “investable” projects? Are there con-
                           nections to potential users of the technology or possible investors?
                        •	 Are seed financing schemes available (see the discussion of the Valley of Death in box
                           7.2)? Financing is often unavailable for the additional research that is needed to move
                           beyond proof of concept, and prototypes. These activities are neither eligible for stan-
                           dard research grants nor attractive options for venture capitalists and so entrepreneurs,
                           and researchers engaged in entrepreneurial activities struggle to finance ideas that
                           would succeed were they to find the funds.

iii. The private sector has access to resources required to innovate
 Relevance to           Innovation is not cheap. By its nature, it involves a higher degree of risk than business
 the outcome            ventures that operate in established markets with tested products. Firms therefore require
                        access to cheap capital, machinery, and associated assets to be encouraged to take the risks
                        of innovation.
 Assessment             •	 Do innovating firms have access to cheap debt?
 checklist              •	 Do firms have access to equity financing? (see the discussion of the Valley of Death in
                           box 7.2)?
                        •	 Do firms have access to equipment and machinery as discuseed in the section of the
                           “Affordability and availability of machines and equipment” in the Technology Adoption
                           and Diffusion section?

iv. Government support for business R&D increases innovation 5
 Relevance to           Fiscal support compensates firms for the externalities and risks involved in the R&D activ-
 the outcome            ity. It is designed to reduce the cost of private investments and increase the volume of R&D
                        invested by the firm. The critical issue is to understand whether the incentive was generated
                        by additional investments—that is, investments that would not have been made without
                        the incentive. The number of OECD countries that implement an R&D tax incentive scheme
                        rose from 18 in 2004 to 26 in 2011.
 Assessment             •	 Are government monetary support programs for business R&D appropriately targeted?
 checklist              •	 Are support programs designed to suit the needs of the economy?
                        •	 Are the levels of direct and indirect support to private sector adequate?
                        •	 Are the administrative requirements to access and use government support compatible
                           with international good practices?

   Box 7.2: Knowledge-based Start-ups and the Valley of Death

   Knowledge-based start-up firms often need substantial, externally provided funds to successfully grow. Their need for
   funding is often greater than the funding that friends or family can offer. At the same time, these firms are often too young
   and under-developed to receive funding from more formal sources of funding such as banks, venture capital, or private
   equity funds. Studies have shown that in developing countries, friends and family usually contribute up to US$50,000,
   enough for an entrepreneur to get started but not enough to generate sufficient revenues to scale the business. To grow,
   entrepreneurs may need an injection of capital, but banks have little appetite to lend to high-risk businesses with insuf-
   ficient cash flows. Venture capital and private equity firms (which may not exist in some countries) usually do not invest
   less than US$1 million—too much for a seed-stage start-up. The resulting funding gap is called the “valley of death.” It
   can be difficult to traverse, which leads to failure of start-ups. Firms can get through the valley of death with the help of
   pre-seed funding to achieve positive cash flows and so build successful and prosperous businesses.

v. Tax Incentives for Research and Development6
 Relevance to                  Governments are increasingly relying on tax breaks to support to R&D efforts by firms. A
 the outcome                   number of studies have found that R&D tax credits increase R&D expenditure, and lead
                               to an increase in innovation.7 The economic rationale for tax breaks is that they increase
                               R&D by lowering the cost of carrying out R&D in the private sector, and thus overcome the
                               market failure that arises because the social returns from R&D are lower than the private
                               returns.

                               Tax breaks can take a number of forms. These include tax credits (and enhanced deduction
                               schemes) that allow firms to deduct R&D expenditures (or more) from their tax liabilities,
                               depreciation allowances, and unconditional cash refunds which provide benefits to compa-
                               nies that are loss making and so don’t pay taxes.

                    requires an adequate institutional framework. Government policies to support innovation

                    novation and remove bureaucratic, legislative, and regulatory obstacles to innovation—and
                    particularly technology adoption and diffusion. These obstacles often affect competition
                    laws, licenses to operate, government authorizations, technical norms and standards, and
                    customs procedures. For instance, monopoly rights may represent a barrier to the adop-
                    tion of technologies in the sense that industry insiders with monopoly rights to the current
                    technology will resist the adoption of better production techniques. This suggests that
                    more competitive economies are likely to be characterized by higher absorptive capacity.

ii. Affordability and availability of machines and equipment
 Relevance to         The acquisition of machinery and equipment represents a major source of knowledge for
 the outcome          innovation in firms. The technological know-how embodied in machinery enables firms to
                      employ more efficient production processes and thus raise the quality of their own prod-
                      ucts and processes. Embodied technology diffusion is about the introduction into produc-
                      tion processes of machinery, equipment, and components that incorporate new technology
                      developed in other firms either domestically or abroad (Papaconstantinou et al. 1996). The
                      extent to which firms can acquire machinery is defined by the availability and affordability
                      of machinery and equipment.
 Assessment           •	 Are firms able to acquire new technologies at competitive prices in local markets?
 checklist            •	 Are there high tariffs or other restrictions on the importation of machinery, equipment,
                         and intermediate goods?
                      •	 Are there restrictions or high tariffs on importation of used equipment and machinery?

                      •	 Can firms rent machines?
                      •	 What is the depreciation policy embedded in the country’s tax policy?
                      •	 Is there an adequate supply of financing instruments (at reasonable cost) for firms to
                         purchase new machinery and equipment?
                      •	 Are there shared facilities enabling firms to access high-cost and modern technologies?
                      •	 Are there sufficient skills in the local labor market to operate cutting-edge machines and
                         technologies?

iii. Technology extension services8
 Relevance to         In many countries technology extension programs fall into the category of “innovation”
 the outcome          policies and programs. However, the role of extension work within the spectrum of such
                      programs is unique. Technology extension aims to improve the productivity and competitive-
                      ness of existing businesses through the adoption of the most appropriate technologies for
                      their fields of activity. It aims to promote learning that is articulate, thoughtful, and repeat-
                      able by the companies so they are able to develop new skills for the future.

                      Several countries have programs to support manufacturing SMEs, of which comparative
                      studies have been conducted. Most developing countries face special challenges in terms
                      of the skill level of their workforce. The introduction of new technologies and processes
                      requires more carefully designed assistance processes than those used in developed coun-
                      tries. The design and implementation of technology extension programs for these countries
                      should keep this situation in mind.

                      Supplying technology extension services is not synonymous with offering financing. Support
                      or advice on access to funding sources from other agencies may be a component of im-
                      provement projects, but they are not the main focus. Typical mechanisms by which tech-

     Box 7.3: International Good Practices for the Provision of Technology Extension Services

     Demand driven/mission oriented. Technology extension programs should be geared to the needs of the industrial
     customers they serve and well informed about the nature of the demand for improvements as they feed a proactive
     vision for companies to solve their problems and make such improvements.

     Practice-oriented technology applications. The applications of technology promoted by extension service programs
     should be primarily practical and of proven value among industry leaders. Providers must avoid recommending highly
     abstract projects or innovative but untested concepts that are more appropriate in research laboratories than in SMEs
     with challenging business problems.

     Decentralization. Service centers must be distributed in regions where the demand for their assistance is documented
     and understood. Being near their customers helps providers understand regional variation in the needs of SMEs and
     makes their programs more visible and easily accessible to companies that are potential customers.

     Target SMEs. When the pressure to become self-financing becomes too high, service providers tend to migrate to more
     capable, generally larger companies that have more resources and do not need subsidized consulting. The opposite mis-
     take is focusing on micro-enterprises that do not have the capability of absorbing and leveraging the services received.
     Critical role of human resources. Staffing the program with competent personnel who are familiar with SMEs and
     the delivery of industrial extension services is absolutely critical. The desirable profile of these providers, then, has three
     dimensions: they must have knowledge of technology, knowledge of the business environment of companies, and the
     ability to communicate in interpersonal relationships that grow out of improvement projects.

iv. Standards and technical regulation9
 Relevance to           Standards and technical regulations can play an important role facilitating innovation. They
 the outcome            consist of rules and guidelines for products, processes or production methods. Compliance
                        with standards is voluntary and they can be set by the state, private sector, or civil soci-
                        ety. In contrast, technical regulations are mandatory and are typically set by the state. By
                        codifying the technical characteristics of products and processes, standards and technical
                        regulations embody technological knowledge and best practices. Because information in
                        them is nonproprietary, they create a pool of technical knowledge that can be transferred
                        across companies and countries, freely accessed by entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers,
                        and used to generate new ideas and technologies. Moreover, standardization stimulates
                        innovation by helping to build focus, cohesion and critical mass in the emerging stages of
                        technologies and markets. They also play an important role facilitating trade by reducing
                        risks and transaction costs.

                        Governments play a leading role in designing and implementing certain standards and
                        technical regulations. This includes ensuring that national standards and regulations are
                        consistent with international ones, especially those in important export markets. Govern-
                        ments can also play an important role facilitating the adoption of standards by firms which
                        may find standards to complex and demanding to implement by themselves. The state can
                        promote awareness about standards and design appropriate capacity-building programs to
                        ensure that standards do not exclude local companies from domestic and export markets.
                        A number of services that are needed by the private sector to comply with technical regula-
                        tions, standards, metrology, and quality requirements are described in table 7.2.

   Summary

   The ultimate objective of the Final Report is to provide a fact-based set of recommendations that describe how policy
   makers’ strategic goals can be achieved through policy reforms and strategic investments. These recommendations can
   take the form of a plan that links the achievement of the strategic goals to the required inputs, outputs, and outcomes.

   The Final Report recommendations arise from an analysis that complements and extends the work done in previous stages
   of the PER. The analysis begins with a review of the NIS policy mix, which considers whether policies maximize returns to
   public investment by considering their relevance, coherence, and consistency. There follows a review of the composition
   and level of spending, including issues such as the mix of direct versus indirect support to business R&D, operating versus
   capital investments, and basic versus experimental and applied research. Then, a governance analysis evaluates how poli-
   cies are made and implemented, and how to improve this process.

   The Final Report is largely based on data collected for the previous stages of the PER. This data may be complemented
   with additional material. In particular, interviews may be used to collect additional information for the governance section
   from policy makers and implementation agencies.

Box 8.1: Macro-Level Analysis on Social Returns to R&D, Infrastructure, and Human Capital

The rate of return on gross R&D investment is computed for Croatia using World Development Indicators macro-level
data. Following the methodologies used in Coe and Helpman (1995), Jones and Williams (1998), and Lederman and Maloney
(2003), the R&D capital stock is computed and then the elasticity of various output measures is found with respect to R&D
capital and computed gross rate of return (see table B8.2.1 below). Rate of return on R&D investment for GDP measured
in constant local currency unit (LCU) is 73 percent. Based on these findings, optimal amount of R&D investment can be
estimated. In Croatia this amounts to 9.23 percent of GDP. The real interest rate in Croatia between 1997 and 2010 was
around 7.3 percent. The current gross rate of return was 0.73 percent, which is close to 10 times less than real interest
rate. As a result, optimal amount of R&D expenditure would be 0.92 * 10 = 9.2 percent, where 0.92 is the average R&D
expenditure (as a percent of GDP).

Using macro-level data, there are several studies that estimate the rates of return to R&D. Among these studies, Leder-
man and Maloney (2003) use cross-country data for the 1975–2000 period and find that returns to R&D investment are
around 78 percent. They group countries according to their income levels and find: 20–40 percent as OECD average, 60
percent for medium-income countries, and around 100 percent for poor countries. Returns to R&D in developing countries
are higher than the values for industrialized countries. Coe and Helpman (1995) estimate rates of return to R&D for the
period 1991–90 and find 123 percent for the G7 and 85 percent for the remaining 15 OECD countries. The result for rate
of return obtained for Croatia is in accordance with the studies in the literature.

Canning and Bennathan (2000) compute the rate of return to infrastructure (electricity generation and paved roads) .
They find that the average return to electricity generation capacity is 40 percent where the values vary significantly across
countries. To give some examples, over their survey period, in Turkey, the rate of return was 32 percent, Portugal 7 percent,
Mexico 51 percent, and Brazil 10 percent. They find the rate of return to paved roads was 30 percent over this period. In
their study, elasticities of GDP per worker with respect to electricity services were 9 percent for a country at the median
income level and 6 percent for a country in the lower quartile. Elasticity of GDP per worker with respect to paved roads
was 9 percent for a median-income country and 5 percent for a lower-income country. In a recent study, Drezgic (2008) esti-
mates the elasticity of GDP from 1996 to 2006 across Croatian counties with respect to transport and electricity sectors. The
elasticity varied around 4.7 percent and 4.6 percent for transport and electricity sectors, respectively. In another specification
where Drezgic combines transport, electricity, and construction sectors, elasticity of GDP with respect to this combined sector
was 6 percent. Based on these estimates, rate of return on infrastructure in Croatia can be estimated using the methodology
used in Canning and Bennathan (2000). Consider as the Cobb-Douglas production function where K is physical capital, L is
labor, and X is infrastructure capital. Solving the aggregate production function, the following first order conditions are found:

     where px is rate of return to infrastructure capital and r is the rate of return to physical capital. Drezgic (2008) computes
     net capital stocks for each industry in Croatia from 1996 to 2006. He shows that electricity sector comprised around 19
     percent of total private capital stock (X = zK where z is a multiplier). The transportation sector comprised 21 percent of
     total private capital stock. Return to private capital stock which is the real interest rate, was around 7.3 percent. Using this
     information, the average rate of return on electricity and transportation sectors can be calibrated as follows:




     According to this formula and using the estimates obtained from Drezgic (2008), the rate of return to infrastructure is 34 percent
     for electricity and 32 percent for transportation, and 24 percent when electricity, transport, and construction sectors are combined.

     The literature on rates of return to human capital is much older. Psacharopoulos (1994) estimate the social returns to
     investment in education level for a large number of countries. An updated study (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2004) that
     presents results for the same countries finds that average rate of return to an additional year of schooling is 9.7 percent.
     Returns for low, middle, and high-income countries are 10.9 percent, 10.7 percent, and 7.4 percent in respective order.
     The value for Croatia is likely to be around 10.7 percent.

     These findings on rates of returns on R&D, infrastructure, and human capital show that the returns to R&D (73 percent) are quite
     significant and higher than the returns of infrastructure (around 24-34 percent) or human capital (around 10 percent) in Croatia.

  Box 8.2: The Cost of Reaching the Two Percent of GDP Target for R&D in Turkey in 2009

  A back-of-the-envelope exercise can be done to calculate the necessary variation of public sector support to accomplish
  the goal of a total R&D to GDP ratio of 2 percent. In order to do this, one has first to consider the interactions between
  business enterprise R&D (BERD) and government R&D (GERD), and assume two different ways of public R&D spending.
  The first finances specifically BERD and the latter refers to total R&D spending by the government, without consideration
  of the sector where R&D takes place (whether BERD or GERD).

  Accordingly, these two ways of public R&D spending define two kinds of business sector R&D elasticity to public sector
  R&D. The first is the elasticity of private sector financing of BERD to the government financing of BERD, which quantifies
  how much the business sector R&D performance financed by the government encourages the private sector to spend on its
  own R&D. The second is the elasticity of total R&D financed by business to the total R&D financing of the government; this
  elasticity informs how much the government financing of R&D activities in the country encourages business to invest in R&D.

  The two elasticities are estimated in a background paper (Böke 2009), which was based on annual data between 1997
  and 2007 from 36 countries. The majority of these countries are European, while others are large economies (including
  Russia, China, the United States, and Japan).a The first elasticity was inferred to be of the magnitude 2, which implies
  that an increase in government-financed BERD doubles the private financing of BERD. The second elasticity drops to a
  range 0.3 to 0.5, which means that when one takes into account the correlation of the two sources of financing without
  differentiating between the sectors in which R&D is performed, the effectiveness of government financing in crowding in
  business financing is reduced.

  In order to finally calculate the necessary variation of government expenditure in R&D (as a percent of GDP), the report
  defines three elasticity scenarios: 2; 0.3; and 0.5. The first one focuses specifically on the public financing of BERD while
  the other two relate to the total R&D spending by the government. The nuance is important because it will inform the op-
  tions on how further increases in public investment in R&D could be allocated (supporting more BERD, the first scenario; or
  keeping the current pattern of expenditures, the second or third scenarios). Solving the point elasticity equation for these
  three elasticity values, it is possible to construct three different scenarios, as summarized in table B8.2.1.b.

  If all additional public investment is allocated to finance BERD (the first scenario), public support would have to increase
  by about half a percentage point of GDP (0.56 percent), which in turn would make business R&D account for the largest
  share of R&D in the country (58 percent of the total). If one assumes public expenditures increase regardless the supported
  sector of support (scenarios 2 and 3), then the variation of public support would be in the range of 0.98 percent of GDP
  (for a elasticity of 0.5) and 1.07 percent of GDP (for a elasticity of 0.3) and business R&D would account for 25–30 percent
  of total R&D. Concentrating further increases in public investments in R&D on the support of private R&D seems therefore
  the most effective way to reach a total R&D-to-GDP ratio of 2 percent.

     a. The data on R&D expenditure is obtained from the EuroStat while the data for control variables mostly come from the World Develop-
     ment Indicators. The R&D data includes the source of the financing as well as the target sector in which the R&D is undertaken.
     b. The following point elasticity formula is assumed:
                                           Elasticity = (∆BERDexp/∆GERDexp) x (GERDexpi/BERDEXPi),
     where GERDexp is the government R&D expenditure (as % of GDP), BERDexp is the same for private R&D expenditure, and GERDexpi
     (BERDEXPi) is the baseline level of the government (private) R&D expenditure (as % of GDP). Accordingly, the elasticity can then assume
     three values: 2; 0.3; and 0.5, and once knowing the values of GERDexpi (BERDEXPi), which are the same for all the three scenarios, it is
     possible to find ∆BERDexp and ∆GERDexp.

     Box 8.4: Addressing Horizontal Bottlenecks in Innovation Policy

     An important international experience in addressing horizontal coordination issues in innovation policy is the development
     of innovation councils. The development of such councils is part of a move toward more comprehensive, integrative, in-
     novation policy making. Some countries that have moved toward such councils already had a history with organizations
     that were more narrowly focused on science and technology. For example, Finland and the Republic of Korea have had
     science and technology (S&T) councils established for decades. However, at present, no dominant structure seems to have
     emerged. Rather, the success of innovation councils depends largely on the council’s composition, mandate, and functioning.

     For example, all relevant stakeholders may be formally represented at the council, but the implementation structure of the
     council’s recommendations is not clear. Or it may be the case that the horizontal dimension has identified the right goals and
     cross-ministerial planning works, but the ministries or other agencies assigned with policy implementation in the vertical dimen-
     sion (such as S&T or the environment) are not implementing well. Stakeholders can also differ, or very little effort may be made
     to engage the relevant stakeholders in the design and implementation process. Finally, policy measures to achieve innovation
     policy goals may differ. The main innovation policy measure is resource allocation for R&D, but in many cases this may not be a
     sufficient measure to achieve the desired results. Therefore a number of other regulative and fiscal measures may be required.
     The composition of the innovation council can also be only a partial reflection of the relevant stakeholders, due to reasons
     of institutional tradition or otherwise. For example, S&T policies may monopolize the state budget’s allocations for R&D.

Table A.1 includes a number of key definitions from the Frascati Manual (OECD 2002).


Table A.1: Key Definitions

Term                          Definition

Abroad                        All institutions and individuals located outside the political borders of a country, except vehicles,
                              ships, aircraft and space satellites operated by domestic entities and testing grounds acquired by such
                              entities.
                              All international organizations (except business enterprises), including facilities and operations within
                              the country’s borders.

Applied research              Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is,
                              however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.

Basic research                Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of
                              the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or
                              use in view.

Business enterprise sector    All firms, organizations and institutions whose primary activity is the market production of goods or
                              services (other than higher education) for sale to the general public at an economically significant
                              price.
                              The private non-profit institutions mainly serving them.

Capital expenditures          Capital expenditures are the annual gross expenditures on fixed assets used in the R&D programmes
                              of statistical units. They should be reported in full for the period when they took place and should not
                              be registered as an element of depreciation.

Experimental development      Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and
                              practical experience, that is directed to producing new materials, products and devices; to installing
                              new processes, systems and services; or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.

Extramural expenditures       Extramural expenditures are the sums a unit, organization or sector reports having paid or committed
                              themselves to pay to another unit, organization or sector for the performance of R&D during a specific
                              period. This includes acquisition of R&D performed by other munits and grants given to others for
                              performing R&D.

Government (for purposes of   Central or federal government should always be included.
GBAORD)                       Provincial or state government should be included when its contribution is significant.
                              Local government funds (i.e. those raised by local taxes) should
                              be excluded.

                                   such as R&D managers, administrators, and clerical staff.
Research and experimental          Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic
development (R&D)                  basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society,
                                   and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.
Researchers                        Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products,
                                   processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned.
Technicians and equivalent staff   Technicians and equivalent staff are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and
                                   experience in one or more fields of engineering, physical and life sciences or social sciences and
                                   humanities. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the
                                   application of concepts and operational methods, normally under the supervision of researchers.
                                   Equivalent staff perform the corresponding R&D tasks under the supervision of researchers in the
                                   social sciences and humanities.
