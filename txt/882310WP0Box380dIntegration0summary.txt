This document, on the use of ICTs for Regional Trade and Integration in
Africa, is the summary of the full thematic study which was carried out by
a team from ict Development Associates led by David Souter and com-
prising Lishan Adam, Abiodun Jagun and Tusu Tusubira. The full report is
available at www.eTransformAfrica.org. This document forms chapter eight
of the publication edited by Enock Yonazi, Tim Kelly, Naomi Halewood
and Colin Blackman (2012) “eTransform Africa: The Transformational Use
of ICTs in Africa.”

    ICTs for

and integration
   in Africa
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have
the potential to transform business and government in Africa,
driving entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth.
A new flagship report – eTransform Africa – produced
by the World Bank and the African Development Bank,
with the support of the African Union, identifies best
practice in the use of ICTs in key sectors of the African
economy. Under the theme “Transformation-Ready”,
the growing contribution of ICTs to Agriculture, Climate
Change Adaptation, Education, Financial Services,
Government Services and Health is explored. In addition,
the report highlights the role of ICTs in enhancing African
regional trade and integration as well as the need to build
a competitive ICT industry to promote innovation, job
creation and the export potential of African companies.

    Performance Index. A recent World
    Bank report suggests that the conti-
    nent is losing billions of dollars in rev-
    enue as a result.

    Regional integration is crucial to re-
    ducing non-tariff requirements and
    improving cross-border infrastruc-
    ture and coordination, which in turn
    reduce trade costs and improve trade
    performance. The African Union sup-
    ports regional integration through
    eight Regional Economic Communi-
    ties (RECs)1, which have some over-
    lapping membership. Some of these
    have implemented free trade zones
    and four (COMESA, EAC, ECOWAS
    and SADC) have implemented or are
    implementing custom unions, with
    further progress anticipated towards
    common market principles. The re-
    maining RECs have failed to achieve
    comparable integration.

    Trade barriers are strongest at criti-
    cal points along the supply chain
    between producers and consumers
    of goods and services, particularly
    points of entry/exit between countries.
    These are illustrated in Figure 1, to-
    gether with the main actors involved at
    each stage.
