                                    Results for Development Institute (R4D) is a nonprofit organization
                                    whose mission is to unlock solutions to tough development challenges
                                    that prevent people in low- and middle-income countries from realizing
                                    their full potential. Using varied approaches in multiple sectors, including
                                    global education, global health, governance, and market dynamics, R4D
                                    supports the discovery and implementation of new ideas for reducing
                                    poverty and improving lives around the world.

                                    The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) is a global
                                    partnership program administered by the World Bank. It was established
                                    in 2003 to develop output-based aid (OBA) approaches across a variety
                                    of sectors — among them water, energy, health, and education. As of
                                    September 2015, through a portfolio of 44 projects with US$228 million
                                    in commitments for subsidy funding and ongoing technical assistance
                                    activities, GPOBA is demonstrating that OBA can deliver a diverse range
                                    of services and lasting results for the poor. The program’s current donors
                                    are the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development

  Some RBF schemes provide upfront financing,               components to fill current gaps in the evidence base.

  supplies, or opportunity costs that reduce demand
  for education; while others channel funds directly
  to recipient governments and do not seek to
  specifically target demand-side barriers to education.
  This is important in the context of education where
  costs and fees can vary dramatically by level or by
  sector. Moreover, certain education sub-sectors or
  interventions face much greater upfront costs, such
  as tertiary education or school construction, which
  can influence the applicability of RBF if the specific
  RBF scheme in question does not provide pre-

  Key takeaways:
  •	 OBA is a versatile tool that can be applied to address issues in education related to access, quality, and
     system inefficiencies.

  •	 Through a range of targeting mechanisms, OBA is well-placed to target those left behind: poor and
     disadvantaged, girls, orphans and vulnerable children, disabled children or adults, indigenous populations/
     ethnic minorities, adults lacking a complete education, etc.

  •	 Government support and buy-in for the project is often important to determining the project’s likely
     sustainability. Active engagement with government at the relevant decision-making level was seen to be a
     determinant for the success of several OBA education projects.

  •	 More projects should incorporate evaluations into their design and implementation, especially in
     education, where the overall evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of results-based approaches
     remains relatively weak.

  •	 Very few OBA education projects have scaled and sustained financially. It is important that projects are
     designed with future scaling and sustainability in mind and that potential pathways to scale are identified
     from inception.

  Based on these characteristics, our analysis suggests that OBA may be a particularly promising approach in:

      •	 Early childhood development (very little application to date), vocational training (some application to date), and potentially
         higher education (no application to date) – with an emphasis on excluded and disadvantaged groups. These education
         sub-sectors typically have fees associated with them, are not guaranteed to be provided by the government, and often are
         provided by private sector providers.
      •	 Application through existing PPP interventions, in country contexts characterized by a favorable environment for PPPs.
      •	 De-centralized education systems, where service providers may be more likely to have higher degrees of autonomy.
      •	 Contexts with high levels of inequity in education.


  Moving forward, the OBA education field could be strengthened by:

      •	 Further implementation and testing of OBA approaches in education to better understand contextual and design factors
         that lead to program success, particularly in education sub-sectors with fewer projects (e.g. early childhood education).
      •	 More OBA education projects incorporating evaluations into their design and implementation. This is particularly important
         in the education sector, where the overall evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of results-based approaches
         remains relatively weak.
      •	 Further research to determine factors that lead to scale and sustainability of OBA education projects, once more examples
         OBA education projects that have sustained and scaled over time exist.


  Finally, this report has also shed light on a number of outstanding questions which would benefit from further research:
      •	 Emerging evidence suggests that the autonomy of the service provider is more important than whether it is public or
         private. However, further research into the impact of service provider autonomy on the effectiveness of OBA education
         projects is needed.
      •	 The ideal amount of upfront financing to provide in OBA education projects, which sufficiently motivates them to meet
         outcomes but does not compromise program quality, remains an open question.
      •	 More explicit data gathering is required among OBA education projects to determine whether an OBA approach improves
         the level of innovation and efficiency of service providers.

                      •	 OBA can be applied to address issues in education relating to access (e.g. low equity, high tuition costs or
                         household education-related costs, inadequate access to skills training programs, inadequate supply of
                         education inputs or services), quality, and system inefficiencies (e.g. excess costs, lack of autonomy of or
                         competition between service providers).
Rationale             •	 Ways in which OBA can be applied to address these issues include: subsidies to cover the costs of schooling
                         or skills training programs; support for the construction of new schools or service providers; support for
                         the financing of programs that otherwise would not have been implemented; and payments to incentivize
                         improvements in attendance (or enrollment, retention, or completion) rates, equity, learning outcomes,
                         school inputs, or employment rates.

                      •	 Active government support and buy-in for the project is often important in determining the likelihood of the
                         project’s sustainability.
                      •	 Adequate country capacity and institutional development likely plays an important role in the implementation
                         of successful, and in particular, sustainable, OBA education projects.
                      •	 Other factors that appear to facilitate project success are past experience of the implementing agency in
Context                  working in the selected project provinces and areas in which local communities have a history of engagement
                         with education issues.
                      •	 In a number of cases, OBA approaches were applied in contexts where there was strong private sector
                         delivery of education services. This may be due in part to the public sector’s own capacity constraints to
                         deliver equitable and quality education and/or a predominance of private institutions, as well as an attempt
                         to reach disadvantaged students through private providers. However, this is not a pre-requisite for the
                         implementation of successful or sustainable OBA projects.

                      •	 Donors may need to provide capacity building support, and should be sensitive to the local context to ensure
                         project expectations are realistic and appropriate.
                      •	 Early engagement of the government, especially at the decision-making level, is important for, though does not
                         guarantee, future project sustainability.
                      •	 The implementing agency should be well-known and trusted in the communities in which the project is
                         operating.
                      •	 More important than whether a service provider is public or private is the degree of autonomy it has, and by
Institutional setup      extension, its ability to implement changes required to achieve targets. Even if a provider has the autonomy to
                         determine the optimal use of funds to make improvements, it still must have the ability and capacity to do so. In
                         addition it is important that service providers understand how the OBA system works and trust that it will work
                         well.
                      •	 Community engagement, often facilitated by local organizations working under the implementing agency, is
                         important for project success.
                      •	 Given that OBA is a relatively new approach, convincing various stakeholders to buy into the idea of using OBA
                         can be challenging. Common concerns include skepticism of the effectiveness of OBA and fear of perverse
                         incentives. Clear communication with project stakeholders is important to mitigate these concerns.

                      •	 All OBA projects reviewed targeted poor students. Additional beneficiary groups targeted include girls, orphans
                         and vulnerable children, disabled children or adults, indigenous populations/ethnic minorities, and adults
                         lacking a complete education.
                      •	 Projects reviewed used a range of targeting mechanisms to reach beneficiaries, including means-tested,
                         geographic, self-selection, school-based, community-based, and random (as part of an RCT).
                      •	 Service providers may be less willing to enroll certain populations such as the poor and disadvantaged, who
                         may be harder to retain or less likely to meet performance targets. To counter this tendency, several projects
                         made use of weighted subsidies and bonus awards to target particular sub-groups.
                      •	 The appropriate targeting mechanism for an OBA education project is likely to depend on the context in
Targeting                which it is being applied, the available capacity for administering the targeting mechanism, and the project’s
mechanisms               ultimate objective.
                        •	 Means-tested targeting is more accurate than other targeting methods but also more costly and
                           administratively burdensome to implement. It may be appropriate where there is a significant risk that
                           without it, subsidies could end up benefiting non-poor students.
                        •	 Geographic targeting may be an appropriate option in contexts where certain areas are characterized by
                           very low education outcomes, or where beneficiaries are grouped closely together.
                        •	 Self-selection targeting is relatively low-cost and administratively easy to implement; however, it is
                           important to ensure that the education services subsidized will in fact target the intended beneficiaries.
                      •	 In selecting schools to take part in the program, projects used criteria including sector (public or private),
                         exam performance, student-teacher ratios, infrastructure availability, enthusiasm of faculty, and geography.




Paying for Performance: An Analysis of Output-Based Aid in Education	5

                         •	 Reviewed projects implemented or suggested a number of measures to encourage service providers to take
                            on performance risk, and ensure that such levels of risk are not disproportionate to what service providers can
                            reasonably bear.
                         •	 A common method was the provision of some amount of upfront payment, as most schools or training
      Performance risk      providers are likely to lack access to pre-financing. However, the ideal amount of upfront financing that
                            will both suit the needs of service providers while still motivating them to improve outcomes is yet to be
                            determined and may vary by context and type of provider.
                         •	 Other methods of mitigating performance risk included: (1) providing training and capacity building to school
                            staff, including teachers, (2) active community engagement, (3) knowledge sharing and peer-learning, (4)
                            improving student preparation, and (5) payment flexibility and pro-rating payments.

      efficiency
                         •	 More explicit data gathering is required among OBA education projects to determine whether an OBA
                            approach does generate a positive impact on the level of innovation and efficiency of service providers.

                         •	 Projects used a range of indicators to set and measure progress towards targets, related to both access and
                            quality of education. The most common indicators used were test scores and enrollment rates.
                         •	 Indicators used related to increasing education access included enrollment, promotion rates, attendance,
                            training completion, and exam participation.
                         •	 Quality indicators used by projects reviewed can broadly be categorized into learning outcomes (e.g. test
                            scores, GPA rates), labor market outcomes (e.g. salary, employment), and school inputs that can contribute to
                            improved school outcomes (e.g. pedagogy, school management, teacher attendance, school management
                            committee participation).
                         •	 Several projects used intermediate indicators such as pedagogy, school management, teacher attendance,
      Outputs
                            and school management committee participation. While these are not direct proxies for learning outcomes,
                            they may be easier to improve in the short term and thus useful to include as indicators in addition to
                            outcomes.
                         •	 Some schemes used a single indicator, while others used multiple indicators. Using few indicators may reduce
                            costs while using a greater number can help to ensure the achievement of a wider range of targets.
                         •	 In tying payments to indicators, there is a risk of creating perverse incentives (e.g. motivation to cheat or teach
                            to the test); it is important to design indicators to minimize the likelihood of perverse consequences.
                         •	 When deciding upon indicators for a project, it is important to involve relevant stakeholders in the process, so
                            that they understand and are in approval of the indicators used.

                         •	 Payment types for the OBA projects reviewed generally fell into two categories: payments to cover costs of
                            delivery of education services (subsidies) or incentive payments. Subsidy payments were typically much larger
                            than incentive payments.
                         •	 The majority of projects reviewed provided payments on a per-student basis, but some projects provided
                            payments in lump sums per institution. Payments often varied based on factors related to the types of
                            students targeted, services provided, and type of institution.
      Subsidy            •	 While not technically OBA, teacher incentive payments are included as components of some OBA projects.
      calculation           Depending on how they are structured, teacher incentive payments may be politically controversial.
      and delivery       •	 Payments may be calculated using different functions, including based on a step function (full amount
      mechanisms            released upon achievement of set targets), incremental function (payments are disbursed based on units
                            of improvement), the provider’s ranking (providers receive payment if they achieve a certain ranking in
                            comparison with other service providers), or a combination of multiple functions.
                         •	 It is important to consider what percentage of payments should be disbursed in a results-based way, so that
                            payments both sufficiently motivate service providers and remain palatable enough to them that they seek to
                            participate in the program.
                         •	 Payment may need to be accompanied by other components, such as information sharing or support on how
                            to improve practices in order to be effective.

                 •	 Reviewed OBA projects used a range of methods for collecting and managing data to monitor the fulfillment
                    of outputs. These included the use of: Education Management Information Systems (EMIS), independent data
                    collection systems, school-generated reports, new certification/assessment systems, national exams, open
                    source platforms, annual census data, and community surveys.

                 •	 Though use of EMIS may be ideal from a cost and sustainability standpoint, issues with data quality and access
                    may create challenges that necessitate the use of other monitoring systems in addition to or instead of EMIS,
                    and/or significant capacity building, to achieve the quality of data management required in OBA projects.

                 •	 Few OBA education programs reviewed have undergone an external impact assessment or cost-effectiveness
                    analyses. Projects should incorporate evaluations into their design and implementation, especially in
Evaluation          education, where the evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of results-based approaches remains
                    relatively weak. The concurrent use of qualitative evaluation approaches can help provide clarity around
                    specific pathways to achieving desired outcomes in education.

                    However, even if government take-up occurs, capacity building may still be necessary, and the program may
                    be at risk of unpredictable financial flows if the government faces difficult times financially or as a result of

                 •	 It is important that projects are designed with future scaling and sustainability in mind, and that potential

     	It is important to note that the above characterizations are based on typical lower and lower-middle income country contexts, and not high-income
      country contexts. It is also important to note that the education landscape inherently varies by country and by region, and that there are of course
      exceptions to the general landscape portrayed here. For instance, there are examples of service provision in every education type/level described here that
      are freely provided without user fees (the most obvious example being public primary education, though even some sub-sectors that charge user fees are
      also often provided freely by NGOs, for example).

       24 projects were identified as standalone OBA
       projects or as having components that met the
       definition of OBA.16 These projects were profiled,
       with a diverse range of available qualitative and
       quantitative information gathered on each project.
       This information is available in the database of OBA
       education projects compiled by R4D.

       This section of the report describes the range
       of approaches used by OBA education projects,
       analyzes common characteristics and themes
       that emerge among them, and highlights relevant
       components of specific project examples. The
       analysis covers OBA projects at all stages of
       development, including those that are now
       completed, those currently under implementation
       (both pilot and more mature projects), and
       projects that have been scaled-up. The goal of
       this analysis was to identify the factors that appear
       to be necessary for both effective, and ultimately,
       sustainable OBA projects in education.

 The component of this program highlighted is not strictly OBA, as performance-based payments are made to the Benazir Income Support Program
rather than to service providers, as in other examples listed above. However, outputs remain under the control of the service providers, hence the
inclusion of the project in this table

                                                          that RBF is a relatively new funding mechanism,

                                                          have important implications for any analysis regarding

                                                          can be learned from early-stage projects, they are

       The nature of OBA in education and in other sectors
       is such that in addition to the mechanisms used for
       collecting data related to project outputs analyzed
       above, projects are also required to conduct some
       form of verification (generally independent verification)
       of the data collected. Below is an overview of
       the most common approaches to independent
       verification noted in the projects reviewed.

            	The organization did not have strong relationships with communities outside those in which it worked, and as a result of the unstable environment in
             the region, approaching external communities could have posed security threats to the implementers. This raises the question as to whether quasi-
             experimental evaluation designs of OBA projects are feasible in such fragile-state contexts.
       39
         	It should be noted that there may be routes to sustaining the program’s impacts outside of continued funding. As with all development programs, the goal
          of OBA is to ultimately incentivize behavior change such that the program is no longer necessary. It is possible that OBA programs may influence behavior
          such that the impacts of the program (e.g. enrollment or achievement of underserved students) remain while the program no longer is in existence.
          However, given the paucity of evidence around OBA in education, it is difficult to say whether this claim can be supported; further research would be

Case studies of sustainable
OBA education projects
The number of OBA education projects reviewed that
have demonstrated sustainability over time are limited,
however, below two such examples are highlighted:


  Case Study 1: Foundation Assisted Schools Program
  The Pakistan Foundation Assisted Schools (FAS) program, run by the government-supported Punjab Education Foundation,
  provides monthly subsidies to support low-cost private schools in the region conditional upon them meeting specified
  target pass rates on standardized exams. FAS was started by the government in 2005 and remains primarily government-
  funded, with additional support from the World Bank. The government plans to continue funding the program. Key factors
  highlighted by the World Bank that have contributed to the program’s sustainability and success include:
  •	 The World Bank’s method of working with the government, where it supports the government’s own program, even if
     improvements are made slowly
  •	 High quality research into the region and context in which they planned to operate
  •	 Strict program entrance requirements for participating schools
  •	 Strict adherence to the RBF model, under which the threat to schools of losing the subsidy for failing to meet targets is real
  •	 Cost-effectiveness of the program
  In addition, while not currently realized, there is the possibility that the program could be self-sustaining through the use
  of its endowment to generate funds for program continuation.




  Case Study 2: Chile Lifelong Learning and Training Project
  In the Chile Lifelong Learning and Training Project, basic and secondary education opportunities for adults were offered
  through public and private institutions, which received payment upon demonstrating student completion of learning
  modules. The World Bank-funded program took place from 2002-2009, and as of 2012, the government of Chile was
  continuing to fund the program. Similarly to the Foundation Assisted Schools program, the program was primarily
  government-funded from the beginning, with a small funding contribution from the World Bank (project lead interview).
  Substantial government involvement likely contributed to the sustainability of the project: government actors at both
  national and local levels were critically involved in project oversight and implementation, the government contributed
  significantly to program costs and increased its commitment over the course of the project, and there was a strong sense
  of government ownership. Additional success factors included the close incorporation of stakeholders into designing
  the program, a balance between the empowerment of central and regional governments, and that the provision of adult
  education services was demand-driven.

Annex 1: Results-based financing schemes in education
                                                Cash on Delivery (COD) Aid

                   Cash on Delivery Aid (COD), proposed by the Center for Global Development (CGD) in 2010, is a form of RBF that
                   emphasizes country ownership. Payment is disbursed to the highest level of the recipient country government,
 Definition and    contingent upon the demonstration of results, with funders taking a “hands-off” approach to program
 overview          implementation to allow the government flexibility. According to CGD, the five key principles of COD Aid are: (1)
                   Payment for outcomes, not outputs, (2) Hands-off implementation, (3) Independent verification of progress, (4)
                   Transparency through Public Dissemination, and (5) Complementarity with other aid programs (Birdsall et al. 2010).


                   COD is distinct from other types of RBF in three key ways (Birdsall and Perakis 2012):
                   •	 Central government as primary actor: Funds are disbursed to, and responsibility for demonstrating results
                      linked with, the highest level of government possible, ideally the central government. A more realistic
                      application of COD may be between donors and specific government ministries (e.g. the Ministry of
                      Education) (expert interview).
 Differentiating   •	 An emphasis on “hands-off” implementation: Funders cannot design or demand any particular intervention
 characteristics      or investment, affirming recipients’ responsibility and authority to implement development programs in their
 from other           country. This is intended to provide governments with the flexibility to design and implement their own
 forms of RBF         programs and policies, builds local capacity, and promote country ownership.
                   •	 Transparency through public dissemination: The content of the COD contract, the program’s progress, and
                      payments are transparently and publicly disseminated, the theory of change being that this will enable civil
                      society to hold the government accountable for quality and quantity of its services.
                   COD differs from OBA in that it does not address a specific funding gap (in the way that OBA subsidies seek to
                   do), but rather it is an incentive payment to a government for a specific output (Mumssen et al. 2010).


                   The primary advantage of COD aid, according to proponents, is its potential to support systems strengthening
                   through country ownership. Since payments are not tied to specific inputs, recipients are free to address constraints
                   in any sector. The recipient government can implement locally appropriate solutions and be responsive to local
                   changes. Technical assistance is provided only upon the recipient government’s request, rather than assistance needs
                   being determined by the donor. Removing funder involvement in program implementation provides an additional
                   advantage through reducing administrative costs (Birdsall and Savedoff 2010).
 Major
                   A real risk of COD is that it may be difficult to convince donors to take a fully “hands-off approach” (expert

 and risks
                   willing to take on the sizeable risk inherent in reforming systems (de Renzio and Woods 2008). Disbursing funds
                   to high levels of government produces additional risk, as funds may not end up with the agencies or providers
                   for whom they would be most effective (Boissiere 2008).
                   COD (as with other forms of RBF) also runs the risk of creating incentives for cheating and distortions in systems
                   and objectives. In the case of COD, given that the source of funding is from external donors, there is a risk of
                   donor domination of objectives (as opposed to donor intervention in instruments and processes).


                   A current DFID-funded pilot of COD in Ethiopia focuses on secondary school education, with DFID issuing
 Illustrative      payments to the Ministry of Education for the number of students above the national baseline that take or
 example in        pass the 10th grade examination. Payments will be higher for girls and students from disadvantaged areas. A

                   existing support in the education sector (Birdsall and Perakis 2012).

                                        Debt-swaps and loan buy-downs for education

                         In a debt buy-down, a third party (e.g. a multilateral aid institution) buys down all or part of a loan between a
       Definition and    country and a creditor, possibly contingent upon using the released funds for domestic development reforms
       overview          or programs (R4D 2013b). In a debt swap, a creditor forgives a country’s debt conditional on the debtor making
                         funding available for specified development projects (UNESCO 2011).


       Differentiating   Debt swaps and buy-downs are differentiated from other RBF as follows:
       characteristics   •	 Unlike other RBF mechanisms mentioned, the financing tool used is not loans or grants but rather debt forgiveness.
       from other        •	 Payment is not necessarily conditional upon demonstrating results; tying payments to specific outcomes or
       forms of RBF         “triggers” is optional (R4D 2013b).


                         Debt swaps provide additional sources of aid funding, which may supplement aid programs rather than
                         replacing one program for another. Additionally, the structure may allow for spending more resources on
       Major             education in large countries by circumventing the spending limit, which GPE has set at $100m (R4D 2013b).
       advantages        Neither debt swaps nor buy-downs have a mandatory focus on results (the use of triggers is optional), and a
       and risks         number of questions about buy-downs in education still need to be answered, including country, donor, and
                         lender interest and effectiveness of triggers (R4D 2013b). These mechanisms therefore, based on how they are
                         designed, may have less of a results-orientation than others reviewed in this section.


                         A debt swap was conducted between France and Cameroon from 2007-2011, with France releasing 1.17 billion
                         euros of Cameroon’s debt, part of which was agreed to be used to support Cameroon’s Education Sector
       Illustrative
                         Strategy. The strategy focused on increasing the number of contract teachers and building schools. The
       example in
                         program was able to hire the target number of teachers, with success being due to strong government and
       education
                         donor support. However, high administrative costs were seen, largely due to a complex system of requirements
                         utilized to ensure funds were spent properly (UNESCO 2011).


                         Debt buy-downs have been limited in number, with most in the health sector and only one in education
       Applications      between DFID and China in 2003. Debt swaps have a longer history, with the first debt swaps occurring in the
       to date           1980s. Education-focused swaps have been implemented by countries including Spain, Italy, and Germany
                         (UNESCO 2011).

                                                     Output-Based Aid (OBA)

                   OBA is a type of RBF pioneered by the World Bank. OBA “ties the disbursement of public funding in the form of subsidies
                   to the achievement of clearly specified results that directly support improved access to basic services” (Mumssen et
                   al. 2010). Specifically, OBA takes two main forms: (1) funding to buy down the capital costs of investment required to
Definition and
                   deliver a particular service, or (2) funding in the form of a subsidy to close the gap between what beneficiaries can pay
overview
                   for a social service and the costs incurred by the service provider. It should be noted that OBA can take different forms in
                   different sectors. For a program to be classified as OBA, it must involve contracts with service providers that transfer risk to
                   service providers by linking output/outcome delivery to subsidy disbursements or capitation payments.

                   OBA is primarily differentiated from other forms of RBF in several respects:
                   •	 The focus of OBA is on service provision (access and quality). The service provider, typically private, is the primary
                      actor: funds are distributed to the provider, who is responsible for demonstrating results. Funds typically either flow
                      through the government or through an intermediary implementing agency.
                   •	 The service provider bears performance risk. This differentiates OBA from CCTs, for example, in which funding goes
Differentiating       to households.
characteristics    •	 Funding is provided in the form of targeted subsidies for service provision – intended to create opportunities for
from other forms      service providers to offer a service that otherwise may not have been financially attractive. In particular, one goal of
of RBF                OBA is to incentivize private-sector providers to focus explicitly on the poor.
                   •	 Explicit focus on increasing the engagement of private sector capital and expertise (Mumssen et al. 2010). Other than
                      SIBs and DIBs, no other RBF scheme reviewed has an explicit focus on leveraging the private sector.

                   OBA contracts typically specify one or very few outcomes, which may contrast to other RBF schemes in education
                   such as COD that specify much broader outcomes (Pearson et al. 2010).

                   Through working directly with third-party private providers, OBA may be best suited to encourage innovation and
                   experimentation at the level of the service provider relative to other forms of RBF. Unhampered by government
                   bureaucracy, private actors are often able to improve their methods of service provision faster than public sector
                   providers, using a focus on results as incentive to identify provision methods that are cost-effective and efficient
                   (Mumssen et al. 2010). As they are generally faster to adapt, private providers may also be more willing to accept results-
                   based contracts than public providers. These types of contracts involve modifying not only possibly their service delivery
                   methods but also operational functions to be able to pre-finance activities as funding is received ex-post as opposed to
                   ex-ante, as well as creating or modifying data collection methods to suit the OBA contract requirements.
Major advantages
                   OBA approaches that work entirely outside of the public sector risk weakening government systems by circumventing
and risks
                   public systems, which has been identified as poor aid practice, and risk not obtaining government buy-in from the start,
                   which can limit projects’ potential for scale up. Many OBA projects work in close partnership with government, and OBA
                   was originally set up as a public-private partnership mechanism (Mumssen et al. 2013). In education, there is significant
                   scope for governments to contract out some education services to the private sector (either for-profit or NGOs).
                   Additionally, OBA requires the service provider to pre-finance its activities, which it may find more difficult to do so
                   than a government agency, who may be able to pre-finance programs with other forms of input-based aid. Within
                   the education sector, OBA approaches that focus on private providers may face difficulties reaching scale, given that
                   education remains overwhelmingly delivered through the public sector.

                   An example of a “pure” OBA project in education is the Vietnam Upper Secondary Education Enhancement Project,
                   funded by GPOBA and launched in 2010 in partnership with East Meets West Foundation, which aimed to increase
                   access to secondary education for poor and disadvantaged students. Targeted students in selected districts received
                   tuition reimbursements to attend a private or semi-private secondary school conditional upon maintaining a set GPA,
                   attendance record, and behavior standards. Schools took on performance risk by making upfront tuition payments and
                   receiving reimbursement from GPOBA after student performance indicators were verified. The project ran from 2010-
                   2013 (East Meets West Foundation 2014).
                   The current GPOBA database contains other examples of education projects that have been classified as OBA. Often
Illustrative       such projects do not meet the “pure” definition of OBA (which is reflected in the Vietnam example above), but rather
example in         include specific and discrete components that are OBA-based. For example, The Bangladesh Female Secondary
education          School Assistance Project (FSSAP) funded by the World Bank and running from 1994 to 2001 has been classified as an
                   example of a project in education that employs an OBA component by the World Bank (Mumssen et al. 2010) and the
                   GPOBA database. The project as a whole is more akin to a CCT (and is included as such in the literature on CCTs, see
                   Fiszbein et al. 2009), in that it aimed to increase the number and performance of female students attending secondary
                   school, by providing stipends and tuition for female students who attended school for at least 75 percent of the year
                   and who received a score of at least 45 percent on annual exams. The specific OBA component of this project (and
                   the reason for which it is classified as OBA) is due to the fact that “performance-bonuses to schools are linked to
                   female enrollment, among other indicators” (GPOBA database). In identifying other applications of OBA in education,
                   we therefore acknowledge that the number of “pure” examples may be limited, and that instead programs may have
                   specific components that use OBA.

                   Since 2002, there have been nearly 200 OBA projects implemented worldwide, approximately two-thirds by
Applications       the World Bank. Projects are relatively evenly distributed across the sectors of transport, water and sanitation,
to date            energy, health, and ICT, with a small number of education projects, though total subsidy volumes by sector vary
                   significantly (Mumssen et al. 2010). This study identified 24 OBA projects in education.

                            Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) and Development Impact Bonds (DIBs)

                         SIBs and DIBs involve cooperation between public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Investors provide funding
       Definition and    to implement programs through service providers, managed by an intermediary, which also collects data and
       overview          monitors progress. If progress is shown, government (in SIBs) and/or public funders (in DIBs) pay investors pay
                         back with returns dependent on the level of success (Development Impact Bond Working Group 2013).


       Differentiating
       characteristics   The primary differentiating factor in SIBs/DIBs is that investors provide funds to allow the service provider to pre-
       from other        finance the program. This is the only mechanism that addresses this issue directly (expert interview).
       forms of RBF


                         The provision of pre-financing through investor involvement is a clear advantage for service providers, which
                         may have difficulty securing pre-financing otherwise. In addition, SIB funding is generally additional to what
                         otherwise would be available from donors, CSOs, and private philanthropies. Finally, through heavy private
                         sector involvement, SIBs/DIBs tend to adopt a “private sector mentality,” resulting in a greater focus on rigorous
       Major             measurement and efficiency (expert interview).
       advantages        However, due to the large number of actors involved in SIBs/DIBs (including an intermediary), SIBs/DIBs can be
       and risks         very complex, time-consuming, and costly to set up and run (Bellinger and Fletcher 2014). In addition, to the
                         extent the project achieves its objectives, an entity is required to pay back the SIB investor. This means that the
                         commitment of donors, CSOs, and private philanthropies is therefore a prerequisite to SIBs. Furthermore, as
                         with OBA, there is the risk that if the project is not designed with sufficient buy-in from government, its chances
                         of being replicated even if it succeeds may be low.


                         In June 2014, a DIB was launched focusing on education in Rajasthan, India. Educate Girls will run programs
       Illustrative      with the goal of increasing student academic performance as well as increasing attendance of female students.
       example in        Upfront investment is provided by the UBS Optimus Foundation, and if Educate Girls demonstrates success,
       education         the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation will repay investors, with repayment rates higher the greater the
                         success. The setup is being managed by an intermediary, Instiglio (Perakis 2014).


                         Besides the Rajasthan DIB mentioned above, 13 education-related SIBs have been implemented in the US and UK,
                         12 of which focus on vocational education. Ten have been implemented by the Department of Work and Pensions
       Applications
                         in the UK to reduce unemployment among young people, and one each has been implemented in Massachusetts
       to date
                         and New York to improve employment outcomes among those who have been formerly incarcerated. The final
                         education SIB focuses on improving preschool education in Utah (Bloomgarden et al. 2014).



                                                       Teacher Performance Pay

                         In a performance-based payment model, teachers receive payments based on their performance along certain
                         metrics. Payments are most commonly based upon outcomes (e.g. student performance on assessments), but
       Definition and    can also be based upon outputs or intermediate outcomes (e.g. attendance). Performance payment can take
       overview          place at the individual level (in which one teacher receives payments based on his/her performance) or at the
                         group level (where all teachers at a school receive payments based on the overall performance of the school)
                         (Bruns et al. 2011).


       Differentiating
       characteristics   Unlike any of the other forms of RBF reviewed, performance pay is targeted at teachers, rather than the school
       from other        or provider level, like OBA, or at the student level, as in CCTs.
       forms of RBF


                         In theory, linking teacher pay to student performance should improve outcomes by aligning teacher incentives.
                         Evidence is mixed: there is some evidence that performance pay is effective in improving student test scores in
                         India, Israel, and Kenya, though no effect was found in multiple studies conducted in the US (Loyalka 2015).
                         Tying pay to teacher performance risks creating perverse incentives, such as incentivizing teaching to the
       Major             test, focusing only on students around the target performance threshold, and cheating. These risks point to
       advantages        the importance of having a payment setup that is well-designed (Muralidharan 2011; Lavy 2007). Lavy (2007)
       and risks         emphasizes that the system must “align performance with ultimate outcomes and must be monitored closely to
                         discourage gaming if not outright fraud in measured output. Goals should be attainable. Incentives should balance
                         individual rewards with school incentives, fostering a cooperative culture but not at the expense of free riding. All
                         teachers should be eligible for the incentive offered, but only a subset of teachers should be rewarded in practice.
                         If too many teachers are rewarded, teachers may not need to exert much extra effort to benefit.”

                   A study conducted by Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011) in India examined the effects of group and
                   individual teacher bonuses tied to student exam performance. Both types of incentives were found to be
 Illustrative      effective in improving test scores through motivating more effective teaching, and incentives were found to be
 example in        more cost-effective than providing school inputs. Another study in Kenya (Glewwe et al. 2010), looked at the
 education         impact of a performance pay program conducted by a Dutch NGO in Kenya. Teachers and headmasters were
                   provided with non-cash prizes based on student performance. The program resulted in increased scores as well
                   as increases in test preparation and student test taking.


                   The idea of tying teacher pay to performance has grown in political popularity, with a number of countries
 Applications      having implemented or attempted to implement performance pay (including the US, Australia, Brazil, Chile,
 to date           Israel, and the UK) (Muralidharan 2011). Evaluations of performance pay programs have occurred in countries
                   including India, Israel, Kenya, Brazil, and Chile (Bruns et al. 2011).



                                           Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs)

                   Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) provide regular cash payments to individuals or families conditional on
                   some behavior, such as a child enrolling in school and attending regularly, sometimes with a performance
 Definition and    requirement. CCTs vary significantly in scope. Some programs are nationwide, some are niche programs
 overview          that serve a narrow target population, and others are small-scale pilot efforts. Some programs require that
                   households receiving transfers comply only with schooling conditions; others, especially programs in Latin
                   America and the Caribbean, combine both schooling and health conditions (Fiszbein et al. 2009).


                   CCTs differ from other forms of RBF in a few important ways:
                   •	 Demand-side only: CCTs are transferred to individual households and/or students, and the incentives
                      are designed to influence behavior at that level (as opposed to at the level of the service provider or
                      government). This is the main reason why CCTs do not meet the definition of OBA, because they “do not
 Differentiating      involve contracts with service providers and do not transfer risk to service providers by linking output delivery
 characteristics      to subsidy disbursements.” (Mumssen et al. 2010). Thus while OBA involves a supply-side subsidy to providers
 from other           to incentivize service delivery, CCTs focus on demand-side subsidies to incentivize individuals/families to use
 forms of RBF         those services.
                   •	 Explicit targeting: Given that CCTs directly target poor households and families, the targeting mechanisms
                      used tend to be more precise and narrow than in other schemes. Most use a combination of geographic and
                      household targeting (mainly via proxy means testing) (Fiszbein et al. 2009).


                   A key advantage of CCTs is the stronger evidence behind their effectiveness. While evidence remains weak and
                   practical examples limited for a number of RBF schemes, there is a large body of evidence related to CCTs and
                   factors that contribute to their success (summarized in systematic reviews such as those by Fiszbein et al. 2009;
                   Banerjee et al. 2013; Krishnaratne et al. 2013; DFID 2011; Kabeer et al. 2012). CCTs pioneered in Latin American
                   countries built in best-practice monitoring and evaluation (DFID 2011), which set a strong precedent for CCTs
                   to follow. Nonetheless, less is known about the impact of CCTs in certain regions (for example in sub-Saharan
                   Africa) (DFID 2011).
                   One off the advantages of CCTs is that they have been the impetus for developing poverty maps or household
 Major             targeting systems in their countries, or for upgrades to them (particularly in Latin America): “it would not be an
 advantages        exaggeration to say that CCTs have moved forward the state of the art and standards for targeted programs
 and risks         generally” (Fiszbein et al. 2009).
                   CCTs also have several disadvantages. For one, the evidence behind their impact on improving learning
                   outcomes is less established. One reason for this may be that even if CCTs stimulate demand, the quality
                   of education provided may be so low, that increased access does not lead to significant benefits (Fiszbein
                   et al. 2009). This is one advantage that OBA has over CCTs, including in education, in that it can combine
                   incentives that are both supply-side (by placing performance risk on providers) and demand-side (in some
                   cases by providing tuition subsidies or stipends to students). Finally, some studies have shown that CCTs can
                   have negative effects on siblings of children receiving the subsidies, who as a result may have to work more or
                   whose schooling is deprioritized (Barrera-Osorio et al. 2008; Parker et al. 2006).


                   PROGRESA in Mexico (later renamed Oportunidades), one of the first CCTs in education, launched in the mid-
                   1990s and provided up to three years of monthly cash transfers to poor mothers whose children maintained an
 Illustrative      attendance rate of 85% or higher. The initiative led to a 3.5% increase in enrollment rates for students in grades
 example in        in 1 through 8. Offering a premium on attendance for older children and girls, the initiative also increased
 education         transitions from elementary to junior secondary school by 11.1% and girls’ enrollment by 14.8% (Schultz 2004).
                   In addition to generating improvements in enrollment, recent evaluations are showing that CCTs can also have
                   significant positive effects on learning outcomes (Trevino 2015).




Paying for Performance: An Analysis of Output-Based Aid in Education	65
                         CCTs have been applied extensively in education and health. In education, CCTs have been implemented
                         primarily in Latin America and Asia. From the encouraging results shown by the Oportunidades CCT in Mexico,
                         similar CCT programs emerged in over 25 other countries (e.g. Bolsa Familia in Brazil, Familias en Accion in
                         Colombia). Given the costs associated with verification in the CCT model, examples of unconditional cash
                         transfers (UCTs) have emerged as an attempt to increase cost-effectiveness. The evidence shows that these
       Applications      have had largely successful results. Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) in Ecuador raised enrollment rates by
       to date           10% by creating the impression that conditionality existed through advertising and emphasizing the importance
                         of schooling upon registering participants, without ever enforcing or monitoring enrollment or attendance
                         (Schady et al. 2006). A “labeled” cash transfer in Morocco, in which there was no conditionality, but where
                         transfers were explicitly labeled as an education support program, led to strong increases in school participation
                         (Benhassine et. al 2013). Though innovative and in some cases impactful, UCTs overall have been found by
                         Baird (et al. 2013) to not be as effective as CCTs that monitor compliance and penalize non-compliance.




                                                 Performance-based Scholarships

                          Performance-based scholarships are similar to CCTs in that they involve a cash transfer to individual students,
       Definition and     but while CCTs are most often conditional on student enrollment and attendance rates, performance-based
       overview           scholarships involve cash transfers tied to student academic performance. A number of programs target
                          female students specifically (Petrosino et al. 2012).


       Differentiating
                          Like CCTs, performance-based scholarships are targeted at the level of the individual student rather than
       characteristics
                          the government or service provider. Unlike CCTs, they are exclusively merit-based (i.e. based on academic
       from other
                          performance).
       forms of RBF


                          Merit-based scholarship programs have been found to lead to improved test scores, enrollment and
                          attendance (Krishnaratne et al. 2013, Petrosino et al. 2012), likely through motivating students to work harder in
       Major              order to qualify for the scholarships (Kremer and Holla 2009).
       advantages and
       risks              A risk of performance-based scholarships is that they risk more often going to students from wealthier families
                          who are already more likely to attend school, and so may not increase the chance of students attending
                          school or target students in need of support (Krishnaratne et al. 2013).


                          In the Girls’ Scholarship Program in Kenya, female students in grade six who scored in the top 15% on the
                          district exam received a two-year award covering school fees and supplies for the remaining two years of
                          primary school (Kremer and Holla 2009).
       Illustrative
       example in
       education          The Female Stipend Program (FSP) in Bangladesh also involved a performance-based scholarship element
                          (the precursor of the FSSAP discussed above). Created in 1982, the scheme sought to increase the enrollment
                          and retention of girls in secondary schools. In addition to providing payments to students conditional upon
                          attendance, it also required that girls obtain at least a 45% in annual school exams (Raynor et al. 2006).


                          There are only a few studies that have looked at the impact of financial incentives conditional on academic
                          performance in developing countries. Existing evidence, however, suggests an important and encouraging
       Applications to    role for financial incentives in improving academic performance, though further research and experimentation
       date               is necessary “to shed light on the efficacy of the various forms of performance incentives, their longer term
                          impact, whether their impact varies across different sub-groups of students, and whether there is any evidence
                          that these incentives lead to crowd-out of intrinsic effort” (Banerjee et al. 2013).

Annex 2: World Bank activity in results-based financing
The World Bank has actively engaged with RBF both                       known as Program for Results, (ii) the inclusion of
in general and specifically in education over the past                  RBF in the Global Partnership for Education (GPE)’s
few years. This annex provides an overview of recent                    new financing modality, and (iii) the launch of a new
developments in RBF both within the World Bank and                      World Bank-managed multi-donor trust fund for RBF
related to the World Bank, including: (i) the launch                    in education known as Results in Education for All
of a specific RBF instrument within the World Bank                      Children (REACH).


Program for Results (PforR)

                                      Program for Results (PforR)
   (with a discussion of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) and Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAps))

                   PforR is a loan instrument approved by the World Bank in 2012 to address projects not covered by the Bank’s
                   two main investment instruments: investment loans best suited to finance large capital projects (ILs), and
                   development policy loans (DPLs) designed to encourage policy reforms (Gelb and Hashmi 2014). PforR is
                   intended to bridge the gap between project side and policy side lending by financing service delivery programs
                   and improving systems as well as outcomes, using disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), which can be system-
                   level improvements as well as project-level outputs or outcomes to issue payments (Gelb and Hashmi 2014).
                   While PforR formalizes the use of DLIs, these have been in use by the World Bank in the education sector for
                   many years (though these programs were not known as PforR). PforR projects differ from DLI projects in that they
                   are exempt from Bank safeguard requirements (although PforR still requires the review and approval of recipient
                   governments’ corresponding systems, which can be time consuming and onerous). DLI’s can include input
                   financing as well as DLI financing in the same operation (and can disburse against recurrent costs), whereas PforR
                   projects cannot. In the early days of their use, DLIs would not necessarily have to be directly linked to increasing
                   learning outcomes, but rather were developed on a case by case basis to identify outcomes considered
Definition and     instrumental to achieving effective education systems in a particular context and linking the disbursement of
overview           financing to them (expert interview). Many of the seminal projects that the World Bank financed using DLIs in
                   education were in Latin America and South Asia.
                   Similarly, while PforR seeks to find a middle way between project-level and policy-level financing within the Bank,
                   the notion that aid should be aligned and harmonized both among donors, and with recipient governments’
                   strategies as a whole is not new. Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps), while not a financial modality in itself, nor
                   inherently results-based, is an approach that was developed in the second half of the 1990s as an attempt to both
                   achieve greater coherence among development agencies’ approaches to providing development assistance, and
                   to shift towards general budget support within a particular sector, in contrast to the practice up until that point
                   which had been largely to finance individual and specific projects (Ridell 2007). This distinguishes SWAps from
                   DLIs and PforR in that they were limited to providing general budget support for overall programs (or project
                   support for specific aspects of overall programs) and not for outcomes or outputs of those programs. SWAps led
                   to a focus on sector-specific issues and some degree of results, mainly around measures of policy change (expert
                   interview). SWAps have also been applied in the education sector, though a review of the literature on education
                   SWAps yields inconclusive evidence on their effectiveness in improving education outcomes (Skolnik et al. 2010).

                   Three key differentiating factors of PforR are as follows:
                   •	 Relevant governing ministry or branch is primary actor, responsible for accepting funds and demonstrating
                      results. For example, for an education project, this would be the Ministry of Education or another government
                      body within the education sector (expert interview). However, coordinating ministries such as Finance
                      Ministries are still required to sign off.
Differentiating
                   •	 Donor involvement in system improvement, while still focused on results/outputs. Unlike COD, donors take
characteristics
                      an active role in agreeing with governments on steps they need to take to improve national systems, by
from other forms
                      setting DLIs to link payments to desired changes and process steps (Gelb and Hashmi 2014; expert interview).
of RBF
                      However, unlike OBA which tends to focus specifically on the outcomes of a particular service delivery
                      program, PforR can incentivize both program outcomes and systems outcomes.
                   •	 Intended for large-scale use. Though it is currently capped at 5% of World Bank lending, the Bank is open to
                      the possibility that PforR will become a major lending modality. This contrasts with other types of RBF that are
                      implemented as part of larger input-based aid programs (expert interview).




Paying for Performance: An Analysis of Output-Based Aid in Education	67
                                 Like COD proponents, PforR proponents argue that PforR can incentivize specific project-level outputs or
                                 outcomes. But PforR also has the flexibility of being able to create effective system-level improvements. While
                                 PforR can still include system or policy-level DLI’s, unlike DPL’s it does not require macro analysis or conditionality,
                                 and is limited to a particular expenditure program (expert interview). Moreover, PforR are longer term operations
                                 (usually 6-8 years), whereas DPL’s are shorter term, which can lead to challenges in maintaining a long-term focus
                                 (expert interview). Additionally, targeting government sub-sectors rather than central governments or macro-level
                                 actors (as in COD or other forms of WB lending focused on the macro level such as Sector Wide Approaches
                                 (SWAps) or General Budget Support (GBS)), may allow for greater consistency of donor funding, as donors will
        Major advantages         be less likely to pull out after adverse events involving the central government, and allows the control over
        and risks                operations to remain in the hands of sector level actors (expert interview).
                                 One potential drawback to PforR of concern to some is its lack of independent social, environmental, and
                                 fiduciary safeguards, as included in other Bank lending modalities. Instead, PforR utilizes existing country
                                 safeguards. Because of this concern, the Bank has limited use of PforR to projects that do not pose significant
                                 financial, social, or environmental risk; however, this has raised questions about the widespread applicability of
                                 PforR. This is a particular concern if PforR becomes a significant portion of Bank lending (Gelb and Hashmi 2014;
                                 expert interview). However, this could also be seen as an advantage of PforR, in that it shifts the relationship
                                 between the Bank and the recipient away from a “parent-child” compliance relationship, to one more akin to
                                 management consulting, where country safeguard systems stand to be strengthened (expert interview).

                                 Big Results Now in Education (BRNEd) is an initiative launched by the president of Tanzania in 2013 and, in
                                 2014, became the first education project approved by the World Bank to receive support through a PforR
                                 mechanism. The program aims to increase learning outcomes of students in primary and lower secondary
        Illustrative
                                 schools country-wide through initiatives including school rankings, school assessments, school incentive grants,
        example in
                                 and teacher training. Progress is measured through performance of grade two students on reading and numeracy
        education
                                 assessments, teacher attendance, and teacher knowledge in math and languages. DLIs are tied to process,
                                 output, and outcome indicators such as improved results monitoring, effective implementation of BRNEd
                                 interventions, and incentivizing improved student performance (World Bank 2014a).

                                 Besides BRNEd, 11 PforR programs have been approved by the Bank, four of which are currently in the
                                 implementation phase. Another 17 are under preparation. Of these projects, 7% of funding is devoted to the
                                 education sector (Gelb and Hashmi 2014; World Bank 2014).
                                 Seminal examples of the World Bank’s use of DLI’s in the education prior to the introduction of PforR include
        Applications to          the Punjab Education Project in Pakistan, and the Sindh Education Project in Pakistan.44 These were the first
        date                     results-based education sector operations in IDA countries, with disbursements tied to pre-specified annual
                                 implementation progress and performance targets (DLIs). The DLIs captured intermediate results, central to the
                                 medium-term achievement of the project development objectives.

                                 Education SWAps have been applied in a number of countries, including Uganda, Nepal, and Brazil.45

New Global Partnership for Education Financing Model
The announcement made by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in 2014 that it plans to introduce a
results-based component to its 2015-2018 funding cycle is likely to alter the landscape of education RBF in the
coming years. GPE is the only multilateral partnership focused exclusively on education, and is comprised of close
to 60 developing countries, donor governments, international organizations, the private sector, teachers, and civil
society/NGO groups. The new financing model seeks to more directly support the achievement of results at the
country level, through (1) expanded eligibility criteria, (2) a needs-based allocation formula, and importantly for this
analysis, (3) a new results-based approach. This new results-based approach will have two key components:

GPE therefore plans to become a key player in the RBF sector in education, focusing explicitly on incentivizing results
in basic education at the country level. Given that the World Bank serves as the supervising entity for 75% of GPE
projects, any initiative that implicates GPE in RBF automatically does so for the World Bank too, and leads to the need
to build World Bank capacity in this area. This has led to the launch of a new trust fund, described further below.



      Overview of GPE RBF funding modality
      New performance requirements: In order to receive the first 70% of its financing allocation, each member country
      supported by its partners must achieve the following performance benchmarks:

      •	 Produce a credible, costed, evidence-based and workable Education Sector Plan that international and domestic
         partners have endorsed and committed to implementing,

      •	 Commit to implementing an education sector analysis and strengthening data collection and the management and
         information system, and

      •	 Commit to raising its own domestic spending on education (up to at least 20 percent of the national budget) and to
         tapping additional external financing.

      Performance Incentives: In order to receive the remaining 30% of its financing allocation, developing countries
      must demonstrate significant performance results in three primary categories that align with the Global Partnership’s
      strategic goals:

      •	 Equity (e.g. girls, disabilities)

      •	 Efficiency (e.g. more effective, equitable and efficient education sector financing)

      •	 Learning outcomes.
      This last part of the funding model is explicitly results-based. The performance standards will vary depending on the
      development situation in each country: some countries will be able to measure progress in the number of children
      attending school and learning, while others need intermediate milestones such as adopting stronger policies and
      strategies or implementing key actions to move towards improved results. (Source: GPE 2014).
