RAPID SOCIAL RESPONSE PROGRAM
The Rapid Social Response Program (RSR) is a multidonor program that was
established in 2009 to help the world’s poorest countries, in partnership with
the World Bank, build effective social protection systems. RSR is one of the
key instruments for implementing the World Bank’s Social Protection and
Labor Strategy for Resilience, Equity and Opportunity in countries eligible for
International Development Association (IDA) support. RSR has been generously
supported by the Russian Federation, Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
Sweden.

                                    his report summarizes progress made by the Rapid Social Response Pro-
                                    gram (RSR), with special emphasis on the last 12 months. RSR was estab-
                                    lished in 2009 with initial support from the Russian Federation, Norway,
                             and the United Kingdom. Australia and Sweden joined the program in 2012 and
                             2013, respectively.

                             While originally established as a crisis response mechanism, the current mission
                             of RSR is to be catalytic, transformative, and forward-looking in its support to the
                             development and strengthening of social protection and labor (SPL) systems
                             in low-income countries eligible for International Development Association (IDA)
                             support.



                             Summary Accomplishments
                             RSR became operational in December 2009. Since then, it has received
                             275 funding proposals and approved 131 projects in 63 countries (see map on
                             pp. 4 and 5 for an overview of RSR project countries). Even more countries have
                             received indirect benefits from RSR-financed activities and products, such as
                             South-South learning forums, communities of practice, and analytical/operational
                             toolkits. Key facts about RSR are summarized in table 1.

                             In its more than four years of existence, RSR has gone through two distinct
                             phases. The first was a crisis response phase, lasting from its inception through
2                            the end of 2012. The program then moved into its second phase: SPL system
                             building and strengthening.



                             PH A SE 1: C RISIS RE SP ONSE
                             The original RSR mandate was to help low-income countries cope with major
                             crises such as the food, fuel, and financial crises of 2008–11.1 Consequently, in
                             its early years, RSR funded projects that would mitigate the immediate impact
                             of the food, fuel, and financial crises on poor and vulnerable populations—par-
                             ticularly infants and young children. Examples of these projects include the
                             Gambia: Rapid Response Nutrition Security Improvement Projects ($3.2 million),
                             Mali: Piloting Effective Early Childhood Development Services ($2.2 million), and
                             Haiti: Household Development Agent Pilot ($3.2 million). These were among the
                             45 projects approved in early March 2010 during the first rounds of competitive
                             selection (see RSR chronology on page viii). Although they were relatively
                             small given the magnitude of the crisis facing beneficiary countries, the projects
                             provided critical services and in-kind benefits to the poor and vulnerable.

                             While effective in providing small grants in Phase 1, RSR’s comparative advan-
                             tage was not in emergency crisis response. Its limited role in this area was a con-
                             sequence of its funding size. Total programmable resources during Phase 1 were
                             about $60.8 million—an amount smaller than that for typical safety net projects.

                              There are many definitions of “low-income countries.” RSR defines these as countries

For example, IDA funding for Madagascar’s Emergency, Food Security and Social
Protection Project (P147514; February 2014) was $65 million; for Kenya’s National
Integrated Safety Net Program (P131305; May 2013), it was $250 million. And in
                                                                                       Typical IDA funding of a safety net

small resource envelope, RSR’s role in alleviating the immediate impact of major
crises in countries was quite limited.

It was primarily for this reason that RSR began placing more emphasis on its
catalytic role and preparedness for future crises rather than the mitigation
of those of the present day. It thus focused on helping countries build and
strengthen their social protection systems—since countries without adequate
systems are less able to respond effectively to a crisis. For example, by the onset
of the food, fuel, and financial crises, some middle-income countries like Brazil,
Colombia, and Mexico had already spent nearly two decades building their social

                                                     in place is that they can be triggered or adapted at the onset of a crisis—e.g., to
                                                     increase the level of benefits or lower eligibility thresholds. In countries where
                                                     SPL systems were less developed, the food, fuel, and financial crises reversed

                                                     For example, in the low-income countries of Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, and Cam-

                                                     crises reached only small percentages of the poorest populations: in Timor-Leste,
                                                     27 percent of the poorest one-fifth of its population in 2007; in Afghanistan,
                                                     15 percent in that same year; and in Cambodia, 2 percent of its poorest in 2008

                                 RSR umbrella trust fund, supporting systems-building (especially in lower
                                 income countries) and global knowledge-sharing in SPL, especially South-South
                                 (World Bank 2012).


                             To fulfill this new mandate, in November 2012, RSR Multi-Donor Trust Fund
                             (RSR-MDTF) donors approved a five-year extension of RSR from June 30, 2013,
                             to June 30, 2018.2 This extension marked the official end of Phase 1 (crisis
                             response) and the beginning of Phase 2 (systems building).

                             The strategic objectives of this extension were to (1) position RSR as an instru-
                             ment to support the implementation of the SPL Strategy in low-income countries
6                            during its first five years, and (2) allow the program to expand its coalition and raise
                             additional resources. As a result, in November 2012 and August 2013, respectively,
                             Sweden and the United Kingdom signed the administrative agreement and became
                                                                                            mable
                             members of the RSR-MDTF. Consequently, RSR’s cumulative program­
                             resources have exceeded $105 million, of which $44.5 million is for Phase 2.

                             RSR’s thematic typology has also been modified. In Phase 2, the number and
                             substance of high-level themes remains the same as in Phase 1, except that
                             Themes 2 and 3 have been reversed; additionally, more detailed subthemes have
                             been introduced (table 3), enabling better delineated tracking and analysis.

                             The Phase 2 portfolio reflects the prioritization of systems (figures 1 and 2). Since
                             Phase 2 began, RSR has approved 37 new projects ($14.2 million in total) out of
                             79 proposals ($32.8 million), bringing the total number of projects in the portfolio
                             to 131. Competitive selection Round 7 is currently under way. So far, Theme 1
                             (systems) is dominant, both in terms of the number of projects approved and the
                             amount of funding allocated. Nearly 95 percent of the projects address sys-
                             tems in one way or another. The proportion of resources allocated for Theme 1
                             is 88 percent of the total funding amount. While the share of knowledge (now
                             Theme 2) has not changed dramatically, the benefits theme has become less

IDA-eligible. For Theme 2 projects—which deal with knowledge sharing and for
which information exchange among countries at different levels of development
is key to strengthening evolving social protection systems—the RSR administra-
tive agreement allows the inclusion of countries that are eligible to borrow from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). However,
because only a small share of resources has been allocated to Theme 2 (8 per-
cent in Phase 1; 3 percent in Phase 2 thus far), RSR support of middle-income
countries has been very limited.

                                                                                                               9
Key Results and Performance Indicators
Figure 4 illustrates RSR’s results framework, as agreed upon with the five
donors and the World Bank in June 2013. The framework is articulated around
three levels of results: (1) impacts, (2) outcomes, and (3) outputs. Outputs are
what the implementation agency can exert the most control upon, while out-
comes and impacts tend to be more contingent on a variety of contextual and
exogenous factors. This is even more pronounced for any initiative’s expected
influence upon “higher-order” domains such as reduced poverty and inequality
among targeted populations. To properly reflect the nature of such classes of
results, the results framework maps them around a pyramid-shaped matrix. In
this framework, the higher-level results (e.g., impacts) are placed toward the top
of the pyramid. Moving from the pyramid’s base toward the top illustrates how
additional time, complexity, and combinations of factors progressively affect
materialization of results.



IMPA C T L E V E L— MORE P OOR P E OP L E C OV E RE D
BY SOCIAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
As implied by the results framework, RSR’s results chain is simple and straight-
forward. To begin, RSR provides a small amount of funding to facilitate SPL sys-
tem-building and strengthening activities in IDA-eligible countries. Then, many of
those efforts mobilize and facilitate the preparation of a full-fledged IDA-funded
project. Finally, the IDA project actually provides needed SPL coverage (figure 5).

RSR outcomes are measured by three indicators as noted in table 5, i.e.:

•	 Increased resource allocation to social protection through IDA (million $)

•	 Increased resource allocation to social protection overall budget, domestic,
   and other funding (million $)

•	 Global data accessible (number of new countries in the ASPIRE/SPARCS
   databases)

In terms of IDA leveraging, $3.3 billion worth of IDA operations (59 operations)
were associated with RSR at the end of the reporting period (December 2013).
As of May 2014, the numbers had grown to $3.8 billion and 68 operations.

Leveraging of non-IDA resources has reached about $2.4 billion. It is important to
note that this number is dominated by a single country, Bangladesh. As mentioned
earlier, IDA provides merely 18 percent ($500 million) of the total cost of the Safety
Net Systems for the Poorest Project (P132634; July 2013); the rest ($2.2 billion)
comes from the Bangladesh government. Similarly, in the case of the Nigeria Youth
Employment and Social Support Operation (P126964; March 2013), the cost shar-
ing between IDA and the country government was $300 million and $100 million
(75 percent by IDA). And funding for the Tanzania Productive Social Safety Net
(P124045; March 2012) comes from IDA ($220 million), the Tanzanian government
($4 million), the U.K. Department for International Development (DfID) ($16 million),
and Spain ($0.9 million). However, for most projects, IDA is the sole financier.

The final indicator at the outcome level is the number of countries in the ASPIRE
and SPARCS databases. ASPIRE (the Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators
of Resilience and Equity) is an ongoing project that aims to improve SPL data
quality, comparability, and availability to better inform SPL policies and programs.

                                           Its portal (http://datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/) generates harmonized indi-

                                           market programs based on nationally representative household survey data.
                                           Most indicators are estimated by program type for the entire population and by
                                           quintiles of both pre- and post-transfer welfare distribution.

                                           At the end of the reporting period (December 2013), ASPIRE contained data for
                                           57 countries, most of which were middle-income countries. However, this num-
                                           ber is growing very rapidly. As of May 2014, 69 countries were in the ASPIRE
                                           database, and a total of 117 were expected by the end of June 2014.

                                           Technical design of assessment modules has advanced considerably since last
                                           year, and awaits final approval by the Social Protection Inter-Agency Consultation

                                           Thematic Characteristics
                                                Theme 1 (systems) has claimed the largest share of RSR resource allocations
                                                     during the 2010–13 period, reflecting the nature of the program. As fig-
      Figure 6: Resource Allocations by Theme        ure 6 shows, RSR’s overall programmable resources have been largely
      2010–13                                        allocated to Theme 1 (60 percent), followed by Theme 3 (32 percent).
                                                     As discussed earlier, the allocations changed from Phase 1 to Phase 2.
                                                     Theme 1’s share increased from 53 percent to 88 percent, while
                                                     Theme 3 decreased from 39 percent to 9 percent.

Theme 2 (knowledge) has been claiming the smallest share of resource alloca-
tion (8 percent); this share has been relatively constant between the two phases.
The flagship activities in this theme have been four global South-South learning
forums and one Asia learning forum.

Theme 3 (benefits) has drastically reduced its share both in terms of resource
allocation (39 percent in Phase 1 to 9 percent in Phase 2) and number of projects
(16 percent of the Phase 1 portfolio to 3 percent of the Phase 2 portfolio). This is
consistent with the reorientation of the
RSR program focus.                              Figure 8: Resource Allocations by Region, as of May 2014

Operational Procedures
Unlike many other trust fund programs, RSR has very few program-specific pro-
cedures, and relies on the World Bank’s existing quality assurance and fiduciary
control mechanisms that have been devised to maintain both quality assurance
and responsiveness. RSR-funded projects follow the Bank’s rigorous standard
operational policies and procedures. RSR’s Bank-executed knowledge services
such as technical assistance and economic sector work follow the same strict
review process all non-RSR-funded projects are required to follow—includ-
ing through the concept stage, output and endorsement stage, outreach and
completion stage—with peer and decision reviews chaired by the respective
country director. External training such as South-South forums also requires
reviews at the concept stage and delivery of learning/knowledge-sharing activity
and completion stage. RSR’s recipient-executed projects follow the streamlined
procedures and policies established for small recipient-executed trust funds, with
standardized templates complemented with a risk-based approach.

One of the few RSR-specific procedures is its call for expressions of inter-
est—i.e., call for proposals. Only trust fund–accredited World Bank staff mem-
bers may submit an expression of interest on behalf of the beneficiary country. In
addition, the expression of interest must be cleared by immediate line managers

                                         prior to submission. Once received, proposals are reviewed and scored by two
                                         lead/senior-level subject specialists, using 20 technical and operational criteria
                                         ranging from 5 (most favorable) to 1 (least favorable). Proposals with the highest
                                         average scores are forwarded to the RSR Program Management Committee,
                                         consisting of a group of directors headed by a vice president, for review and
                                         approval or rejection.

                                         Reflecting the demand-driven and results-oriented nature of RSR, one of the
                                         most important criteria in evaluating RSR funding proposals is the project’s ability
                                         to be implemented. This quality, by definition, requires strong client owner-
                                         ship even for relatively small-scale technical assistance projects. To ensure the
                                         proposal’s consistency with the Bank’s overall strategy to assist its clients, the
                                         applicable World Bank country director’s office is consulted from a very early
                                         stage of concept development. Other key evaluation criteria are cost-benefit
                                         consideration and solid monitoring and evaluation arrangements. In sum, the RSR
                                         review process looks for projects that will significantly strengthen SPL systems
                                         by generating concrete results.

                                         Only IDA-eligible countries (including “blend” countries) are currently eligible
                                         under Themes 1 and 3. Theme 2 activities are required to benefit two or more
                                         client countries, and at least half of these countries must be IDA-eligible. In addi-

                                         Lessons Learned
                                         During the last four and a half years, RSR has accumulated several useful
                                         lessons, which have been reflected back to the operation and approach of the
                                         program itself.

Without taking risks, the IDA SPL portfolio and the resulting SPL coverage
expansion (to 42.1 million people) could have been far smaller than they are
today. RSR’s approach to risk is analogous to that of venture capitalists in the pri-
vate sector. It has been an important factor in catalyzing IDA operations as well
as other transformative policy/program changes in client countries.



LE SSON 2: PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE
External agencies like international financial institutions (including the
World Bank), United Nations agencies, and bilateral donors often press             Figure 9: Increase of IDA/RSR Association
for quick results. However, as figure 9 clearly shows, often two or even
                                                                                    Million $

begins to fully germinate. For example, the Cameroon Social Safety
Nets Project (P128534; $50 million) was approved in March 2013. The                     80
corresponding RSR project, Strengthening Safety Net Response to                         60

LESSON 3: NOT ALL RSR PROJECTS LEAD TO
IDA OPERATIONS
Above half of all approved RSR projects—67 of 131—have been associated with
IDA operations. Four types of RSR projects do not tend to catalyze IDA.

•	 Knowledge management projects that target multiple countries such
   as South-South and peer-to-peer learning, communities of practice,
   and analytical and operational toolkits. These projects are not designed to
   directly support a country’s systemic efforts. While in some cases, partici-
   pation in a learning forum or community of practice has eventually led to an
   IDA operation, such causality is often difficult to clearly establish, unlike with
   country-specific technical assistance projects. Cases of clear attribution do
   exist; for example, the Cash Transfers—Design for Scaling Up in Sub-Saharan
   Africa projects led to three IDA operations in Benin, Mali, and Tanzania.

•	 Projects approved in the early rounds of RSR operation when the
   program had a stronger immediate crisis-response orientation. The
   Gambia’s Rapid Response Nutrition Security Improvement Project and the
   early childhood development projects in Mali and Malawi are examples of
   such projects. Their objectives were not to build SPL systems, but to mitigate
   the immediate impact of a major crisis.

•	 Changing circumstances and priorities of the beneficiary country.
   Projects for the Democratic Republic of Congo and Yemen had to be canceled
   because of the difficult political and social environment. In Nicaragua, the
     THE WORLD BANK | RAPID SOCIAL RESPONSE PROGRAM


                                 Crisis Module for the Nicaraguan Labor Force had to be withdrawn because
                                 the newly elected government had priorities that differed from those of the
                                 previous administration.

                              •	 Projects for which non-IDA follow-up was expected. The government of
                                 Timor-Leste decided to follow up the RSR-financed social protection admin-
                                 istration projects through its own financing. Zimbabwe also has not sought
                                 IDA follow-up to its Productive Safety Net: Pilot Public Works Project; this is
                                 because the project is inactive.


                              LESSON 4: PROJECTS IN SOUTH ASIA AND

                              DIFFICULTIE S THAN THOSE EL SE WHERE
                              On average, RSR projects in South Asia are extended 2.2 times, for a total of
                              426.2 days per project. The corresponding figures in West Africa are 1.5 times
                              and 314.7 days, respectively. Global averages are 1.4 times and 240.4 days. How-
                              ever, the payoffs from these delays are high, as illustrated by the examples of
                              Bangladesh and Cameroon mentioned earlier, in terms of both IDA mobilization
                              and SPL coverage expansion.



                              LESSON 5: DEMAND FOR RSR SUPPORT IS
                              SHIFTING
16
                              Earlier, the nature of RSR-supported technical assistance was broadly policy ori-
                              ented. Countries needed evidence to determine what kind of SPL services were
                              needed and if those were fiscally sustainable. Increasingly, however, demand
                              is shifting toward “how to” services. For example, participants in recent South-
                              South learning events frequently expressed such comments as, “We don’t need
                              more convincing that a unique ID system is needed. We want to know how to
                              design and implement one that is most suitable to us.” Similar comments were
                              heard about management information systems, payment systems, beneficiary
                              registries, and many other “nitty-gritty” details of system design and imple-
                              mentation. Because innovations are taking place within countries themselves,
                              supporting knowledge sharing among them will continue to be important.

                              was estimated to have reached 42.1 million people by December 2013, and is
                              expected to grow to 58.3 million by the time those IDA operations come to an
                              end. While this is a significant achievement, 299 million people in low-income
                              countries alone still live on $1.25 a day or less without any SPL coverage. Adding
                              those in middle-income countries, 871 million people live in extreme poverty
                              without any social protection—they are out of the system (see “Special Section:
                              Where Are the Poor?” beginning on page 17). The legacy of RSR will very well
                              be determined by what it will do for those who still remain unprotected.

                                               n the developing world, just over 1.2 billion people live on less than $1.25 a
                                               day. Of those, 398 million live in low-income countries, 652 million in low-
                                               er-middle-income countries, and 167 million in upper-middle-income coun-
                                         tries (World Bank 2014b). As table S1 shows, safety net coverage of the extreme
                                         poor is the lowest in low-income countries (75 percent). However, lower-mid-
                                         dle-income countries (73 percent) are not far behind—and even in upper-mid-
                                         dle-income countries, 56 percent are unprotected. Worldwide, 871 million people
                                         live on $1.25 a day or less without publicly provided safety nets. A majority of
                                         them (479 million) are in lower-middle-income countries.

                                         With respect to the World Bank, most middle-income countries can only borrow
                                         from IBRD; some are “blend” countries, i.e., they can also access IDA credits
                                         and grants.1 As shown in figure S1, 62 countries can borrow only from IDA, 20
                                                  are IDA/IBRD blend countries (eligible to borrow from both), and 62 are
                                                     only IBRD-eligible. IDA-only and blend countries are IDA-eligible coun-

                                                     countries, most of which are only IBRD-eligible. For example, the Arab

                                                     Several IDA-eligible countries are expected to move into the blend

          n the following pages, we highlight 12 of RSR’s 122 activities that have
          been implemented during the past three years. As in previous reports,
          the project profiles are divided into three themes:


Theme 1: Support to New and Improved
Social Protection and Labor Systems
Coordinated SPL systems bolster people and help economies grow. RSR
helps to build critical parts of such systems through policy dialogue and
technical assistance, and by providing the analytical work that helps the
systems run efficiently and cost-effectively. RSR projects mobilize larger
resources from IDA as well as other sources to complete the system-
building work and help governments operate the systems to expand social
protection coverage.


Theme 2: Increased Learning and Knowledge
Sharing for Social Protection Service Delivery
RSR raises awareness on how to increase coverage of social protection
in low-income countries through South-South learning initiatives and
the development of communities of practice. RSR also helps to create
new diagnostic techniques that can benefit individual countries or have
a global impact on social safety net systems and poor people’s access to
basic services.


Theme 3: Protecting Access to Basic Services
to the Most Vulnerable in Times of Crisis
As crises hit and threaten livelihoods and human capital, RSR’s emergency
window for limited-scale delivery of SPL benefits and services can be
opened to prevent irreversible harm to the most vulnerable populations.
RSR projects help to provide nutrition benefits, particularly to young
children and their mothers, waivers for school fees and health services,
and the required administrative support for efficient service delivery.

Some grants approved in recent selection rounds support activities that build on
previously financed RSR activities and achievements. This is the case for several of
the projects profiled in this section.

                                        As Afghanistan transitions from a country whose security and
                                        development are dominated by the international community to one led by
                                        its own government, RSR supports its preparations for a social safety net

     APPROACH
     The IDA-financed Afghanistan Pension Administration and Safety Net Project
     began in 2009 to improve the administration of the country’s public pension
     schemes and pilot a modest but robust social safety net for the most vulnerable
     people. The project has made steady and encouraging progress, and was restruc-
     tured in 2013 to enable a scale-up for reaching more vulnerable people across the
     country. Funds from RSR are helping the project grow efficiently by improving
     institutional capacity for monitoring and evaluation. Also with RSR funds, an oper-
     ations manual and management information system were developed.

                                     WEAVING A SOCIAL SAFETY NET
                                     As Côte d’Ivoire slowly emerges from a decade of internal conflict
                                     and economic crises, RSR is helping to rally momentum for policy
                                     development on social protection. An RSR-supported policy dialogue
                                     has resulted in the preparation of a social protection strategy and the
                                     development of two IDA operations—one for safety nets and one for
                                     results-based health financing.

Project ID P143332)                  APPROACH
CI-Results-Based Financing Project   The government is committed to taking on various reforms, including in the
(currently under preparation)        realm of public sector governance, and has engaged in broad consultations with
                                     stakeholders on its Poverty Reduction Strategy. In line with the government’s
                                     post-crisis and social recovery strategy, RSR is helping jump-start the delivery of
                                     basic social services through analytical work looking back at the aggregate and
                                     distributional impact on human capital of the civil war, the food, fuel, and financial
                                     crises, and the recent post-electoral crises. The diagnostic work looks at the
     present and the future: how well are existing crisis-response mechanisms doing,
     and how could programs and delivery systems improve?

     The second component of the RSR grant is to build the capacity of the line min-
     istries in the social sectors (Ministry of Education, Health, and Family, Women
     and Social Affairs) to help staff better undertake diagnosis, develop policies, and
     prioritize interventions under the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

     The World Bank and UNICEF are also co-chairing a donor work group to support
     the country’s policy dialogue on social protection.

     Implementation of the RSR grant has been slow, reflecting the reality of trying to
     bring about change in a fragile state. On the other hand, this lengthy time span
     has enabled ownership to take hold and local capacity to be strengthened—both
     of which are key ingredients in sustainability.

                                      of the state’s gross domestic product (World Bank 2013). Reforming these
                                      programs through the Bihar Integrated Social Protection Strengthening Project

     will help lead to more effective implementation and efficient spending in social
     protection.

     RSR finances activities that will provide in-depth learning on a number of
     building blocks for Bihar’s social protection system as the studies (1) evaluate
     the application processes for existing social protection programs and systems
     for delivering goods and services, (2) test new monitoring processes, and (3)
     assess the use and impact of social protection and rural livelihoods programs.
     They will facilitate the design and testing of a tracking system and tools to be
     used to follow 300 applicants to social pension schemes to determine the time it
     takes to apply to the programs and identify bottlenecks faced by citizens trying to
     access assistance. Another study will build on this work to assess the impacts of
     providing various types of information and assistance to households applying for
     social pension programs. And RSR activities will support the creation and testing
     of user assessments, such as citizen report cards, to provide feedback on the
     quality of services provided by common service c enters. The lessons learned
     will be of value not only to the State of Bihar and other states in India, but also to
     other low-income, low-capacity countries in South Asia and beyond.

     Finally, RSR will help finance the Bihar Rural Income and Expenditure Survey
     being executed under the $163 million World Bank Bihar Rural Livelihoods Proj-
     ect (JEEViKA), including the design and incorporation of a social protection com-
     ponent. Currently, income generation is a relatively understudied topic in rural
     India. The government-supported National Sample Survey focuses on measuring
     household expenditures as the primary indicators of well-being. Introducing a
way to measure income allows policy makers in Bihar to understand not only
trends in well-being, but also where income comes from. The survey will pro-
duce average total household annual income estimates for rural households and
will be planned for three rounds over multiple years to ensure its usefulness in
assessing changes over time. Results from the survey will provide information
on the use of both social protection and rural livelihood programs, and how these
programs interact. Future rounds will provide data that can be used to assess the
impact of activities financed under the Social Protection Strengthening Project
and to integrate and improve the efficiency of key social protection programs.

                                      MODERNIZING SOCIAL PROTECTION
                                      Just after the end of the violent conflict in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010,
                                      RSR helped amend the eligibility rules for the country’s only cash transfer
                                      program to help the poorest families cope with loss of income and higher
                                      food and electricity prices. Today, with the program declining in coverage
                                      and popularity, RSR is providing continuous support to modernize the
                                      program and develop a social protection strategy for the country.

                                      increased since 2009, most of the benefits are received by wealthier populations
Project ID P126278)
                                      through categorically targeted programs. The only program explicitly targeted to
                                      the poor, the Monthly Benefit to Poor Families, has seen a decline in coverage
                                      in recent years. At present, the program only reaches one-third of the poorest
                                      20 percent of the population. This low coverage is primarily due to stringent eligi-
                                      bility requirements, making qualification for benefits difficult. For example, ben-
                                      eficiaries must have an income lower than the guaranteed minimum income. In
                                      addition, fiscal constraints have led the Ministry of Social Development to tighten
                                            access to the program by adopting more
                                            restrictive filters (e.g., excluding owners of
                                            livestock) and increasing norms for imputed
                                            income from land plots.

                                            Finally, the program is losing political sup-
                                            port as some leaders argue that the country
                                            spends too much on benefits.



                                            APPROACH
                                            Following the crises of 2010, RSR extended
                                            rapid technical assistance to improve the
                                            Monthly Benefit to Poor Families through
     an analysis that enabled the government to amend the rules so the income
     threshold for eligibility was raised. The rules were also changed to allow families
     affected by the 2010 conflict and without birth certificates or other papers to
     claim benefits.

     A new grant from RSR provides technical assistance to the government. Under
     this grant, RSR is continuing to identify critical interventions to strengthen the
     benefit program, and to improve its credibility and public image. RSR is also
     helping to integrate the program into a wider systems approach through a social
34
     protection strategy that focuses on modernization of key community-based
     social services as vehicles to protect the most vulnerable.

     RSR technical assistance is expected to improve program design and help it to
     more accurately target and improve access for a significantly larger share of the
     poor through evidence-based planning and monitoring of implementation.

                                      FOR BETTER PROTECTION FOR THE POOR
                                      RSR supported a social safety net review and related technical assistance
                                      to help the government make more efficient use of social transfer
                                      resources. The review revealed that Lesotho’s spending on safety nets is
                                      relatively high, and its impact on poverty and inequality is limited. The
                                      review emphasized that well-targeted, cost-effective transfer programs can
                                      reduce extreme poverty without straining the budget.

                                      weak poverty targeting, however, tax the government’s scarce resources.
     APPROACH
     As part of the government’s public expenditure review, RSR supported an
     assessment of the country’s social transfer schemes, including those within the
     agriculture and education sectors, and made recommendations on how to better
     reach out to the most vulnerable.

     Building on analytical work in the social protection sector undertaken by UNICEF,
36   the International Labour Organization, and the World Food Programme, the RSR
     initiative consisted of a poverty and vulnerability analysis, an expenditure anal-
     ysis, an assessment of safety net programs, and development of policy recom-
     mendations and implications.

     Additionally, the government—with support from RSR—undertook the devel-
     opment of a National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA) as an
     important first step in consolidating and rationalizing social protection programs
     and their targeting mechanisms.

                                      RSR helped set the direction of the new safety net system by financing an
                                      assessment of Mali’s social safety net policies and programs and development
                                      of an effective safety net strategy. The assessment was part of a regional review
                                      aimed at helping African countries ensure that new social protection schemes
                                      are effective, affordable, and anchored in policy frameworks. The review
                                      underscored the importance of improving on typically isolated, irregular, and
                                      untargeted existing programs in the face of the

                                      learned from an RSR-supported Early Childhood
                                      Development Pilot. The pilot was instrumental
                                      in devising the design of parental education

                                        poor families with children under the age of 13, and provides them with a series
                                        of workshops on topics such as early childhood development, nutrition, domestic

                                        expected to benefit from the community-based social welfare model.
     A cash transfer component was added with IDA support and is currently being
     piloted with 20,000 families in six departments. Unlike typical conditional cash
     transfer programs, payment is conditional on participation in the workshops
     rather than on school attendance or periodic health checkups and vaccinations.

     RSR resources were used to improve essential building blocks of the program

     A new RSR grant, approved in 2013, continues to help build up the system by

                                     up. One RSR grant provided the necessary technical inputs and enabled
                                     the development of an IDA operation. And a newly approved RSR grant
                                     will support the government in establishing a shared targeting system.

                                     Sierra Leone is at peace and its economy is growing, but the country remains
                                     scarred by war and plagued by a “resource curse” associated with mineral
                                     wealth and poor governance. The country is still among the poorest in the world,

Associated IDA project:              APPROACH
Sierra Leone Safety Nets Project
($7 million; World Bank Project ID   The government is looking to build a well-targeted and effective social protection
P143588)                             system that could help households graduate from poverty through multiyear pre-
                                     dictable transfers, and that can be scaled-up to tackle future food price shocks.
                                     The government has included a pillar for social protection in its 2013 Agenda for
                                     Prosperity Program for all citizens with a special focus on women, children, the
                                     elderly, vulnerable youth, the poor, and people with disabilities.

                                     In 2011, the cabinet approved a social protection strategy that prioritizes inter-
                                     ventions to achieve maximum impact with limited resources. RSR helped
                          formulate recommendations for the strategy, including improving the efficiency
                          and relevance of existing safety nets. Significantly, RSR helped make the case for
                          a systematic approach to social safety nets and enabled the development of an
                          IDA operation, the Sierra Leone Safety Nets Project.

                          The first crucial building block for such a system is a common targeting mecha-
                          nism the government can use on its path toward inclusive growth. The targeting
                          of social protection interventions is especially important in light of the expected
                          boom in revenues from extractive resources in Sierra Leone, as it could act
                          as a tool to highlight and reduce geographical and social disparities. Since the
                          proposed common targeting mechanism and accompanying registry are highly
                          technical, a new RSR operation, approved in November 2013, will provide techni-
                          cal assistance to the Sierra Leone government as it establishes these products.

                             making decisions about social protection options. The diagnostic synthesized
                             existing sources of information on poverty, vulnerabilities, and shocks and
                             provided a description of the characteristics of the most disadvantaged popu-

                             existing interventions, analyzed their cost-effectiveness, main design issues,
                             targeting, coverage and methods of delivery, and funding source. It also pro-
                             vided comparisons to countries with similar characteristics.

                          •	 Building on the poverty and vulnerability diagnostic and the review of existing
                             safety nets, developed recommendations and proposed policy options to
                             improve the effectiveness, relevance, and financial viability of the safety nets
                             system, as well as suggestions for new programs and improvements in mon-
                             itoring. A particular focus was to transform the current ad hoc, crisis-driven
                             approach into a programmatic approach. The recommendations for new and
                             modified safety net programs formed the basis for a new IDA project.

the United Nations (FAO)               The World Bank is developing a series of user-friendly software that will allow
                                       for the efficient collection, processing, and management of social protection
                                       program data while requiring minimal technical design and support from gov-
                                       ernments. There are numerous advantages in the Bank’s undertaking of this
                                       initiative, including (1) a reduction in government spending on these tasks,
                                       (2) client access to software that is developed and updated based on common
                                       practices, and (3) increased system continuity and sustainability. The increased
                                       standardization across countries of the data formats and processing procedures
                                       used will facilitate more internationally comparable reporting on social protection
                                       programs—and thus better and easier analysis.

                                       The first software the Bank made available helps governments capture infor-
                                       mation needed for their social protection beneficiary registry systems through
     the use of mobile devices. The software, called Computer-Assisted Personal
     Interviewing (CAPI), allows governments to custom design surveys that, while
     conducted in the field, organize data that can be readily fed into a beneficiary
     registry for social protection programs. Because the data gathered are recorded
     directly on mobile devices, they can be processed immediately for analysis.

     CAPI has many advantages, and it is being piloted in several countries. The soft-
     ware is flexible and easy to use, but is powerful enough to accommodate diverse
     requirements across countries. It can be adapted for use in many types of sur-
     veys—e.g., on living standards, health, environment, or agriculture. And the use
     of mobile devices can help reduce fraud because on-board tools like time stamp,
     camera, and global positioning system (GPS), as well as attachable devices like
     a fingerprint scanner, become easily accessible. Although originally designed to
     improve social protection systems where sector-appropriate tools exist that can
     be connected to the mobile device, CAPI can collect and process different types
     of technical data useful in project management, such as the size or location of
     agricultural plots, the weight of babies, or environmental quality. To learn more
     about CAPI, go to http://go.worldbank.org/CALISV6BF0.

     Once governments have used CAPI to build a client registry system, the next step
     in building a strong social protection management information system is linking
     this information to other existing government systems to enable the verification
     of data collected and facilitate efficient distribution of benefits. The software that
48   creates these linkages is currently being piloted in the Middle East and North
     Africa region. Pilot results will become available by the last quarter of 2014.

               CHALLENGE
               Many countries spend a substantial share of their gross domestic product (GDP)
               on SPL programs with the objective of protecting the poor, building resilience for
               the vulnerable, promoting equity, and providing opportunities for enhanced pro-      49

               ductivity. However, many of these programs in the developing world are highly
               fragmented and uncoordinated—resulting in inefficiencies; low program cover-
               age, particularly among poor and vulnerable people; inclusion of the nonpoor;
               inflexibility in responding to shocks; and poor linkages with jobs and productive
               opportunities. To overcome these challenges, governments are increasingly
               focusing on system approaches that allow policies, programs, and delivery
               instruments to work together in a more coherent and cost-effective way.

               APPROACH
               The South-South Learning Forum on Social Protection and Labor this year was
               organized by the World Bank, in partnership with the federal government of Brazil,
               the state and municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro, and the German Agency
               for International Cooperation (GIZ). The forum provided a platform for policy
               makers to share their experiences to improve the design and delivery of SPL
               systems at the policy, program, and service delivery levels. This particular forum
               put special emphasis on building effective delivery systems, and the ability to
               enhance existing enrollment and transaction processes. An additional focus was
               on using information systems to help organize and communicate key indicators
               for effective and efficient program administration.

               Real-world experiences were shared through country case presentations, inter-
               active sessions, field trips, and dedicated group work. Topics included how to

                                                   Família which I can capitalize on when developing similar programs. I
                                                   wanted to see first hand through field trips to improve our knowledge of
                                                   payment systems.”

                                                   “If I can mention one thing I think all participants agree on—that is that a
                                                   single registry is one of the most important instruments in building social
                                                   protection systems.”

                                                   “One thing we realized by coming down here is that each country’s system
                                                   can always be better. There is always room for improvement.”

                                    RSR AND NUTRITION IN AFRICA
                                    In the wake of the food, fuel, and financial crises, rapidly deployed funds
                                    from RSR helped many African countries build their institutional capacity
                                    to address malnutrition and give relevant interventions the position
                                    and budget they deserve in poverty reduction strategies and agendas.
                                    Through its core business of helping establish social safety net systems,
                                    RSR also supported interventions in which social protection and nutrition
                                    worked together to reduce vulnerabilities.

                                    time. In 2011, the growth of an estimated 55.8 million children in Sub-Saharan

                                    APPROACH
                                    The recent situation in Africa highlighted the need to build resilience to food
                                    crises and to expand beyond traditional delivery channels for nutrition by explor-
                                    ing how nutrition-sensitive interventions can be implemented by other sectors
                                    including social protection, education, agriculture, and health. Such interven-
                                    tions range from direct actions such as the distribution of vitamin A capsules to
                                    addressing the underlying determinants of malnutrition—e.g., through improved
                                    agricultural practices adapted to climate change, improved access to clean water,
                                    education for girls, and better access to health services and social protection
                                    programs.
                                          Social protection can support food security
                                          and the ability to address malnutrition in
                                          a variety of ways, particularly by reducing
                                          vulnerabilities. Typically, the beneficiaries of
                                          cash transfers and public works are linked to
                                          nutrition interventions, with nutrition support
                                          delivered either as part of in-kind transfers or
                                          as beneficiary training. Social protection can
                                          also serve as an umbrella framework when
                                          building government capacity to implement
                                          stronger and more interconnected systems
                                          capable of strengthening access to and
                                          demand for quality basic and welfare ser-

     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RESULTS
     •	 In Djibouti, RSR supported nutrition-sensitive social protection through an
        IDA-financed workfare program. The program provides short-term employ-
        ment opportunities for women and men in community-based services jointly
        with a nutrition program. This relatively new concept makes use of com-
        munity-driven behavioral change communication to ensure that the income
54      a person earns from the public works program benefits the whole family’s
        nutritional needs.

     •	 An RSR grant to the Gambia supported the National Nutrition Agency with a
        framework for monitoring and evaluation and a communications strategy that
        has since been rolled out in all regions. The regional health teams have sub-
        sequently scaled-up the promotion of healthy behaviors for maternal nutrition
        and child growth; also, access to therapeutic feeding and nutrition services has
        been improved. The work funded by RSR has informed two IDA operations
        currently under preparation: the Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Results
        Project and the Commercial Agriculture and Value Chain Management Project.

     •	 Ethiopia, a country that has seen recurring seasonal shocks result in famine for
        decades, is developing a system to predict looming food crises. In support of a
        $30 million IDA project, RSR helped Ethiopia’s regional health bureaus improve
        data collection and quality to better track malnutrition in the wake of seasonal
        shocks. Early warning information is now flowing from villages to regional
        administrators and line ministries, enabling a more united and timely response.

     •	 In Rwanda, RSR supported a capacity assessment to scale up nutrition
        actions under the Community Health Workers Program. The assessment pro-
        vided other donors with the opportunity to develop the tools for community
        health workers to better communicate with families and provide advice on
        nutrition practices with a particular focus on women and children.

     •	 In the Democratic Republic of Congo, RSR supported a landscape study of
        existing policies and a nutrition survey in a pilot district. The IDA-supported
  Congolese Health Sector Rehabilitation Support Project used the RSR analytic
  work as a basis for implementation. Despite the multiple crises and insecurity
  afflicting the country, the continuing dialogue and advocacy precipitated by
  the RSR analytical products led to gradual recognition of the importance of
  nutrition to the country’s growth. The Congolese government has since joined
  the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, thereby committing to ensure that
  all government programs are conscious of nutrition and to increasing coverage
  of interventions that improve nutrition during the 1,000-day period between a
  mother’s pregnancy and her child’s second birthday.

•	 Following the food crisis and severe flooding in 2010, the government of
  Benin put into practice a roadmap of institutional reform to give the country’s
  nutrition response a higher priority. To this end, it created a Food Fortification
  Commission and the National Council for Food and Nutrition, and elaborated
  a broad and strategic framework under which these entities operate. RSR
  provided technical support to establish the council; this assistance was used
  to set up a donor coordination platform and to recruit a permanent secretary.
  The technical assistance provided through RSR lev-
  eraged a $28 million IDA operation: the Multisectoral
  Food Health Nutrition Project. As part of a growing
  commitment to ensuring food and nutrition security
  by their governments, Benin and Rwanda joined the
  SUN Movement in the fall of 2011.

•	 Like Benin, Malawi has endured tough conse-                                         55
  quences from exogenous shocks and has an equally
  strong commitment to combating malnutrition
  and food insecurity. Technical support from RSR
  informed a $30 million IDA operation—the Malawi
  Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Project—and leveraged
  another $13.5 million from the Canadian International
  Development Agency. Specifically, RSR provided
  an organizational assessment of, and subsequent
  targeted capacity-building assistance to, the Depart-
  ment of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS. The department
  is now able to play a consequential role in policy
  dialogue and nutrition response.

•	 Building up an evidence base was important in Mad-
  agascar, which was badly affected by the economic
  instability wreaked by the food, fuel, and financial
  crises, and the natural disaster and political crises
  that followed. The effects on Madagascar’s eco-
  nomic and social outcomes continue to be severe,
  with more than 92 percent of the population living
  on less than $2 a day. In some areas, acute child
  malnutrition has increased by more than 50 percent
  and child mortality by 30 percent. RSR supported
  two pivotal surveys to assess the impact of the
       crisis on children under age five and on pregnant and lactating women. The
       data from the health and nutrition study fed into the Emergency Support to
       Critical Education, Health and Nutrition Services Project, a $65 million IDA
       effort that will benefit approximately 2 million people by 2016. The RSR health
       and nutrition grant also leveraged resources for technical assistance from
       UNICEF to implement a household survey.

     •	 As back support to the many nutrition interventions in Africa and elsewhere,
       RSR has fostered the development of global knowledge around nutrition. In
       2010, it produced a toolkit, Resilience in the Face of Crisis: Multisector
       Actions to Achieve Nutrition Results, as a means of capitalizing on the
       momentum growing out of the food, fuel, and financial crises in acknowledg-
       ing the role of nutrition in the alleviation of poverty.
