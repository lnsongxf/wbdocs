Executive Summary
1. Overview
Between May to July 2016, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Supervisory Agent (SA),
led by Management Systems International and supported by Altai Consulting and the Champions
Technical Training Center, conducted 524 sub-project site visits in 33 of the 34 provinces across
Afghanistan (see Figures 3 and 4 on the following pages). By the end of the third quarter, the SA
conducted a total of 1,299 ARTF sub-project site visits. Figure 1 shows the third quarter site visit locations
and breakdowns by province and ARTF project.

The SA identified and trained 24 additional Citizen Monitors (CMs) in the third quarter. The CMs delivered
121 observations from 27 sub-projects (see Figure 2) between April and July 2016.The observations sent
by the CMs were shared with the respective ministries on a weekly basis.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                                                                                 7
A primary objective of the ARTF Third Party Monitoring (TPM) program is to coordinate efforts
between the SA and Government of Afghanistan (GoA) line ministries to improve their utilization of
the findings. As important as identifying and reporting deviations is, it is as important for the SA to
assist the GoA line ministries to effectively utilize the findings submitted by the SA. In the third
quarter, the SA conducted numerous coordination meetings with five GoA line ministries as a means
of discussing findings (good practices as well as deviations), debating root causes, and designing
corrective actions for the following ARTF projects:

    •   The Afghanistan Rural Access Program (ARAP), implemented by the Ministry of Public Works
        (MoPW) and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD).
    •   The Education Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP), implemented by the Ministry of
        Education (MoEd).
    •   The Irrigation Restoration and Development Project (IRDP), implemented by the Ministry of
        Energy and Water (MoEW).
    •   The National Solidarity Program (NSP), implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation
        and Development (MRRD).
    •   The On-Farm Water Management Program (OFWMP), implemented by the Ministry of
        Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL).

By the end of the second quarter, the SA successfully populated a secure, web-based database with
over 30,000 unique documents from the previous ARTF TPM program. In the third quarter, the
current ARTF program data was also added to the ARTF TPM database. The ARTF TPM database
consists of a web-based file hosting service called “Egnyte,” and a secure, cross-platform, open-
source desktop geographic information system application called “QGIS,” that allows data viewing,
searching and analysis. Figure 5 is a screenshot of NSP sub-projects visited in the third quarter.




Figure 5: Visualization of EQUIP sub-projects visited in Kabul and neighboring provinces.

This ARTF TPM database is used daily by the SA to plan sub-project site visits, catalogue Site Visit
Reports and related documents, and analyze findings. It will be made available to the World Bank and
the GoA line ministries in the fourth quarter.

2. Findings
Findings from the combined first and second quarters allow the SA to begin identifying initial patterns
in the ARTF TPM program’s primary monitoring objectives:

    •   Design, construction, operation, and maintenance compliance (all projects).
    •   Environmental, gender, and social safeguard compliance (all projects).
    •   GoA implementation team, contractor, and mobilized capacity assessment (ARAP, EQUIP).
    •   Data verification (EQUIP, NSP).
    •   Irrigation Association and Mirab performance (OFWMP).

2.1. Construction and Maintenance Specification Compliance
Qualified SA field engineers uniformly assess and grade various sub-project components against a
five-point scale in order to arrive at a grade that reflects the overall sub-project quality. An overall
grade of less than 3.00 indicates the sub-project has multiple minor and/or major deviations from the
contracted specifications, and as a result rework is required. An overall grade greater than 3.00
indicates that construction quality conforms to and/or possibly exceeds the design specifications.

Figure 6 shows the average overall construction and maintenance grades for the 524 infrastructure
sub-projects visited in the third quarter by the SA.

Figure 6: Average overall construction and maintenance grades for infrastructure sub-projects visited
in the third quarter.

As evident from Figure 6, the projects (with the exception of EQUIP) have consistently performed
better than average according to the design, construction, material, and workmanship grading
standards applied by the SA.

2.1.1. Afghanistan Rural Access Program
The primary development objective of this jointly implemented program between the MoPW and the
MRRD is to enable rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and
facilities. Secondary roads are the responsibility of the MoPW, whereas tertiary roads are the
responsibility of the MRRD.

In the third quarter, the SA monitored 51 sections of 24 ARAP sub-projects in eleven provinces. This
included six secondary roads and three bridges implemented by the MoPW, ten tertiary roads
implemented by the MRRD, and five bridges also implemented by the MRRD.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                  9
ARAP sub-projects monitored in the third quarter received an overall grade of 3.5, with MoPW and
MRRD sub-projects receiving the same grade (3.5). The average overall grade indicates good quality
design, construction, materials, and workmanship.

Salient findings from the third quarter include:

    •   Of the 24 sub-projects monitored during the quarter:
             o Three sub-projects met their design specifications.
             o 18 met their design specifications with conditions.
             o One sub-project’s physical progress was too little to make an assessment.
             o Two sub-projects didn’t meet their design specifications.
    •   Bridges material and workmanship continued to receive relatively high grades this quarter
        followed by asphalt roads. Some common issues observed on bridge sub-projects were:
        bridge approach roads are not surveyed and designed according to the site requirements and
        protection walls were not included in some cases. A similar pattern was observed in the
        second quarter.
    •   21 sub-projects were delayed and eventually received an extension. Many reasons were
        given for these delays, including the winter season, delayed payments, social problems,
        security incidents, and a change in design drawings. Only three sub-projects (MSI-AR-0364,
        MSI-AF-0074, MSI-AMR-0004) monitored during this quarter were completed on time.

2.1.2. Education Quality Improvement Program
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 233 EQUIP sub-projects in 27 provinces. These included: 15
‘stopped’ sub-projects, 37 ‘recently completed’ sub-projects, and 181 ‘under-construction’ sub-
projects (E1, E2 and AF including Annexes for CC and Missing Items). EQUIP subprojects monitored
during the third quarter received an overall average grade of 3.0.

Salient findings from the third quarter include:

    •   Of the 233 sub-projects visited in this quarter, 112 (48%) were on schedule. The remaining
        121 projects’ completions were delayed, with delays ranging from 20 days to 91 months. The
        primary causes of project delays include delays in project payment by the ministry, security
        problems, site issues, and design revisions.
    •   36 NCB-implemented sub-projects had an average grade of 3.25 (above average), while 197
        CC contracts received an average grade of 2.98 (below average).
    •   Many students were attending classes in tents or other temporary facilities not designed as or
        well-suited for classrooms. 165 schools were observed to be overcrowded, with students
        studying in shifts and more than 40 students per classroom.
    •   Poorly chosen EQUIP school locations was another recurring problem. 33 schools (14%)
        visited were located in areas prone to flooding or on mountain slopes or at the base of a
        mountain where potential landslides can occur. This reflects either deficient surveys or the
        inability of designers to incorporate surveys into their designs.
    •   Lack of adequate supervision at ongoing sub-projects, most frequently in the Missing
        Component category, by MoEd-ISD engineers resulted in poor quality construction, materials
        and workmanship.
    •   Operation and maintenance (O&M) plan was found to be missing in 129 (97%) of 133
        completed schools. According to the school principals, doors, windows, floor concrete,
        plaster, paint, and building roofs needed maintenance and repair.
    •   Electrical systems made up of outlets, switches, and classroom ceiling lights were not
        installed according to the design specifications at eight EQUIP schools.
    •   Delays in payment to EQUIP contractors by the MoEd often caused setbacks in construction.
        This was the case at 121 of the visited sub-projects, which resulted in extended construction
        timelines or the contractor permanently leaving the job site because of cash flow issues.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                10
        There were six such cases where the contractors abandoned the sites and project activities
        were noted as stopped by the SA at the time of monitoring.
    •   Plaster and paint deviations were observed at 39 EQUIP schools. Plaster deviations were
        due in large part to design deficiencies whereby “Plaster Stops” and “Plaster Drip Edges”
        were omitted from the design drawings.
    •   Poor quality doors, windows, and related hardware were observed in 27 EQUIP schools.
        This deviation is usually caused by contractors cutting costs, especially in the case of door
        and window hardware because no specifications are given in the BoQ for these items.

2.1.3. Irrigation Restoration and Development Project
In the third quarter, the SA conducted twelve sub-project site visits resulting in 27 unique reports (24
sections at nine ongoing canals, two hydrological stations, and one meteorological station) in six
provinces.

Salient findings of the third quarter monitoring visits include:

    •   The sub-projects monitored complied with MoEW specifications and received an overall
        average grade of 4.00, demonstrating good quality design, materials, construction, and
        workmanship.
    •   The SA observed that the scopes of work for all nine monitored canals were revised to meet
        the site requirements, but the corresponding MoEW-approved drawings were not available.
    •   Contractors stated at all canals monitored that the prescribed material tests were done.
        However, no material testing documentation was made available to substantiate that claim at
        any of the sites.
    •   The regional offices could not provide O&M plans for any of the sites visited during the
        quarter. The O & M plans are supposed to be available at regional offices.
    •   Meteorological and hydrological stations monitored were compliant with the MoEW
        specifications and the sensors were operational and recording data.
    •   According to communities and the IRDP officials surveyed, Mirabs at visited sites properly
        managed water use according to traditional water rights and canal maintenance guidelines.
    •   Prime contractors worked on the monitored canal sub-projects.
    •   The SA was informed by the Mirabs and the communities at all visited sites that the
        contractors hired skilled and unskilled workers from local communities.
    •   At visited sites, the contractors followed safety standards and provided laborers with Personal
        Protection Equipment (PPE), resulting in a 0% injury record.
    •   The SA interviewed security guards at the hydrological and meteorological stations monitored
        during the quarter, and they stated that they were paid regularly.

2.1.4. National Solidarity Program
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 136 NSP infrastructure sub-projects (59 ongoing and 77
completed with Maintenance Cash Grants [MCG] in six sectors (education, irrigation, power, rural
development, transportation, and water supply and sanitation) across 17 provinces of Afghanistan.

Salient findings from the third quarter include:

    •   NSP infrastructure sub-projects received an average grade of 3.8, reflecting overall good-
        quality design, construction, materials, and workmanship.
    •   MRRD/NSP-supplied data showed 59 sub-projects as ongoing, although a majority of those
        monitored (63%) in this quarter were actually completed.
    •   At three sub-projects (MSI-NS-79687, MSI-NS-22260, and MSI-NS-22334), contraction joints,
        although needed, were not specified in the design drawings for pathways.
    •   At 14 sub-project sites (10%), completion certificates were issued by the PMU even though
        SA observations indicate that some components were incomplete.


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                  11
    •   Building construction quality certificates were not available at seven sites (5%) visited, and
        when enquired about this gap, the FP didn’t have any reasonable answer.
    •   Almost 50% of the sub-projects visited in the third quarter (61) didn’t have O&M plans, though
        an O & M plan was required to be on the site.
    •   Maintenance Cash Grant sub-projects monitored during the quarter were working in line with
        the MCG Operation Manual. Additional salient MCG sub-project observations include:
            o The most common activities under MCGs are road gravelling, compaction, canal
                cleanings, and the construction of protection walls, pathways, and concrete side
                ditches.
            o At 49 of the monitored MCG sub-projects, CDCs established committees of local
                villagers to identify community members to work on projects as laborers. In 22 of
                those cases, CDCs identified laborers from the community on a short-term basis in
                order to give multiple community members the chance to earn a wage over the
                course of the sub-project. At six of the 49 sites, the PMU and Social Mobilizers
                helped CDCs identify laborers from the community.
            o At 22 sites visited (30%) laborers were hired on a short-term rotational basis, which
                resulted in higher employment but lower wages. Depending on the duration of the
                projects and availability of the laborers in the community, the rotations varied from
                two-three days to one week.
            o No women were employed at any of the 77 sites visited.

2.1.5 On-Farm Water Management Project
In the third quarter, the SA conducted site visits at 27 OFWMP sub-projects in five provinces,
resulting in 29 unique site visit reports. Of the 27 OFWMP sites visited, 23 sub-projects were
completed and four were ongoing. All 27 sub-projects visited were operational, and surveyed
beneficiaries reported satisfaction with canal rehabilitation, which led to adequate access to irrigation
water from the canals.

Salient findings from the third quarter include:

    •   Mirabs and Irrigation Associations (IAs) successfully allocated water according to traditional
        water rights, collected water dues, and saw to canal repairs and maintenance.
    •   Construction work completed by contractors in the Nangarhar and Kunar provinces was
        better than that in Herat and Parwan in the third quarter. Reasons for this could include the
        availability of good quality material and skilled laborers as well as effective quality control by
        the MAIL-OFWMP team in Nangarhar.
    •   Most of the observed deviations involved poor workmanship and low quality materials used in
        building stone masonry structures, improperly staggered stones, and gaps between stones
        that had not been properly filled with good quality mortar.
    •   Changes to design dimensions and structure locations were frequently observed in the Herat
        region, but revised design drawings were not available at those sub-project sites.
    •   Minor deviations observed in the third quarter include: canal lids and panels at check and
        outlet structures that were damaged or unavailable at the site; canal parts/sections that were
        worn down or required repair; and canal sections that were filled with debris and required
        cleaning.

2.2. Environmental, Gender, and Social Safeguard Compliance
In the third quarter, the level of environmental, gender, and social safeguard compliance observed
and recorded varied between ARTF projects in terms of Environmental and Social Management
Plans (ESMPs), Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs), and the consultation of women. As seen in
Figure 7, IRDP and OFWMP had a high degree of formal environmental and social safeguard
documentation compliance, NSP achieved mixed levels of compliance, and EQUIP had the lowest
level of compliance.

Figure 7: ESS and Gender compliance at ARTF sub-projects monitored in the third quarter.

Additional ESS and gender findings in the third quarter include:

    •         As evident from Figure 7 above, GRM was available at 82% of the sites across all five
              projects. Stakeholders reported being aware of GRM, but in most cases there were no
              documents available to confirm this. Local stakeholders stated that grievances are handled
              verbally. The absence of documentation (institutional memories) about the nature of
              grievances and how they were addressed precludes the possibility of learning from these
              incidents. Institutional memories help future stakeholders to handle an issue based on
              precedent (which helps maintain consistency) and can be a tool for effectively planning and
              implementing future projects.
    •         Local stakeholders (CDCs, Mirabs, IAs, FPs, communities) claimed that women were
              consulted at 59% of the sites visited during the quarter. However, documentation was not
              available at most sites to substantiate the claim.
    •         Environmental Impact Identification Checklists (EIICs) were available at 65% of NSP sub-
              project sites, but no negative environmental impacts were observed or recorded in a majority
              of cases. NSP infrastructure sub-projects should require mitigation measures due to the
              nature of the construction activities, but since no impact was registered, these records were
              not available.
    •         5,903 trees were cut down at 21 ARAP, NSP, and OFWMP sites, but replantation was done
              at only nine sites. One good environmental practice was observed at MSI-AR-0471 (ARAP
              sub-project), where the contractor planted 800 trees even though none were cut down.
    •         Sand and gravel were obtained from nearby rivers beds at 42 of the monitored sub-project
              sites visited in the third quarter, but GoA ministry representatives and community members
              claim that there was no sizable negative impact on the riverbeds.
    •         Voluntary land acquisitions were reported at 171 of the sites that were monitored in the third
              quarter, whereas documents were available at only 56 sites (Figure 8).

Life-safety related observations from the third quarter include:

    •       In April 2016, the Taliban attacked the Achaka Girls Secondary School (MSI-EQ-1727)
            in Chakana village, Muqur district, Badghis province, with an IED. The attack damaged the
            school building and injured the guard, although no schoolchildren were harmed because the
            explosion took place at night. The principal said that the attack lowered the attendance of 8th
            and 9th grade girls and many subsequently stopped coming to school.
    •       At Chap Qul Primary School (MSI-EQ-1395), the principal stated that an unknown gunman
            appeared around the building at night, and therefore, he keeps important documents at his
            home in case the school building is set on fire.
    •       At the Khwaja Shah Wali Primary School in Shaghal Konda village in Salang district of
            Parwan Province (MSI-EQ-1411), the SA observed a safety issue: there was no railing on the
            retaining wall around the school building.
    •       There are safety issues along the road alignment at sub-project MSI-AR-0143-a (ARAP sub-
            project) due to the lack of a railing on the retaining walls.
    •       Laborers were observed working without Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at two IRDP
            sites (MSI-IRDP-305,306 and MSI-IRDP-351) and one OFWMP site (MSI-OFWM-151).
    •       33 EQUIP schools were located on mountain slopes or at the base of a mountain where
            landslides can potentially occur.

2.3. Data Verification

2.3.1. MoEd Education Management Information System (EMIS) Data Verification
The SA is required to randomly verify teacher and student data collected in the field against MoEd
Education Management Information System (EMIS) data. Although only random sampling is required,
the SA observed and recorded student and teacher attendance at all 227 EQUIP schools monitored
in the third quarter and compared them with data from the MoEd EMIS.

In line with the previous quarters, there continue to be significant variances in the EMIS data and the
data collected by the SA. Salient comparison findings include:

    •       Variances (+/-) were found in student attendance recorded in the field by the SA and data
            stored in EMIS at 224 of 227 EQUIP schools (99%).



8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                     14
    •    Variances (+/-) were found in teacher attendance recorded in the field by the SA and data
         stored in EMIS at 190 of 227 EQUIP schools (84%).

These variances were discussed with the MoEd EMIS department and at that meeting, the SA was
told that EMIS data is updated twice in a year:

    •    Enrolment data is updated in March/April every year for the cold regions.
    •    Exam results data are updated in September/October every year for hot regions.

Based on the information provided, the data should have matched for the third quarter (May through
July) because EMIS data should have been updated in March/April. However, as evident from the
findings there were huge variances in the third quarter also. MoEd-EMIS department has been shared
the data on a monthly basis and a justification explaining the variances is still awaited.

2.3.2. NSP Data Verification
NSP data verification will be provided by the SA in a bi-annual report to be submitted separately at
the end of the first contract year.


3. GoA Utilization of Supervisor Agent Findings
Each week the SA submits a spreadsheet to the GoA line ministries containing deviations identified in
the field that week. The embedded SA Knowledge Managers (KMs) assist each line ministry utilizing
the deviation data provided by the SA to take corrective actions. The KMs track the deviations until
they are corrected.

In the third quarter the SA reported a total of 280 deviations that were agreed upon with the
ministries. Of the 489 total deviations submitted to the GoA line ministries through July 2016,
feedback on 190 were provided by the ministries to the SA, but evidence for corrective actions taken
is only available for 44. It is important to mention that some of the deviations are structural and need
some time to correct. Also, in some cases, especially with EQUIP, the deviations were related to
Operation & Maintenance (O & M) and it is difficult to rectify deviations in absence of O & M funds.

Figure 9 shows the number of reported, addressed, and remaining deviations by GoA ministry.

3.1. ARAP
In the third quarter the SA identified and shared a total of 74 deviations distributed between MoPW
sub-projects (54) and MRRD sub-projects (20). The most frequent deviations included poor side
drainage, which did not function on steep slopes, cracks and settlement on plain cements concrete,
segregation and honeycombs on Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) elements, weep holes and
construction joints were not installed per the design drawings, placement of unsuitable material on
different road layers which caused potholes and rutting development.

Between February and July 2016, 148 deviations were observed and reported to the ministries by the
SA. The SA received 47 responses from ARAP Regional Offices regarding the identified deviations,
which were either correction notices or feedback on action taken by the ministries along with a
tentative timeline of the correction process.

In response to SA findings related to road alignment and sub-project locations, the MoPW-ARAP
recently created a design department, which will create design-specific surveys for each proposed
ARAP sub-project. In response to SA findings related to discrepancies between material and labor
BoQ costs and local material and labor costs, the MoPW-ARAP now conducts a monthly survey of
regional material and labor costs throughout Afghanistan. Previously, the ARAP material and labor
survey was conducted twice a year, but due to the recent fluctuations in local material costs this is
especially important so that MoPW and contractors have the same material and labor cost estimates.
As a direct result of SA reported issues of road slope slippage and road settlement, the MoPW-ARAP
Kabul office has hired a geo-technical consultant to address important road design issues in order to
prevent deviations.

Although the SA shares deviations with the MoPW and MRRD ARAP on a weekly basis, they have
had only minor success in getting the ARAP regional offices to cooperate in the correction of or
feedback about the deviations. The ministries need to do more in terms of working with their regional
offices, specifically their (regional office) capacity development with regards to correcting reported
deviations. However, the ministries are showing that they are serious about deviation prevention by
making changes and additions within their departments.

3.2. EQUIP
The SA submitted a total of 56 deviations to the ISD between February and July 2016, and ISD
provided feedback on all of the deviations reported. The feedback provided by the ISD includes
reasons for the deviations and the actions they are going to take to correct those deviations.

The ISD has established a mechanism whereby the deviations observed and reported by the SA are
sent by the ISD Quality Control Manager to the respective Provincial Education Departments (PED)
Senior Project Manager, who in turn shares the findings with the sub-project site engineers for
general feedback and correction, if necessary.

Although the ISD has developed a mechanism for sharing the critical and frequent deviations reported
by the SA, there has been little significant follow up on the part of the PEDs and the ISD departments
in both the correction and prevention of deviations. ISD management needs to ensure that the PEDs
are following up on reported and agreed upon deviations.

3.3. IRDP
Since February 2016, the SA submitted a total of 33 deviations to the MoEW IRDP Implementation
Team for review and corrective action.

Upon receiving the weekly updated list of deviations in the form of a deviation tracking spreadsheet,
the IRDP Implementation Team in Kabul forwards the deviations to the regional IRDP offices who
share the list with the local IRDP offices. The local IRDP offices are responsible for ensuring
deviations agreed by the IRDP Implementation Team in Kabul are corrected and report back on the
correction status.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                16
In response to the crosscutting issue regarding stone masonry finish quality and specifically the stone
selection, grout joints, and stone placement, the IRDP Implementation Team plans to build a mock up
of a stone masonry wall at the MoEW in Kabul for all IRDP contractors to use as a reference. Other
corrective actions implemented by the MoEW in response to SA findings include:

    •   Improvement of site selection criteria to ensure optimum canal feature locations are selected;
    •   Site specific surveys are now an IRDP requirement in response to canal alignment issues;
    •   Past contractor performance will be used in the selection of future contract awards.

3.4. NSP
The SA submitted 96 deviations to the MRRD through July 2016. Of the 96 reported deviations, 71
deviations were forwarded to the respective NSP PMUs and sub-project Focal Points (FP) for
corrective action. 25 reported deviations e.g., 5% variation in concrete cap thickness of the retaining
wall, plaster crack, etc., were considered insignificant by the MRRD and not forwarded to the PMUs.
Of the 71 deviations forwarded for corrective action, 26 have been addressed by the PMUs through
corrective action measures and 45 deviations are pending.

The MRRD has taken steps to help prevent deviations from reoccurring. In response to reported sub-
projects closing out without the prescribed Building Certificate and mandatory O&M plan, CDCs must
now show proof of these items before the PMUs approve sub-project final completion. Monthly sub-
project progress meetings with NSP are now mandatory for all Focal Points (FP) in response to the
reported FP absenteeism. Frequently reported deviations have been included in the Community
Contracting (CC) Technical Manual as lessons learned for the prevention of project deviations.

3.5. OFWMP
The SA submitted a total of 156 deviations to the MAIL-OFWMP Implementation Team for corrective
actions from February to July 2016. Of the 156 deviations reported, the SA has so far received
feedback on 37 deviations, primarily from the Nangarhar and Kabul provinces. The remaining 119
deviations are still open and awaiting feedback and/or rectification from the MAIL-OFWMP
Implementation Team.

Upon receiving the weekly updated deviation spreadsheet from the SA, the MAIL OFWMP team in
Kabul forwards the deviations to their regional offices, who then share the deviations with the local
offices. The local offices are responsible for ensuring that the reported deviations are corrected and
report back to the OFWMP team in Kabul on the corrective action status.

The MAIL-OFWMP team has taken some steps to help prevent reported deviations from reoccurring.
The lack of approved variances and approved as-built drawings is a cross cutting issue on OFWMP
sub-projects and have been frequently reported by the SA as deviations. In an effort to streamline the
approval process, the MAIL-OFWMP team has combined the two approval processes into one and
has made the application process for approval easier. The issue of broken and/or missing drain
panels (concrete lids), which are frequently reported deviations, has also been addressed by the
MAIL-OFWMP team in Kabul by having each sub-project supplied with a pre-formed lid box so that
communities can easily make their own drain panels when necessary.


4. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
4.1. All Projects
    • All ARTF sub-projects should be constructed according to the respective GoA ministry-
         approved design drawings or the drawings should be revised and then approved by the
         competent authorities before changes are implemented at the site. At 49 sub-projects
         monitored in the third quarter, the design and scope of work was changed without prior
         approval by the respective GoA ministry. A possible cause of this non-compliance could be



8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                 17
        the delay in getting approval from the respective GoA ministry, which should be studied by
        the GoA ministries and improved where needed.
    •   A general lack of O&M plans was a trend found across all ARTF projects monitored in the
        third quarter. Proper O&M strategies should be institutionalized at the sub-project level across
        all projects to increase the lifespan of the completed projects and reduce resulting repair
        costs.
    •   142 sub-projects monitored in the third quarter were impacted because of delays in payment
        by their respective ministry. Contractor payment processing should be studied across all
        projects and improvements made where necessary.
    •   ESMPs should be prepared for all sites, as infrastructure-related sub-projects often have
        negative environmental and social effects caused by construction activities.
    •   Material testing is required by ARAP and IRDP but these tests were not available for review
        at any of the ARAP and IRDP sub-project sites monitored in the third quarter. The contractor
        should keep a copy of material test results at sub-project sites and the same should be
        produced to SA for review and evaluation.

4.2. ARAP
    • Two ARAP bridge sub-projects (MSI-AF-0073, MSI-AF-0019) are not functional due to the
       poor design of the approach roads. These roads should be surveyed and designed according
       to the site requirements and protection walls should be included in the design if needed.
    • Contractors need to pay more attention to side drains. It is a simple, but very critical element,
       and poor side drains are often the reason that road surfaces are damaged or washed out.
    • The manual mixing of concrete and mortar causes rough and unsmooth finishing and results
       in segregation and spalling of the structures’ concrete. All contractors should use machine
       mixers while preparing concrete and mortar. Pre-construction training in the correct
       procedures for concrete mixing and placement should be provided to workers.
    • Expansion joints in stone masonry walls and causeway surface concrete should be filled
       immediately when stone masonry/ concrete work are completed. This will avoid joints filled
       with debris and other material.

4.3. EQUIP
    • Proper site surveys should be conducted and incorporated into school designs to avoid
       potentially dangerous placement of schools and to cater to the actual number of students.
    • EQUIP sub-projects need to improve environmental, gender, and social safeguard
       compliance.
    • Quality Enhancement Grant (QEG) materials (books, cabinets for books, laboratory material
       and other learning materials) were not always used to their potential due to the lack of
       laboratories, libraries, and resource rooms.
    • Students, especially girls, are discouraged from attending school due to the lack of boundary
       walls and basic facilities like latrines and drinking water wells (water quality tested).
    • The number of classrooms being constructed is not in line with the number of Afghan children
       needing access to education facilities.
    • EMIS data is not up-to-date and should be addressed by the MoEd.

4.4. NSP
    • 14 (10%) of the sites monitored in the third quarter received completion certificates from the
       MRRD even though there were incomplete items. The FP and the PMU engineers should
       regularly monitor sub-projects during the implementation phase and a completion certificate
       should be issued only after careful onsite monitoring of the sub-project.
    • Based on SA observations, Community Participatory Monitoring (CPM) is a very good
       approach to improving sub-projects’ performance, improving transparency and accountability,
       and encouraging feedback mechanisms at the community level. Based on the data collected
       by the SA in the last three quarters, the CPM approach is widely used under NSP. At about
       65% of the sub-projects monitored during the last three quarters it was noted that the


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                  18
          communities are using this approach for improved transparency and accountability. However,
          there is scope to institutionalize the CPM approach in all communities.
    •     Different methods are applied in different communities to identify target groups of unskilled
          laborers. Clearly documented criteria is needed to identify this target group so that poor and
          food-insecure families can sustainably benefit from the Maintenance Cash Grant scheme
          sub-projects. Minimum guaranteed labor days should be ensured for the targeted families so
          that they can afford to buy enough food.

4.5. OFWMP
    • Steering gates should be recommended instead of lids and panels, as most of the lids and
       panels observed by the SA in the third quarter were damaged and replacements were not
       available at the site.


5. Trends and Analysis
Monitoring 1,299 sub-projects over two quarters provides initial evidence to infer some initial trends.
The SA also used historical data from the previous ARTF TMP program (2014-15) to do a
comparative analysis. Some initial trends include:

    •     IRDP and NSP have performed well, followed by ARAP and OFWMP. EQUIP has continued
          to receive comparatively low grades among the five projects over a two-year period (Figure
          10).

    •     EQUIP sub-projects visited in the third quarter showed some quality loss as compared to the
          second quarter and historical data available for 2014-2015. EQUIP sub-projects achieved a
          slightly lower grade (3.0) in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.
    •     Over the course of two quarters, ARAP sub-projects continue to receive above average
          grades. Further analysis of the grades received show that bridges continue to receive the
          highest grades for good design, material, and workmanship, followed by asphalt and gravel
          roads.
    •     In the third quarter, IRDP sub-projects continue to receive above average grades. A positive
          incremental trend is seen in the first two quarters of the current ARTF TPM program; the most


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                   19
        recent quarter received good grades (4.0) for all 27 sub-projects monitored compared to 3.8
        in the second quarter.
    •   NSP sub-projects consistently performed better than average. While second quarter
        performance nearly matched the historical data from the previous ARTF TMP program (2014-
        15), grades received by sub-projects visited in third quarter showed further improvement.
        Sub-projects monitored in the third quarter achieved a grade of 3.8 as compared to a 3.6 in
        the second quarter.
    •   Over two quarters, OFWMP sub-projects have continued to receive above average grades. If
        we also consider the historical data from 2014-15, the quality of OFWMP sub-projects
        monitored was below average (< 3.0), but incrementally improved to 3.8 in the most recent
        quarter.


6. Next Quarter
In the fourth quarter, the SA will monitor 601 sub-projects distributed across Afghanistan and all five
ARTF projects. Figure 11 illustrates the distribution of sites to be monitored by the SA in the final
quarter of the first contract year.

Additional monitoring initiatives to be conducted by the SA in the fourth quarter include:

    •   Working with CDCs or Shuras at select EQUIP and OFWMP sub-projects to identify 28 CMs.
    •   Conducting a pilot project in the Nangarhar province to identify CMs through crowdsourcing.
    •   Holding monthly coordination meetings with all five GoA line ministries to review SA findings,
        determine deviation root causes, and design possible corrective actions.
    •   Conducting mobile data collection and geospatial database system training with GoA
        ministries.

7. Beneficiary Story


        NSP IMPACTING LIVES OF THE RURAL AFGHANS
  Naqibullah (photo right) is a 30-year
  old unskilled laborer in Dehswar
  village in Balkh province. He earns his
  living doing manual labor in his and
  neighboring villages.


   “I’m so happy that my family
  doesn’t have to go without
  drinking water when I’m sick or
  when I’m out for work.”


Naqibullah’s family includes his parents, his wife and their five children. He works hard to support his
eight dependent family members. He cannot afford to take time off. His life is very challenging, not only
because he is his family’s sole provider, but also because of an issue that affected not only him but the
other community members: the quality of the drinking water in his village.

In the village where Naqibullah lives with his family and 300 other families, there was no safe drinking
water. Everyone had to get their drinking water from a well that was almost two kilometers away.
Naqibullah said, “sometimes getting water was the biggest challenge, especially when I was sick or
when I was at work far from home. Many times I had to leave work because I had to get water for my
family. My parents are too old to get water from the well. My wife cannot go outside to get water and
our children are too young to shoulder this responsibility. There were times when I was sick and I could
not get water from the well and we had to borrow water from our neighbors.” He further added, “I was
not the only one who suffered from this condition but the entire village suffered the same way.”

Naqibullah continued, “In 2013, under the National Solidarity Program, the MRRD offered to provide
funds for community development and the top priority for the villagers was a water supply network. The
project was completed in approximately one year with the financial support from the NSP and all
villagers happily contributed labor. I still remember it was winter when the actual supply started and it
was the happiest moment of my life and I’m sure the same was the case with our fellow villagers. Now
we don’t have to travel two kilometers or leave work to get water. We can get potable water at our
doorstep. I’m so happy that my family doesn’t have to stay without drinking water when I’m sick or
when I’m at work. At least one challenge in our life is over. Tashakoor!”

This Water Supply Network sub-project (MSI-NS-76660) was completed in 2014 with the financial
support from MRRD under the NSP. The total sub-project cost was AFN 3,333,333, which benefited
300 families, including Naqibullah’s.

Afghanistan Rural Access Project
1. Primary Objectives
In Year I, the SA is required to conduct 150 site visits to selected ARAP sub-projects implemented by
the MoPW and MRRD. The primary monitoring objectives are:

1. Monitor civil works’ contracts, design, documentation, and workmanship quality; random quantity
   checks and comparisons with BoQ; quality and compliance with ESMPs, security, Abbreviated
   Resettlement Action Plans, and GRMs; contractor capacity, onsite mobilization and technical staff
   quality; and other relevant activities related to contract management, including timely payment.
2. Monitor the O&M contracts on completed roads.
3. In collaboration with the World Bank, MoPW and MRRD ARAP implementation teams, recruit and
   train qualified local citizen monitors to supplement TPM work.
4. Train MoPW / MRRD M&E staff to utilize the SA’s data collection and management systems.
5. Provide ARAP TPM program data in a web-based format to the MoPW and MRRD.

Together with World Bank and MoPW / MRRD ARAP implementation teams, the SA developed TPM
data collection forms tailored to the primary monitoring objectives. In the third quarter refinements
were made to the forms to also conduct BoQ quantity checks and traffic volume counts.


2. Overview
In the third quarter (May to July 2016), the SA monitored 51 sections of 24 ARAP sub-projects in
eleven provinces (see Figures 13 and 14 on the following pages). The SA will conduct another 37
ARAP sub-project site visits in the next quarter in order to meet the annual target. Figure 12 provides
a breakdown by category of ARAP sub-projects visited through the end of the third quarter.




Figure 12: ARAP sub-project sites visited in the third quarter.

ARAP sub-projects visited in the third quarter included six secondary roads and three bridges
implemented by the MoPW, ten tertiary roads and five bridges implemented by the MRRD. The status
of each ARAP sub-project monitored in the third quarter were as follows:

    •   MoPW: four sub-projects were completed and under the Defect Liability Period (DLP), three
        were on-going, and two were delayed.
    •   MRRD: five sub-projects were completed and under the DLP, five were on-going, and five
        were suspended.

Sub-project site selection in the third quarter covered all ARAP categories (asphalt roads, gravel
roads, bridges, Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC), Ultra-thin Reinforced Concrete Pavement
(UTRCP), and O&M). MoPW and MRRD staff accompanied the SA to all 24 sub-project visits
conducted in the third quarter.

3. Findings
3.1. Construction and Maintenance Compliance
ARAP sub-projects monitored in the third quarter received an overall grade of 3.5, with MoPW and MRRD
sub-projects achieving the same average grade. The average overall grade demonstrates a reliably good
quality in all aspects of construction, including design, materials and workmanship. Figure 15 breaks
down the overall average grades for ARAP sub-projects by province.

Figure 15: Overall average grade for ARAP sub-projects monitored in the third quarter by province

Salient ARAP sub-project findings observed and recorded in the third quarter include:

     •   Overall design specification compliance of the 24 sub-projects monitored during the quarter were:
              o Three sub-projects met their design specifications;
              o 18 met their design specifications with conditions;
              o One sub-project’s physical progress was too little to make an assessment;
              o Two sub-projects didn’t meet their design specifications.
     • An ARAP sub-project (MSI-AR-0119) in Nimroz province required granular material that could not
         be found locally. Instead, the contractor was required to transport granular material 150
         kilometers from the project site. The resulting transport costs made the material price much
         higher than estimated. Neither the MoPW nor the contractor correctly estimated material costs.
     • 21 sub-projects were delayed and eventually received an extension. Many reasons were
         attributed for these delays, including the winter season, delayed payments, social problems,
         security incidents and a change in design drawings. Only three sub-projects (MSI-AR-0364, MSI-
         AF-0074 and MSI-AMR-0004) monitored during this quarter were completed on time.
•    Road slopes in an ARAP sub-project (MSI-AR-0331) in Samangan province were built at grades of
     19.94%, 18%, 17%, and 16.4% according to MRRD design specifications (see Figure 16).

Figure 16: Road slopes at MSI-AR-0331 in Samangan.

   •   These slopes will make it difficult for any vehicle without four-wheel drive to access the road in
       wet and winter months. Also, the drainage design does not completely address the steep slopes,
       including the run off from culverts, which should flow to a multi-stepped rip raff. The multi-stepped
       rip raff was proposed by the contractor, but the MRRD refused to pay for more than one step.
   •   At an ARAP asphalt road sub-project (MSI-AMR-0004) in Parwan province, a new wearing
       course layer was not shaped and compacted according to the design specifications. On the same
       road, potholes and rutting developed on the newly laid gravel wearing course (see Figure 17).




Figure 17: Damaged portions were repaired, but new cracks and potholes appeared (MSI-AMR-0004).

   •   At another ARAP gravel road sub-project (MSI-AMR-0160) in Kabul province, the newly laid
       gravel wearing course material mix had insufficient gravel and more sand than specified.
   •   Of the eight ARAP bridges monitored in this quarter, two (MSI-AF-0019, MSI-AF-0073) in
       Kandahar and Panjsheer provinces were not functional due to the incomplete/washed out
       approach roads (see Figure 18).

3.2. Performance by Category
In the third quarter, bridges continued to receive better grades for design, material, and workmanship
quality. The average grade by category is given in Figure 19.

3.3. Contractor Performance
Contractor key staff are specified in each ARAP road contract. Qualified engineers and project managers
were observed at all ARAP sub-projects monitored in the third quarter. An adequate labor force, made up
of skilled and unskilled workers, was observed at all monitored sub-projects under construction. Figure 20
shows the average overall grade by contractor in the third quarter.

3.4. Contractor Equipment Quality
The SA observed that contractors had deployed necessary construction equipment on site at all sub-
projects under construction in the third quarter. The quality of the observed construction equipment was
good (see Figures 21 and 22 on the following page).

3.5. Environmental, Gender and Social Safeguard Compliance
Notable environmental, gender, and social safeguard compliance findings in the third quarter include:

    •   ESMP documentation was not available at four sub-projects under construction (MSI-AR-0331,
        MSI-AR-0468, MSI-AR-0452, and MSI-AR-0467).
    •   1,670 trees were cut at five sub-project sites. ESMP documentation did not have a record of
        cutting trees at three sub-projects (MSI-AR-0466, MSI-AR-0452, MSI-AR-0467). Replantation
        was done at only one of five sub-projects (MSI-AR-0470).
    •   At sub-project MSI-AR 0471, the contractor planted about 800 trees although no trees were cut.
    •   GRM was established for all ongoing sub-projects monitored. The most frequent conflicts were
        related to irrigation canal blockage during the construction of culverts. The SA noted that all such
        grievances were resolved amicably.
    •   Nine monitored sub-projects obtained sand and gravel from nearby riverbeds, but no sizable
        negative environmental impact (such as erosion) was reported.
    •   At eleven sub-projects monitored during the quarter, it was observed and noted that no water
        catchment plan was designed for road erosion prevention.
    •   Women were consulted at only one sub-project (MSI-AR-0143) during the planning and
        implementation phases.
    •   An ARAP sub-project (MSI-AR-0452) in Kabul province was delayed because the sub-project
        was suspended for six months due to issues between the contractor and an influential member of
        the community. The community member wanted the contractor to sub-contract portions of the
        tasks to the community member, which the contractor considered unacceptable. After intervention
        by community elders, the issue was resolved and construction resumed.
    •   Based on the SA’s observations and interviews, communities were involved in site selection for
        camping waste disposal at 21 sub-projects.
    •   Land was acquired and land transfer documents were available at four sub-projects.
    •   Workers were equipped with PPE at only four sub-projects (see Figure 23).




Figure 23: Workers equipped with PPE at MSI-AR-0143 in Takhar province, Bangi district.

    •   At four ARAP sub-projects (MSI-AR-0452, MSI-AR-0466, MSI-AR-0467 and MSI-AR-470), 25
        people donated land. At each of the four ARAP sub-projects, Abbreviated Resettlement Action
        Plans were developed.

4. Ministry Utilization of Supervisory Agent Findings
In the third quarter the SA identified and shared with the ministries a total of 74 deviations distributed
between MoPW sub-projects (54) and MRRD sub-projects (20). The most frequent deviations were
related to side drainage (which did not function on steep slopes), cracks and settlement on plain cements
concrete, segregation and honeycombs on RCC elements, weep holes and construction joints not being
installed per the design drawings, and the placement of unsuitable material on different road layers
(which caused potholes and rutting development).

Between February and July 2016, 148 deviations were observed and reported to the ministries by the SA.
The SA received 47 responses to the identified deviations from ARAP Regional Offices, which were either
correction notices or feedback on action taken by the ministries and tentative timelines to correct the
deviations.

In response to SA findings related to road alignment and sub-project locations, the MoPW-ARAP team
recently created a design department, which will create design-specific surveys for each proposed ARAP
sub-project. In response to SA findings related to discrepancies between material and labor BoQ costs
and local material and labor costs, the MoPW ARAP now conducts a monthly survey of regional material
and labor costs throughout Afghanistan. Previously, the ARAP material and labor survey was conducted
twice a year, but due to the recent fluctuations in local material costs MoPW has started doing monthly
surveys of the local material and labor market. This is important that MoPW and contractors have the
same material and labor cost estimates. As a direct result of SA reported issues of road slope slippage
and road settlement, MoPW-ARAP Kabul office has hired a geo-technical consultant to address important
road design issues and prevent deviations.

Examples of corrective actions taken by the ministry are shown in Figures 24 to 27.

Although the SA shares deviations with the MoPW and MRRD ARAP on a weekly basis, they have had
only minor success in getting the ARAP regional offices to cooperate in the correction of or providing
feedback about the deviations. The ministries need to do more in terms of working with their regional
offices, specifically deciding how to correct the reported deviations. However, the ministries are showing
that they are serious about deviation prevention by making changes and additions within their
departments.


5. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Some important lessons learned in the third quarter and resulting recommendations include:

      •    Six ARAP sub-projects (MSI-AR-0404, MSI-AR-0469, MSI-AR-0468, MSI-AR-0466, MSI-AR-
           0470 & MSI-AR-0143) were delayed due to the late payments by the ministries. According to the
           IPs surveyed, improvement in invoice processing times by the ministries are needed. The MoPW
           and MRRD should review their payment process system in order to prevent sub-project delays.
      •    Bridge approach roads should be surveyed and designed according to the site requirements and
           protection walls should be included in the design where needed. Two ARAP bridge sub-projects
           (MSI-AF-0073 and MSI-AF-0019) are not functional due to the poor design of approach roads.
      •    Contractors need to pay more attention to side drains. It is a simple but very critical element.
           Most road surface damage or washouts are due to poor side drains.
      •    Manual mixing of concrete and mortar by workers causes rough finishing, as well as segregation
           and spalling of the concrete. All contractors should use mixers while preparing concrete and

        mortar. Pre-construction training should be provided to workers so that they know the correct
        procedures for concrete mixing and placement.
    •   Expansion joints in stone masonry walls and causeway surface concrete should be filled
        immediately. This will avoid joints filled with debris and other material.
    •   Material testing results were not available on site at seven ARAP sub-projects under construction.
        According to the ARAP engineer’s statements, the results were sent to the ARAP regional office.
        A copy of material test results should be available at sites for SA review and evaluation.


6. Trends and Analysis
Data gathered in the field at 60 ARAP sub-projects is insufficient to establish conclusive trends. However,
inferences can be drawn to indicate some initial trends:

    •   Over the course of two quarters ARAP sub-projects continue to be graded above average.
    •   Further analysis of the grades given shows that bridges continued to receive the highest grades
        for good design, material and workmanship, followed by asphalt and gravel roads (Figure 28).
    •   Further analysis of the grades given show that MRRD-managed sub-projects performed
        comparatively better in the second quarter, but in the third quarter MRRD and MoPW sub-
        projects achieved the same grade (Figure 29 on the following page).
    •   The SA tried to compare performance of the sub-project by provinces to draw some conclusion
        about how PMU oversight impacted sub-project performance. The analysis indicates that a sub-
        project’s performance is not always directly linked to the efficiency of the PMU (Figure 30 on the
        following page).

Education Quality Improvement Program
1. Primary Objectives
In Year I, the SA is required to conduct 750 site visits to selected EQUIP sub-projects implemented by the
MoEd Infrastructure Services Department (ISD). Primary monitoring objectives are:

    1. Monitor school design, documentation, construction and maintenance quality; track identified
       deviations; verify bid compliance; assess Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMPs);
       and discuss remedial measures with the ISD.
    2. Observe and report on ISD engineer performance, including contract management and payment
       processing, at all levels of sub-project supervision.
    3. Randomly monitor teacher and student attendance; and compare with EMIS and payroll data.
    4. Conduct spot checks to assess the availability and use of textbooks/learning materials in
       classrooms and the use of Quality Enhancement Grants (QEGs).
    5. Recruit and train qualified local monitors to supplement TPM work.
    6. Train MoEd ISD staff to use the SA’s field data collection and management systems.
    7. Provide TPM program data in a web-based format to the MoEd.

Together with World Bank TTLs and the ISD, the SA developed TPM data collection forms tailored to all
EQUIP primary monitoring objectives. The data collection forms were further refined in the third quarter.


2. Overview
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 233 EQUIP sub-projects in 27 provinces (see Figures 32 and 33).
In line with the World Bank’s suggested selection criteria, the SA monitored 15 ‘stopped’ sub-projects, 37
‘recently completed’ sub-projects, and 181 ‘under-construction (E1, E2 and AF including Annexes for CC
and Missing Items)’ sub-projects in the third quarter. Figure 31 provides a breakdown by school category
of EQUIP sub-projects visited.




Figure 31: EQUIP sub-project sites visited in the third quarter of Year 1

131 EQUIP schools monitored in the third quarter were combined-gender schools, 36 were girls-only
schools, 60 were boys-only schools, and six were PED facilities. A total of 2,892 male teachers and 1,803
female teachers were observed. A significantly higher number of male students were observed attending
EQUIP schools on the days visited: 113,019 male students versus 64,448 female students.

MoEd representatives accompanied the SA to 164 out of 233 EQUIP sub-project sites in the third quarter.

3. Findings
3.1. Construction, Maintenance and Contract Management Compliance
EQUIP subprojects monitored in the third quarter received an overall average grade of 3.0, which is
slightly lower than the results from the previous quarter. 94 EQUIP sub-projects monitored in the third
quarter received unsatisfactory grades (below 3.0), primarily due to poor material quality and
workmanship. Three EQUIP sub-project received good grades (4.0 and above). The remainder (136)
received grades between satisfactory and good. Figure 34 breaks down the overall grades given to
EQUIP sub-projects by province.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                                                                                   39
Salient general findings observed and recorded for EQUIP sub-projects in the third quarter include:

    •   Many students were attending classes in tents or other temporary facilities not designed or well-
        suited for classrooms. 165 schools were observed to be overcrowded with students studying in
        shifts with more than 40 students per classroom (see Figure 36)




Figure 36: Students attend class in the open because of school overcrowding and a lack of classrooms
at the Badam Ali Girls Middle School (MSI-EQ-0986).

    •   Poorly chosen EQUIP school locations was another recurring problem. 33 schools (14%) visited
        were located on mountain slopes or at the base of a mountain, where potential landslides can
        occur, or in areas prone to flooding, reflecting either deficient surveys or the inability of designers
        to incorporate surveys into their design (see Figure 37).

   •   Lack of adequate supervision at ongoing sub-projects, most frequently in the Missing Component
       category, by MoEd-ISD engineers resulted in poor quality construction, materials and
       workmanship. Figure 38 shows an example of a poorly constructed garbage collection vessel.




Figure 38: Garbage collection vessel damaged due to no reinforcement (MSI-EQ-0285).

   •   O&M Plans were missing in 129 (97%) of completed schools. According to the school principals,
       doors, windows, floor concrete, plaster, paint, and building roofs needed maintenance and repair.
   •   Electrical systems made up of outlets, switches, and classroom ceiling lights were not installed
       according to the design specifications at eight EQUIP schools (see Figure 39).

   •   Delays in payment to EQUIP contractors by the MoEd often caused setbacks in construction.
       This was the case at 121 sub-projects visited, which resulted in extended construction timelines
       or the contractor permanently leaving the job site as the contractors struggled with cash flow
       issues.
   •   Plaster and paint deviations were observed at 39 EQUIP schools. Plaster deviations were due in
       large part to design deficiencies whereby “Plaster Stops” and “Plaster Drip Edges” were omitted
       from the design drawings (see Figure 40).




Figure 40: Exterior plaster and paint damaged and peeled off (MSI-EQ-1336).

   •   Another frequent deviation observed in 27 EQUIP schools was the poor quality of doors,
       windows, and related hardware, which is usually caused by contractors cutting costs. Cost cutting
       is most common in cases where no specifications are given in the BoQ, as in the case of door
       and window hardware.
   •   Of the 233 sub-projects visited in this quarter, 112 (48%) were on schedule. Completion of the
       remaining 121 projects was delayed. The delays range between 20 days and 7.5 years. The
       primary causes include delays in project payment by the ministry, security problems, site issues,
       and design revisions.
   •   96 Missing Components (boundary walls, latrine blocks, and water wells) were provided to CC
       schools constructed between 2006 and 2008. At almost all of those schools, repair and
       maintenance work is needed because of normal wear and tear over a period of time.
   •   Roof structures with poor waterproofing systems and/or a lack of proper roof drains and
       downspouts were observed at 18 sites. Some roof problems stem from inadequate slope; a roof
       constructed flat or nearly so will not drain water rapidly, and as a result, standing water can
       infiltrate the waterproofing layer and eventually seep through to the ceiling below.
   •   Non-compliance with ESS and Gender requirements at EQUIP sub-projects continued in the third
       quarter. About 95% of sub-projects monitored didn’t have an ESMP. Female consultation was
       observed at only 27% of the sites visited and GRMs were implemented at only 39% of the sites
       visited.

3.2. Environmental, Gender and Social Safeguard Compliance
Salient environmental, gender, and social safeguard findings observed in the third quarter include:

    •   Of 233 EQUIP schools visited, only 13 had an Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
    •   Women were consulted in the planning and implementation phases at only 64 sub-projects.
    •   Land was acquired at 111 sites, but land acquisitions documents were available only in 11.
    •   GRMs were in place at 91 sub-projects, but related documents were available at only eight.

An example of a good environmental practice in a school environment is seen in Figure 41.

3.3. Data Comparison
Although only random sampling is required per the TPM contract, the SA observed and recorded student
and teacher attendance at all 227 EQUIP sub-projects monitored and compared them with data from the
MoEd Education Management Information System (EMIS). In line with the previous quarters, variances
between EMIS data and data collected by the SA persist:

    •   Variances were found in student attendance recorded in the field by the SA and data stored in
        EMIS at 224 of 227 EQUIP schools (99%).
    •   Variances were found in teacher attendance recorded in the field by the SA and data stored in
        EMIS at 190 of 227 EQUIP schools (84%).

The variances were discussed with the EMIS department, and the EMIS department responded that the
data is updated twice in a year. Specifically:

    •   Enrolment data is updated in March/April every year for the cold regions.
    •   Exam results data are updated in September/October every year for hot regions.

3.4. Learning Material and Quality Enhancement Grants
185 of 233 EQUIP sites visited in the third quarter received QEGs 1, 2, or both. At 70% of the schools
(130 of 185), books, learning aids, and laboratory equipment were actively being used by students and
teachers. At the remaining schools that received QEGs 1, 2, or both, books and learning aids were not
used to their fullest potential due to the lack of laboratories, libraries, and resource rooms. Figure 42
shows QEGs by province at schools visited in the third quarter.

3.5. Participatory Monitoring
In the third quarter, the SA identified three CMs in Kunar, Nangarhar, and Wardak provinces. The SA
provided on-site training to the identified CMs, and the CMs have provided eight observations verified by
the SA and subsequently shared with the MoED-ISD. Sample observations submitted by the CMs are
shown in the Figures 43 and 44.

4. Ministry Utilization of Supervisor Agent Findings
The ISD has established a mechanism whereby the deviations reported by the SA are sent to the ISD QC
Manager for initial review with the embedded SA Knowledge Managers. The ISD QC Manager forwards
the deviations to the respective Provincial Education Department’s (PED’s) Senior Project Manager, who
in turn shares the findings with the sub-project site engineers for feedback and correction, if necessary.

In the third quarter, the SA submitted 30 deviations to the ISD for corrective actions. Between February
and July 2016 the SA reported a total of 56 deviations. Through July, the ISD communicated all 56
deviations to the respective PED, but neither the ISD nor any PED has submitted any confirmation to the
SA (i.e. date stamped and geo-referenced photos after implementing a corrective action).


5. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Lessons learned in the third quarter and associated recommendations include:

    •   Lack of O&M plans is a general finding across all projects. O&M plans and funding should be
        institutionalized to conduct repair and maintenance and increase the lifespan of sub-projects.
    •   Proper site surveys should be conducted and incorporated into school designs to avoid the
        dangerous placement of schools and to cater to the actual number of students.
    •   The MoEd payment processing system should be streamlined to avoid delays.
    •   EQUIP sub-projects should improve environmental, gender, and social safeguard compliance.
    •   Due to the lack of laboratories, libraries, and resource rooms, the materials provided under QEGs
        were not always used to their potential.
    •   Lack of boundary walls and basic facilities like latrines and drinking water wells discourages
        students, especially girls, from attending school. Latrines were missing at about 112 schools
        (48%), and 39 schools (17%) had no boundary walls.


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                     45
   •    The number of classrooms being constructed is not in-line with the number of Afghan children
        needing access to education facilities.
   •    According to the MoEd/ISD, their representatives could not accompany the SA to 69 EQUIP sub-
        project sites (30%) due to understaffing at the provincial level and the lack of funds for staff
        transportation and per diem. Better time and resource management could have enabled the
        provincial units to accompany the SA to all sub-project sites. For accountability and capacity
        development, it is important for ISD staff to accompany the SA to all sites.
   •    Based on the information provided by the MoEd, ideally EMIS and SA teacher and student data
        should match for the third quarter (May through July) because EMIS data should have been
        updated in March/April. Since this was not the case, the MoEd data collection and storage
        process in EMIS should be investigated.
   •    Although the ISD has developed a mechanism for sharing deviations reported by the SA with
        their provincial and sub-project colleagues, there has been no follow up on the part of the PEDs
        and ISD departments regarding corrective and preventative actions taken. ISD management
        needs to ensure that the PEDs are following up on reported and agreed upon deviations.


6. Trends and Analysis
Based on the data collected in the field at 524 EQUIP sub-projects in the second and third quarters,
inferences can be drawn to indicate some initial trends:

   •    NCB-implemented sub-projects continue to have quality advantage over CC-implemented sub-
        projects (see Figure 45).
   •    Sub-projects visited in the third quarter show some quality loss compared to the previous quarter
        along with the historical data available for 2014-2015 (see Figure 46 on the following page).
   •    Analysis of provincial data shows sub-projects in some provinces (Badakhshan and Urozgan)
        consistently performing below average, whereas Baghlan, Balkh, Kunar, and Nangarhar have
        consistently achieved above average grades for workmanship, material, and design (see Figure
        47).

Irrigation Restoration and Development Project
1. Primary Objectives

In Year I, the SA is required to conduct 100 site visits to IRDP sub-projects implemented by the Ministry of
Energy and Water (MoEW). Primary monitoring objectives include:

    1.   Monitor construction, contractor and maintenance compliance.
    2.   Monitor environmental, gender and social safeguard compliance.
    3.   Recruit and train qualified local Citizen Monitors (CMs) to supplement TPM work.
    4.   Train MoEW staff to use the SA’s field data collection and management systems.
    5.   Provide TPM program data in a web-based format to the MoEW.


2. Overview
In the third quarter, the SA monitored twelve IRDP sub-projects resulting in 27 unique Site Visit Reports
(24 sections at nine ongoing canals, two hydrological stations, and one meteorological station) in six
provinces (Kandahar, Herat, Parwan, Badakhshan, Ghor and Nimroz - see Figures 49 and 50 on the
following pages). Figure 48 shows the number of IRDP sub-projects visited through the third quarter.




Figure 48: IRDP sub-project sites visited in the third quarter of Year 1.

General site selection criteria were determined at the beginning of the program in consultation with the
World Bank and MoEW-IRDP Implementation Teams. In addition, the MoEW requested the SA to focus
on ongoing canal sub-projects along with select hydrological and meteorological stations.

MoEW representatives accompanied the SA to eight of twelve sub-projects monitored in the third quarter.

3. Findings
3.1. Construction and Maintenance Compliance
Notable general findings observed and reported from twelve IRDP sub-projects monitored in the third
quarter include:

   •   The sub-projects monitored generally complied with MoEW specifications and received an overall
       average grade of 4.00, demonstrating good quality design, materials, construction, and
       workmanship. Figure 51 shows an unreinforced canal intake structure on the Khawabagh Canal
       in the district of Charbojak in Nimroz. The concrete surface is smooth and includes weep holes
       that reduce hydro pressure by relieving water buildup. Backfill was compacted in lifts and the
       worker is seen with PPE.




Figure 51: The Khawabagh Canal in Charbojak district Nimroz (MSI-IRDP-332a).

   •   The SA observed that the scopes of work for all the nine canals monitored were revised to meet
       the site requirements, but the corresponding MoEW-approved drawings were not available.
   •   At all canals monitored, contractors stated that the prescribed material tests were conducted. No
       material testing documentation was made available to substantiate those claims at any site.
   •   There was no O&M plan available at any of the sites visited during the quarter.
   •   Meteorological and hydrological stations monitored were compliant with the MoEW specifications
       and the sensors were operational and recording data. Figure 52 on the following page shows the
       Nazdik Hydrological Station built in the Karukh district of Herat. The hydrological station was
       reported as being 100% compliant with design specifications.

Figure 52: The Nazdik-i-Hirat Hydrological Station in the Karukh district of Herat (MSI-IRDP-ST-116)

    •   Mirabs at visited sub-projects managed water use and canal maintenance properly according to
        the community and IRDP officials interviewed.
    •   All work at the monitored canal sub-projects was conducted by prime contractors.
    •   The SA was informed by the Mirabs and the communities at all sites visited that the contractors
        hired skilled and unskilled workers from local communities.
    •   At visited IRDP sites, the contractors followed safety standards, provided laborers with PPE, and
        had a 0% injury record.
    •   The SA interviewed security guards at the hydrological and meteorological stations monitored
        and they (security guards) stated that they were paid regularly.

3.2. Environmental, Gender, and Social Safeguard Compliance
Notable environmental, gender, and social safeguard findings from the third quarter include:

    •   Local communities were involved at the selection stage of the quarry site, borrow pits, work
        camp, and waste disposal depot at all monitored canal sub-projects.
    •   The Environmental and Social Focal Point (ESFP) was assigned at all sub-projects monitored.
    •   Communities reported that pre-consultation meetings were held with women concerning project
        plans and the prioritization of their sub projects, including social structures at all nine monitored
        canal sub-projects.
    •   There were no reports of concerns raised by community women regarding the canal schemes.
    •   GRM was in place at all the nine canal sub-projects monitored, but GRM records were not
        available at any of the sites during the monitoring visits.
    •   Additional land was not required for any of the sub-projects monitored according to the IRDP
        officials and Mirabs.

3.3. Participatory Monitoring
In the third quarter, the SA identified and recruited 13 Citizen Monitors in Kandahar, Badakhshan and
Nimroz provinces. Based on selection criteria agreed with the World Bank and MoEW, the SA identified
CMs for ongoing IRDP sub-projects where the ministry envisaged a need for periodic monitoring. The SA
provided on-site training to the CMs and since April, they have provided 30 verified observations that
were shared with the MoEW.

Figure 53 shows a CM observation in Ashoqa village of Zheray district in Kandahar (MSI-IRDP-3511).
The observed elements were in compliance with MoEW design specifications.

3.4. Ministry Coordination Meetings
Coordination meetings with the MoEW-IRDP team were conducted in the third quarter and the following
points were discussed:

    •   Monthly Site Visit Reports and deviations reported since the inception of the program.
    •   The MoEW-IRDP team presented corrective actions for the deviations reported by the SA.
    •   The SA provided an update on the status of Citizen Monitoring.


4. Ministry Utilization of Supervisory Agent Findings
Each week the SA sends an updated deviation spreadsheet to the IRDP Implementation Team in Kabul.
After review in Kabul the updated deviation spreadsheet is forward to regional IRDP offices who share the
list with the local IRDP offices. The local IRDP offices are responsible for ensuring deviations approved
by the IRDP Implementation Team in Kabul are corrected and report back on the correction status (with
photographic evidence).

Since February 2016, the SA submitted a total of 33 deviations to the MoEW IRDP Implementation Team
for review and corrective action. Figure 55 shows a sample deviation reported by the SA in the third
quarter: a crack in the stone masonry wall of a wash culvert on the Shar-e-Naw canal (MSI-IRDP-242),
which was shared with the MoEW IRDP Implementation Team.




Figure 55: Cracked stone masonry wall at the Shar-e-Naw canal (MSI-IRDP-242).

Of the 33 deviations reported, 24 have been corrected and 9 are pending. Examples of corrective actions
taken by the MoEW are shown in Figures 56 and 57 on the following page.

Figure 57: The Ablution house was repainted per the specifications after the SA report (MSI-IRDP-320).

In response to the cross-cutting problem of stone masonry finish quality (specifically stone selection,
grout joints, and stone placement), the IRDP Implementation Team plans to build a mock up of a stone
masonry wall at the MoEW in Kabul for all IRDP contractors to use as a reference. Other corrective
actions implemented by the MoEW in response to SA findings include:

    •   Improvement of site selection criteria to ensure optimum canal feature locations are selected.
    •   Requiring site specific surveys in response to canal alignment issues (this is a new IRDP
        requirement).
    •   Awarding contracts based on contractor performance.

5. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Some important lessons learned in the third quarter and resulting recommendations include:

    •    When an IRDP sub-project design is changed to meet site requirements, the MOEW should
         provide the revised design drawings and new specifications to the SA for site-visit reference.
    •    The MoEW should develop and implement sustainable O&M plans for IRDP sub-projects.
    •    The scopes of work at all nine monitored IRDP canals under construction were revised, but the
         corresponding MoEW-approved drawings were not available at the time of the site visit. This is a
         general trend and underscores to the need for the MoEW design approval process to be
         improved.
    •    At all IRDP sub-projects monitored in the third quarter, each contractor told the SA that material
         tests were conducted. However, no material testing documents were available at any site visited.
         The MoEW should develop a proper material testing documentation system and share it with the
         SA.
    •    MoEW representatives should accompany the SA to all IRDP sub-project sites. This was not the
         case in the third quarter.


6. Trends and Analysis
Data gathered in the field at 46 IRDP sub-projects is insufficient to establish conclusive trends. However,
inferences can be drawn to indicate some initial trends:

    •    In the third quarter, IRDP sub-projects continue to be graded above average. It is worth noting
         that there has been an incremental positive trend, and the most recent quarter received good
         grades (4.0) for all 27 sub-projects monitored (Figure 58).

1. Primary Objectives
In Year I, the SA is required to conduct 404 site visits to NSP infrastructure sub-projects implemented by
the MRRD. The primary monitoring objectives for infrastructure sub-projects are:

    1. Monitoring technical and operational compliance.
    2. Monitoring environmental, gender and social safeguard compliance.

2. Overview
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 136 NSP infrastructure sub-projects (59 ongoing and 77 completed
with MCG) in six sectors (education, irrigation, power, rural development, transportation, and water supply
and sanitation) across 17 provinces (see Figures 60 and 61 on the following pages). Figure 59 provides a
breakdown of NSP infrastructure sub-projects visited through the end of the third quarter.

Figure 59: NSP infrastructure sub-project sites visited in the third quarter.

Sub-project site selection criteria applied in the third quarter was in line with MRRD and World Bank
guidance provided at the outset of the program. Sub-projects selected in the third quarter also needed to
be:

    •    Sites where communities received a MCG.
    •    Sites where the physical work started under a MCG.
    •    Ongoing sub-projects with Repeater Block Grants (RBGs).

59 ongoing NSP infrastructure sub-projects were selected based on data provided by the MRRD. While
sub-projects at 37 of the selected sites had been completed when the SA visited, the sub-projects at the
remaining 22 sites were ongoing, with completion levels ranging from 30% to 90%. Of the 59 sites visited,
44 were operational, two were partially operational, and 13 were non-operational. Representatives from
the MRRD and the FPs accompanied the SA to all 136 sites visited in the third quarter.

3. Findings
3.1. Construction and Maintenance Compliance
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 136 NSP infrastructure sub-projects that received an overall
average grade of 3.8. The average overall grade reflects good quality in all aspects of construction,
including design, materials, and workmanship. Figure 62 shows break down of the overall grades
received by NSP infrastructure sub-projects by sector and Figure 63 breaks down the overall grades by
category.

Salient issues observed during the third quarter include:

    •   In two cases, mosques were constructed on the sites where Community Center Construction sub-
        projects (MSI-NS-67960 and MSI-NS-67952) were specified. Both sub-projects are located in
        Gurbuz district of Khost province and facilitated by IRC (see Figures 64 and 65). It is important to
        mention that the communities intended to construct a mosque from the beginning. When the SA
        inquired, the communities gave the logic that the mosques were also used as community centers.

    •   MRRD/NSP-supplied data listed 59 ongoing sub-projects, but a majority of those monitored in this
        quarter (63%) had already been completed.
    •   At 14 sites, completion certificates had been issued by the PMU even though some components
        were incomplete based on SA observations (Figure 66).

sidewall concrete cap is missing.


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                       61
    •   The scope and design of one sub-project (MSI-NS-76066) was changed by the CDC, but written
        approval from the PMU and the revised drawings were not available at the site.
    •   At three sub-projects (MSI-NS-79687, MSI-NS-22260, and MSI-NS-22334), contraction joints —
        although needed — were not specified in the design drawings for pathways.
    •   According to the NSP technical manual, there should be an expansion joint every ten meters for
        protection and retaining walls. However, expansion joints were not specified in the design
        drawings at four sub-projects: MSI-NS-79691 (08-0821-0056-2-a, 08-0821-0056-6-a), MSI-NS-
        22264 (09-0901-0019-1-d, 09-0901-0019-6-a), MSI-NS-22260 (09-0901-0018-6-a), and MSI-NS-
        21604 (08-0820-0003-6-a).
    •   Building construction quality certificates were not available at seven sites (MSI-NS-46729, MSI-
        NS-40105, MSI-NS-90220, MSI-NS-88823, MSI-NS-38031, MSI-NS-67952, and MSI-NS-67960).
    •   61 sub-projects had no Operation and Maintenance (O&M) plan.

3.2. Environmental and Social Safeguard Compliance
Notable environmental and social safeguard findings from the third quarter include:

    •   At 28 sites visited, CDCs had held meetings in the past three months (21%).
    •   ESMPs were available at 115 sites visited (85%).
    •   Site Selection Criteria Checklists were available at only 77 sites visited (57%).
    •   EIICs were available at 89 sites visited (65%).
    •   At one site visited (MSI-NS-66964), around 30 trees were cut for canal widening but no
        replantation was done according to the local CDC.
    •   At eight sites, riverbeds were used as borrow pits for sand and gravel. However, at one site (MSI-
        NS-6763), the CDC reported that the riverbed was not rehabilitated properly (see Figure 67).

    •   Land acquisition was required at 56 sites visited (41%), but land transaction documents were
        available only at 46 sites (34%). GPS coordinates were included in the land transaction
        documents at only 4 of 56 sites requiring land acquisition (7%).
    •   At 96 sites, CDC members were aware of GRM. However, grievances were only documented at
        five sites. According to the CDCs surveyed, they (the CDCs) resolve most conflicts verbally.

3.3. Gender Compliance
Notable gender findings from the third quarter include:

    •   Community Participatory Monitoring (CPM) committees were established at 79 sub-projects
        visited (58%) and women were members at 65 of those sites (82%).

Third quarter findings pertaining to female participation are summarized in Figure 68.

3.4. Maintenance Cash Grant
The SA monitored 77 MCG sub-projects in ten provinces in the third quarter. Salient findings include:

    •   Maintenance Plans (Form 1) and Paid Labor Logbooks/Registers (Form 2) were maintained at all
        sub-projects visited.
    •   The most common activities under MCGs are road gravelling, compaction, and constructing
        protection walls, canal cleanings, pathways, and concrete side ditches.
    •   At 49 of the monitored MCG sub-projects, CDCs established committees of local villagers to
        identify community members to work on the projects as laborers. In 22 of those cases, CDCs
        identified laborers from the community on a short-term basis in order to allow multiple community
        members the chance to earn a wage over the course of the sub-project. At six of the 49 sites, the
        PMU and Social Mobilizers helped CDCs identify laborers from the community.
    •   Community members reported no grievances at any of the sub-project sites that were visited.


8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                                63
   •   PMU Social Mobilizers/Engineers visited all but one sub-project visited by the SA.
   •   At 22 sites visited in the third quarter, laborers were hired on a short-term rotational basis, which
       resulted in a higher employment but lower pay.
   •   No women were employed at any of the 77 sites visited.
   •   According to the Form1, communities involved with the monitored MCG sub-projects received a
       total of AFN 39,732,689 ($584,304). This benefited 19,358 families in ten provinces.
   •   According to Form 2, 2,244 skilled laborers and 61,674 unskilled laborers worked at 77 sub-
       projects from the MCG program’s start up to the date of the SA’s visit.
   •   According to Form 2, at the 77 MCG sub-projects visited, a total of AFN 1,458,450 ($21,448) was
       paid to skilled laborers and AFN 18,663,960 ($274,470) was paid to unskilled laborers from the
       MCG program’s start up to the date of SA visit.
   •   Unskilled laborers were paid AFN 300 ($4.41) per day and skilled laborers are paid AFN 650
       ($9.55) per day.


4. Ministry Utilization of Supervisory Agent Findings
The SA has submitted 96 deviations to the MRRD since November 2015. Of the 96 reported deviations,
71 deviations were forwarded to the respective NSP PMUs and sub-project Focal Points (FP) for
corrective action. 25 reported deviations were considered insignificant by the MRRD Engineering
Department and not forwarded to the PMUs. Of the 71 deviations forwarded for corrective action, 26 have
been addressed by the PMUs through corrective action measures and 45 deviations are pending.

The most common deviations observed and reported in the third quarter were related to the quality of
works implemented. A detailed list of the deviations along with their corresponding date-stamped and
geo-tagged photos, probable causes, possible solutions, and probable cost of corrections is provided in
the weekly deviation tracking spreadsheet submitted to the MRRD/NSP by the SA.

Figures 69 to 72 show sample deviations and their corresponding corrective actions implemented in the
third quarter.

                                                     (MSI-NS-72846).

The MRRD has taken steps to help prevent deviations from reoccurring. In response to reported sub-
projects closing out without the prescribed Building Certificate and mandatory O&M plan, CDCs must now
show proof of these items before the PMUs approve the sub-project’s final completion. Monthly sub-
project progress meetings with NSP are now mandatory for all Focal Points (FP) in response to the
reported FP absenteeism. Frequently reported deviations have been included in the CC Technical
Manual as lessons learned for the prevention of project deviations.

At one coordination meeting conducted by the SA with the MRRD-NSP team in the third quarter,
deviations submitted by the SA along with possible root causes and corrective actions were discussed.
Furthermore, the World Bank representative, who also attended this meeting, suggested that MRRD-
NSP/FP should send their engineer with the SA instead of a social organizer or other admin staff.

5. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Some important lessons learned in the third quarter and resulting recommendations include:

   •   One of the major challenges faced by the SA was the unavailability of an up-to-date NSP
       infrastructure sub-project list. Based on the data provided by MRRD/NSP team, 59 ongoing
       infrastructure sub-projects were selected for monitoring in the third quarter. However,
       approximately 37 of those sites (63%) were completed when SA engineers visited them. A
       regular update of the MRRD/NSP database is recommended.
   •   14 sites visited (10%) had received completion certificates although they were still incomplete.
       The FP and the PMU engineers should regularly monitor the sub-projects during the
       implementation phase and a completion certificate should only be issued after careful onsite
       monitoring.
   •   Designs and drawings were not prepared according to the NSP technical manual and/or
       engineering requirements. FP engineers should design sub-projects according to the actual
       engineering requirements and in line with the NSP Technical Manual. PMU engineers should
       review the sub-project design carefully.
   •   O&M plans should be institutionalized in all NSP infrastructure sub-projects to increase the
       lifespan of completed sub-projects and reduce the resulting maintenance and repair costs.

8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Third Quarter Report: May to July 2016                  65
   •   Some NSP infrastructure sub-projects monitored in the third quarter didn’t have an ESMP, site
       selection criteria checklist, and environmental impact identification checklist. All NSP
       infrastructure sub-projects should have these documents as part of their required environmental
       compliance. An EIIC should be prepared with an appropriate mitigation plan to address negative
       environmental impacts observed at the sites.
   •   Based on SA observations, CPM is a very good approach to improving sub-projects performance,
       improving transparency and accountability, and encouraging feedback at the community level to
       guide corrective actions. Based on the data collected by the SA in the third quarter, currently 79
       sub-projects (58%) have CPM, but this should be implemented by all communities.
   •   Different methods are applied in different communities to identify target groups of unskilled
       laborers. Clearly-defined criteria are needed to identify this target group so that poor and food-
       insecure families can sustainably benefit from the program. Minimum guaranteed labor days
       should be ensured for the targeted families so that they afford to buy enough food.
   •   NSP can take multiple steps to help PMUs and Focal Points respond to deviations requiring
       corrective action. Although the SA shares a deviation tracking spreadsheet with the MRRD-NSP
       team that includes information on the possible deviation’s causes and solutions, more specific
       instructions on how to correct the deviation may be required by the contractor. Repairing and/or
       retrofitting faulty work is oftentimes more difficult than new work and can require a specific skillset
       or expertise. Structural cracks in beams, girders, and slabs are all examples of deviations found
       at NSP sub-projects. Corrective action and repair work requires correct surface preparation as
       well as the application of a two-part epoxy designed specifically for structural repair; however, this
       process is not commonly understood by all working within the construction community. Providing
       better and clearer instructions for contractors may expedite the corrective action process.


6. Trends and Analysis
After monitoring 244 NSP sub-projects through July 2016, some initial inferences can be made:

   •   NSP sub-projects consistently performed above average. While second quarter performance
       grades nearly match the historical data from the previous ARTF TMP program (2014-15), grades
       received in the third quarter showed improvement (see Figure 73).

    •    Based on SA observations in the field, UN-Habitat, IRC, DACCAR, and BRAC have consistently
         performed well whereas BDN, Relief International, and Care International have performed
         relatively poorly. It is important to note that this initial analysis is done only for FPs that have
         facilitated more than five sub-projects (Figure 76). Figure 77 below tracks FP performance over

On-Farm Water Management Project
1. Primary Objectives
Between November 2015 and October 2016, the SA is required to conduct 100 site visits on the OFWMP
sub-projects implemented by the MAIL. The primary OFWMP monitoring objectives as defined by the
World Bank are:

    1.     Monitor the strengths and weaknesses of Irrigation Associations (IAs).
    2.     Monitor Mirabs’ effectiveness and sub-project implementation support.
    3.     Monitor water delivery to and utilization by the end water users.
    4.     Train MAIL M&E staff to utilize the SA’s field data collection and management systems.
    5.     Provide MAIL with TPM program data in a web-based format.
    6.     Monitor the infrastructure part of the OFWMP sub-projects.


2. Overview
In the third quarter, the SA conducted site visits to 27 OFWMP sub-projects in five provinces (see Figure
79 on the following page) resulting into 29 unique Site Visit Reports. Of the 27 OFWMP sites visited, 23
were completed and the remaining four were ongoing. All were operational.

Figure 78 provides a breakdown of OFWMP sub-projects visited through the end of the third quarter.

Site selection in the third quarter was accomplished by combining the general criteria agreed upon with
the MAIL and the World Bank. In addition, the MAIL requested that the SA monitor completed sub-
projects in Herat province and ongoing sub-projects in Nangarhar province.

MAIL representatives accompanied the SA to all the 27 sub-projects monitored in the third quarter.

3. Findings
3.1. Construction and Maintenance Compliance
In the third quarter, the SA monitored 27 OFWMP sub-projects. The average overall grade of 3.8
demonstrates good quality design, materials, construction, and workmanship. Figure 80 breaks down
the overall grades received by the OFWMP sub-projects by province.

Notable general findings observed and reported in the third quarter include:

    •   At the Bala Joy canal (MSI-OFWM-42), there was no control gate or turnout structure at the
        branch canal intake. The canal filled with stones and debris and required cleaning (see Figure
        81).

    •   On the Joye Dah Canal (MSI-OFWM-022), ten culverts were specified in the design drawings.
        Seven were constructed at the site and head walls of some culverts were missing (see Figure
        82).




Figure 82: Culvert head walls were specified but not constructed at the site (MSI-OFWM-22).

    •   At the Kalatak canal (MSI-OFWM-151), laborers worked without PPE and instead of using a
        mortar mixer machine, they mixed mortar by hand on the ground. The contractor also utilized
        child labor, which is illegal under Afghanistan’s labor laws.
    •   Minor deviations observed in the third quarter include: Lids and panels at check and outlet
        structures were damaged and not available at the site, some canal parts were worn down and
        required repair, and some parts of the canals were filled with debris and required cleaning.
    •   Rehabilitation of the 27 canal sub-projects monitored in the third quarter resulted in 3,420
        hectares of additional agricultural land according to Irrigation Associations (IAs), Mirabs, and
        OFWMP officials.

3.2. Environmental, Gender and Social Safeguard Compliance
Notable environmental, gender, and social safeguard findings from the third quarter include:

    • ESMPs were available at all 27 sub-projects visited. They included environmental impact
      mitigation measures, a selection of access routes for transporting construction materials to the
      site, a safety plan for labors, strengthening of the traditional Mirab system, and capacity
      building of the IAs and Mirabs.
    • Water flowing in the Khuja Sabz Posh Canal (MSI-OFWM-035) and Khuja Chust Canal (MSI-
      OFWM-036) was contaminated with industrial waste. As a result, the community could not use
      the water for irrigation, which negatively affected crop yields (see Figure 83).

Figure 83: Contaminated water of Khuja Chasht canal (MSI-OFWM-036)

    • According to the Mirabs interviewed, trees were cut down at 22 sub-projects visited. Trees
      were replanted at 15 sub-projects following a ratio of two to one.
    • Sand and gravel were obtained from nearby rivers at 25 sub-project sites. Based on SA
      interviews of IAs and Mirabs, there was no significant negative impact on the river beds.
    • A formal GRM existed at all sub-projects visited. In most cases, the community communicated
      their grievances verbally to IAs, but important grievances were recorded in the GRM log
      books.
    • Private land was not acquired at any site monitored in the third quarter.
    • The MAIL-OFWMP team held meetings with women prior to and during the construction phase
      and their concerns and suggestions were incorporated at all visited sub-projects.
    • Female consultation was documented at all the 27 monitored sub-projects this quarter.
    • First aid kits were available at all the four ongoing sub-projects
    • No life-safety issues were observed in this quarter.
    • Community access point structures for women (i.e. locations for clothes washing, animal water
      drinking, dish washing, and other water use) were constructed at ten sub-projects monitored
      although they were specified in the design drawings for 19 sub-projects. However, out of the
      nine sub-projects where community access point structures were noted as missing, three sub-
      projects were under construction at the time of monitoring, and the contractors of those three
      sites informed the SA that they will construct community access points as specified in the
      design drawings in the last phase of the construction activities. Figure 84 on the next page
      shows a well-built community access point in Hinko Village (MSI-OFWM-153). The slab,
      retaining walls, and dimensions all meet design specifications.

3.3. Irrigation Association and Mirab Performance
The performance of IAs and Mirabs was also monitored in the third quarter and the salient findings
are summarized below:

    •   According to the communities and OFWMP officials interviewed:
         o IAs performed their duties according to the bylaws, including collecting and managing
             water user dues, informing the community about water allocation plans during and after
             canal rehabilitation, and liaising with the MAIL-OFWMP;
         o Mirabs performed their jobs efficiently, including doing necessary canal maintenance and
             managing and allocating water to the end water users according to the traditional water
             rights;
         o Water end users were informed well in advance by the IA and Mirab about canal
             rehabilitation work and they (water end users) were satisfied with the canal rehabilitation
             work and the resulting water distribution and utilization.
    •   The IA for the Deh Pada canal (MSI-OFWM-020) collected and deposited 48,000 AFN into
        the bank account for canal maintenance and small repairs.
    •   The IA for the Gulbafa canal (MSI-OFWM-025) spent 125,000 AFN on canal maintenance
        and small repairs.
    •   According to IAs, Mirabs, OFWMP officials interviewed, and SA interaction with community
        members, all communities were satisfied with the canal rehabilitation work; three communities
        also requested the MAIL-OFWMP team to approve additional funding to rehabilitate the
        remaining parts of their canals.
    •   The OFWMP-MAIL and the IA reported that communities contributed 10% of the total contract
        cost (in-kind) contribution (i.e. labor and backfilling) at all the canal sites visited in the third
        quarter.

3.4. Coordination Meetings with Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
During the third quarter, four coordination meetings were conducted with the MAIL-OFWMP team.
Major issues discussed at the meetings included:




8005414 ARTF Third Party Monitoring Program – Quarterly Report May to July 2016                          74
    • Deviations reported by the SA and corrective actions taken by the MAIL-OFWMP team.
    • Coordination of joint monitoring visits by SA and MAIL staff.
    • Citizen Monitoring of select OFWMP sub-projects.


4. Participatory Monitoring Results
As per the SA’s Term of Reference, CMs were not evisaged for OFWMP. However, based on a
request from the World Bank TTL and subsequent approval from the ARTF Sr. Operations Officer on
June 30, 2016, the CM target for IRDP was reduced to 20 and CM was included in the OFWMP
scope of work. In the third quarter, three CMs were recruited in Nangarhar province. Based on the
sub-project site selection criteria agreed upon with the World Bank and MAIL-OFWMP, the OFWMP
CMs were identified for ongoing sub-projects where the ministry envisaged a need for periodic
monitroing. The identified CMs were provided on-site training by the SA and have provided 19 verified
observations that were shared with the MAIL-OFWMP.

Canal in the Surkh Rud district of Nangarhar Province (MSI-OFWM-155).


5. Ministry Utilization of Supervisory Agent Findings
Each week the SA sends an updated deviation spreadsheet to the MAIL-OFWMP Implementation
Team in Kabul. After review in Kabul the updated deviation spreadsheet is forwarded to regional
OFWMP offices who share the list with the local OFWMP offices. The local IRDP offices are
responsible for ensuring that deviations agreed upon by the OFWMP Implementation Team in Kabul
are corrected and that the correction action is undertaken and reported (with photographic evidence)
back to Kabul.

In the third quarter the SA submitted 117 deviations to the MAIL-OFWMP team for corrective actions.
Between February and July 2016 the SA sent a total of 156 deviations. Through July the MAIL-
OFWMP team communicated all deviations to the provincial and local offices. Feedback and
corrective action confirmations were received for 37 deviations, primarily from the Nangarhar and
Kabul offices. An example of a reported OFWMP deviation and related corrective action is shown in
Figures 87 and 88.

The MAIL-OFWMP team has taken some steps to help prevent reported deviations from reoccurring.
The lack of approved variances and as-built drawings is a cross cutting issue and these have been
frequently reported by the SA as deviations. In an effort to streamline the approval process, the
OFWMP has combined the two approval processes into one and has made the application process
for approval easier. The issue of missing or broken drain panels (concrete lids) being frequently
reported as deviations has also been addressed by the OFWMP team in Kabul by having each sub-
project supplied with a pre-formed lid box so that communities can easily make their own drain panels
when necessary.

6. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
Lessons learned in the third quarter and resulting recommendations include:

    •   In line with the first two quarters, the SA observed in the third quarter that design revisions
        were made at all of the OFWMP sub-projects monitored, but no supporting documentation of
        prior approval of any design revision by the MAIL was available at the sites. A possible cause
        of this non-compliance is delays and difficulties in getting MAIL approval. Therefore, the
        current design change and approval process should be reviewed.
    •   No O&M plan was available at any OFWMP sub-project monitored in the third quarter and a
        similar pattern was observed at OFWMP sites monitored in the first two quarters. The MAIL
        OFWMP team should develop and implement an O&M plan for every sub-project going
        forward.
    •   Many observed lids and panels were damaged or not available at the site. Based on this
        finding the MAIL should consider implementing steering gates instead of lids and panels.


7. Trends and Analysis
Data gathered in the field at 78 OFWMP sub-projects is insufficient to establish conclusive trends.
However, inferences can be drawn to indicate some initial trends:

    •   Over two quarters, OFWMP sub-projects continue to receive above average grades. If we
        also consider the historical data from 2014-15, it is worth noting that the quality of OFWMP
        sub-projects monitored were below average (< 3.0), but incrementally improved to 3.8 in the
        most recent quarter (Figure 89).
