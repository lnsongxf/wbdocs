executive summary
t          his assessment presents a synthesis of analysis to contribute to the definition of a lower
           carbon and greener growth path for Romania to 2050. The objective of Romania’s green
           growth path is to implement mitigation actions and undertake needed adaptation while
           preserving growth and employment. Sectoral analysis of energy, transport, urban, water,
agriculture, and forestry is complemented by economy-wide modeling. To bring together the find-
ings, three multi-sector scenarios for Romania’s economic development to 2050 are developed:
the first without any additional greening actions but including current European Union (EU) climate
policy—the baseline; the second with modest effort at further action framed around implementa-
tion of the imminent EU 2030 low carbon targets and modest adaptation efforts—Green; and the
third with ambitious action to align Romania with the EU’s prospective Roadmap 2050 accompanied
by ambitious adaptation—Super Green. Despite its technical depth, this report takes a practical
approach to identifying specific challenges and opportunities Romania faces in building its green
growth future and to present them in a form useful for decision makers. (See Table ES1 where the
methodologies are presented by sector or approach.)

Romania has maintained a steady growth in output while containing the growth of its greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions. The country grew faster than the rest of Europe during 2000 to 2008 and recov-
ered quickly from the international financial crisis. Meanwhile, Romania’s greenhouse gas emissions
continued on their long-term path of decline.1 While emissions per capita are currently the lowest
in the EU, Romania has among the highest levels of energy and emissions intensity (the energy or
emissions per euro of GDP) in the European Union (EU) despite ongoing improvements, and the




1. In the period 1991–2013, the level of GHG emissions in Romania experienced a 46 percent decline, and in the period
1999–2013—an 18 percent decline. From 1991 to 2013, a year-on-year emission increase happened only in eight years.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                                                                 xvii
Figure ES.1.  Growthand energy consumption have been decoupling and energy intensity
continuously declining since the early 1990s
Trends in growth, energy use, and energy intensity




Notes:  Energy consumption is measured in thousand tons (metric) of oil equivalent. GDP is measured in millions of US$ at
2005 prices. Energy intensity is gallons of oil equivalent per dollar of GDP.

energy sector2 in Romania is responsible for near 60 percent of emissions in the country.3 Energy is,
therefore, an obvious and necessary sector to lead on mitigation action (See Figure ES.1).

From now to 2050, real incomes in Romania are expected to continue to grow, and its carbon emis-
sions are expected to continue declining. Romania’s per capita income is converging towards EU aver-
ages albeit at a modest pace. Growth overall will be dampened by the ongoing decline in Romania’s
population and labor force, but continuing improvements in total factor productivity will keep growth
positive. Expanding output and incomes will be sufficient to bring about higher energy demand, which
in turn will support rising per capita and overall emissions. In the Baseline scenario, compliance with the
current EU ‘2020 climate and energy package’ and participation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
(ETS) will offset this trend, with total emissions rising only slowly after 2020. Pressure to reduce energy
intensity going forward will hasten the underlying momentum towards service sectors and away from
heavy industry. At the same time, it is assumed that the country will tackle the many inefficiencies that
keep it off its best possible growth path by pursuing reforms and investments to improve the overall
performance of key sectors, apart from moving to greener growth paths. (See Figure ES.2).

Romania can meet the targets of the Green scenario with only modest costs to growth and employ-
ment, EU emissions trading for energy-intensive sectors sets a uniform price for GHG allowances,

which generates an efficient allocation across countries of mitigation actions in those sectors. (See
Figure ES.3). Even with no additional policy actions by the government, Romania is already on a
declining carbon path because of the current EU climate and energy package. The tighter (immi-
nent) targets of the Green scenario will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in all sectors further,
by more than one-fifth by 2030 compared to 2005 (an additional 17 percentage points beyond that
achieved by current policies) at a cost of only 1.1 percent of output.

The Super Green scenario, in contrast, seems likely to prove expensive and demanding at the
economy-wide level. By 2050, emissions could be more than two-thirds below 2005 levels, but at a
likely cost of GDP four percent lower than otherwise. Employment impacts are similar. Importantly,
the cost to Romania of either greener path is higher than the EU average.4 This outcome reflects the
fact that Romania is already on a downwards trend for carbon emissions, and modest additional mit-
igation is not overly burdensome despite Romania’s starting point of relatively high energy intensity.
However, mitigation as dramatic as that under the Super Green scenario is difficult and expensive.
Moreover, since the shift to lower carbon will not be uniform across the economy, it will be important
for the government to monitor sectoral, regional, and social impacts of the green transition, as labor
and capital move across sectors, and stand ready with safety nets as warranted.

A greener energy sector needs to continue the transition towards low carbon fuels and away from
coal. Achieving emission reduction targets beyond the EU 2020 targets—the Green (imminent EU
2030 targets) and the Super Green (prospective EU 2050 targets)—will require Romania to abandon
plans for new coal-based power generation capacity and life-extension of existing plants. It will also
require a significant additional renewable generation capacity. Replacement of obsolete fossil-fuel
electricity plants poses a heavy investment burden irrespective of mitigation targets; and switching
to renewable power to reduce energy sector emissions at the same time will augment those costs,
especially because an increase in the variable wind and solar sources will require a corresponding
additional peak load capacity. Ongoing participation in EU emissions trading will drive power emis-
sions to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, without any new policies (the Baseline scenario), as
new generation focuses on renewables and nuclear power in the face of rising carbon prices. (See
Figure ES.4 on how the structure of baseline power generation evolves.)

The difficulty of meeting the tighter targets for mitigation set out in the Green and Super Green
scenarios will be eased significantly by improvements in energy efficiency. Improving energy effi-
ciency across the board in all economic sectors, but especially in the residential sector and district
heating, offers the most effective and also viable means for containing the growth of energy demand,
limiting investment requirements to meet the growing demand, and reducing GHG emissions. Major
measures include use of more efficient lighting and electric appliances, retrofitting buildings with
wall, window and roof insulation, heating system improvement in residential, commercial and public
buildings, and use of efficient electric motor and thermal energy equipment in the industry sec-
tor. These energy efficiency measures can reduce energy demand for space heating in buildings,
promote energy efficiency in industry, and moderate household demand for electricity. Residential
energy consumption can be reduced by more than one-quarter by 2050 (compared to Baseline lev-
els); service sector energy use by almost one-third (because of the impact of efficiency measures in
non-residential buildings); and more than one-sixth decline in industrial sector energy consumption.

The investment costs for these measures are substantial, totaling €19 billion through 2050;5 however,
they deliver significant abatement, are cost efficient, and require a modest implementation effort.

Investment in lower carbon power generation is the most expensive part of either green scenario.
Under the Green scenario, in which power emissions are pushed to 45 percent of the 2005 level by
2030 (rather than by 2050 as in the Baseline), aggressive energy efficiency measures contain demand
such that a nearly unchanged level of investment in power generation can add additional solar and
nuclear, and electricity generation from fossil fuel-based sources decreases rapidly. Investment costs
would rise from an average annual 0.8 percent of GDP of investment for the power sector in the
Baseline scenario during 2015–50 to 1.1 percent for supply-side capital and demand-side energy
efficiency measures under the Green scenario (or an increase from €28 billion of investment in the
Baseline to €37 billion in the Green scenario6). Going to zero in the power sector in the Super Green
scenario requires energy efficiency measures complemented by expensive new electricity generation
from renewable sources and nuclear and eliminating electricity generation from coal-based sources
by 2030. Romania’s power sector emissions could be driven close to zero by 2050 by investing an
average annual 1.7 percent of GDP in the power sector during 2015–50. (See Figure ES.5). Critically,
for a successful shift towards low carbon energy, today’s government must accelerate needed sector
reforms in several areas: pricing, restructuring of lignite and coal power-generating companies, and
support mechanisms for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and shale gas investment.

The challenges for mitigation in the fossil fuel-dependent transport sector are significant, espe-
cially as Romania’s motorization rate converges with the EU average. Transport emissions are likely

to grow under current policies by 15 percent by 2030 and 44 percent by 2050 as more people drive
more cars more kilometers, and national policies have a leading role in pushing transport to con-
tribute to the imminent 2030 EU target for such sectors of –20 percent (compared to 2005). Policies
for the transport sector face the challenge of containing the pressure on emissions coming from
continuing growth in vehicle ownership and road travel and the fossil fuel dependence of the sector.
The ongoing shift towards road transport for both passenger and freight traffic derives from pricing
that does not reflect the full costs of transport, technologies that are fuel inefficient, and the influ-
ences of spontaneous transition of the urban form (due to relaxation of land development controls,
encouraging low-density development). Intertwined challenges are traffic congestion, poor parking
management, declining public transport patronage, increasing private vehicle usage, an old taxi
fleet, and lack of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in urban areas. (See Figure ES.6).

A greener transport sector will require new and coordinated national policies and investments
and will yield many additional benefits beyond GHG reduction. Since transport is not part of Euro-
pean emissions trading, mitigation policies are the responsibility of national governments. Romania
already has a national transport plan which includes commitments to rail investment, as well as an
existing set of taxes and incentives and traffic management measures. A greener transport sector
can be fostered through new taxes on fuel and vehicles, and programs for eco-driving and ‘smarter
choices’ in personal travel planning. The disincentive of high parking charges should be combined
with an effective and efficient public transport system, and good walking and cycling facilities. Trans-
port service provision needs to be addressed holistically to ensure that public transport is able to
attract new users and realize the full climate and economic benefits. As shown in the marginal abate-
ment cost analysis, transport options have very high calculated net costs in the absence of inclusion
of important co-benefits such as reduced air pollution, diminished congestion, and fewer road acci-
dents. Although challenging given the underlying trends, the growth in transport emissions can be
slowed by implementing Green or Super Green packages. (See Figure ES.7 and ES.8.)

Urban areas, especially Romania’s largest city of Bucharest, have the potential to lead on many
green issues, starting with energy efficiency. Urban areas represent a concentration of population,
economic activity, energy use, and GHG emissions, especially Bucharest. Low density development

on the periphery of Bucharest with no integrated transport and land use planning has contributed to
more inefficient urban form. Today, buildings account for the largest share of energy consumption,
and residential buildings in particular use the majority of energy for heating. (See Figure ES.9).

Proactive measures to promote smart urban development in Bucharest and other urban areas,
including more compact city design, improved vehicle stock and efficiency, and policies promoting
building efficiency upgrades, can deliver sizable reductions in annual energy spending and emis-
sion levels. Such a package of urban low carbon measures would consist of a mixture of land-use
planning and action to reduce emissions from buildings, transport and solid waste. Promotion of
mixed land use, up-zoning and transit-oriented development are part of the recommended policy
package, along with congestion pricing and district heating upgrades. Preferential land space for
public transport, creation of pedestrian-only zones, parking policies and completion of ring roads
are complementary transport actions. At the same time, energy efficiency can be fostered through
various financing support and capacity-building programs. Such a policy shift can lead to less sprawl,
higher densities, mixed-use, and a coordination of transit and spatial planning. In turn, better spatial
development will generate significant improvement in energy use, energy spending and emissions.
Overall, emissions from buildings in a Low Carbon scenario are projected at almost 40 percent below
the BAU level in 2050, transport emission at 23 percent below BAU, PM10 emissions 39 percent lower,
NOx emissions will be reduced by 16 percent, and a total (real) savings in energy spending will
amount to US$440 million per year by 2050, accrued to the municipal budget. The solid waste sector,
currently mostly landfills, can achieve the highest proportional emissions reduction, with 80 percent
below the baseline by 2050 if Bucharest-Ilfov meets all EU targets on recycling and biodegradable
waste diversion. Finally, a successful shift to a low carbon pathway for Romania’s capital city, and then
for other municipalities as the lessons of Bucharest’s experience emerges, demands strong local
leadership to steward Bucharest to a low carbon future. (See Figure ES.10).

A changing climate will affect water and water-using activities and sectors in Romania, but there
are numerous adaptation actions that make sense. Water demand for agriculture has decreased
in correspondence to the long trend of reduction in irrigated areas, but water scarcity is serious in
many basins during summer droughts, and climate change will threaten water availability during the
primary growing months while raising irrigation water demand. At the same time, crop yields will be
affected by climate-driven changes in soil moisture, direct temperature effects on crop growth, and
changes in the evapotranspiration requirements of the crop, among other effects. Similarly, supply
reliability for industrial and domestic use is most challenged for basins with lower endowment dur-
ing summer months. A possible increase in hydropower generation as part of a lower carbon energy
sector will both constrain and be constrained by changes in river runoff. (See Figure ES.11).

A greener water sector should pursue adaptation investments with the greatest potential. These
investments include optimizing agronomic inputs, including fertilizer inputs, and rehabilitating irri-
gation infrastructure to restore irrigation production to currently rainfed areas. Expanded irrigation
should be targeted to the Southeast and South-Muntenia regions. These measures would require
complementary investment in high-quality extension services, as well as increased and/or subsidized
availability of fertilizers, with the payoff being a significantly increased crop yield. To ensure consoli-
dation of the smallest farms is encouraged while also avoiding an unnecessary subsidy to the largest
farms which are already quite productive, fertilizer programs should be targeted for farms of medium

size (roughly 10 ha). Recommendations also include encouraging windbreaks and soil management
to reduce soil erosion, promoting renewable energy sources, promoting organic farming, improving
good farming practices, improving awareness of climate change and the need for adaptation, and
strengthening policy, and institutional capacity is vital to support the recommended interventions.
Modest adaptation actions in the water sector under the Green scenario, including investment in
enhanced fertilizer application and in increased crop varieties, would cost about €1.8 billion over
2015–50 while more ambitious water sector investments in the Super Green scenario add investment
in irrigation rehabilitation, pushing costs to over €11 billion for the period.7

Romanian agriculture requires adaptation actions, and the sector can also contribute to mitigation
goals. Agriculture has average crop yields 30–50 percent below the EU average and labor produc-
tivity four times lower than the EU average, at least partly due to the large share of subsistence agri-
cultural holdings. The ageing farm population and out-migration of the younger generation could
trigger a significant change in the structure of the sector in the next 15 years. Effective policies will be
essential to address the risk of land abandonment and address the issue of land fragmentation. As
noted above, the main adaptation actions in Romanian agriculture include a reliable irrigation infra-
structure, adjusted crop varieties, and improved fertilizer application, all of which will improve reve-
nues more than sufficiently to cover costs. Emissions from the agriculture sector can be addressed

through a number of mitigation actions. Currently two major supported mitigation measures are
minimum tillage and manure management. Financing needs for these measures are low, although
small farms are ineligible for the related EU support. The measures are also highly beneficial from the
point of view of sector efficiency. Moderating methane emissions from livestock through changes in
feed may also prove important, especially if this part of the agricultural sector continues to expand
into the future at recent rates of growth. (See Figure ES.12).

Romania’s forests warrant a greater role in climate action. Romania has the largest intact tract
of contiguous natural and naturally regenerated forests in Europe. LULUCF8 activities (and mostly
forestry activities) removed more than one-quarter of Romania’s emissions during 2000–11. Climate
change, however, is negatively affecting forest health and growth through drying and biological risks
such as pest infestation and increased frequency of forest fires. This compromises forests’ ability to
sequester carbon, unless they are appropriately managed. Romania’s forest holdings are a mix of
private, public, small and large, and have uneven road accessibility, requiring concerted efforts to
promote sustainable management of forests. With investments, forestry appears a very attractive
option for Romania to reduce its emissions, and it would be important that the EU move rapidly
toward defining the rules (including the country level targets and the flexibility rules) for LULUC-
F-based mitigation within its 2030 Framework. A greener path for the forestry sector would include
better management of forest resources (both protection and production forests), afforestation, and
policy measures to create incentives for sustainable forest management on both private and public
forest lands. Intensive sustainable management of forests and increasing afforestation can increase
the level of CO2 sequestered. Romania’s forests can provide significant mitigation contributions at
low cost, but some public financing and good use of EU funds will be needed. (See Figure ES.13).

An overview of the costs of this low carbon green growth path for Romania is informative for
government planning. Drawing together the analysis of investment costs across four key sectors—
electricity, energy efficiency, water, and transport—from 2015 to 2050, elicits an average annual
1.5 percent of GDP of additional investment needed for the Green scenario and 2.4 percent for the
Super Green scenario. These numbers are equivalent to an annual investment of €3.5 billion in the
Green scenario and €5.2 billion in the Super Green scenario in the period from 2015 to 2050.9 Of the
estimated costs from now until 2020 of €11 billion under the Green scenario, two-thirds belongs to
electricity generation investments and more than one-quarter to energy efficiency; while under the
Super Green scenario, with the total costs of €14 billion, electricity generation is responsible for one-
half of the total and energy efficiency and water—for more than one-fifth each. The costs of building
new power plants dominates investment needs under the Super Green scenario after 2030, when
the urgent push for energy efficiency tapers off. Funding from the EU could prove key for financ-
ing some of these investments, in particular in energy efficiency and in forestry (the costs for which
are additional to these aggregates). Importantly, the likely share of public investment is modest, at
less than one-sixth of the total and less than one-quarter for the Green and Super Green scenarios
respectively. Figure ES.14 provides an estimate of the sector contribution to the overall abatement
and also of the cost each sector would have per unit of CO2 abated. Marginal Abatement Curve for
Romania (Figure ES.15) shows abatement potential and unit costs of each of the evaluated measures,
across sectors. In year 2050, when all measures will be implemented in full, actions across the four

mitigation sectors in this assessment will reduce emissions in the country by 38 Mt CO2 eq./year. It
should be kept in mind that such costings are snapshots based on available data and the technology
set that today is considered practical for such assessments. New technologies will certainly emerge
over the coming decades that will change these costs and benefits, providing an important reason
why governments need to update such analysis periodically.

Note: How to read the MACC. The height of each column shows the average cost of abating one ton of CO2e by 2050.
The chart is ordered from left to right from the measures with the lowest cost to the ones with the highest cost. The width
of each column shows the GHG emission reduction potential of the measures in year 2050, when all the measures have
been fully implemented. See sector technical reports for discussion of technologies. Calculations use a tool developed at
the World Bank.

10. NOx is a generic term for mono-nitrogen oxides, in particular, NO2. NO2 forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks
and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone,
and fine particle pollution, NO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system. NOx are distinct from
nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas emitted from agricultural lands. PM10 is atmospheric particulate matter smaller than
10 microns.

      introduction

      This assessment presents a synthesis of analysis to contribute to the definition of a lower carbon
      and greener growth path for Romania to 2050. The objective of Romania’s green growth path is
      to implement mitigation actions and undertake needed adaptation while preserving growth and
      employment. Sectoral analysis of energy, transport, urban, water, agriculture, and forestry is comple-
      mented by economy-wide modeling and made consistent through the application of three common
      scenarios.

      Chapters of the report have a standard structure, but the underlying analytic work varies. Each
      starts with a chapter summary, followed by a description of the relevant challenges to green growth.
      Then, the methodology is laid out, and the main findings summarized. Finally, conclusions and rec-
      ommendations are introduced. Despite the identical structure of the chapters, analytic work under-
      taken for each sector differs depending on sector specifics, green growth objectives in particular
      sectors in Romania, and analytic tools available.1 Therefore, the analysis has varying methodological
      frameworks, analytic tools including modeling, and types of findings and recommendations:
      •	 The Benchmarking analysis (Chapter 1) aims to define, “What is green growth, and how green
         is Romania?” It provides an initial portrait of Romania’s status, prospects, and challenges with
         respect to green growth using a framework for mapping the country against comparator coun-
         tries and country groups on three aspects: “how green?,” “going green,” and “riding a green
         wave.” The analysis makes use of a database of more than 100 indicators for 69 countries.
      •	 In the macroeconomic assessment chapter (Chapter 2), forecasting Romania’s economic path to
         2050 and two alternative green paths is based on computable general equilibrium (CGE) model-
         ing. A CGE model was developed for Romania, in collaboration with local experts, designed to
         address the complex and overlapping elements of the EU’s climate and energy policy framework.
         It was applied to assess a Green and Super Green scenario against the baseline, which includes
         ongoing implementation of the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package. The Green scenario
         imposes compliance with the main features of the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Frame-
         work, while the Super Green assumes the Roadmap 2050 will be implemented.
      •	 Energy sector analysis (Chapter 3) estimates the best solutions for Romania’s energy supply
         mix given the country’s current, imminent, and prospective mitigation obligations. A system
         optimization model is used for energy supply modeling while the potential for reduction of
         energy demand in end-use services through energy efficiency measures was estimated using a


      1.  Background technical reports are available for each of the chapters.

   specially-developed demand analysis model. Marginal abatement cost analysis provided a cost
   comparison of the analyzed measures.
•	 In transport analysis (Chapter 4), a bottom-up, detailed engineering model was developed,
   utlizing Romania’s General Transport Master Plan, as well as non-quantitative evaluation of bar-
   riers to implementation and externalities of green measures. Marginal abatement cost analysis
   assessed cost effectiveness and abatement potential of the measures.
•	 Urban analysis (Chapter 5) examines cross-sectoral urban (mitigation) issues using a geospa-
   tial model that compares population and development patterns under different scenarios for
   the Bucharest region. The cross-sectoral approach allows combined analysis of spatial issues,
   transportation, and building efficiency, among other issues. The findings propose focus areas for
   municipal policy decision making and recommend priority areas for interventions across munici-
   pal sectors.
•	 Water sector analysis (Chapter 6) examines adaptation solutions to address rising unmet water
   demand as the climate changes. A series of models were applied to project climate change,
   water availability for various users, and productivity of crop agriculture. Financial evaluation of
   adaptation measures was also conducted. The analysis was aimed at answering three questions:
   (i) how will climate change affect the water demand-supply gap? (ii) what impact will reduced
   water availability have on the sectoral outcomes in water-using sectors, such as agriculture, indus-
   try, municipalities, and hydropower? and (iii) which interventions and at what cost will contain or
   reverse those impacts?
•	 In agriculture (Chapter 7), the analysis addressed both mitigation and adaptation, applying out-
   comes from water sector modeling and marginal abatement cost curve calculations. The main
   adaptation measures in agriculture were assessed. Two key mitigation actions were costed using
   marginal abatement methods, based on country-specific cost estimates, a result of a detailed
   expert assessment.
•	 Forestry analysis (Chapter 8) is a combination of a review of existing sector analysis and mar-
   ginal abatement cost estimates based on country-specific data and research conducted for this
   assessment. The analysis proposes priority measures for forestry that would support both miti-
   gation (by improving the ability of forests to sequester carbon) and adaptation (by reducing the
   negative impact of climate change on the quality of the forests).
•	 Marginal abatement cost curve analysis (Chapter 9) provides estimates of mitigation potential
   and their cost for all emission reduction interventions that are recommended by the sectoral
   analyses conducted for this assessment. Such measures are recommended by the analyses in the
   energy, transport, agriculture, and forestry sectors. The chapter provides a summary comparison
   of key mitigation measures, a useful tool for policy makers’ discussions and decision making.
•	 A brief conclusion section underlines the importance of green growth assessments for policy
   decision making and suggests ways in which this assessment can be useful for forming the miti-
   gation and adaptation agenda in Romania.

              sing a broad set of indicators of green growth, Romania is compared to international
              and regional benchmarks to provide an initial portrait of the country’s status, pros-
              pects, and challenges with respect to green growth. Green growth starts with a tradi-
              tional concern about sustainable use of natural resources, including minerals, water and
clean air, and biodiversity, and then adds consideration of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions,
attention to adaptation to a changing climate, and more focus on innovation and green jobs. For
any individual country, the nature of a greener growth path will depend on endowments and history,
which positions countries quite differently with respect to current ‘greenness’ and potential greening
of their growth paths. A framework to define a list of questions key to understanding how Romania
or any country compares in an international context is constructed with three aspects: “how green?,”
“going green,” and “riding a green wave,” and used to guide a benchmarking exercise in which
Romania is mapped against comparator countries and country groups using a dataset of more than
100 indicators for 69 countries. This benchmarking exercise aims to define, “What is greener growth
for Romania?”

Romania is well-endowed with various natural resources, which, if used productively, can support
strong and sustained economic growth. The country possesses fuel and mineral deposits, hydro-
power resources, wind power resources, and agricultural and forest land. However, significant reforms
in agriculture aimed at increased productivity are needed, and improved management of forests is
critical for sustained quality of this resource. The country has been developing new sustainable energy
sources such as wind energy, further bolstering its relatively high and increasing share of non-emitting
and renewable generation. This approach to energy will, over time, assist Romania in improving its cur-
rent high emissions and energy intensities and also contribute to (global) sustainability by mitigating
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Romania already faces obligations as a member of the EU to reduce
its GHG emissions, with current, imminent, and prospective targets for reduction that will progres-
sively tighten requirements for reducing carbon. Adaptation to protect tomorrow’s output from climate

damage is also important for Romania. Although its projected exposure is only average, its large agri-
culture sector renders it more sensitive to climate shocks, and its rather weak adaptive capacity (or
ability to address climate threats) means that, altogether, the country is vulnerable.1

A greener world will require economic transition, and successful transformation for a country will
depend on the flexibility of its economy—its ability to absorb shocks—and its readiness to take
advantage of new opportunities. A flexible economy has sufficient capital mobility to ease firms’
entry and exit, a nimble sectoral structure with a high share of manufacturing and services, well-
developed global links and openness to trade, a flexible labor market with human capital adequate
for a modern economy, and a supportive business environment. Against these metrics, Romania’s
strengths are its high (although variable) level of investment in fixed assets, a large share of manufac-
turing in industry, and good energy security. Critical areas to improve economic flexibility are trade
openness (strengthening competitiveness and exports) and better labor mobility. Policy reforms
would include improving the regulatory environment (especially product market regulation) and lib-
eralizing the labor market. The most pronounced green transition weakness of Romania is its lack of
readiness for new green opportunities, reflected in innovation and knowledge economy indicators.
Romania lags far behind the EU in research and development and a number of indices of innovation
and connectedness. Altogether Romania’s connections to global knowledge and readiness for an
innovation revolution are insufficient to benefit from green technological change.

This benchmarking exercise identified a selected set of issues within the broad green growth
agenda on which Romania should focus as it considers how to move onto a greener growth path.
As the Romanian government considers implementation of green growth and low carbon measures,
policymakers need to think when drawing down natural capital in the interest of economic growth
is a wise tradeoff and when it is not. Certainly, more investment in maintaining and upgrading some
natural assets seems warranted, in particular agricultural land and forests today and water going

tion of greenhouse gases and contain growing energy demand; and government needs to manage
actively the likely impacts of a changing climate on agriculture and water. To cope with a greening
world, greater flexibility of the economy, strengthened connections to global knowledge, and more
effective support of innovation should be fostered through policies and investments. Beyond the
one-time exercise summarized in this chapter, a country pursuing green growth might find occa-
sional benchmarking of value to identify emerging green issues. It would likely be most useful if
supplemented with a locally-designed results framework, to monitor progress on current greening
efforts and to support the implementation of its national strategies and plans related to climate
action, resource use, and sustainability. With a growth path already shaped by the requirements of
EU membership, this first glance at green growth for Romania seems to indicate much complemen-
tarity between the short term and the long term, with relatively little conflict between policies and
structural reforms that will lead to more vibrant as well as more sustainable growth.

Overview

Green growth benchmarking is a diagnostic at the country level, which helps define a country’s
strengths and vulnerabilities in adopting a path to greener growth. Green growth can be consid-
ered simply as growth in economic output that preserves the ability of natural assets to provide the
resources and services on which human welfare depends.2 While most countries agree that such
growth is a worthy goal, determining what a green growth path might mean for a particular country
is a significant challenge. A starting point in the process of defining a country’s green growth path
should be analysis aimed at mapping the country’s current position on a multi-dimensional chart of
green growth, with each dimension defined by a green growth indicator. The purpose of such analy-
sis is to understand what the country needs to do to pursue green growth and what policy decisions,
investments and institution building need to be undertaken to support green growth. Green growth
benchmarking is a methodology proposed for such analysis.

Green growth starts with a traditional concern about sustainable use of natural resources. The
efficient exhaustion of nonrenewable resources such as energy and mineral deposits and the sus-
tainable use of renewable resources such as forests and fisheries, water, and clean air have been
considered part of a sustainable growth agenda for decades. Natural resources are necessary to
economic activity, providing raw materials and environmental services essential for production to
continue. Some components of natural resources have become of greater concern in recent years,
among them freshwater resources affected by overexploitation, pollution, and climate change; and
biodiversity under threat from habitat alteration and pollution.

Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is a critical additional component of environmental sus-
tainability, with rising prominence and particularly difficult challenges for countries. The growing
imbalance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a clear example of the breeching of planetary
boundaries and of a global public good. As such, individual countries can reap only local co-benefits
such as reduced suspended particulates in the air if fossil fuel burning is reduced. Since the bulk

of the benefits do not accrue to an individual country, a decision to move to low ‘carbon’ (referring
to emissions of greenhouse gases) generally must be motivated by other considerations, including
access to carbon finance and other external funding, in response to regional standards and require-
ments such as those of the European Union, or driven by a decision to lead on global issues and
prepare for an eventual global agreement.

Adaptation to a changing climate must also be part of a country’s sustainable growth path. Regard-
less of future greenhouse gas emissions, climate is already changing, with more extreme weather
events, rising sea levels, and overall warming. Some countries, sectors, and populations will be
strongly affected, although with major impacts in most places not materializing for some decades.
For many countries, it makes sense to consider how adaptation needs can be incorporated into
decisions about long-lived infrastructure such as new hydropower plants. More generally, countries
that will face significant impacts need to factor such shifts—in frequency of droughts, in crop yields,
in coastal and riverbank flooding—into thinking about sustainable and greener development paths.

The newest element of the green growth agenda is the strong emphasis on innovation and green
jobs. This dimension of green growth proposes that a shift towards greener growth will spur tech-
nological innovation, especially in the energy sector, and promote the emergence of new industries.
Innovation can help decouple growth from natural resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions
by shifting out global production possibilities and allowing more production with fewer and more
environmentally-friendly inputs. Environmental considerations do not necessarily constrain growth;
but to the contrary, a dynamic technical change towards low carbon and low pollution technologies
could drive growth and generate jobs at all skill levels (see Figure 1.1).3

3.  Such assessment is consistent with mainstream economic arguments that there is close substitutability between clean
and dirty technologies. In that case, policies can push the economy towards a clean solution, causing the sector with clean
technology to become large enough to be self-sustaining. In such a situation, the shift to greener technologies will sup-
port growth rather than limiting it. See Aghion, et al. 2011. “The Environment and Directed Technical Change.” Growth
and Sustainability Policies for Europe (GRASP) Project of the European Commission. Working Paper 21. Brussels: EC.

Challenges: Where Should Countries Start?

A greener growth path must address these four aspects and balance greening with growth of out-
put and incomes, but the details of a country’s path will depend on country-specific conditions and
policy choices. Each country starts with a set of endowments, natural and man-made. While some
aspects of any country’s current condition are driven by recent policy choices, much derives from
exogenous characteristics such as geography or endowments of fossil fuels, hydropower potential,
or forests; and the myriad of distant policy decisions that drove national development to where it is
today. These characteristics position countries quite differently with respect to their current ‘green-
ness’ and the potential greening of their growth paths. In considering the complex task of assessing
green growth at the country level, the starting point is fundamental to the costs and tradeoffs the
country faces in choosing a greener path forward.

One holistic approach to sustainability is national wealth accounting and the measurement of
natural capital, which aims to capture a good part of the green challenges to orthodox growth
measurement. Part of the determination of an optimal green growth path for a country involves
proper valuation of environmental costs and benefits, an approach which has been part of the sus-
tainability agenda for many years. Recent international agreement to support wealth accounting or
green national accounts is moving this effort into the mainstream. A correct costing of depreciation
of natural resources such as mineral deposits and of externalities such as air and water pollution
will take countries who adopt such an approach a good distance toward maximizing a greener type
of GDP.4 However, some elements of greenness are not easily costed, among them greenhouse
gas emissions, biodiversity, and the non-income benefits (or happiness) that comes from living in
a country with a healthy and well-protected natural environment. A simpler starting point in such
assessment is benchmarking against comparator countries—using indicators that measure various
dimensions of green growth. This quick mapping can help identify challenging areas, as well as easy
wins. It can create a balanced portrait of a country’s green issues, and, as set out below, it can serve
as primarily analytic rather than monitoring objectives.

Methodology

A simple scheme helps to define a list of questions key to understanding how Romania or any
country compares in an international context (see Figure 1.2). Firstly, how green is Romania? A
country’s natural resources support production and economic growth, but like other forms of capital,
they require investment, maintenance and good management in order to be productive and con-
tribute to rising output and welfare. How important are natural resources to current growth, and how
productively has the country made use of them? Is pollution a major problem? Has Romania made
any progress in decoupling economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions? Is the country pre-
paring for the impacts of a changing climate? Secondly, what will be Romania’s greatest challenges
in going green? Transition to a green growth path is equivalent to an economic shock, and econo-
mies differ in their ability to weather such shocks. Is Romania’s economy flexible enough to succeed
in the transition towards green growth? Is Romania’s economy well-diversified and ready to reap
emerging opportunities? Is energy subsidized? Are Romania’s imports emissions-intensive? Thirdly,

can Romania ‘ride the green wave’ and reap substantial payoffs from ‘going green’? More rapid
green growth is inconceivable without innovation, which can help to decouple growth from natural
capital depletion and environmental pollution, towards cleaner, more resource-efficient and resilient
growth. How can Romania be ready for this surge of innovation, particularly in the energy sector, and
be competitive in new and growing green industries? These three aspects of measuring ‘green-ness’
capture a country’s status, prospects, and challenges with respect to the four elements in Figure 1.1.

Benchmarking can provide a practical starting point for a country green growth assessment, with
an emphasis on analysis rather than monitoring. Attempting to measure green growth is not a new
effort: this methodology builds on existing analysis and applications but with a new focus on how
economies can cope with a greening world as the climate changes. The benchmarking method
presented here differs from other green growth indicators in that it has a primarily analytic rather
than monitoring objective and focuses on the economic factors of green growth and the economy’s
capacity to absorb the shock of a greening world and climate change using its natural resource
endowment, flexibility of the economy and openness to technological transition. Using a specially-
constructed database, Romania was benchmarked on more than 100 indicators across 69 countries.5,6

Findings

How green?

Romania is well-endowed with various natural resources which, if used productively, can support
strong and sustained economic growth. Figure 1.3 shows Romania’s main strengths to be its signifi-
cant endowment of agricultural land, low level of water withdrawals, middling level of air pollution
(PM10),7 and moderate level of forest loss. Its main weaknesses as revealed by benchmarking are low
productivity of agriculture as reflected in cereal yields, low water resources per capita, and impaired
seafood resources (as indicated by fish stock damage). Partly countering these limitations is Roma-
nia’s implementation of policies to protect its resources and its relatively high productivity of their
usage. The country has substantial fuel and mineral deposits (including oil, gas, lignite, iron ore,
copper, bauxite, manganese, lead, and zinc), which now include shale gas as well as hydropower
and wind power resources. These local energy sources contribute to energy security and protect
Romania’s economy from global energy price shocks. The country also benefits from good quality
agricultural land and substantial forest resources.

Agricultural land in Romania is a valuable resource, but agricultural productivity and incomes com-
pare poorly with the EU. Agricultural land occupies near 60 percent of the country’s area, and almost
two-thirds of it is arable. However, Romania’s agriculture sector today is highly inefficient: a sector with
almost 30 percent of employment accounts for five percent of GDP, resulting in the lowest farm labor
productivity and the lowest agricultural incomes in the EU.8 Low productivity of agriculture in Romania
is reflected in its cereal yields, which are significantly below those in other EU countries. While Romania
produces 2.8 tons of cereal per hectare, the EU’s average production is 5.0 tons per hectare, and top EU
producers are at 7.2 tons per hectare (Germany) and 6.1 tons per hectare (Denmark). The direct reason
for inefficiency is land fragmentation and the prevalence of subsistence farming. Reviving agriculture
will require significant investment and policy measures to support rehabilitated irrigation and modern
farming practices. Expanded irrigation will in turn create additional pressures on Romania’s limited water
resources. Romania’s water withdrawals are relatively low, at three percent of available water used each
year. However, Romania’s water resources are far from being abundant: their level of 1,969 m3 per capita
is only slightly above the international benchmark for water stress of 1,700 m3 per capita.9

Romania has significant forest land resources, and forest loss is low. Romania’s forest covers more
than one-quarter of its land area, creating a substantial natural asset (although that share stands
below the EU average of 38 percent). Forest loss in Romania averaged a low four percent of forest
stock over the period 2000–2010, significantly below the EU average of ten percent and below the
comparator sample average of 5.4 percent. The annual allowable cut is 22 million hectares, but


7. Romania’s air pollution is better than ECA or UMC averages but worse than the EU average. PM10 is the concentration
in urban air of suspended particulates less than 10 microns in diameter that are capable of penetrating deep into the
respiratory tract and causing significant health damage.
8. In addition, Romania’s performance is below the EU average in pesticide regulation, an indicator of damage to the
rural environment.

sions intensity of Romania’s economy and its energy intensity remain high compared to EU averages
despite drastic improvements since the early 1990s.11 In 2010, the emissions intensity of the Romanian
economy was still 2.8 times the EU average and 2.1 times the OECD average. The emissions intensity
of energy in Romania is driven by the structure of power generation: while the country has a relatively
large share of low-carbon generation, ranking fourteenth in the EU in its share of zero-carbon generation
(including hydro, wind, solar and nuclear) and thirteenth according to the share of renewable genera-
tion, fossil sources still dominate its electricity production. Currently, the energy sector in the country is
responsible for near 60 percent of emissions and is, therefore, a critical sector for mitigation.12 With the
EU’s current, imminent, and prospective targets for emissions reduction that will progressively tighten
requirements for reducing carbon, Romania needs to make substantial investments, especially in the
energy sector to advance mitigation of greenhouse gases. (See Figure 1.4.)13

  Box 1.1.  Measuring       vulnerability to climate change
  An aggregate index of vulnerability combining indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity

  The World Bank adaptation index is designed to support adaptation decision-making. The index is designed to focus
  on reducing vulnerability to the changing climate. Vulnerability is measured using three sub-indices: exposure, sensi-
  tivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure and sensitivity reflect potential impact of climate change (physical, economic,
  and societal), while the ability to react effectively depends on adaptive capacity.

  Exposure to climate change is the extent of climate variability projected for 2070–2100 relative to the variability
  observed in the recent past (1961–1990). Climate variability is measured based on the number of hot, dry and wet
  years, summers, and winters.

  Sensitivity to climate change is measured based on indicators likely to increase the impact of climate shocks. These
  include the level of water stress (renewable water resources per capita), the extent of air pollution (PM10); the impor-
  tance of agriculture in the economy (share of employment and value added); the exposure of the power sector to
  climatic risks (share of electricity generated by hydroelectric plants); the exposure of network infrastructure to climate
  change including extreme events (logistics index or index of overall quality of transport infrastructure); and the share
  of population under 5 (a measure of demographic/social flexibility of the society).

  Adaptive capacity is a function of organizational skills, access to and ability to use information, and access to financ-
  ing. It is measured by the Gini coefficient (income inequality), GDP per capita, and institutional adaptive capacity
  reflected in governance indicators.

  exposure index is from Baettig, et al. 2007. “A Climate Change Index: Where Climate Change May Be Most Prominent in the 21st
  Century.” Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, Issue 1. Washington, DC: American Geophysical Union.




Adaptation to protect tomorrow’s output from climate damage is also important for Romania, a coun-
try more vulnerable to climate change than other EU countries. According to the adaptation index
(see Box 1.1), although its exposure (or projected climate variability for future decades) is average,14
the country has higher sensitivity to climate shocks because of current characteristics such as limited
water availability, the importance of agriculture, and the susceptibility of infrastructure and the power
sector. Romania’s weakest point on adaptation, though, is its adaptive capacity or ability to address cli-
mate threats, which requires organizational skills, access to and ability to use information, and access to
financing. In particular, Romania’s climate change sensitivity is reflected in the large share of agriculture
in its economy. Romania has one of the highest shares of rural population and of agricultural employ-
ment within the EU: 45 percent of the total population is rural (compared to 26 percent EU-wide), and
agricultural employment constitutes near 30 percent of total employment (compared to five percent
across the EU). This dependence on a weather-sensitive economic sector raises the likely economic
impact of a worsening climate. Romania’s sensitivity to climate compared to the EU is also indicated by
air pollution (with the 6th worst PM10 levels in the EU) which worsens the health impact of heat waves as
well as relatively low water resources per capita (with a level 2.3 times below the EU average). Romania’s
water resources are already limited, leaving the country sensitive to the reduced water availability com-
ing with higher temperatures and increased evaporation in future decades. In addition, Romania’s index
of the overall quality of transport infrastructure is significantly below that of the EU, and infrastructure in
poor condition is more likely to break down as a result of extreme weather.15 (See Figure 1.5.)

15. Overall quality of infrastructure measures the susceptibility of network infrastructure to climate change including
extreme events. It includes quality of ports, roads, railroads, and information networks.

Romania’s adaptive capacity—the ability to react effectively to climate change—is weaker than in
other EU countries. Financing adaptation requires resources, and a country’s overall wealth (GDP
per capita) and its distribution (measured by the Gini coefficient) provides an indication of whether
resources are available overall and accessible by households and firms across the country. With the
second lowest GDP per capita in the EU and the highest inequality, Romania is not strong on either
count compared to its European neighbors. In addition, Romania’s institutional capacity is below
that of the comparator countries: voice and accountability is estimated to be the lowest in the EU,
political stability and absence of violence third from the bottom, and the measure of aggregate gov-
ernance quality is second from the bottom. (See Figure 1.5.)

going green: Structure of the economy and Labor Market

Romania’s strengths in ‘going green’ include reasonably high although variable capital mobility.
Romania has a high level of investment in fixed assets (gross capital formation), a high share of man-
ufacturing in industry, and a moderate share of energy imports in energy use. On all three indicators,
Romania significantly outperforms the EU average, although the significant fluctuations year to year
in investment and manufacturing moderate the positive assessment of Romania. The current level
of gross capital formation (reflecting capital mobility) is 23 percent of GDP, while the EU averages
about 19 percent. During 1999–2013, gross capital formation fluctuated between 16 percent of GDP
in 1999 and 31 percent in 2008, driven upwards by the construction boom of 2000–2008. Currently,
investment is more diversified, flowing into construction, machinery, and transport equipment. A

less successful area is investment in infrastructure, which remains inefficient and has led to Romania’s
bottom rating within the EU on infrastructure quality.16 (See Figure 1.6.)

Another strength is Romania’s relatively high share of manufacturing in industry, indicating more
flexibility. Manufacturing and services have greater flexibility than agriculture, because of their expo-
sure to international competition and, thus, a higher potential for technological progress. Likewise,
within industry, manufacturing firms have a stronger capacity to adjust to shocks by switching to new
technologies than non-manufacturing (or primary) industrial firms such as mining and quarrying,
construction, and energy. Such flexibility derives from manufacturing’s greater sensitivity to global
price competition due to easier product substitution. With a share of manufacturing in industry six
percent above that of the EU average and exceeding that of ECA by one-third, Romania has a clear
advantage in ‘going green.’

A third area of strength in ‘going green’ is Romania’s good energy security. The country has a mod-
erate share of energy imports in energy use, supported by its indigenous energy resources. In par-
ticular, Romania is endowed with renewable resources, including wind, hydro, and biomass, as well
as with fossil fuels—lignite, oil, and gas. In addition, one-fifth of its electricity generation comes from
nuclear generation, further enhancing energy security. The level of energy imports is an important

16.  An important aspect of this issue is the instability of priorities over time for public investment, which represents almost
20 percent of total investment (or five percent of GDP). Ensuring efficient investments in public infrastructure is a key chal-
lenge for the Romanian economy. See European Commission. 2015. “European Economy: Macroeconomic Imbalances.

indicator of economic flexibility because of the instability of world energy prices. An economy that is
highly dependent on energy imports is continuously exposed to energy price shocks, which can be
quite costly for both public and private sectors and disruptive overall for the economy.17

By contrast, Romania’s weaknesses in ‘going green’ include limited openness of the economy. Open-
ness of the economy to trade (as measured by the ratio of trade to GDP) promotes global competi-
tion and increases the likelihood of new technology transfer and absorption. Imports, and especially
imports of investment goods, support modernization of capital assets and thereby increase the effi-
ciency of production. However, according to ‘going green’ data, the share of trade in GDP for Romania
is one-third lower than the EU average and one-fifth below the ECA average. However, strong export
growth in recent years points to gradual improvement. Formerly unsustainable current-account deficits
have been corrected and are expected to remain contained. The issues that still need to be resolved to
support export growth are limited public administration capacity and an unstable tax policy.18

Another key weakness in ‘going green’ is insufficient labor mobility and other flaws in labor mar-
kets. While Romania’s unemployment rate is reasonably low at five to seven percent, the official rate
disguises a large informal sector (especially in rural areas), hidden unemployment and underem-
ployment (in urban areas), generally low labor market participation, and labor market rigidity driven
by guaranteed jobs in the public sector. Labor market participation in Romania is 59 percent, near
the low end of the range in the EU. Rural population constitutes 45 percent of the total, but rural
employment accounts only for 29 percent of total employment. Yet the official rural unemployment
rate does not differ from the national rate, indicating very high informal rural employment and a very
low participation rate in formal labor markets, which is consistent with the predominance of subsis-
tence farming. The relatively low level of urbanization in Romania and the large share of employment
in agriculture also indicate low labor mobility. However, labor mobility is likely to increase in future
decades as agriculture is transformed by the aggregation of very small farms into larger commercial
enterprises, driven by aging of the rural population and out-migration.19

Romania’s business environment regulation remains too restrictive to support ‘going green.’
Romania ranks 25th of 27 EU countries in the restrictiveness of its regulatory environment, measured
as the degree to which domestic policies restrict or promote competition in a recent OECD survey.
Romania outperforms only Greece and Slovenia. The latest scores for Romania shows the country
fares poorly in comparison with the EU in: state control (the extent to which the state owns, controls,
or is involved in business), public ownership (state involvement in or control of business and prefer-
ential treatment of state enterprises), and administrative burdens on start-ups. Within those areas,
Romania has weak governance of state-owned enterprises, high barriers to entrepreneurship, and
high regulatory barriers in transport. On the other hand, Romania performs well in other regulatory
areas: it has low barriers to trade and investment and low regulatory barriers in the energy and com-
munications sectors.20

HOW GREEN IS ROMANIA? A BENCHMARKING EXERCISE                                                                         17
The low urbanization rate in Romania is another indicator of insufficient labor flexibility, reflecting
inadequate growth of formal jobs in urban areas. The urban labor market also suffers from certain
inefficiencies, a result of a large and rigid state-owned enterprise sector with guaranteed employ-
ment; a high level of emigration of the working age population over the past 20 years out of Roma-
nia, especially those with skills; an unsupportive business environment with one of the highest costs
of opening, operating and closing a company in Europe; and a very limited supply of labor with
adequate and modern skills. While the overall unemployment rate is low, the level of joblessness
is much higher for the youngest working age group, those 15 to 24 years of age, and especially for
young women. In 2009, about 20 percent of young women and 15 percent of young men were not
in employment, education, or training; and these numbers increased in recent years. Higher unem-
ployment and lower labor market participation is also a factor for women aged 25–49 and both men
and women aged 55–64. A further challenge is inadequate skills of the workforce. Finding employ-
ees with appropriate skills is one of the three biggest concerns about doing business in Romania.
The quality of education is low, and students often graduate without the skills required in a modern
economy. The need to improve skills and education, especially those of children, to the levels typical
for EU countries, is recognized by the Government: the National Education Law of 2011 strongly
supports progress in educational outcomes.21

Inefficiency of the labor market is a remaining weakness of the Romanian economy in the context
of ‘going green.’ Labor productivity started to improve only recently, including cost competitiveness.
Non-cost competitiveness is still capped by low investment and innovation, as well as by the busi-
ness environment. Labor demand and job creation remain subdued. The job vacancy rate remains

low, and the ratio of unemployed to hirings is the fifth highest in the EU. The lack of job opportunities
forces people into inactivity or informality and contributes to migration of both qualified and unqual-
ified labor.22 Instead, Romania needs to aim at enhanced labor market flexibility and higher levels of
human capital so that during the green growth transition, labor resources can easily move to new,
more technologically-advanced jobs. Urban concentration facilitates the needed labor mobility, and,
more importantly for Romania’s situation, a large rural population with non-transferable skills remains
a barrier to a green transition.

Riding the Green Wave: Innovation and the Knowledge Economy

Romania does not appear ready to take advantage of new green opportunities: various indicators
of innovation and the knowledge economy reveal a need for improvement. Compared to the EU,
Romania significantly underperforms on indicators such as broadband subscribers (as a share of the
population), percentage of researchers in the population, research and development (R&D) expen-
ditures (as a share of GDP), and high-tech goods in manufacturing exports. Romania’s performance
looks better when compared with all of ECA average, standing above average according to the
same indicators (Figure 1.7). Against all the comparator countries, Romania is placed in the middle

this particular area of benchmarking using the entire comparator list. Since Romania is part of the
EU and convergence with the EU is expected on a wide range of performance indicators, including
those reflecting innovation, it is reasonable to compare Romania in this area with the EU alone.

Romania is ranked last in the EU by the European Commission’s Innovation Union Scoreboard
(IUS). Research has been consistently underfunded for twenty years or more, which, together with
the ‘brain drain’ caused by high rates of emigration of highly-skilled workers, has generated a crisis
in Romania’s research community. R&D expenditures currently constitute only 0.6 percent of GDP,
compared with 1.5 percent in the EU on average and with top spending levels at 3.7 percent in Swe-
den, 3.0 percent in Switzerland and 2.9 percent in Denmark. As a result, Romania’s gap with most EU
countries in innovation has been increasing; and in 2014, Romania was the worst performer on the
IUS innovation index in the EU. Most individual IUS innovation indicators (that together constitute
the innovation index) place Romania either last or second to last in the EU. This result holds across
indicators of research and innovation policy, both public and private R&D spending, and patent
applications.23,24

Even against a wider set of countries, Romania’s innovation performance stands in need of improve-
ment. According to the Global Innovation Index, Romania ranks 55th within 143 countries evaluated
on their innovation capabilities and results. Romania scores particularly poorly on innovation outputs
such as information and communications technology and on capabilities deemed critical to innova-
tion such as intensity of local competition; net inflows of foreign direct investment; ease of paying
taxes; market capitalization; government effectiveness; and ease of resolving insolvency. Romania
scored well on other aspects that enable innovation: ease of getting credit; cultural and creative
goods and services exports; and high and medium high-tech manufactures. Based on Romania’s
income level, a higher overall ranking would be expected, confirming that innovation and readiness
for the knowledge economy are areas of particular weakness.25


CoNCLuSioNS AND reCoMMeNDATioNS

This benchmarking exercise identified a selected set of issues within the broad green growth
agenda on which Romania should focus as it considers how to move onto a greener growth path.
Mapping Romania against comparator countries and country groups allows policymakers to con-
sider the country’s relative standing on the three aspects of measuring ‘green-ness’: (i) How green?,
(ii) Going green, and (iii) Riding a green wave. Benchmarking is, of course, only a starting point,
making use of existing data to highlight in a quick fashion the key aspects for a particular country
that merit more serious analysis and consideration. The subsequent chapters in this report take up
the issues identified here as critical to a greener growth path, in particular those linked to mitigation
and adaptation challenges which have not been elsewhere assessed. The issues identified for Roma-
nia’s ‘going green’ and ‘riding a green wave’ are, in general, closely linked to structural reforms and
investments that support growth overall and have been the focus of much other analysis.

Romania has significant natural resources, and the country needs to improve the efficiency of
usage of its land resources, in particular in agriculture and forestry. As the Romanian government
considers implementation of green growth and low carbon measures, policymakers need to think
when drawing down natural capital in the interest of economic growth is a wise tradeoff and when it
is not. Romania is developing new sustainable energy sources such as wind energy, further bolstering
its relatively high and increasing share of non-emitting and renewable generation. Substantial invest-
ments will be needed in the energy supply and in energy efficiency. This approach to energy will,
over time, assist Romania in improving its current high emissions and energy intensities and also con-
tribute to (global) sustainability by mitigating GHG emissions. For water resources, Romania needs
to prepare for a hotter, dryer future with higher water demand. A key part of improved management
of water resources will be more sustainable and productive use of Romania’s land resources. Agricul-
ture has very low productivity, a high share of subsistence farms, and low living standards compared
to urban areas. Increasing sector efficiency will require significant investment and policy reforms
aimed at rehabilitation of irrigation and modernization of farming practices. These challenges will be
heightened by climate change in coming decades. Lastly, in forestry, Romania’s vast and high quality

forests are being negatively affected by inefficient forest management. Improvement in this area will
require only modest expenditures but coherent institutional reforms in forestry. Together, these mea-
sures can allow forests to provide valuable mitigation and adaptation services to rural areas. Across
all of Romania’s natural resources, substantial investments are needed, with the heaviest financing
needs in the energy sector to advance mitigation of greenhouse gases.26

A greener world heralds an economic transition, and successful transformation will depend on
the flexibility of a country’s economy and readiness for green opportunities. For Romania, the
critical issues to achieve the level of economic flexibility needed for a green transition are trade
openness via strengthened competitiveness and higher export growth along with improved labor
mobility. Romania needs to address the issue of a restrictive regulatory environment by countering
current high barriers for start-ups, excessive state control over businesses, and a large public sector
with preferential treatment of state-owned enterprises. Although overall levels of capital formation
have been strong, a weak area within investment in fixed assets is investment in infrastructure where
improvement is still needed. The country would also benefit from addressing inefficiencies in its
labor market, which are reflected in a high share of the informal sector (specifically in rural areas),
hidden unemployment and underemployment (in urban areas), generally low labor market participa-
tion, labor market rigidity with guaranteed jobs in the public sector, and the inadequate level of skills
and education of workers for a modern and green economy. A last challenge, and perhaps the most
difficult, is in increasing connections to global knowledge and support of innovation, to bridge the
gap with other European countries in access to modern communications and in support of scientific
research. Research has been continuously underfunded and has suffered further from the long-term
trend of emigration of highly-skilled workers. On the global level, Romania ranks well below what
would be expected for development of its knowledge economy based on its income level.

As Romania moves towards implementation of green and low carbon actions, it should remain
aware of the usefulness of ongoing reassessment of its green path while coordinating greening
into its overall growth path. Beyond the one-time exercise summarized in this chapter, a country
pursuing green growth might find occasional benchmarking of value to identify emerging green
issues. It would likely be most useful if supplemented with a locally-designed results framework,
populated with a combination of internationally-comparable and locally-developed indicators, to
monitor progress on current greening efforts and to support the implementation of its national strat-
egies and plans related to climate action, resource use, and sustainability. The newer dimensions of
the green growth challenge—mitigation, adaptation, and innovation and green jobs—will require
the most attention. Mitigation and adaptation are taken up in the subsequent chapters of this report.
The issues identified for Romania’s ‘going green’ and ‘riding a green wave’—key to the innovation
and green jobs aspect of green growth—are mostly linked to structural reforms and investments that
support growth overall and have been the focus of much other analysis. Moreover, most of the short-
comings identified here are well-known and being addressed as part of the country’s overall growth
agenda. The country continues to implement policy and structural reforms that will lead to more
vibrant as well as more sustainable growth, especially as its membership in the EU both limits its pol-
icy choices and aligns them with greener paths. With a growth path already shaped by the require-
ments of EU membership, this first glance at green growth for Romania seems to indicate much
complementarity between the short term and the long term, with relatively little conflict between
policies and structural reforms that will lead to more vibrant as well as more sustainable growth.

CHAPTER SUMMARY



          he focus for Romania’s low carbon green growth path is to implement mitigation actions
          and undertake needed adaptation while preserving growth and employment. Thinking
          through this path at the macroeconomic level can be simplified into three main scenarios
          for analyzing the impact of green interventions. The necessary horizon to assess the costs
and impact of a new growth path is long, and 2050 is chosen as the endpoint for assessment. The
backbone of the analysis is macroeconomic modeling, which provides both a consistent foundation
for sector analysis and an overarching analysis of impacts economy-wide.

Romania’s recent history of economic performance provides important clues about future direc-
tions but climate action will become more prominent, requiring both mitigation and adaptation
measures. The country grew faster than the rest of Europe during 2000 to 2008 and recovered quickly
from the international financial crisis. Meanwhile, Romania witnessed its greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions decline by almost one-third. Since Romania’s economy does not yet match the typical pat-
tern in the rest of the European Union (EU), the path to 2050 is likely to feature convergence towards
Europe in income levels and economic structure. The path is also likely to include intensified climate
action. Although the country’s GHG emission levels are not large on a global scale, Romania faces
current, imminent, and prospective limits on emissions of GHGs. Reducing these emissions will both
require government action and affect Romania’s growth path. At the same time, newly-developed
climate scenarios show rising temperatures and falling precipitation in future decades, increasing the
likelihood of water shortages which will harm agriculture and other water users.

The baseline scenario for Romania’s economy through 2050, generated by a newly-built macro-
economic model, indeed finds real incomes in Romania likely to converge towards European Union
averages albeit at a modest pace. Growth, although above the EU average, is dampened by the
ongoing decline in Romania’s population and labor force. The story the sector level is of divergence,
rather than convergence. Part of those developments are driven by compliance with the current
‘2020 climate and energy package’ and participation in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS),


WHERE IS ROMANIA HEADING? FORECASTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT                                          25
which generate pressure to reduce energy intensity going forward. This baseline scenario constitutes
a critical first phase of the analysis, serving as a benchmark for comparisons of economic outcomes
before and after policy actions or investments.

A computable general equilibrium model was developed for Romania, in collaboration with local
experts, designed to address the complex and overlapping elements of the EU’s climate and
energy policy framework. Drawing on the well-known GEM-E3 model, the ROM-E3 model is capa-
ble of quantifying the first and second round effects of energy and climate change policies and
regulations related to multiple economic sectors as well as the feedback and spillover effects within
Romania and across countries through the trade channel. The model has been applied to assess a
Green and Super Green scenario against the baseline, which includes ongoing implementation of
the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package. The Green scenario imposes compliance with the main
features of the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework, while the Super Green assumes the
Roadmap 2050 will be implemented. (Table 2.3).

Implementing the imminent EU 2030 climate framework imposes only modest costs on Romania’s
economy, but fulfilling the prospective EU Roadmap 2050 will impose a heavy burden. EU emis-
sions trading allocates mitigation efficiently across EU member states via a uniform carbon price (the
emissions allowance price that clears the ETS market) for power generation and energy-intensive
industry while a package of national policies will aim to achieve the mitigation targets set for each EU
member state for other sectors. Likely 2030 obligations will require cutting GHGs by 36 percent by
2030 compared with 2005 at an estimated cost of 1.1 percent of GDP overall, but with high variability
across sectors. By contrast, meeting the EU’s proposed 80 percent mitigation goal in 2050 would
leave Romania’s output an estimated four percent lower.

Policymakers should find this analysis of interest. The analysis recommends that the government
be prepared to monitor the cross-sectoral impacts of the green transition, as labor and capital move
across sectors. Policymakers should consider, within the boundaries set by EU rules, applying the
rising revenues from the auctions of emissions allowances to support renewable energy deployment,
energy efficiency projects and to reduce labor taxes, thereby reaping a small ‘double dividend’. Fur-
ther, Romania can gain through the inclusion of stronger equity considerations into EU-wide climate
policy discussions. Lastly, the macroeconomic model constructed for this analysis remains available
for further development and application by the government for current and future policy questions
related to low carbon and green growth.



CHALLENGES FOR GREENER GROWTH

Overview

Although green growth can be a broad concept, the main concern for Romania is moving onto a
low carbon growth path while addressing key adaptation deficits. The benchmarking exercise in
Chapter 1 found that mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to a changing climate
are key elements in a greener growth path for Romania. The country’s high emissions and energy
intensity of output need to be reversed to make strong progress on mitigation. Moreover, the coun-
try already has obligations on mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions as a member of the Euro-
pean Union (EU), and proposed and tentative future obligations further render mitigation action an

inevitable part of Romania’s future. At the same time, moderate vulnerability to climate damages is
worsened by current weaknesses in Romania’s productive use of its land resources. Romania needs
to understand possible climate damages and what adaptation actions are advisable as part of a
greener future. The impacts on Romania’s economy for the years to come, some negative and some
positive, merit investigation. This chapter summarizes analysis from the application of a macroeco-
nomic model to provide important insights about the achievement of the EU’s proposal for climate
action for 2030 and also for 2050 and the selection of key adaptation measures, as well as a frame-
work for the sector analysis presented in subsequent chapters. The energy, transport, forestry, and
urban analysis in subsequent chapters provides sector-level conclusions on mitigation options while
the chapters on water, agriculture, and forestry provide conclusions on adaptation options.

To assess the costs and impact of a lower carbon and green growth path for Romania, economic
developments over a long horizon (to 2050) need to be considered despite the uncertainty inher-
ent in such scenarios. For climate mitigation actions, such as building power plants with cleaner fuels
or improving energy efficiency through new building standards, the benefits of action will materialize
over decades. For climate adaptation actions, the horizon must be at least as long. Climate damages
for most countries become more significant 30 and 40 years into the future although the appropriate
adaptive response may require action today. The horizon for the scenarios and analysis for Romania
extends to 2050—40 years is just about long enough to consider long-lived infrastructure needed
for either mitigation or adaptation. Thinking so far into the future is inevitably associated with large
uncertainty; but sensitivity analysis around key assumptions, transparency in methodology, and close
collaboration with the client and local experts can all act as counterweights.

Macroeconomic modeling constitutes the backbone of the analysis, providing a consistent picture
of economic impact, taking into account domestic sectoral inter-linkages and international trade

flows. General equilibrium models set up a coherent economy-wide framework and allow economic
decision making to be the outcome of decentralized optimization by producers and consumers.
They simulate the functioning of a market economy, including markets for commodities, for labor,
and for capital. They provide a detailed look at how changes in economic conditions are mediated
through prices and markets while assuring that all economy-wide constraints are respected. They
also enable quantitative examination of how shocks or policies move through the economy and influ-
ence its performance and structure. Dynamic processes can be captured, which is important if the
time horizon of the modeling is long (as is required for low carbon and green growth analysis). The
modeling emphasizes the key economic relationships within Romania and with the EU and the rest
of the world. As such, the CGE (computable general equilibrium) model constitutes a backbone for
the harmonization of the sectoral work in a consistent and rigorous manner, providing key economic
variables needed for sector analysis while assessing multi-sectoral impacts of low carbon and green
actions on growth, sectoral output, employment, and fiscal revenues and expenditures.

A baseline scenario serves as a benchmark for comparisons of economic outcomes before and
after policy actions or investments—a hypothetical path that envisages what would happen under
‘business-as-usual’ or no policy change. Business-as-usual projections are often based on extrapo-
lation of historical trends or adoption of steady-state GDP growth. The simplest of baselines would
be a steady-state baseline, in which all physical quantities grow at an exogenous uniform rate while
relative prices remain unchanged; this scenario would have the virtue of providing a transparent ref-
erence path for the evaluation of policy options. However, such a path is unrealistic, especially over
a long time period, limiting the usefulness of the scenario results to policymakers, who need more
realistic comparisons. For example, when a country decides on a target for mitigating greenhouse
gases, the target is generally defined against a base year, as a certain percent reduction compared
to that year. But such a definition provides little indication of the degree of challenge involved in
meeting the target. What matters is the size of the reduction compared to the level of emissions in
the target year, which lies in the future. This expected level is a matter for projections, determined by
assumptions about the growth rate of emissions in the absence of additional policy—the business-
as-usual emissions baseline. Faster expected growth translates to faster rising emissions, and the
higher is the future emission level in the absence of climate policy, the more stringent are the effec-
tive reduction targets and, thus, the costs of abatement. (See Table 2.3 comparing the baseline sce-
nario to the alternative low-carbon green scenarios used in this analysis).

Romania’s Economy Today and Looking Ahead to 2050

Romania grew faster than the rest of Europe between 2000 and 2008, and from 2010 its economy
bounced back following the international financial crisis. Per capita GDP (measured in purchasing
power parity) rose from 26 to 47 percent of the EU average in the years preceding EU accession in
2007. Markets opened and institutions were reformed. Legal and institutional reforms were advanced
through the process of adopting the acquis communautaire. Generous foreign direct investment
and other financial inflows contributed to consumer demand, built up key industries, modernized
wholesale trade, and spurred the movement of labor from low-productivity activities like agriculture
towards high-productivity activities like manufacturing. Public and private investment in education
pushed tertiary education enrollment from 12 to 23 percent. The income of the bottom 40 percent of
the population grew by 5.5 percent on average during the 2000–2011 period, a pace slightly above
the 4.8 percent growth in the income of all households and the 4.1 percent average growth. After
plunging by near seven percent in 2009, growth had recovered by 2013, as robust industrial output

and an abundant harvest led to double-digit export growth. GDP is expected to expand by more
than three percent in 2015.1,2 (See Figure 2.1).

Economic growth has been boosted since 2000 by the shift in output and employment toward
more productive sectors. Romania has experienced a major change in allocation of workers—the
proportion of the workforce in agriculture, which is comparatively unproductive, fell from 35 percent
in 2002 to 26 percent by 2010. Workers tended to move to sectors that drove economic growth:
between 2002 and 2010, the share of employment increased from four to nine percent of GDP in
construction and from 16 to 21 percent of GDP in the wholesale/retail sector. These sectors contin-
ued to absorb labor through 2010 despite steep declines in output, and workers continued to leave
agriculture. Between 2002 and 2010, labor reallocation contributed an average of about two percent
a year to total growth; the rest was generated by increases in output per worker within sectors.3

Yet the structure of Romania’s economy remains more concentrated in less productive and more
energy-intensive sectors than the EU and the OECD4 despite success in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. Comparing Romania’s structure of value-added to other groups of countries, the

biggest difference is the weight in total value-added of agriculture—almost double compared to
other EU new member states and three times higher than the EU15.5 The services sector (including
both market and non-market services) is relatively small in Romania, below 40 percent of output
while, for example, the EU15 has more than half of output from services. Production from energy-in-
tensive sectors exceeds that of the OECD average by some 50 percent. (See Figure 2.2). Neverthe-
less, between the mid-1990s and the late 2000s, greenhouse gas emissions in Romania declined by
almost one-third (see Figure 2.1). The country’s success in mitigation was mainly driven by changes in
the structure of output towards less polluting sectors as well as sectoral improvements in energy effi-
ciency. Figure 2.3 decomposes the decline in emissions according to the well-known Kaya identity.6
A decline in the carbon intensity of energy, from fuel switching away from fossil fuels, contributed to
a lesser extent. These three factors fully offset the increase in emissions stemming from increased
output. As a result, overall carbon dioxide emissions fell during 1995 to 2009 by almost over 40 mil-
lion metric tons.

The path for Romania’s economy to 2050 is likely to feature growing similarity in income levels
and economic structure to the rest of Europe, i.e., convergence. Such a path continues the trends
of the past two decades and the convergence processes observed across the EU. Since 1990, as
noted above, Romania’s economy has transformed its sectoral structure, moving strongly towards
services, and it has become far less energy-intensive. Going forward, the shift away from agriculture

and energy-intensive and polluting heavy industry towards lighter manufacturing and services
should continue. Energy intensity should decrease in line with the shifting structure of the economy.
Although there is no agreement over whether economic convergence of nations holds overall, the
European Union has demonstrably fostered strong convergence among its members and also, to
some extent, on candidate countries. The ‘catch-up’ hypothesis is driven by the assumption that
productivity growth rates vary inversely with productivity levels. Then it follows that the convergence
process stems from lower initial income levels, higher returns on capital, and substantial potential
to improve labor participation and productivity, while the country benefits from a diffusion of global
technological progress. Over a long forecasting period, such as the 40-year horizon used in this anal-
ysis, convergence is a convincing and practical approach to predicting what any individual economy
might look like in the distant future.

Romania’s Mitigation Obligations

Romania contributes only marginally to the global carbon footprint with a share in global GHG
emissions of less than one-half of one percent. (See Figure 2.4). The EU as a whole is responsible for
about 13 percent of global emissions, while China and the US, the largest emitters, are responsible
for almost 40 percent of global emissions between them. However, production in Romania is energy
intensive, and energy used for each unit of output is the highest in Europe. The average energy
intensity in the EU was 142 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) per €1,000 in 2013, close to the world
average, while Romania stands at 335.7 However, irrespective of Romania’s own carbon footprint, as a
member of the European Union, it faces three sets of emissions mitigation obligations: one current;
one imminent; and one prospective.


7. Energy intensity is measured as gross inland consumption of energy divided by GDP, or kgoe per €1000 of GDP at
2005 prices. Data is from Eurostat.

The ‘2020 climate and energy package’ is under implementation until 2020. Approved in Decem-
ber 2008, the EU’s current policies on GHG emissions require comprehensive action by EU members
on overall emissions reduction across all sectors in the economy. The 2020 targets include a 20 per-
cent reduction in emissions compared to 1990 levels (a 14 percent reduction compared to 2005);
a 20 percent renewable energy target as a percent of gross final energy consumption, including a
10 percent share of biofuels in the transport fuel market; and a 20 percent indicative reduction in
primary energy use compared to projected levels under a business-as-usual scenario, to be achieved
through energy efficiency improvements. Large installations in energy-intensive sectors are covered
by the EU-wide Emissions Trading System (ETS), a cap and trade arrangement. The overall target
of –14 percent for emissions is further divided into a target of –21 percent for the ETS sectors and
–10 percent for all other sectors (non-ETS). For the ETS sectors during 2013–2020, allowances are
to decline by 1.74 percent each year. The non-ETS targets were translated into differential national
targets varying by income level. Romania is under obligation for emissions from the non-ETS sectors
to grow by no more than 19 percent relative to 2005. (See Box 2.1 for details of the ETS).8

The 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework was approved in October 2014. The new policy
package proposes a binding target to reduce EU domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least
40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.9 This target aims to ensure that the EU is on the cost-effective
track towards meeting its objective of cutting emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050. In addition


8.  As noted above, most of the comparisons for GHG reductions in this report are reported against 2005 levels because
that is the year European emissions trading was established; thus, all practical rules and targets are formulated against
2005. 1990 is cited in the original broad policy statements because it is the EU’s base year for the Kyoto Protocol and
other international obligations.
9.  The 2030 targets were reiterated in the EU’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) submitted to the
UNFCCC on March 6, 2015.

  bOX 2.1.   The centerpiece of EU climate policy is European emissions trading
  The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

  The ETS provides an Eu-wide limit on greenhouse gas emissions. First launched in 2005,10 the EU ETS is a regional
  (multi-country) system for trading GHG emission allowances. It is the first and largest greenhouse gas trading scheme
  in the world, now covering about 45 percent of the EU’s GHG emissions. The system works on the “cap and trade”
  principle, in which a limit is set on the total amount of GHG emissions and the 11,000 or so heavy energy-using instal-
  lations (in power generation and energy-intensive industry), who are required to participate, must secure emission
  allowances to cover their own emission and can trade with one another as needed. The ETS covers carbon dioxide
  emissions from power and heat generation; energy-intensive industry sectors including oil refineries, steel works and
  production of iron, aluminum, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and bulk organic
  chemicals; and from civil aviation. Also covered is nitrous oxide from production of nitric, adipic, glyoxal and glyoxlic
  acids; and perfluorocarbons from aluminum production.

  The Eu ETS is divided in three trading periods. The first period covered the period 2005–2007 and constituted
  ‘learning by doing’ by establishing national caps and mostly free allocation of allowances. In phase two (2008–2012)
  which coincided with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, three additional countries (Iceland, Liech-
  tenstein and Norway) joined. Additional greenhouse gases were included so that all the main GHGs were covered.
  The system was extended to the aviation sector (in 2012). More auctioning of allowances occurred although some free
  allocation continued. The third phase of EU ETS runs from 2013 to 2020 and cuts allowances to reduce GHG emissions
  by 2020 by 21 percent compared to 2005. More harmonized rules have been put in place, in particular:

     i) a single, EU-wide cap on emissions (replacing national caps);
    ii) for each year after 2013, the overall cap decreases annually by 1.74 percent of the average total quantity of allow-
        ances issued annually during 2008–2012;
   iii) auctioning (rather than free allocation) as the default method for allocating allowances (and up to half of allow-
        ances are expected to be auctioned during phase three); and
   iv) about 90 percent of allowances will be distributed to EU member states (based on emissions shares in 2005), and
        at least half of auctioning revenues must be used by member states for climate and energy related purposes such
        as energy efficiency, renewables, research, and sustainable transport.

to the target for overall cuts, the Framework also sets out targets of at least a 27 percent share for
renewable energy and at least a 27 percent improvement in energy efficiency. To achieve the overall
40 percent target, the Framework notes that sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce
their emissions by an estimated 43 percent compared to 2005. Emissions from sectors outside the
EU ETS would need to be cut by about 30 percent below the 2005 level, and this EU-wide target will
need to be translated into Member State targets. A 43 percent greenhouse gas reduction target in
2030 in the ETS translates into a cap declining by 2.2 percent annually from 2021 onwards, instead of
the rate of 1.74 percent up to 2020 set by the 2020 package.10

The European Union has laid out a vision for mitigation through 2050. A “Roadmap for moving to
a competitive low carbon economy in 2050” was published in March 2011 by the European Com-
mission.11 Scenarios were created by combining the four main decarbonization options—energy
efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. The Roadmap sets out long-

10. The ETS was set out in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003
establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.

term objectives for EU mitigation: overall emissions for the EU are to drop by 79 to 82 percent,
while emissions in the power sector are to disappear (–93 to –99 percent reductions). The Roadmap
remains a long-term vision, not a policy proposal, but this objective has been reiterated by the EU
in the context of its March 2015 offer to the UNFCCC, and the 2030 package is consistent with an
emissions path that could get the EU to –80 percent by 2050. (See Table 2.1).

Projections of Climate Change in Romania to 2050

Future climate scenarios were developed, showing rising temperatures and falling precipitation.
Historical temperature and precipitation data for each of Romania’s river basins, derived from daily
observations at 160 meteorological stations for 1961 to 2013,12 were combined with projected changes
obtained from global climate modeling to create scenarios of future climate for Romania for 2015 to
2050. Using 17 available combinations of global general circulation models (GCMs) and Reference
Concentration Pathways (RCP) employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
a crop model was run through 2050 to estimate the changes in irrigation water requirements for
maize. Three climate scenarios were selected and further developed (low impact, medium impact,
and high impact) based on the most positive, the median, and most negative changes.13 The impact
on precipitation and temperature is shown in Figure 2.5. All three scenarios show rising temperatures
over coming decades. The pattern for precipitation is less clear. But it is important to remember that
annual national averages are not what matter for water availability and agricultural production.14

12.  Meteorological data were provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration (NMA, or Administratia
Nationala de Meteorologie).
13.  The high impact climate scenario was based on the GCM, Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC)
ESM using the IPCC emissions scenario, RCP 8.5. The medium impact scenario was based on the GCM, Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) ESM2M using the emissions scenario, RCP 4.5. The low impact scenario was based on
the GCM, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) ESM2G using RCP 8.5. RCP is a Representative Concentration
Pathway as used in the fifth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. AN RCP is gas
concentration trajectory, and each is named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to
pre-industrial values. RCP 8.5 is a ‘business-as-usual’ pathway with no mitigation so emissions continue to rise throughout
the 21st century. Emissions in RCP 4.5 peak around 2040, then decline.

Baseline Scenario for Economic Development to 2050

The likely path for Romania’s economy through 2050 before considering low carbon and green
growth actions is generated by a macroeconomic model. Baseline scenarios can be created in
different ways. Here the baseline relies mainly on the official long-term forecasts prepared by
the government’s National Commission for Prognosis (Comisia Nationala de Prognoza, CNP). The
official CNP projection provides a consistent picture of economic and sectoral developments. The
baseline also draws on economic convergence theory and utilizes information from empirical stud-
ies, reviews of sector strategies, and consultations with experts and stakeholders. A consistency
framework is provided by the computable general equilibrium model, including consideration of
Romania’s links to the rest of the world. (The methodology section that follows provides details
about the model.)

Real incomes in Romania are expected to converge towards the European Union average but at
a modest pace, averaging 2.2 percent annual growth through 2050 compared to 1.4 percent for
the EU overall. These growth rates are higher in earlier years and then moderate, from just below
three percent during 2010–20 to 1.6 percent during 2040–2050. But Romania’s rate of expansion
remains well above that of the EU as a whole and very slightly ahead of those of the OECD although
below those in the rest of the world. (See Figure 2.6). Projected growth comes from the official long
term forecasts of the National Commission for Prognosis (CNP, Romanian acronym). It reflects a
broad consensus that income per capita in Romania is set to catch up gradually to EU levels. Total
factor productivity gains and capital accumulation are expected to be the main growth drivers, con-
sistent with the Solow model. Romania’s total factor productivity (TFP) growth is projected to decline
from 1.7 percent annually at the beginning of the period towards 1.5 percent at the end, higher rates
than in the EU because Romania farther from the technological frontier, making it easier to adopt
innovations from abroad and to benefit from foreign direct investment which will bring both organi-
zational and technological innovations. (See Figure 2.7).

Notes:  The chart is based on the standard Solow analysis with a Cobb-Douglas production function (Y = AKaL1–a). Conse-
quently, GDP growth can be decomposed as Dln(Yt) = Dln(At) + aDln(Kt) + (1 – a)Dln(Lt). The first component is contribution
of TFP, the second—capital and the third—labor. Capital is calculated on the basis of investment data, labor force comes
from employment statistics. TFP was calculated implicitly, assuming that share of capital in GDP (a) is equal to 40 percent
and depreciation rate (d) is equal to 6 percent.

Romania’s population and labor force are continuing to shrink. Population, depleted by emigration,
is projected to decline by 11.8 percent by 2050 (compared to 2010).15 The labor force, affected by
aging, will receive only a small boost from improving labor force participation from its current low
levels but not enough to offset the shrinking number of workers. The unemployment rate is forecast

to remain close to 7 percent. Labor productivity is estimated to grow by more than 3 percent annually
up to 2040 and more than 2 percent thereafter.

In the baseline, almost all economic sectors are projected to grow, but their growth rates will be
quite diverse. These projections took into account the constraints imposed by possible develop-
ments in global markets (both in the EU and outside the EU). Overall, the trend away from ener-
gy-intensive sectors and towards higher productivity sectors will continue. Agriculture’s share will fall
due to reallocation of resources to low-end services such as trade and transport. According to CNP
forecasts, services will gain about 3 percentage points during 2010–2050 period, remaining much
below the EU average. Meanwhile, industry is to maintain its value-added share due to existing
comparative advantages. The economy should follow the general historical growth pattern observed
in more advanced EU countries alongside rising incomes. However, since sectoral transformation is
a slow process, sectors such as agriculture and industry will continue to have a higher share in the
Romanian economy than in the EU, and this will also be reflected in employment. Romania is to keep
its specialization in selected primary sectors in comparison to the EU. (See Figure 2.8).

Under the baseline scenario, EU countries comply with the 2020 climate and energy package,
which requires participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The package sets a target
of 20 percent reduction in GHG emissions for the EU as a whole from 1990 levels (equal to a 14 per-
cent reduction compared to 2005 levels). Also, an increase to 20 percent in final energy consump-
tion produced from renewable resources is required, and an indicative target was put in place for
improvement of energy efficiency by 20 percent compared to the EU baseline level for 2020. Post-
2020, the rules underlying the third phase of the EU ETS are assumed to continue (although they
are only legally binding until 2020, the probability of the ETS disappearing completely after 2020 is

the ’20-20-20’ package was a 20 percent reduction in primary energy use compared to projected levels under a busi-
ness-as-usual scenario, to be achieved through energy efficiency improvements; however, this target was not translated
into a legally binding commitment but was left as indicative only. ***Revenues from sales of carbon allowances that accrue
to governments are assumed to be used (recycled) to reduce general taxes. This is a simplifying assumption since current
EU regulations require mixed use of these revenues to support energy efficiency. See Methodology and Findings sections

low). These rules include: a harmonized single EU-wide cap instead of national caps, harmonization
of monitoring and reporting, and full auctioning of allowances within the EU ETS. Post-2020, the
emissions cap decreases annually by 1.74 percent of the average annual total quantity of allowances
issued by the Member States in 2008–2012.16 As a result, greenhouse gas emissions related to ETS
entities decline to 21 percent below 2005 levels in 2020 to 34 percent lower in 2030 and 53 percent in
2050. (See Figure 2.10). The main policy assumptions on climate and energy in the baseline scenario
are summarized in Table 2.2.17



16.  For non-EU countries, in the baseline scenario, they commit to their 2020 emission pledges. There have been sev-
eral actions at global level with the aim to commit countries to emission reductions. In 1992, countries joined the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to cooperatively consider what can be done to limit average global
temperature increases and the resulting climate change, and to cope with whatever impacts were, by then, inevitable. In
1995, countries launched negotiations to strengthen the global response to climate change, and two years later, adopted
the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed countries to emission reduction targets. In 2009 the
Copenhagen Accord was drafted. Countries submitted emissions reductions pledges or mitigation action pledges.
17.  For non-ETS sectors, the model assumes that each EU country imposes a domestic CO2 tax which equalizes marginal
abatement costs only across each country’s domestic non-ETS emission sources. This assumption is a shorthand for the
most efficient possible way for each EU member state to meet its individual non-ETS target. In reality, countries will likely
use a mix of policy tools, including taxes, subsidies, standards and other regulation, and other measures.

Over the 40-year horizon, the energy intensity of the Romanian economy is projected to continue
to decline, offsetting expanding output such that GHG emissions are close to stable. The energy
intensity of production and the carbon intensity of energy are projected to decline. The reduction of
energy intensity of GDP can be attributed to autonomous energy efficiency gains, structural changes
of the economy away from energy-intensive activities and sectors (such as the ferrous and non-
ferrous metals, chemicals, and cement industries), take-up of more efficient energy equipment by
consumers, and the reaction of energy consumers to higher energy prices. The next most important
factor is the ongoing shift in the structure of value-added towards less energy-intensive sectors—
away from agriculture and industry to services—which was the main driver of emissions decline in the
EU over the last two decades. Third is the reduction in energy-related CO2 emissions compared to
final energy demand, which corresponds to a higher penetration of carbon-free energy sources into
the energy mix and substitutions within the fossil fuel mix towards less carbon-intensive fossil fuels,
for example, natural gas substituting for coal or oil (that are more carbon-intensive and have lower
energy efficiencies when used in final demand sectors and for electricity production).

dynamic computable general equilibrium model that covers the interactions between the economy,
the energy system and the environment. The model is Romania-specific but also captures the interac-
tion of the country with international markets—aggregated into five countries/regions (Romania, the
EU-15 and other EU new member states, other industrialized countries, and developing countries).
The international features allow it to analyze both the impact of EU policy choices on global markets
and international spillovers triggered by emission abatement policies of other major industrialized
regions.19 The model contains 28 economic activities or sectors. While in standard global CGE mod-
els only CO2 from combustion is modeled, in ROM-E3 all greenhouse gases are modeled, including
process-based emissions from agriculture and industry. The model’s horizon stretches to 2050, and
institutional settings and policy instruments for climate policy implementation are included, includ-
ing the complex rules for the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) under which installations in power
generation and energy-intensive industry must participate in ETS carbon trading (with the rest of the
economy covered as part of the ‘non-ETS sector’ facing national emissions reduction targets).

Key sectors driving emissions are energy and transport, and a detailed bottom-up representation
of each is included in the model.20 Power supply is modelled by ten representative generation tech-
nologies whose market shares and cost structures are consistent with energy balances. The market
shares and capital costs of power generation technologies have been harmonized with the results of
energy modeling (see Chapter 3). For transport, major categories of transport21 are represented, with
two different categories distinguished by purpose: i) private, including households’ expenditures
for transport equipment (cars, motorcycles) and for public transportation (leisure trips, commuting
trips), and ii) business, including firms’ expenditures for transportation of goods (freight transport)
and employees (passenger transportation paid by business).

Data sources and main assumptions are important to note, and the model includes some key mar-
ket imperfections. The ROM-E3 model is calibrated to a base year (2010) dataset that includes full
Social Accounting Matrices for each country/region represented in the model.22 The key exogenous
variables of the model are: total factor productivity, technical progress, fossil fuel prices, labor force,
minimum consumption of households (adjusted based on population changes), public consump-
tion, taxes and subsidies, shares of different technologies in power generation, and sectoral growth
expectations. The labor market includes involuntary unemployment and fiscal instruments such as
indirect taxes, subsidies, duties, and income taxes are modelled. Figure 2.9 explains how the base-
line and policy scenarios are run.

The ROM-E3 model has been used to evaluate alternative GHG emission reduction scenarios—the
Green and Super Green scenarios, in addition to the baseline. The baseline was presented above.
The two green scenarios are defined below. (See Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3). The Green package aims
to quantify what is already agreed about EU commitments for mitigation in 2030, specifically the
40 percent emissions reduction by that year and the expected cuts from ETS and non-ETS sectors,

19.  The non-EU regions do not participate in carbon trading or offsets but rather set a uniform domestic carbon tax.
20.  In the macroeconomic model, only electricity generation is modelled in detail, rather than the entire energy sector
which also includes heat production and energy sector own-use (under the standard International Energy Agency/IPCC
definition).

were updated to 2010 using national statistical data, and 2010 was the base year used in ROM-E3. GTAP is Purdue Uni-

but numerous details remain to be decided, in particular the national targets that will aggregate to
the overall non-ETS abatement effort. The Super Green package aims to quantify implementation
of the Roadmap 2050, which is a broad strategy document with no legally binding power although
it has been reiterated as the EU’s long-term objective on mitigation (see the anticipated sectoral
contributions in Table 2.1).

The Green scenario imposes compliance with the main features of the 2030 Climate and Energy
Policy Framework. As determined in the October 2014 decision of the European Council, the 2030
Framework sets an all-EU target for emissions reduction of 40 percent compared to 1990. For ETS
sectors, EU-wide carbon trading ensures equal prices of emissions abatement across the EU in all
scenarios. The sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) would have to reduce
their emissions by 43 percent compared to 2005.23 Emissions from sectors outside the EU ETS would
need to be cut by 30 percent below the 2005 level on average. While the EU ETS operates as a sin-
gle market, differential emission reduction targets are to be imposed for the non-ETS segments of
the respective EU economies. For non-ETS sectors, as in the baseline, the model assumes that each
EU country imposes a domestic CO2 tax as a shorthand for the most efficient possible way for each
EU member state to meet its individual non-ETS target. In reality, countries will likely use a mix of pol-

23. 2005 was the first year of ETS trading and so is the year against which emissions reductions are measured.

icy tools, including taxes, subsidies, standards and other regulation, and other measures. As in the
baseline scenario, marginal abatement costs are equalized across each country’s domestic non-ETS
emission sources; in addition, in the Green scenario, the national non-ETS targets were selected as
the most efficient allocation, but an allocation based on equity generates similar targets: Romania
has a target of 0 percent change in non-ETS emissions by 2030 compared to 2005. In the Green
scenario, as in the baseline, the revenues from auctioned ETS allowances and domestic taxation of
non-ETS emissions are recycled through general taxes (because no restrictions on use of auction
revenues have yet been set; however, it is likely that the EU will restrict use of revenues as it does
under the 2020 climate package.)24

A more ambitious mitigation scenario—Super Green—reflects the reduction of emissions by
almost 80 percent compared to 1990 levels for developed economies. In order to stabilize GHG
concentrations at safe levels (i.e., 450 ppm according to the UNFCCC), there is a need for global
action. The Super Green scenario imposes an emissions constraint on richer countries (the EU and
OECD) for 2050 while emissions are allowed to increase in line with the baseline path for developing
countries. According to the milestones set in the March 2011 “2050 Roadmap for the EU,” the EU

climate and energy related purposes.

should prepare for reductions in its domestic emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990.
Further, all reductions of EU emissions should come from within the EU itself and not result from
carbon offsets. (See Table 2.1 and surrounding text).

Main Findings

The Green scenario imposes only modest net costs on Romania’s economy. EU-wide emissions
trading in the model determines how the overall EU ETS reduction of 43 percent compared to 2005
will be most efficiently allocated across countries, while each country meets their individual non-ETS
target to aggregate to –30 percent for the EU overall. Total emissions for Romania will decline by
21 percent by 2030 vs. 2005, compared to a 36 percent decline for the EU overall. For Romania, ener-
gy-intensive sectors (or ETS sectors) must reduce emissions by 23 percent by 2030 or about 12 per-
centage points more in 2030 compared to the baseline pattern of ETS emissions. The EU will cut
ET emissions by 43 percent or nine percentage points additional to the baseline scenario. Together,
this additional mitigation compared to the baseline will reduce Romania’s GDP by 1.1 percent in
2030 compared to baseline. (See Figure 2.11 and Table 2.4). Employment is harmed more, with a
reduction of 1.7 percent. (See Figure 2.10 for emissions reductions under all scenarios compared to
1990). If carried on through 2050, the 2030 Framework would generate 2.0 percent lower GDP in 2050
compared to the baseline. Nevertheless, although not as high as baseline GDP, GDP in 2050 under
the Green scenario would stand 111 percent higher than in 2015.

Moderate effects at the economy-wide level mask significant output, employment, and trade
effects at the sectoral level, but energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries are not devastated
by emissions abatement. Capital is substituted for energy as an input factor. Energy, extractive and
energy-intensive sectors lose in output terms, while services and light industry win. Declines in out-
put of over 10 percent are recorded for fossil fuel extraction, agriculture, oil products, and power
supply subsectors. The higher costs of production for those sectors in which (fossil fuel) energy
inputs represent a significant share of direct and indirect costs leads to a loss in competitiveness,

ment, transport equipment, and non-ferrous metals subsectors. In the new equilibrium, real wages
are lower, and unemployment rises. Since many of the new technological options come from abroad,
in the form of imported goods, the current account deteriorates. In the first 15 years or so, the great-
est adjustment comes in the transport sector, but then energy-intensive industry comes to dominate
the losses in production compared to baseline. (See Figure 2.11). Despite these costs, all sectors
would experience positive growth in all future decades to 2050 (except for a half percent decline in
energy during the next ten years).

If the revenues from auctioning ETS allowances in Romania were recycled to aim to reap a ‘double
dividend’, the output and employment impacts would be somewhat smaller. Two alternatives within
the Green scenario generate positive differences in GDP and employment impact. The standard tax
recycling option used in the Green scenario is that public revenues are used to reduce general tax-
ation. A variant has been explored—a Mixed Double Dividend scenario—in which tax revenues are
used to reduce labor costs, finance renewable energy, and boost energy efficiency. More specifically,
half of the revenues are used to reduce social security contribution rates for employers, one-quarter
is used to finance deployment of renewables, and the last quarter is used to finance energy efficiency
projects. This mixed use of revenues achieves better results than a simple ‘double dividend’ policy
of devoting all of revenues to reducing labor taxes. It is also better aligned with the likely rules on
use of revenue under the 2030 Framework (based on discussions and decisions to date). The mar-
ginal benefits accrued from all the alternative recycling options that were tested peak at a relatively
early stage. All recycling options exhibit decreasing returns but have different multiplier effects on
the economy. The mixed double dividend approach simultaneously achieves three targets: (i) offset-
ting somewhat the loss of competitiveness of the economy, (ii) reducing the crowding-out effect in

the capital market induced by the deployment of capital-intensive renewable energy technologies,
and (iii) reducing the cost of additional energy efficiency projects. These effects partly offset the
impact of restricting emissions on production costs and reduce upward pressure on prices overall.
Thus, domestic demand is less depressed than in the main Green scenario. The decrease in the cost
of labor sustains demand for labor and, as a consequence, the reduction in wage income is less.
Together, the impact of the Green emissions targets on private consumption is lower than in the
alternative taxation case. This option also slightly benefits employment, by 0.3 percentage points in
2030 when compared to the main Green scenario. Importantly, while this option aims to mimic likely
EU rules, any such recycling option would have to follow actual EU guidelines and rules, which are
not yet determined for the 2030 Framework. (See Table 2.4).

Romania benefits only slightly from halving of oil prices through 2030 as compared to the baseline
scenario. The gains of the Low Fuel Price alternative relative to the Green scenario are much bigger
outside Romania—for the other new member states or for the EU15. This is because terms-of-trade
effects are more pronounced for larger net energy importers. If Romania were to perform the same
emissions reduction effort in 2030 under lower fossil fuel price, the country would benefit from access
to low cost energy resources. However, product prices in other countries would decrease and so Roma-
nia will increase its imports, hence reducing the positive effect of low fossil prices on its GDP. The pos-
itive effects for private consumption are much more significant (a difference of 1.5 percentage points).

Maintaining the 2030 Framework through 2050 allows assessment of the continuing impact of
unchanged 2030 policies. Overall emissions for Romania will continue to decline, reaching 26 per-
cent below 2005 levels by 2050 while the EU as a whole would reduce emissions by 46 percent.
Romania’s emissions from ETS sectors would shrink by 54 percent by 2050 with no additional actions
but only the maintenance of the 2030 Framework (and the ongoing reduction of ETS allowances by
2.4 percent each year). As noted above, the cost to Romania in GDP in 2050 is estimated at 2.0 per-
cent while employment will be lower by 1.7 percent. (See Figure 2.11 and Table 2.4).

The Super Green scenario imposes distinctly larger costs on Romania’s economy as the need for
deep decarbonization, including complete elimination of emissions from the power sector, drives
significant economic restructuring. For the EU overall to cut emissions by near 80 percent by 2050,
Romania’s contribution will be similar: –70 percent compared to 2005 levels. By 2030, Romania’s
GHGs will need to be 37 percent below 2005, and its energy-intensive sectors must reduce emissions
by more than 50 percent below 2005 or 26 percentage points below the baseline pattern of ETS emis-
sions in 2030. In 2050, GDP losses for decarbonizing the EU economy are around 1.6 percent and 4.0
percent for Romania. Employment losses for Romania come to above five percent. Romania suffers
a much larger adjustment cost than the EU average mainly because: i) it provides larger potential
for cost-effective abatement options, and ii) in the baseline scenario, Romania’s energy sector is still
dominated by fossil fuels; hence, it must be restructured more thoroughly than the EU average. At
the same time, a large part of the equipment required to decarbonize the Romanian economy is to
be imported. (See Table 2.4 and Figure 2.12). (Note that some part of these relatively higher costs for
Romania are driven by the modeling assumption that an integrated EU-wide market for all emissions
is used to achieve the 2050 target.) By comparison with the Green scenario, here energy-intensive
industry suffers the biggest losses in output compared to baseline from the start. Even in the Super
Green scenario, however, except for energy and energy-intensive industry (which suffer very modest
output declines of one percent or less), sectors continue to expand output throughout the period to
2050. GDP in 2050 in the Super Green scenario is projected at 107 percent greater than GDP today.

In the Super Green scenario, lower fossil fuel prices could marginally mitigate the adverse impacts
of rising carbon prices. Compared to the Super Green scenario with higher fuel prices, lower energy
costs do not affect GDP, while private consumption could gain around one percent as consumers
would benefit from lower energy bills for imported fuels. In the Super Green scenario, it has been
assumed that developed countries globally undertake intense GHG mitigation action consistent

with a 450 ppm target. It can be expected that this action will have an impact on fossil fuel prices. The
reduction of fossil fuel prices due to global climate action decreases overall prices and costs, allow-
ing consumers to maintain demand and compensate for the additional investment costs needed for
energy restructuring purposes. Thus, lower fossil fuel prices mitigate the adverse impacts of carbon
prices and can even offset the depressive demand effect due to decarbonization. This holds mainly
in developed countries which have high fossil fuel prices and less so in developing countries where
fossil fuel prices are subsidized and taxation is low. (See Table 2.4).


CONCLuSiONS AND RECOMMENDATiONS

After accounting for economy-wide impacts and feedback as well as interactions globally, the
costs of implementing the imminent EU 2030 climate framework are modest for Romania’s econ-
omy. EU emissions trading allocates mitigation efficiently across EU member states via a uniform
carbon price (the emissions allowance price that clears the ETS market). Romania can meet the 2030
obligations by cutting GHGs by 34 percent by 2030 compared with 2005 or by 10 percentage points
compared to baseline emissions at a cost of 1.1 percent of GDP and 1.7 percent of employment.
Simply maintaining likely 2030 policies until 2050 will reduce emissions to about one-third below
2005 levels by 2050 for Romania and to near 45 percent lower for the EU. Importantly, the relatively
modest overall cost masks highly variable impacts across sectors, with more energy-intensive sectors
suffering much higher dislocation.

The same approach to assessing the prospective EU Roadmap 2050 finds a heavy burden in costs
for Romania’s economy. Reducing overall emissions by more than 70 percent and ETS emissions by
near 80 percent by 2050 will leave Romania’s output an estimated four percent lower and employ-
ment almost five percent lower. This path represents a radical shift compared to the current EU 2020
policies or even the upcoming 2030 Framework. However, it is important to note that the modeling
simplification under this scenario of a single EU-wide emissions market for all sectors, without con-
sideration of equity, likely imposes higher costs on Romania than actual future EU policies (since
even by 2050, Romania’s per capita income is projected to rise to just 40 percent of the EU average).

Since modeling requires simplifying assumptions, model outputs must be interpreted with care.
Not every output of a CGE model is meant to be a precise reflection of the real world or how an
economy works in practice. A good example of this is the use of a carbon price to drive the adjust-
ments necessary to achieve a GHG mitigation target. Because the model used here is driven by the
price of emissions (a carbon price), those prices must rise to extreme levels to achieve the Super
Green targets, but reality will likely differ greatly from this part of the forecast. (See Figure 2.13). It
should be kept in mind that the costings and coefficients used in the ROM-E3 model (which drive
the required carbon price needed to achieve emissions reductions) are snapshots based on avail-
able data and the technology set that today is considered practical for such assessments. Despite
the quite detailed and sophisticated treatment of technological progress in the ROM-E3 macroeco-
nomic model, new technologies will certainly emerge over coming decades that will change these
costs and benefits, providing an important reason why governments need to update such analysis
periodically.

The government needs to be prepared to monitor the cross-sectoral effects of the green transition
and consider measures aimed at facilitating the reallocation of labor and capital from one sector

to another. Mitigation measures induce differing economic repercussions across sectors, and the
costs of adjustment are borne mainly by energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors. The estimated
value-added patterns in energy-intensive sectors, such as power and heavy industry, reveal higher
declines in output and employment than in the rest of the economy through 2030/2050. These sec-
tors play an important role in a small and open economy such as Romania, and the government may
wish to consider appropriate measures to assure targeted assistance for displaced workers.

A mixed use of rising revenues from auctioning of ETS allowances, including reduction of labor
taxes but also financing of renewables and energy efficiency measures seems to be a smart option,
given its positive impact on GDP, sectoral output, and employment, if such a policy falls within EU
rules. While economy-wide models are designed to focus on real sector developments over long
horizons, they also offer insights on fiscal issues. The ROM-E3 model assumes fiscal neutrality so that
the impact of mitigation options on fiscal expenditures or revenues must be financed by offsetting
changes in spending or taxes. However, a choice can be made of which taxes or costs to reduce.
The mixed use of revenues—the Mixed Double Dividend scenario—is the recycling option most
supportive of output, job creation, and a reduction of the unemployment rate. This phenomenon is
referred to as the ‘double dividend’, i.e., that a tax on a ‘bad’ (GHG emissions) allows the reduction
of a tax on a ‘good’ (employment, renewables, or energy efficiency). However, the government’s
ability to recycle revenues is likely to be constrained by upcoming EU guidelines and rules under the
2030 Framework. Such rules, if similar to those under the EU 2020 climate policy, will require revenues
to be invested in low-carbon urban mobility, energy efficiency measures and renewables support,
similar to the design of the mixed scenario assessed here.

From the viewpoint of cost efficiency and economic performance, Romania has much to gain
through addressing some of the following challenges. Firstly, the inclusion of strong equity consid-
erations into EU-wide climate policy discussions serves Romania well. Because the Romanian econ-
omy is projected to expand faster than the EU and because Romania remains one of the poorest
EU countries (reaching just 40 percent of EU average income levels by 2050), it could be argued that

the constraints on emissions in its non-ETS sectors for 2030 (and perhaps for 2050) should be looser
on equity grounds. Secondly, recycling allowance revenues in a mixed fashion, as set out above,
improves outcomes. Thirdly, enhancing the flexibility of Romania’s economy so that resources and
production factors can be reallocated more easily (or increasing the ‘elasticities’ in the economy)
will allow for higher growth with reduced emissions. Fourthly, aggressive exploitation of the sizable
potential for energy efficiency improvements in most economic sectors meets multiple goals at effi-
cient cost. Lastly, funding from external non-debt creating sources (such as EU structural funds) for
emissions-mitigation investments greatly lowers overall costs to the Romanian economy.

This economy-wide modeling provides a framework and an integrated approach to considering
low carbon and green actions, but further sector analysis provides valuable confirmation about
greening potential and tangible details about how to achieve that potential. Figure 2.14 illustrates
the contributions to mitigation by sector under the Super Green scenario of the ROM-E3 model. Of
the total mitigation in 2050 compared to baseline of 43 MtCO2e, energy provides near one-quarter
of total mitigation while energy-intensive industries and agriculture and forestry contribute about
17 percent each (not considering carbon sequestration). In the chapters that follow, detailed sec-
tor analysis and modeling will supplement this first assessment of mitigation potential. Adaptation
actions are also of importance, and the sector analysis in subsequent chapters will address these
green actions as well.

Last, the macroeconomic model constructed for this analysis remains available for further devel-
opment and application by the government for current and future policy questions related to
low carbon and green growth. The ROM-E3 model was built in collaboration with Romanian gov-
ernment experts, and it is being transferred to the Commission for Prognosis. The government has
the opportunity to apply this model to numerous questions about EU, global, and national policies
related to emissions mitigation and other green growth issues and to provide the needed regular
updates of this assessment (as noted above). The model also can be applied to a large set of policy

         omania’s emissions have dropped significantly from their peak in the late 1980s as a co-ben-
         efit of structural transformation and due to the growth in the share of low-carbon energy
         sources. The energy sector in Romania1 is characterized by a relatively high share of zero-
         carbon sources, which constitute one-quarter of primary energy supply2 and 45 percent of
electricity generation and include hydropower, nuclear, wind, biomass, and solar photovoltaic (solar
PV). Romania participates in EU emissions trading (the Emissions Trading System, ETS) for energy-in-
tensive sectors which is designed to secure mitigation across the EU of 21 percent compared to 2005
for those sectors, as the centerpiece of the European Union’s current climate rules. Those rules are
expected to tighten for 2030 and further for 2050. In addition, while the energy intensity of Romania’s
economy has been decreasing, it is still one of the highest in the EU. However, continuing de-carbon-
ization of Romania’s energy sector is a challenging process and will require further transformation
of power generation: 46 percent of primary energy and 40 percent of generation still depend on
coal3 and oil. As a result, the energy sector remains responsible for almost 60 percent of Romania’s
total emissions (excluding LULUCF4), and climate change mitigation targets beyond the current set
for 2020 cannot be achieved without significant action in the energy sector. Moreover, the country
faces substantial investment needs irrespective of mitigation obligations, to replace obsolete fossil-
fueled electricity plants; and switching to renewable power to reduce energy sector emissions at the

energy sector in Romania has the potential to become an engine of economic growth.

Analysis and modeling aimed to find the best solutions for Romania’s energy supply mix given the
country’s current, imminent, and prospective mitigation obligations. Such solutions were modeled
as satisfying future energy demand at a minimum cost while meeting emissions mitigation require-
ments. A TIMES model5 was used for energy supply modeling while the potential for reduction
of energy demand in end-use services through energy efficiency measures was estimated using a
tool—Energy Service Demand Analysis (ESDA)—developed for this purpose. Green policy measures
were evaluated under three scenarios: Baseline (current EU policy with 2020 targets), Green (likely EU
2030 targets), and Super Green (possible EU 2050 targets). The findings identify optimal power gen-
eration and energy efficiency measures to meet the emissions mitigation requirements of the Green
and Super Green scenarios. Under the Baseline scenario, energy sector emissions are found to fall
to two percent below 2005 levels by 2050, while this reduction is 26 percent in the Green scenario,
and 43 percent in the Super Green. Within the energy sector, electricity emissions will drop by 36, 72,
and 97 percent respectively. Inclusion of a set of selected energy efficiency measures is critical for the
implementation of both the Green and Super Green scenarios, as these measures deliver significant
abatement, are cost efficient, and require a modest implementation effort.

Romania can meet the mitigation obligations likely under the EU’s 2030 Climate and Energy Policy
Framework at moderate costs; but the prospective requirements of the EU 2050 Roadmap, which
necessitate at least 80 percent reduction in emissions and the virtual elimination of emissions from
the power sector, are likely to be both expensive and challenging to implement. The investment
effort in the power sector (including demand management) required for the implementation of the

Green scenario (to meet 2030 requirements) is estimated at €37 billion (present value)6 or an average
annual 1.1 percent of GDP through 2050, while the investment costs of the Super Green scenario (to
meet 2050 requirements) are projected to amount to 54 billion (present value) or an average annual
1.7 percent of GDP. The required investments shift upwards after 2030 in both green scenarios, as
remaining fossil-based plants are replaced with renewable and nuclear capacity. A lower carbon
path for Romania’s energy sector will impose significant costs and complex planning challenges on
the sector, in particular on power generation. Achieving emissions reduction targets beyond the EU
2020 targets will require Romania to abandon plans for new coal-based power generation capacity
and life-extension of existing plants. It will also require significant additional renewable generation
capacity and, therefore, a regulatory environment that would promote it. Nevertheless, the govern-
ment cannot be distracted from critical near-term sector reforms, many of which lay essential condi-
tions for the success of the long-term green transition. Although the costs of greening are projected
to rise significantly over time and as requirements for emissions reduction tighten, a lower carbon
energy sector needs to be part of Romania’s long-term planning. In support of that enduring objec-
tive, the TIMES supply model and the Energy Service Demand Analysis tool constructed for this
analysis remain available for further development and application by the government.

Overview

Romania’s economic growth and energy consumption have been decoupling since the early 1990s,
and the energy intensity of the economy has been continuously decreasing.7 However, a signifi-
cant increase in energy demand is expected to accompany future growth. After the large contrac-
tions of the economy and energy consumption in the 1990s, Romania’s GDP recovered, expanding
by 53 percent during 2000 to 2011, while energy demand remained flat. This slow growth of energy
demand was in large part due to structural shifts of the economy toward higher-value-added manu-
facturing and services and away from energy-intensive industries, as well as significant improvements
of energy efficiency within industries. As a result of these two factors, the energy intensity of the
economy has been continuously decreasing for more than two decades and is now less than half its
1989 level (see Figure 3.1). In the medium- to long-term, energy consumption patterns are expected
to converge toward those of high-income EU countries, and energy demand will increase, in partic-
ular, due to growth in demand for transportation and services. These changes are already underway:
from 2000 to 2011, energy used in transport grew by 25 percent and in the services sector by 260
percent (although from a relatively small base), while residential and industrial demand declined by
6 and 21 percent, respectively.8

At present, primary energy consumption is characterized by a relatively high and growing share of
zero-carbon energy sources, leading to a shrinking carbon footprint of the energy sector. This trend
has been supported by Romania’s high renewable energy potential and production, as well as by
nuclear power production. From 1990 to 2012, the share of primary energy supply from zero-carbon

social discount rates range from four to six percent).
7. Energy intensity is measured as primary energy consumption (g of oil eq.) per $1 GDP (constant 2005 US$).
8. Total energy supply needs to satisfy total energy demand in the economy including the transport sector; however,
transport GHG mitigation measures are not addressed as part of the energy sector since separate transport sector mod-
eling was undertaken (see Chapter 4).

sources (nuclear, hydropower, wind, solar PV, and geothermal) increased from under two percent to
12 percent, and the share of renewable sources grew from 2.5 to 15 percent of the total. At the same
time, natural gas declined slightly, from 46 to 31 percent of the total (see Figure 3.2.a). This trend
continues to be supported by the country’s rich renewable energy potential: hydropower technical
potential of 36 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, wind generation potential of 23 TWh per year (the
highest in Southern Europe), high solar potential with an average solar radiation level of 1,400, and
rich forestry resources promising to cover 19 percent of total demand.9

Electricity production also uses substantial zero-carbon sources and a growing share of renew-
ables, although fossil fuels still dominate. Total installed capacity at the end of 2013 was 22,947
megawatts (MW), and total production was 59,045 gigawatt hours, consisting of 55 percent fossil
fuel-based generation, 19 percent nuclear, and 26 percent renewables (see Figure 3.2.b). It ranks
14th among the EU’s 29 countries according to the share of zero-carbon generation and 13th accord-
ing to the share of renewable generation (and fifth in Europe in terms of the amount of wind capac-
ity installed). However, fossil-based generation still dominates electricity production, and about
one-third of the fossil fuel-fired capacity is co-generation. The fossil fuel-fired plants consist of pre-
dominantly obsolete, high-emissions coal and gas-fired generation units, most of which need to be
decommissioned or modernized. Over the period 2005–2011, Romania decommissioned 3,000 MW
of thermal generation capacity. Further decommissioning is expected because many plants do not

40 or more years old.10

Romania is a net exporter of electricity, with a fast growing volume of power exports. In 2013,
it exported 4.7 TWh of electricity, about 8.5 percent of its electricity production, transporting it to
Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. Electricity exports, after dropping in the first years of transition and
reaching a low point in 1995, surged almost eleven-fold between 1995 and 2011, when the power
sold abroad amounted to 5.3 TWh, while imports increased 3.3 times over the same period. How-
ever, the trend is characterized by variability, reflecting economic and weather conditions. Going
forward, the country plans to further increase its power exports, responding to the growing demand
in neighboring countries.

Romania is a significant producer of oil and natural gas, and most of gas consumption is covered
by domestic sources; it uses domestic coal entirely for heat and power generation. It has the
fifth-largest proven natural gas reserves in Europe, of 3.9 trillion cubic feet, and the fourth-largest
proven crude oil reserves in Europe, of 600 million barrels.11 A significant proportion of gas demand
is met from domestic supplies. However, production of these fuels has been declining.12 Romania
also holds 51 trillion cubic feet of technically-recoverable shale gas resources, and there are plans to
develop the domestic shale gas industry.13 However, these plans remain uncertain because of public
concerns regarding related environmental issues and perceived potentially high costs of production.

Currently, all imported natural gas comes from Russia and is delivered via Ukraine. Romania is explor-
ing the possibility of diversifying and importing natural gas from other producers (mainly, Azerbaijan)
and is discussing various transport options. Importing LNG (liquefied natural gas) is also a possibil-
ity, depending on how global LNG prices evolve over time. Romania’s total hard coal (anthracite)
resources are estimated at near 2,500 million tons, of which about 11 million tons are commercially
exploitable reserves. Lignite resources amount to 9,640 million tons, including reserves of 280 million
tons.14

Romania has achieved significant progress in reforming energy sector pricing in recent years. One
achievement is completing regulatory reform related to non-residential electricity and gas prices in
January 2014 and January 2015, respectively. Resulting gas price increases for industry have contrib-
uted to a significant reduction in gas consumption. While regulatory reform for residential electricity
prices has made progress, the process stalled in mid-2014. Pricing of district heat is the second
remaining pricing issue in the energy sector. Heat prices are defined by the regulator, and municipal-
ities can either charge these prices to the consumers or reduce them through subsidies from local
budgets. However, non-payment of subsidies by municipalities is common. (A law allowing the Min-
istry of Public Finance to deduct non-payments from the municipalities’ allocation of central transfers
was enacted in 2011 but proved politically unfeasible to implement.)

Romania has also undertaken important reforms that promote good governance, managerial
and operational efficiency, and financial improvements in the power and gas sectors. Following
restructuring and privatization measures taken during the previous decade, several measures were
implemented in recent years: the Government Emergency Ordinance on State-Owned Enterprise
Governance in 2011, a new Electricity and Gas Law and new regulator (Autoritatea Nat             ˘ de
                                                                                           ¸ionala
Reglementare în domeniul Energiei, the National Energy Regulatory Authority, ANRE) in 2012, initial
public offerings of shares of Nuclearelectrica, Romgaz and Electrica and secondary public offerings
of the shares of Transelectrica and Transgaz during 2012–14, as well as mandatory competitive elec-
tricity trade by the generators through OPCOM (Operatorul Piet                          ˘s
                                                                 ¸ei de Energie Electrica ¸i de Gaze
Natural din România, the Romanian gas and electricity market operator).

Romania’s support mechanism for renewable energy was implemented, but later scaled back
because it pushed up end-user tariffs. The support mechanism for renewable energy sources estab-
lished in 2008, a Green Certificate System with centralized trading organized by OPCOM, attracted
substantial investment (estimated at €7–8 billion), resulting in construction of approximately 5,200
MW of renewable energy capacity over the next four years and including 3,221 MW of wind, 1,293
MW of solar PV, 586 MW of mini-hydropower, and 102 MW of biomass. Originally-envisioned support
levels were doubled when the support system was approved by the Parliament, making the system
highly attractive to investors but very expensive to electricity consumers, triggering protests. The
energy regulator, ANRE, concluded that the system over-compensated producers and scaled it back
for 2014 and onward.

These measures have put Romania’s coal power-generating companies under operational and
financial stress, depressing their share in total power generation and bringing Romania closer to its
emissions and renewable energy targets. Electricity price liberalization, mandatory use of OPCOM
for trading, and the renewables support scheme, against a backdrop of subdued demand for elec-
tricity following the 2008–2009 crisis, led to a drop in the market share of coal power-generating

companies. In some European electricity markets, most notably in Germany, the increase in renew-
able energy at a time of flat electricity demand has led to a decrease in gas-fired power generation
and the shutdown of gas-fired generating units. In Romania, this impact was softened by the coun-
try’s rising electricity exports, and coal power plants have largely absorbed it, losing competitiveness
against existing hydropower and nuclear power plants,15 but receiving financial support from the
government. As a result of decreased coal power production, Romania now expects to exceed its
EU-mandated renewable energy target of 20 percent renewable energy in gross final energy con-
sumption by 2020.

Challenges

The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to the country’s carbon footprint, responsible
for 58 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs); and the emissions intensity of the econ-
omy significantly exceeds the EU average.16 Romania’s total and per capita emissions have dropped
significantly from their peak in the late 1980s as a co-benefit of structural transformation, a pattern
typical for transition economies, and the growth in the share of non-emitting energy sources.17 Total

15. Use of gas in power is concentrated in municipal power and heating plants.
16. Excluding LULUCF. Energy supply sector emissions are from electricity and heat production, which are the sum of
three IEA categories: (i) emissions from electricity generation, combined heat and power generation, and heat plants
supplying the public (including emissions from own use of fuel in power plants); (ii) emissions from generation of electricity
and/or heat by auto-producers (in whole or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity)
(note that these emissions would more typically be distributed between industry, transport, and “other” sectors and
counted as part of those sectors’ emissions); and (iii) other (including emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refiner-
ies, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries). Data is
from IEA, available at http://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp.
17. Total emissions follows the IEA/IPCC definition and includes emissions from the following sectors: energy (electricity
and heat production and energy sector own use), transport (all transport activity regardless of the economic sector), resi-
dential (fuel combustion in households), and other (commercial/institutional activities, fishing, and emissions not specified
elsewhere).



HOW CAN ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BE TRANSFORMED?                                                                           57
GHG emissions in Romania amounted to 115 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2010, account-
ing for a modest 2.5 percent of total European Union emissions and 0.25 percent of global emissions.
Per capita emissions are also low; however, the emissions intensity of the economy, while dropping
3.3 times from its 1989 level, was still much higher in 2010 than in many other countries: 2.8 times
above the EU level, 2.1 times above the OECD average, and seven percent higher than the world
average.18

The expense of reducing energy sector emissions comes on top of already high investment needs
to address obsolete fossil-based plants and is further augmented by the intermittency of the
renewable plants that are replacing them. Eighty percent of existing fossil fuel-fired generation
plants and 60 percent of the power distribution networks in the country are already old; and retro-
fitting of fossil fuel-fired power plants in the last 20 years has yielded scant returns. Replacing such
massive existing capacity with new capacity is financially challenging. This capacity will be partially
replaced by renewable energy, which creates additional challenges. Expansion of wind and solar is
expensive but also technically difficult. Moreover, since wind and solar are variable resources and
do not provide capacity commitments against peak load, increase in their penetration will require
complementary peak load capacity.

The continued deterioration and decline of district heating systems is particularly wasteful of exist-
ing assets and undermines the quality of life in Romanian cities. Many of the remaining operators
are no longer economically viable because a substantial number of dissatisfied customers have dis-
connected from the systems and chosen alternative heating options. Inefficiency and high losses in
district heating systems also make them among the most costly to operate in the EU. A multi-year
comprehensive program is needed to modernize those district heating systems that are econom-
ically viable: to improve efficiency and service quality on the one hand and to implement sector
reforms to restore district heating company financial sustainability on the other, while ensuring that
subsidies are well targeted to poor households.

Despite substantial progress, Romania still lags significantly behind most EU countries in the
broadest measure of energy efficiency in key end-user sectors. Its energy intensity was 40 percent
higher than the EU average in 2011, by some measures.19 The efficiency gap is most pronounced for
residential space heating where specific heat consumption is one-third higher than EU best prac-
tice. For the two largest industrial energy users, chemicals manufacturing has a value-added energy
intensity over four times higher than the EU average (indicating structural issues), and steel-making
has an energy intensity per ton of steel that is 70 percent higher than the EU average. These three
areas of end-use together account for roughly 40 percent of Romania’s final energy consumption.

Thermal retrofit of residential buildings is both a financial and an implementation challenge. Only
about one percent of the 150 million square meters of apartment buildings which were determined to
be in need of thermal retrofit had been retrofitted as of 2012. Despite very high capital subsidies (of
up to 80 percent) provided by the national and local governments, many low-income households are
still reluctant to participate. Subsidized energy prices create disincentives. In addition, a lack of pos-

Methodology

The analysis summarized in this chapter aims at understanding how energy supply and demand can
contribute to Romania’s current, imminent, and prospective obligations under the EU to reduce
GHG emissions. How would meeting EU and global obligations alter Romania’s overall energy20 and
electricity supply mix over the next 35 years? What would be the costs of meeting these obligations?
The main objective of the analysis is to find best solutions for Romania’s energy supply mix that
would satisfy future energy demand at a minimum cost under the different scenarios that represent
EU mitigation obligations. Complementary to the supply analysis, the possibility of reducing energy
demand in end-use services (such as space heating, lighting, and electrical machines) through energy
efficiency measures in the household, non-residential, and industry sectors is also investigated.

The analysis was undertaken in three steps: demand-side modeling, supply-side modeling, and mar-
ginal abatement cost curve (MACC) analysis.21 Green policy measures were evaluated using three
scenarios: the Baseline scenario, the Green scenario, and the Super Green scenario. The outcomes
of the Green and Super Green scenarios were compared with the outcomes of the Baseline scenario
to assess the cost of green measures and their emissions-reducing impact. For each of the three sce-
narios, demand-side modeling projected the level of overall demand through 2050 and calculated
related emissions. Detailed demand modeling was completed for three end-use sectors—residential,
services, and industrial—and the level of investment needed to implement proposed green demand-
side measures was estimated. Supply-side modeling provided the best solution for the electricity sup-
ply mix at minimum cost for all three scenarios, ensuring that the volume of power supplied should
be sufficient to meet the level of overall demand projected in the demand-side analysis and that the
GHG emissions reduction target should be met.

The supply and demand modeling was linked to macroeconomic modeling and to the marginal
abatement cost analysis. The analysis was implemented in the following sequence (see Figure 3.3):

n Step 1. The macroeconomic model produced projections for basic macroeconomic indicators,
  which are considered the key factors of energy demand: GDP, energy sector value-added, and
  energy prices.22 These projections were used as inputs in the Excel-based model which projected
  energy demand.
n Step 2. The end-use energy demand model used the macroeconomic projections, together with
  other input data, to project Baseline energy demand for four end-use sectors—residential, ser-
  vices, industrial, and transport—for 2015 to 2050. The demand model also estimated potential
  energy efficiency reductions for various end-uses.

20. In this analysis, energy sector includes electricity supply, non-electric energy supply, and end-use sectors (residential,
industry, services/non-residential, and transport). Detailed transport modeling was undertaken separately (see Chapter 4).

analysis.

n	 Step 3. To meet power demand projected in Step 2 and the mitigation targets, the energy
   supply model, TIMES, developed energy supply plans for the Baseline scenario and the Green
   and Super Green scenarios, with consideration of relevant green measures on both the energy
   demand and supply sides. The incremental costs under the green energy supply plans additional
   to Baseline plans were calculated. Also, reductions of GHG emissions under the green scenarios
   were derived.
n	 Step 4. A marginal abatement cost curve was developed for all generation sources included in
   the Green and Super Green scenarios and for selected energy efficiency measures.

Demand Side Modeling

A tool, Energy Service Demand Analysis (ESDA), was developed for demand projections. This
easy-to-implement Excel-based bottom-up framework serves the purpose of estimating long-term
energy sector end-user service demand (see Figure 3.4). It makes use of key demand variables such
as sectoral outputs, household income, and GDP, the projections of which are provided by the mac-
roeconomic model (see Chapter 2). These variables are linked with energy consumption through
parameters such as specific end-use energy consumption, intensity of energy services (e.g., liters of
hot water per person; joules of heat needed per square meter of living area for space heating), and

utilization factors of energy service appliances.23 The demand modeling exercise assessed energy
efficiency options in different end-uses. The energy efficiency analysis was designed to reflect the
EU’s energy and climate strategies, including the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework and
the Roadmap for Moving to a Competitive Low Carbon Economy in 2050 (see Chapter 2 for more
details). Major energy efficiency improvement measures include use of more efficient lighting and
electric appliances, retrofitting buildings with wall, window and roof insulation, and heating and air
conditioning system improvements.

Supply Side Modeling

Starting from the end-use energy demand forecasts, the TIMES energy supply model24 deter-
mined the optimum mix of final energy to meet the end-use energy service demand. To meet pro-
jected final energy demand, TIMES optimizes the energy supply system, accounting for all potential

HOW CAN ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BE TRANSFORMED?                                                                                                     61
resources (such as coal, crude oil, natural gas, and hydropower), production/transformation facilities
(such as electricity generation and district heating) and transportation/transmission/distribution net-
works, satisfying various resource, technical, economic, environmental and other constraints (includ-
ing the size of the plants, their capacity factor, and the need for back-up capacity).

The following characteristics of TIMES are of essence to understanding its functioning:

n	 It is an optimization model. It computes the least cost (optimized) path of an energy system for
   the specified time frame. It aims to supply energy services at minimum global cost (more accu-
   rately, at minimum ‘loss of surplus’) by simultaneously making equipment investment, operating
   primary energy supply, and making energy trade decisions.
n	 It is an equilibrium model. It is important to note that the TIMES energy economy is made up
   of producers and consumers of commodities such as energy carriers, materials, energy services,
   and emissions, and, like most equilibrium models, it assumes competitive markets for all com-
   modities. Thereby, it ensures that there is a supply-demand equilibrium that maximizes net total
   surplus: based on prices, suppliers produce exactly the quantities demanded by consumers in
   each time period.
n	 It uses a scenario approach that consists of a set of assumptions about future demand trajecto-
   ries and their determinants, leading to a coherent organization of an energy system. A scenario
   typically consists of four types of inputs: energy service demands, primary resource potentials, a
   policy setting, and a description of the set of technologies.

The structure of TIMES is defined by the data input provided by the user. Qualitative data include
lists of energy carriers, the technologies that are deemed applicable over a specified time horizon,
as well as the environmental emissions that are to be tracked. Quantitative data contains the techno-
logical and economic parameter assumptions specific to each technology, region, and time period
(see Figure 3.5).

Three scenarios for energy system optimization were considered: a Baseline, a Green scenario,
and a Super Green scenario. The scenarios, consistent with those used for macroeconomic analysis
(see Chapter 2), were defined in the following way:
n	 The Baseline scenario is an extrapolation of the current state of the energy sector including
   already planned or implemented mitigation measures, in particular ongoing implementation of
   the current EU 2020 Climate and Energy Package, which sets an EU-wide target to reduce GHG
   emissions by 21 percent compared to 2005 in energy-intensive sectors, which participate in EU
   emissions trading. However, it does not include broader reforms that the energy supply system
   needs to implement in line with the EU’s long-term plan to reduce carbon emissions.25
n	 The Green scenario models implementation of the proposed EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy
   Framework, which sets overall GHG mitigation at 40 percent compared to 1990 levels. For the
   power sector and other ETS participants, the proposed EU 2030 target corresponds to the reduc-
   tion of GHG emissions of 43 percent for the EU as a whole compared to 2005.



25.  Emissions reduction here are generally cited against 2005 because that is the year EU emissions trading was estab-
lished; thus, all practical rules and targets are formulated against 2005. 1990 is cited in the original broad policy state-
ments because it is the EU’s base year for the Kyoto Protocol and other international obligations.

   itive Low Carbon Economy in 2050 which aims for the EU to reduce GHG emissions by at least
   80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, to a large extent by almost total decarbonisation of the

Marginal Abatement Cost Analysis

A marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for electricity supply and energy efficiency is estimated
in addition to the demand and supply modeling. The measures examined are presented accord-
ing to two parameters of the MACC: potential mitigation impact (kilotons of CO2, carbon dioxide
equivalent, abated) and the unit cost of abatement (cost per metric ton of CO2e abated). The MACC
calculations for energy demand measures applied the ESDA model and include only end-use energy
efficiency measures for the household sector, as these measures bring the most immediate and
effective results. The MACC calculations for electricity supply used the TIMES model but included
all green power technologies available for development in Romania: solar, hydropower, wind, bio-
mass, natural gas plants with installed carbon capture and storage (CCS, nuclear). The TIMES model

constructed the best (minimum cost) mix of generation sources to achieve a desired abatement level
in eight different cases, corresponding to the eight green generation technologies. The abatement
level was set as a constraint, and each scenario maximized generation from one out of the eight
generation sources, within the constraints of the model. For example, in one case, solar PV was set
to be maximized in the electricity supply system, and the rest of the generation technologies were
selected by the model. The model also calculated the cost of such a system and the cost of the base-
line system. The difference between these two costs constituted the marginal cost, which was then
converted into net present value.

Findings

This section presents the main finding of modeling. It aims to demonstrate the impact of green mea-
sures on sector outcomes by comparing the trends in sector development under the three scenar-
ios: Baseline, Green, and Super Green. The sector outcomes include projections of primary energy
supply, the structure of electricity generation capacity, and electricity generation mixes, required
investment and total costs (investment and operations and maintenance), and the level of emissions.

Primary Energy Supply

Under the Baseline scenario, Romania’s total primary energy supply in 2050 is projected to increase
by almost half from 2015 levels, from about 38,000 ktoe (kilotons of oil equivalent) to about 57,000
ktoe. The structure of primary energy supply reflects only a moderate increase in the share of cleaner
energy sources. The share of renewable energy (hydropower, wind and solar PV) increases from 17
percent in 2015 to 22 percent in 2050. While oil and natural gas continue to be the most important
sources of primary energy, the contribution of gas to the mix increases and the share of oil decreases
over time: oil’s share in the Baseline scenario drops slightly from 29 percent in 2015 to 26 percent in
2050, while the share of gas increases by eight percentage point, from 22 percent in 2015 to 30 per-
cent in 2050. The share of coal drops from 16 percent in 2015 to eight percent in 2050 in the Baseline.
The share of biomass remains at nine percent. (See Figure 3.6).

Moving further towards a greener energy system, the Green scenario contains further expansion
of renewable and non-fossil energy supply and contraction of fossil energy supply. In the Green
scenario, the share of renewables (hydropower, wind and solar PV) in 2050 is higher than in the Base-
line: in 2050, it equals 24 percent or two percentage points higher than in the Baseline. The share of
biomass is three percentage points higher in the Green scenario than in the Baseline in 2050. The
reverse happens with natural gas: its share in 2050 in the Green scenario is 19 percent or five percent-
age points lower than in the Baseline. (See Figure 3.6).

The Super Green scenario assumes that GHG emissions from power generation are eliminated
along with a significant reduction of non-power sector energy emissions—requiring much more
aggressive measures than in the Green scenario. While the share of renewables stays at the same
level as in the Green scenario, the share of biomass is higher (22 percent) and the share of gas is
lower (15 percent). Coal almost disappears from the mix, falling to two percent. Also, nuclear energy
increases to nine percent of the total (from six percent in the Green and five percent in the Baseline
scenarios). (See Figure 3.6).

Electricity Capacity

To meet increasing demand in the face of predicted rising prices for emissions allowances under
the ETS in the Baseline scenario, total installed capacity for power generation is projected to
increase from 23 gigawatts (GW) in 2015 to 30 GW by 2050—an expansion of 29 percent. This
increase will be largely covered by new wind, hydropower, solar PV, and also gas capacities, which
replace coal and oil sources in the mix. From 2015 to 2050, oil declines from two GW to 0.2 GW
(from seven percent to one percent of total capacity), and coal from seven GW to one GW (from 30
percent to four percent of total capacity). The share of wind and solar PV will increase tremendously:
together they constitute four GW in 2015 and 12 GW in 2050. Nuclear capacity is unchanged: Roma-
nia’s two nuclear power plants, Cernavado Plants 1 and 2, currently account for about six percent of
the country’s total installed capacity, and there will be no installation of new nuclear capacity under
the Baseline through 2050.

The higher share of intermittent or variable generation resources (wind and solar) creates a challenge
for load balancing. The Baseline scenario would have ten GW of new wind and solar capacities over
the next 35 years. This high penetration of variable generating sources creates a challenge in balancing
generation and load. To meet peak load, installed capacity should also have sources that provide con-
stant, non-variable, generation (e.g. coal, gas, and nuclear). At present, Romania has a ratio of 23 GW
of installed capacity versus 10 GW of peak load. Adding more variable sources would require a higher
ratio of total installed capacity to peak load, because the risk of insufficient generation for peak load
increases faster than the growth in the share of intermittent sources. However, because non-variable
generation involves economies of scale, electricity generation from all non-variable sources will not be
fully utilized domestically. Exporting the excess generation could be a solution.

The need for zero-emission sources for power generation is higher in the Green and much higher
in the Super Green scenario than in the Baseline. Fossil fuel-based generation resources (i.e., coal,
gas) decrease in the Green scenario and are almost completely eliminated by 2050 under the Super
Green scenario. On the other hand, nuclear power capacity increases by one GW in the Green and
three GW in the Super Green scenario, as compared with the Baseline, providing base load capacity
needed to back up the increase in variable generation. As a result, the share of nuclear in the 2050
capacity mix increases from five percent in the Baseline to 13 percent in the Green and 15 percent

in the Super Green scenario. Wind, solar PV, and hydropower have approximately the same capacity
level across scenarios in 2050. Biomass is not part of the capacity mix in the Baseline but is present in
both the Green and Super Green scenarios at a level of one GW. (See Figure 3.7).

Energy efficiency measures on the demand side can significantly contribute to lowering the capac-
ity needed for electricity generation. Large-scale energy efficiency improvements on the demand
side (in energy end-use sectors such as the residential and commercial sectors) are considered in
the Green and Super Green scenarios. Major energy efficiency improvement measures include use
of more efficient lighting and electric appliances; retrofitting buildings with wall, window and roof
insulation; heating system improvements in residential, commercial and public buildings; and use
of efficient electric motors and thermal energy equipment in industry. The implementation of such
measures leads to a projected 26 percent reduction of residential sector energy consumption by
2050 from that in the absence of these measures. The energy efficiency measures in non-residential
buildings (e.g., more energy efficient space heating and space cooling) result in a 30 percent reduc-
tion in service sector energy demand. In the case of the industrial sector, the introduction of more
energy-efficient technologies, especially electric motors and boilers, leads to a 16 percent reduction
in industrial sector energy consumption. If the energy efficiency measures considered in the analysis
are implemented successfully, it would save three GW and four GW of installed capacity under the
Green and Super Green scenarios respectively (see Figure 3.7). The impact of the energy efficiency
measures is also clearly visible in the demand for new generation capacity; addition of new capaci-
ties under the Green and Super Green scenarios would be two and one GW lower as compared to
that under the Baseline scenario (see Figure 3.8).

The new installed capacity (constructed during 2015–2050) consists of wind, solar PV, hydropower,
natural gas, biomass, and nuclear. The structure of new capacity differs by scenario. Only wind and
hydropower play the same role (in terms of capacity level) in all three scenarios: wind capacity exceeds

six GW26 and hydropower capacity amounts to three GW. The new hydropower capacity is assumed
to operate at a very low capacity factor of 34 percent, thereby incorporating any adverse potential cli-
mate change impacts on catchment areas and run-off.27 Solar PV has importance in all scenarios but to
a differing extent: capacity is higher in the Green and Super Green scenarios (with three GW in each)
but just two GW in the Baseline. Nuclear capacity of three GW would be added in the Super Green
scenario while natural gas capacity is built under the Baseline (four GW) and Green scenarios (two GW).
Under the Super Green scenario, no fossil fuel plants, old or new, will exist by 2040; and in this scenario,
the power sector in Romania would be emissions-free by 2050. (See Figures 3.8 and 3.9).

Electricity Generation

The electricity generation mix changes significantly across scenarios. While the share of non-
fossil fuel based electricity generation equals near 60 percent under the Baseline in 2050, it exceeds
85 percent under the Green scenario and reaches 100 percent under the Super Green scenario.
Under the Green and Super Green scenarios, electricity generation from fossil fuel-based sources
decreases rapidly. For example, there would be no electricity generation from coal, gas, or oil by
2040 under the Super Green scenario. Electricity generation from nuclear power generation facilities
under the Green and Super Green scenarios would be almost three times as high as that of the Base-
line scenario. The impact of demand side energy efficiency measures on saving electricity generation
is significant. If the demand-side energy efficiency measures are implemented successfully, the need
for electricity generation would be reduced by 20 and 11 percent in the Green and Super Green sce-
narios respectively. The lower reduction in generation under the Super Green scenario as compared
to the Green scenario is explained by the Super Green scenario’s mitigation target (almost complete

elimination of power sector emissions) and the consequent high level of renewable (variable) power
sources in this scenario. The higher share of variable sources of generation requires a higher ratio of
total installed capacity to peak load to avoid the risk of insufficient generation for peak hours. This
pushes up baseload capacity, which is almost fully limited to nuclear, and, as a result, nuclear gener-
ation has a much bigger presence in the Super Green scenario. (See Figure 3.10).

Despite the focus on the electricity portion of the energy sector, because of its critical role in
energy sector mitigation, other parts of the energy sector were also considered. Heating, oil refin-
eries, and households as providers of energy services for own use were reviewed. This analysis found
that demand for space heating is likely to grow in the future despite energy efficiency improve-
ments, due to increasing residential and office space. Currently, heat is produced mainly by com-
bined heat and power plants that use natural gas or biomass. Modelling demonstrated that final
demand for heat increases by 20–23 percent in 2050 compared to 2015 if energy efficiency measures
are not implemented. However, with the implementation of energy efficiency measures, the situation
reverses: heat demand decreases by 10–14 percent in 2050 from the 2015 level. While natural gas
remains the main fuel source in heat production during 2015–50 in all scenarios (because there is no
obvious alternative source), mitigation is achieved by improved (cleaner) technologies used for heat
production and the decentralization of the heating sector.

operational costs) over 2015–2050 will total an estimated €336 billion (in present value),29 but would
decrease to €326 billion in the Green scenario due to implementation of energy efficiency measures
on the demand side. Total energy supply costs under the Super Green scenario are projected to
increase further, to €356 billion, as the reduced operational costs from energy efficiency implemen-
tation is offset by expensive new nuclear power and CCS-equipped gas plants for power generation.
Energy efficiency measures that reduce energy demand and thereby lower required energy supply
require additional investment of €19 billion over the 2015–2050 period (or about 0.6 average annual
percent of GDP) but save €29 billion in fuel and operational costs on the supply side.

Energy sector investment costs are the biggest contributor to total costs, and the Super Green
scenario has especially heavy additional investment needs. Romania is facing a substantial replace-
ment of existing coal-based power plants by gas and renewable energy-based power generation:
existing fossil-based plants are quickly becoming obsolete, and the switch to lower emissions sup-
ply is present even in the Baseline. In the Baseline, the retirement of coal and lignite plants hap-
pens mostly early on: 1.5 GW of coal capacity retires by 2025, an additional 3.7 GW by 2035, and
another 0.3 GW by 2040. Since the costs of replacing these plants arrive relatively soon, their dis-
counted value is higher. In addition, other plants retire over the years: overall, the Baseline involves
newly-built capacity of 17 GW, while Green includes 15 GW of new plant capacity (with demand
contained by energy efficiency measures). Therefore, the incremental (to Baseline) cost under the
Green scenario is not significant, because the heaviest financial burden is already imposed in the
Baseline. The incremental cost of the Super Green scenario as compared to the Green scenario is
high because less-expensive generation sources are replaced by more expensive ones (in particular,

social discount rates range from 4 to 6 percent).



HOW CAN ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BE TRANSFORMED?                                                                        69
three GW of nuclear are built in the Super Green while only one GW is built in the Green scenario),
and this happens earlier, increasing the discounted costs. Also, the Super Green scenario requires
more generation than the Green, pushing up capital, fuel, and operations and maintenance costs.

The electricity system will require €28 billion in investment costs in the Baseline during 2015–2050
to meet demand or about 0.8 percent of GDP on average. Required investment increases to €37
billion (present value) in the Green and to €54 billion in the Super Green scenario, or 1.1 and 1.7 per-
cent of GDP through 2050 respectively. The additional costs of the green scenarios above baseline
costs come partly from investment in energy efficiency measures that contain the growth of demand
for electricity (costing eight billion euros). In addition, the Super Green scenario almost eliminates
power sector emissions by 2050, and this is costly: almost all fossil plants are replaced by 2050 by
more capital-intensive renewable energy-based generation. As a result, investment needs in the
power sector double from the level needed in the Baseline.

Investment needs for the electricity sector are substantial in all cases but rise significantly as
requirements for emissions reduction tighten. Until 2020, investment needs in electricity supply and
demand total about seven billion euros (present value) in the Baseline to over nine billion euros in
the green scenarios. In all three scenarios, the burden of investment rises over time, with 40–45 per-
cent of the total falling due in the last decade of 2040–2050, partly because most of the fossil-based
plants retire at that time. In the Green scenario, new wind, solar PV, nuclear, hydropower, and gas is
added, and coal and oil-based generation almost disappears by 2050. In the Super Green scenario,
new electricity generation from renewable sources and nuclear sufficient to eliminate electricity gen-
eration from coal-based sources by 2030 is constructed. Nuclear plant investment after 2030 further
contributes to high investment costs in the Green and Super Green scenarios. Energy efficiency mea-
sures require significant and rising investments of their own. For both these categories, financing will
come from the private sector, although the public sector may need to establish programs of support
for energy efficiency, with some financing available from the European Union (See Table 3.1).

Emissions: Energy Sector and Electricity Sector30

Romania’s energy sector GHG emissions return to near the 2005 level by 2050 under the Baseline
scenario, but the green scenarios secure dramatically lower levels. In the Baseline scenario, 2030
emissions stand nine percent lower than 2005 emissions while 2050 emissions are just two percent
below 2005. Emissions in the Green scenario are about 25 percent below 2005 by 2030 and hold
steady through 2050, while the Super Green scenario pushes energy sector emissions to almost
half of 2005 by 2030, and they rise only slightly by 2050. While the absolute level of emissions in all
three scenarios decreases throughout 2015–2050, the pace of emissions reduction exhibits different
trends across scenarios. It decreases steadily in the Baseline scenario because growing demand
is not restrained in the Baseline and because of only moderate action toward the replacement of
fossil fuels with renewable energy. When more aggressive actions on energy efficiency and lower-
ing carbon are taken in the Green scenario and when more aggressive replacement of fossil fuels is
implemented in the Super Green scenario, the pattern of emissions reduction changes. In these two
scenarios, during 2015 to 2020/2025, the pace of emissions reduction slows because many of the
measures that have been taken require time for implementation (e.g., electricity plant construction).

end-users).

After this phase, the pace of emissions reduction increases through 2030 or so and then holds steady.
(See Figure 3.11).

The electricity sector experiences a large reduction of emissions in all scenarios over time, and the
pace of reduction increases in all three scenarios in later years. This pattern emerges in the green
scenarios due to a combination of aggressively implemented energy efficiency measures that signifi-
cantly constrain demand growth and as a result of aggressive actions on the supply side—an increase
in the share of non-fossil sources of electricity. In the Baseline scenario, emissions in 2030 are 20 per-
cent below 2005 and 36 percent below 2005 in 2050, while the respective outcomes in the Green sce-
nario are 45 percent in 2030 and 72 percent in 2050. The biggest reduction is in the Super Green sce-
nario: 92 percent emissions reduction in 2030 and 97 percent in 2050. In this scenario, the electricity
sector almost completely eliminates emissions. Both the absolute level of emissions and the pace of
its drop increase in all three scenarios throughout 2015–2050, although the pace of emissions reduc-
tion initially slows while the measures are in the process of implementation during 2015–2020/2025, a
typical delay in outcomes when measures require time for implementation. (See Figure 3.12).

Marginal Abatement Cost Curve

The marginal abatement cost curve shows that the proposed measures provide significant poten-
tial abatement, totaling near 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2050
under the Super Green scenario. The demand side measures mostly have negative net costs (pos-
itive benefits), and when applied on a large scale, they will deliver a significant level of mitigation.
Therefore, they are the first candidates for implementation. Then, the most cost-efficient electricity
supply options are solar PV and wind, followed by hydropower, biomass and nuclear. Gas with CCS
would require higher expenses reaching €20 per tCO2e abated. Of the almost 12.5 million tons in
abatement deliverable by energy demand measures, the highest abatement potential is residential
building insulation, followed by efficient lighting by households. In electricity supply, delivering a
total of about 17 million tons, the highest abatement can be achieved from the development of elec-
tricity generation using natural gas plants with installed carbon capture and storage (gas with CCS).
Among renewable energy options, the highest abatement potential is in wind, followed by biomass,
and then solar PV. (See Figure 3.13).


CONCLuSiONS AND reCOMMeNDATiONS

Romania can meet the mitigation obligations likely under the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy
Framework at moderate costs. With an energy sector responsible for almost 60 percent of total
GHG emissions, Romania clearly cannot achieve climate change mitigation targets beyond those
of the current EU 2020 policy without significant action in the energy sector. The Green scenario
compels substantial emissions reduction in the power sector which requires moderate incremental
investment as compared with the Baseline. The Green scenario will achieve 45 percent emissions
reduction by 2030 (and 72 percent reduction by 2050) as compared with 2005. The investment cost
of the Green power sector scenario through 2050 is €37 billion (present value),31 equal to an annual
average 1.1 percent of GDP through 2050.

The prospective requirements of the EU 2050 Roadmap, which entail at least 80 percent reduction
in emissions and the virtual elimination of emissions from the power sector, are both expensive and
challenging to implement. The Super Green power sector scenario will provide 92 percent emissions
reduction between 2005 and 2030 and 97 percent reduction by 2050, achieving an almost complete
elimination of emissions from power. This scenario also delivers abatement on a faster schedule than
the Green scenario. The investment cost of the Super Green scenario to 2050 is €54 billion (present
value) or an average annual of 1.7 percent of GDP.

Implementation of the same set of aggressive energy efficiency measures is a key part of the
Green and the Super Green scenarios, as these measures deliver low cost abatement in the short
term, require moderate upfront investment, and have modest implementation barriers. Improving
energy efficiency across the board in all economic sectors, but especially in residential and non-
residential sectors, offers the most effective and also viable means for containing the growth of

energy demand, limiting investment requirements to meet the growing demand, and reducing GHG
emissions. Beyond the climate agenda, improving energy efficiency is also critical for Romania’s
competitiveness in the European Union. While the energy intensity of Romania’s economy has been
decreasing for the past two decades, it is still one of the highest in the EU, and greater efficiency will
go hand in hand with modernized and more competitive companies and sectors.

A lower carbon path for Romania’s energy sector imposes significant costs and complex planning
challenges on the sector, in particular on power generation. Achieving emissions reduction targets
beyond the EU 2020 targets—the Green (likely EU 2030 targets) and the Super Green (possible EU
2050 targets)—will require Romania to abandon plans for new coal-based power generation capacity
and life-extension of existing plants. It will also require significant additional renewable generation
capacity and, therefore, a regulatory environment that would promote it.

While this assessment included a set of generally-agreed technologies at costs based on today’s
best analysis, both technologies and costs will surely evolve, and updated analysis will be needed.
The TIMES supply model and the Energy Service Demand Analysis tool constructed for this analysis
remain available for further development and application by the government for current and future
policy questions related to the energy sector, in particular questions related to low carbon. The
Ministry of Energy has already taken on these models to apply to critical questions in support of the
country’s new energy strategy. The usefulness of such tools and models will only increase into the
future as Romania begins to take a more active role in contributing to EU climate and energy policy,
as well as implementing it.

At the same time, it should be noted that the energy sector in Romania has the potential to
become an engine of economic growth. Romania’s endowment of energy resources is significant
and diversified well beyond coal, including hydropower and other renewable resources, natural gas,
and even uranium to fuel its nuclear power industry. Romania has the potential to satisfy its own
needs and export electricity and gas into the regional and European energy markets (even without
the use of coal), to energize the economy and create jobs and prosperity.

While long-term sector development to 2030 and 2050—the subject of this assessment—is impor-
tant, the government cannot be distracted from critical near-term sector reforms. Implementation
of the energy reform program jointly supported by the European Commission, the International
Monetary Fund, and the World Bank should continue. The measures recommended here under
the Green and the Super Green scenarios to allow Romania to meet various GHG mitigation obli-
gations require long-term implementation. In the short-term, it is critical that the sector continues
with current reform efforts, many of which lay down essential conditions for the success of the long-
term green transition. These reforms include completion of the ongoing liberalization of residential
electricity and gas prices; adoption and implementation of the Minimum Social Insertion Program (a
social safety net which inter alia will help secure access of low income households to basic energy ser-

these measures are key for Romania’s achievement of emissions reduction targets.

Greening of the energy sector implies substantial costs, which rise significantly over time and as
requirements for emissions reduction tighten, but a lower-carbon energy sector needs to be part
of Romania’s long-term planning. Careful modeling of the power sector provides a detailed assess-
ment of low carbon possibilities. A need for 30 percent more installed power capacity between
now and 2050, along with existing mitigation obligations, push even Baseline investment costs to a
very high level of €28 billion through 2050 or an average annual 0.8 percent of GDP. Lower carbon
scenarios economize on supply costs by pushing energy efficiency to contain demand and achieve
significant mitigation: in 2030, emissions are 31 percentage points and 94 percentage points below
Baseline in the Green and the Super Green scenarios respectively; while by 2050, emissions are
56 percent below the Baseline in the Green scenario and almost completely eliminated in the Super
Green. This is achieved with additional costs during 2015–2050 in the Green scenario (costs above
Baseline) of about nine billion euros and in the Super Green scenario of about €26 billion. Until 2020,
investment needs in electricity supply and demand total about seven billion euros in the Baseline
and just over nine billion euros in the green scenarios. These costs jump after 2030, as remaining
fossil-based plants are replaced with renewable and nuclear capacity and aggressive energy effi-
ciency actions continue. Financing for these investments, whether power generation or energy
efficiency, will be the responsibility of the private sector, although the public sector may need to
establish programs of support for energy efficiency, with some financing available from the European
Union.

How Can the Pace of Emissions Growth

CHAPTER SUMMARY



     n Eastern Europe including Romania, the transport sector is characterized by fast-increasing
     emissions, and controlling the pace of this growth, much less reversing it, is challenging.
     Transport is the second biggest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting sector in the European Union
     (EU), following the energy sector, and is responsible for 29 percent of total EU emissions. How-
ever, EU transport emissions have been falling since 2007. By contrast, in Eastern Europe including
Romania, transport emissions continue growing at a fast pace, driven by increasing car ownership
and usage and a high-emission old vehicle fleet. In Romania, road transport (mainly cars) is the source
of over 90 percent of transport emissions (while the EU average is about 70 percent); increasing car
transportation is pushing out other modes of road transport; and the usage of non-road transport
has decreased. Vehicle usage and emissions-intensity of vehicles have been subject to mitigation
policies; however, more efforts are needed. Decoupling transport sector emissions from economic
growth is a key challenge. Promoting local co-benefits, such as the improvement of local air quality,
and reduction of congestion, noise, and traffic accidents, is a critical element to secure significant
progress in transport sector mitigation.

The objective of the analysis was to assess the impact of green policies and investments on trans-
port emissions. For this purpose, a strategic mitigation model—the Transport Strategic Emission
Prediction Tool (TRANSEPT)—was developed for Romania. TRANSEPT is a bottom-up, detailed
engineering model. The baseline scenario in modeling was based on Romania’s General Transport
Master Plan and is consistent with the baseline in the European Commission (EC) “Trends to 2050”
model. Apart from modeling, the assessment involved a non-quantitative evaluation of the barriers
to implementation and the externalities of each green measure. The costs of the green measures
have been estimated using international case study evidence and adjusted to the Romanian context.
Marginal abatement cost (MAC) analysis was conducted to assess cost effectiveness and abatement
potential of the measures and to illustrate their benefits relative to each other in a form useful for
policy discussions.

The findings show that selected green interventions in Romania lead to a significant reduction of
GHG emissions as compared with the baseline scenario and to a decoupling of transport sector
emissions growth from economic growth, thus achieving a highly challenging goal of transport
sector mitigation. The proposed mitigation action plan recommends fuel pricing policies, taxation
of new vehicles based on emission standards, parking pricing measures and tightened parking regu-
lation and enforcement, an efficient public transport system and walking and cycling facilities, and
eco-driving campaigns. Investment in infrastructure is key for a shift from cars to public transport.
Institutional arrangements are critical. Financing needs for the recommended measures increase
from the Green to the Super Green scenarios. Additional investments total €135 million over
2015–50 in the Green scenario, but almost €1.7 billion in the Super Green scenario. Most of the costs
are incurred in the first fifteen years, during 2015–30. In the first five years, 2015–2020, the recom-
mended transport measures will cost just above €60 million in the Green scenario but approximately
€608 under the Super Green scenario.


CHALLENGES FOR GREEN GROWTH

Overview

Transport is the second biggest GHG-emitting sector in the European Union, following the energy
sector, and responsible for 29 percent of total EU emissions; however, emissions from transport
have been falling since 2007. While GHG emissions from other sectors have been on a generally
downward trend since 1990, transport in the EU experienced rising emissions through 2007. Despite
the subsequent downward trend, EU transport emissions are still above their 1990 level. EU transport
emissions are dominated by road transport which is responsible for 72 percent of transport’s total.
The next largest transport contributors—aviation and maritime transport—produce 13 percent and
14 percent respectively. The EU has policies in place to reduce emissions from transport: aviation is

required to acquire emissions allowances through the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and
the rest of transport is included in the EU’s national targets for emissions reduction for sectors out-
side the ETS.1

In Eastern Europe including Romania, transport emissions continue growing at a fast rate, driven
by increasing car ownership and usage and a high-emissions, aged vehicle fleet. East European
countries are moving toward the EU’s motorization level for passenger transport. Increasing incomes
have made it possible for more households to own cars and also to move to the suburbs, the latter
leading to falling land-use densities in many urban areas. Urban sprawl has pushed up the costs of
public transportation and, in many cases, made it financially non-viable. In turn, reduced availability
of public transport has exacerbated car usage: significantly more cars are on the roads, and the num-
ber and lengths of car trips have been increasing. Also, East European countries have a large share
of older vehicles, with higher emissions per kilometer driven. In freight transport, while a number of
East European countries had relatively high rail use before 1990, rail’s modal share has been declin-
ing, pushing up motorization rates for freight.

Policies aimed at mitigation will be needed to control the growth in transport emissions in Roma-
nia. All these continuing processes mean that transport sector emissions in East European countries
including Romania have been growing fast and will still grow in the near future. However, with trans-
port sector policies aimed at mitigation2, such growth can be reduced. Currently, the transport sector
accounts for 13 percent of Romania’s total GHG emissions, still significantly below the EU average of
25 percent.3 However, from 1990 to 2012, the transport sector’s share in total emissions increased by
78 percent in Romania and only by 10 percent in the EU. Considering this trend, which is expected to
continue with rising incomes and Romania’s overall convergence with the EU, EU levels of transport
emissions will be reached soon (see Figure 4.1).

Road transport, mainly by car, is the source of 91 percent of transport emissions in Romania today,
while the respective EU average is 72 percent. While Romania has been experiencing rapid growth
in motorization, from 152 passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants in 2006 to 224 in 2012, its current rate
is still the lowest in the EU and significantly below other EU new member states. Lithuania’s rate is
130 percent higher, and Romania’s closest neighbor, Bulgaria, exceeds Romania’s rate by 72 per-
cent (see Figure 4.2). Car ownership is projected to continue its growth, with the motorization rate
exceeding 350 cars per 1,000 inhabitants by 2030, an increase of over 50 percent during 2012 to 2030.
At the same time, Romania’s share of cars in total transport already equals the EU average. Together,
these trends mean that when car ownership in Romania reaches EU levels, car usage (and related
emissions) will exceed that of the EU, unless other modes of transportation develop.

Increased car use has been crowding out other modes of road transport for passengers, and the
shift from rail to road is also evident for freight. During the last two decades, Romania experienced
a marked increase in the share of road passenger transport and a significant decrease in the share of
rail. Within road transport, the share of buses, trolley buses, and coaches has been dropping since

1. See Box 1 in Chapter 2 for details about EU mitigation policies. Aviation transport is partly included in the ETS for
2013–16: flights within Europe must secure emissions allowances. The International Civil Aviation Organization has agreed
to develop a global market-based mechanism to address international aviation emissions by 2016 and to apply it by 2020.

sions regulated by the Kyoto Protocol and relevant for transport (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide).

2008. Figure 4.3 shows the modal split for passenger transport between the three main land-based
modes of domestic travel—private car, rail, and bus/trolleybus/coach. Between 2000 and 2013, the
mode share of passenger cars has increased by 15 percent, reaching 82 percent of the total, equal
to the EU average. In the same period, the mode share of passenger rail shrunk by almost three-
quarters from 16 percent to five percent, below the EU’s eight percent average. The share of buses/
trolleybuses/coaches fluctuated during the period but was at approximately the same level in 2000
(12 percent) as in 2013 (13 percent), exceeding the EU average of 9 percent (2013). Furthermore, the
modal split for freight movements has experienced similar trends (although to a lesser extent).4 The
mode share of rail freight has declined in terms of percentage of ton-km travelled, although it is still
higher than the EU average; while road freight has increased its share. The decline in rail and the shift
to road in both the passenger and freight segments can be attributed not only to increased demand
for road transportation but also to underinvestment and poor maintenance of the Romanian railway
system, resulting in slow and unreliable train services.5

Non-land transportation—maritime and civil aviation—currently contribute little to overall emis-
sions in Romania’s transport sector. Emissions from maritime transport constitute just over one
percent of overall transport emissions in Romania, compared to 14 percent in the EU; and emis-
sions from civil aviation produce less than four percent of Romania’s transport total, compared to

13 percent in the EU. Domestic air passenger transport activity (within Romania) forms a small share
(seven percent) of total passenger movements through Romanian airports, which is relatively low
compared to other EU countries: the EU-27 average is 18 percent. It has slightly increased in recent
years (see Figure 4.4). Passengers flying to and from other EU countries form the great majority of
all passengers using Romanian airports, equaling 81 percent, while those flying to and from destina-
tions outside of the EU form the remaining 12 percent of the total. Civil aviation activity is projected
to increase in the future.

Vehicle usage and the emissions intensity of vehicles—the major emission drivers in Romania—
have been subject to mitigation policies; however, there is more to be done. Policy instruments
used include fuel taxation, vehicle scrappage schemes, parking pricing, and new vehicle registration
taxes. While fuel taxes have been increasing, gasoline and diesel prices remain significantly below
the EU average (see Figure 4.5). Parking fees in Bucharest are low compared to other East European
capitals (see Figure 4.6). A policy of higher prices for parking—especially when mass transit public
transport is available—can be an efficient mechanism to discourage the use of private vehicles. A
vehicle scrappage scheme, known as the ‘Rabla’ (clunkers), has been in place in Romania since 2005.
Approximately 500,000 ageing and high-polluting vehicles have been scrapped, and the purchase
of around 250,000 more efficient vehicles has been subsidized. Uptake of the scrappage scheme
peaked in 2010, with almost 190,000 cars scrapped, and has since fallen to much lower levels. Roma-
nia has introduced another pricing mechanism to change the age and emissions intensity of the vehi-
cle fleet­
         —an “Environment Stamp” tax on new vehicle registrations. The broad regulatory frame-
work has been in place since 2013, with flexibility to adjust rates to encourage uptake of greener
vehicle technology.

In addition to pricing measures, Romania has also
implemented regulations to control emissions from
urban road transport, including traffic manage-
ment and restrictions on urban access and speed.
The Bucharest Urban Traffic Control Center intro-
duced an adaptive urban traffic control and public
transport management system, which is estimated
to have reduced travel times (and, therefore, con-
gestion and resulting emissions) by 20 percent and
achieved a 10 percent reduction in CO2 in the area.6
Bucharest has access restrictions that ban vehicles
over five metric tons from the central area of Bucha-
rest at certain times and require them to have a per-
mit to enter at other times. Romania’s speed limits
for cars and motorcycles are currently set at 130 km
per hour on motorways, 110 km per hour on express-
ways, and 90 km per hour on other non-urban roads;
trucks and buses are limited to 110 km per hour,
90 km per hour and 80 km per hour respectively.7

Given the growth in vehicle ownership and road transport, decoupling transport sector GHG emis-
sions from economic growth represents a key challenge and will require departure from business-
as-usual policies in the transport sector. The main challenge the transport sector faces is how to
reduce the system’s dependence on oil, limit GHG emissions, and minimize externalities, without
compromising efficiency, mobility and economic growth. Economic growth and GHG emissions from
the transport sector in Romania have moved in parallel to date (see Figure 4.7). During 2000­–2012,
GHG emissions rose by 54 percent while real GDP rose by 55 percent. The challenge is to decouple
transport sector emissions from growth by channeling transport demand into low-emissions trans-
portation modes and increasing the share of low emission vehicles.8,9

Maximizing local co-benefits is key to transport sector mitigation since such benefits are frequently
needed to offset the relatively high costs of transport mitigation policies or investments. Local
co-benefits—such as reduced traffic congestion and noise, improved air quality and road safety, or
enhanced energy security—are important objectives of transport policies that can complement miti-
gation action. The World Bank’s recent transport climate change strategy advocates for the impor-
tant role of the local social costs of transport in designing GHG emissions reduction for the sector.

Not only do such combined concerns render climate-friendly transport actions more attractive to
policy makers and the public, but aiming at multiple objectives with a single set of policies, in this
case, can reduce significantly the net costs to Romania. For example, congestion levels in a city
such as Bucharest and the city’s trends toward increased motorization constitute as much a classic
problem of transport and urban planning as a GHG emissions challenge. Attacking congestion and
emissions together generates significant co-benefits that are also powerful in motivating support for
improved transport policies, which simultaneously can be GHG-friendly policies.

Road transport mitigation is most challenging as it produces over 90 percent of transport sector
emissions in Romania and, with rising motorization, will grow in the future unless policies change.
Inefficiencies of the road transport sector can be grouped into the following three types: pricing inef-
ficiencies, fuel-inefficient technology, and those that follow spontaneous transition of urban form. At
present, pricing does not reflect the full costs of transport, failing to include costs of negative externali-
ties and the costs of investing beyond roads. Adequate pricing policies are critical to support transport
investments, change demand and existing behaviors, allocate resources more efficiently, and raise
funds to invest in more sustainable forms of transport. Both fuel tax and parking fees in Romania are
low compared with other EU countries. Other pricing instruments can be used more widely, including
the new vehicle registration fees and urban congestion fees. Increasing the use of renewable energy
and the uptake of low-carbon vehicle technology can lower the energy intensity of the transport sector,
but the lack of infrastructure for alternative fuels is an issue that needs to be addressed. At present,

there are only 20 electric vehicle charging stations, constraining the use of alternative fuel vehicles.10
In 2014, only seven electric or hybrid electric vehicles were registered in Romania. By comparison, a
total of over 75,000 were registered across the EU. Moreover, relaxation of land development controls
across Eastern Europe has led to inefficiencies associated with low-density development. In Romania,
there has been a decrease of residential use in urban core areas (with residential use replaced by com-
mercial), an increased rate of residential suburbanization and subsequent increase in personal vehicle
ownership, travel time, and congestion. Integrating land use and transport planning in urban areas in
Romania is key to managing road travel and minimizing GHG emissions in the future.

Specific urban transport problems include high vehicle concentration, traffic congestion, and
pedestrian areas filled with parked cars, resulting in high emissions and undermining of urban
well-being. Urban traffic congestion has significantly worsened as a result of increased private vehi-
cle ownership and usage. Insufficient parking spaces in Romanian cities has led to “informal” park-
ing arrangements, with vehicles parked on footways, cycle tracks, and public spaces. Urban public
transport, which includes metro systems and tram, trolley bus, and bus networks, requires costly
modernization and maintenance to be able to provide services at the level needed to compete with
private cars, and, as a result of insufficient financing, has suffered from a decline in public patronage.
Cycling infrastructure needs to be developed and pedestrian areas modernized, although there
are examples of improvement of pedestrian areas across the country.11 All these issues are more

closed to car traffic and streets repaved with cobblestones, using funding from the 2007­      –2013 Regional Operational
Program. In Ploiesti, an EU-supported CIVITAS project promoted walking, and a pedestrian zone was created in the city
center, backed by a campaign to encourage behavioral change. As a consequence, there has been a 20 percent reported
improvement in public transport speed, in addition to a 15 percent reduction in pollution in the central zone of the city.

pronounced in Bucharest and, as a result, carbon dioxide emissions from road transport in the capital
(833 kt per year) are higher than the total of the 19 next largest cities combined (596 kt per year).12

Transport service provision needs to be addressed holistically to ensure that public transport, as
well as non-road modes of transportation, are able to attract users and thereby realize full climate
and economic benefits. A modal shift from road to low-emissions rail transportation could help con-
tain road transportation demand and emissions, while also resulting in a co-benefit of reduced road
congestion. Such a shift requires reasonably high occupancy or ridership rates or else rail and road
public transport can be more emissions-intensive per passenger-km or ton-km than private cars and
trucks. Romania’s General Transport Master Plan argues that Romanian railways “are in a crisis situ-
ation.” To increase demand for rail service, it is necessary to combine investment in rail assets with
improved maintenance, operational efficiency, quality service and pricing that reflects costs and is
competitive with other modes of transportation.


METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS

Methodology

The objective of the analysis was to assess the impact of green policies and investments on trans-
port emissions. For this purpose, the Romania strategic mitigation model—the Transport Strategic
Emission Prediction Tool (TRANSEPT)—was developed. TRANSEPT is a bottom-up engineering
model and models the measures individually (as opposed to using a systems approach). It includes
four modules for calculation of GHG emissions: (i) transport demand, (ii) vehicle stock, (iii) vehicle
and driving efficiency, and (iv) fuel consumption. Each module takes a number of baseline datasets as
input and applies policy interventions under three scenarios—Baseline, Green and Super Green. The
adjusted datasets are then used as input matrices to the final module of TRANSEPT, which calculates
the resulting GHG emissions for all three scenarios. The process is outlined in Figure 4.8. The impact
of green policies is assessed by comparing the outcomes of the Green and Super Green scenarios
to the Baseline scenario. The costs of the green interventions are assessed outside of TRANSEPT
using case studies. Interventions are selected for both the Green and Super Green scenarios using
multi-criteria analysis. The outcome of the analysis is a proposed list of potential interventions, their
cost (investment and operational), and their abatement potential.

The Baseline scenario in this assessment is consistent with the Baseline in the EC’s “Trends to
2050” model: transport activities, related energy demand, and resulting emissions are expected
to grow (with continuation of current polices but no new policies on climate). Table 4.1 and
Figure 4.9 show consistency between the transport projections (in terms of demand for fuel and
resulting emissions) by the European Commission’s “Trends to 2050” model and by the modeling
developed under this assessment. In both projections, passenger and freight activities are on an
upward trajectory, the energy demand for transport is estimated to grow, and GHG emissions are




12. To date, there are only four countries in the EU that have spatially-disaggregated emissions inventories at a national
level: the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. This data has been analyzed to understand better the distribution
of emissions between urban and non-urban areas. The largest 20 cities (with populations over 100,000) were identified
and their respective emissions levels analyzed. E-PRTR: The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register: Welcome

projected to increase.13 The differences in projections between the two models result from the varia-
tions in the assumptions regarding the trends for different modes of transport, with the model in this
assessment forecasting a greater growth in vehicle usage, fuel demand, and growth in GHG emissions.

Romania’s General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) is used as the basis of the Baseline scenario of
this assessment, and the relevant investments in urban planning and transport sector operational
efficiency are considered in the Baseline, as well as regulatory impacts. In order to ensure comple-
mentarity, the country-specific strategy should be consistent with the EU-level transport strategy, which
focuses on assuring sustainable mobility for people and goods and contributing to ambitious GHG
emissions reduction targets. The Romanian GTMP was developed under the guidance of the European
Commission as a condition for its approval of the Strategic Operational Program for Transport (SOPT).
The GTMP includes significant investment in public transport infrastructure (including the national rail
system). Also, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans that are under development for a number of cities,
involving integrated land use and transport planning in the capital city (Bucharest and Ilfov County) and
seven larger cities that are considered growth poles, were used to develop the Baseline. Existing mea-
sures to improve operational efficiency include well-established eco-driving programs in the freight
sector to reduce fuel consumption and emissions and freight and logistics hubs (as part of the GTMP).


At the last step of the analysis, a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) provides a framework
to present the outcomes of the transport sector analysis in a form useful for policy discussions.
Cost and abatement potential of the proposed interventions estimated in this assessment are used
as input into a tool developed at the World Bank to calculate MACC parameters.14 The MAC curve
also allows for comparisons of measures across sectors, with the caution that only certain aspects of
measures can be simplified into the MACC presentation, which is of particular interest to policymak-
ers designing an overall mitigation strategy that reaches across multiple sectors.



14. See Chapter 9 in this report, which describes the MACC approach used in this assessment across sectors in detail.

Main Findings

The main modeling outcomes include abatement and cost. The TRANSEPT modeling methodology
described above generates outcomes on abatement potential, cost, and the cost effectiveness (cost
per unit of abatement) of the selected green interventions for the period 2015–2050. The assessment
also involved a non-quantitative evaluation of the barriers to implementation and the externalities
of each measure. Marginal abatement cost analysis was conducted to assess cost effectiveness and
abatement potential of the measures and to illustrate their benefits relative to each other.

Four measures have potential to deliver high abatement over the course of the modelled period
of 2015 to 2050. The four highest potential measures were found to be: (i) lowering of speed lim-
its (speed restrictions); (ii) increasing the fuel tax; (iii) eco-driving programs which encourage more
efficient driving patterns, with advertising campaigns targeted at private car users and training pro-
grams focused on the freight transport and public transport sector; and (iv) implementing a more
progressive new vehicle registration tax (Environmental Stamp) promoting the adoption of low
emission vehicles. Figure 4.10 summarizes the cumulative abatement results for each intervention
over 2015–2050. Then, Table 4.2 provides a comparison of the abatement potential of the proposed
interventions in three different time periods: the period 2015–2022 corresponds to the timeframe
of the Government Action Plan, the period 2015–2030 parallels the time horizon of the Govern-
ment Transport Strategy, and the period 2015–2050 is the timeframe of the analysis presented in this
assessment.

Interventions were selected for the assessment in the Green and the Super Green scenarios
based on a multi-criteria analysis. This approach considered: (i) investment cost to the government,
(ii) cumulative emission savings, (iii) cost effectiveness of abatement (unit abatement cost), (iv) bar-
riers to implementation, and (v) local co-benefits. The co-benefits included better local air quality,
reduced congestion, reduced noise, improved safety, reduced inequity, and positive health impact.15
Table 4.3 summarizes the outcomes of the multi-criteria analysis. The costs of delivering the identi-
fied interventions have been estimated using international case study evidence and adjusted to the
Romanian context. Importantly, the costs are limited to those borne directly by government (public
costs) and include both investment and operational and maintenance costs.

The Green scenario comprised a selective list of measures that have high performance according
to the multi-criteria analysis while the Super Green scenario included all interventions analyzed.
Based on the multi-criteria analysis, the following measures were selected for inclusion in the Green
scenario based on lower costs, both total and per unit of CO2 abated: (i) fuel price taxation increase,

15. These benefits were considered at a qualitative level but not included in costs.

Green interventions in this assessment lead to decoupling of transport sector emissions growth
from economic growth in Romania, achieving a transport sector objective that is challenging for
most countries. As shown in Figure 4.11, GHG emissions from transport are projected to decouple
from economic growth even in the Green scenario: they grow more slowly than the real economy.
Both Green and Super Green scenarios achieve significant reduction of GHG emissions as compared

with the Baseline scenario (Figure 4.12). Under the Baseline scenario, emissions grow by 34 percent
during 2015–2050, while under the Green scenario, emissions growth slows to 24 percent. Emissions
growth slows further to 17 percent under the Super Green scenario. Note that the impact of the bun-
dle of measures is not identical to the sum of the individual measures due to the inter-relationship
between them. In all cases, GHG emissions from the transport sector will rise, with different rates
of growth. These results are in line with many studies which suggest that reducing GHG emissions
in the transport sector is hard to achieve. This is more so in the countries of Eastern Europe where
motorization rates are still rising. Policies should aim at achieving reduced growth of transport emis-
sions instead.

Marginal abatement cost curve analysis then provided a method of comparison and presenta-
tion to policymakers. The outcomes, presented in Figure 4.13, show that the most cost-efficient
measures are a fuel price tax, scrappage schemes, vehicle registration taxes, parking pricing, and
urban congestion pricing, while the measures delivering maximum abatement are speed restric-
tions, vehicle registration, and fuel price taxation. When compared with other sectors, transport
measures have very high costs and, at the same time, limited abatement potential.16 This finding is
consistent with the experience of transport MACCs in other countries and is explained by the nature
of transport mitigation: transport abatement has significant co-benefits which are difficult to include
in the estimates of net costs. The examples include the cost of a life lost in a traffic accident, the
costs of a traffic injury, potential municipal budget revenue from developing urban business-friendly
infrastructure, improved well-being from reduced noise and pollution, and gains from reduced com-
muting time. If such benefits were to be taken into account, the net cost of transport sector mitiga-
tion is significantly reduced.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

As Romania’s motorization rate converges with that of the European Union, transport emissions
are expected to grow even if green measures in the sector are implemented. Unlike other sectors,
where the objective is to reduce emissions, the goal of green growth development in transport is to
decouple growth of emissions from sector growth or, in other words, to lower the GHG intensity of
the transport sector going forward.

The proposed mitigation action plan recommends a set of actions on the basis of the estimates
made in this assessment. The main areas of concern coincide with the top drivers of emissions, and
many of them—such as the old vehicle fleet and the rising private ownership of vehicles—should be
addressed using policy or behavioral incentives such as taxes, regulations, fees and pricing aimed
at encouraging replacement of old vehicles and discouraging driving. Particular policy instruments
recommended include the following:
n	   Fuel pricing is a particularly effective policy instrument that discourages vehicle usage and
     encourages the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, thereby reducing vehicle-fuel intensity.
     Fuel taxes are relatively inexpensive to collect, easy to administer and reasonably equitable.
n	   The New Vehicle Registration Tax (Environment Stamp) is levied according to a vehicle’s Euro-
     pean emissions standard, CO2 emissions, and engine displacement, with a discount rate applied
     depending on the age of vehicle. A gradual pre-announced increase of the tax on the most pol-
     luting cars has been a means of influencing purchasing decisions. The cost of changing the rates

     under the existing regulatory framework would be negligible. It is assumed that the change in
     tax rates is fiscally neutral as higher taxes for high-polluting vehicles are offset by lower taxes for
     more efficient vehicles.
n	   Parking pricing, in conjunction with tightened parking regulation and enforcement, may be
     considered to be a more cost-effective, more readily implementable solution to in-town conges-
     tion, instead of urban congestion charging. Parking pricing is a market-based measure which
     offers the potential for emissions savings with a high level of cost effectiveness. Indeed, the mea-
     sure would be expected to offer a stream of revenue which could facilitate some of the invest-
     ment measures in the transport sector.
n	   Air travel taxation presents a mechanism for exerting some control over the growing demand for
     air travel and also offers a revenue stream which may be put to useful purpose. The implications
     for the economy need to be considered, but there are potentially positive equity impacts from
     what is expected to be a strongly progressive form of taxation.
n	   Best practice examples typically combine the disincentive of high parking charges with an effec-
     tive and efficient public transport system, and good walking and cycling facilities. Smarter
     choices programs, combined with investment in walking and cycling infrastructure, have been
     demonstrated to lead to modal shift, achieving not only a reduction in emissions levels but also
     significant wider benefits including health and well-being, and decongestion. Smart choices
     programs are “soft” behavioral change programs that provide better information to travel-
     ers on available choices and highlight the potential benefits of sustainable transport modes.
     Smart choices schemes and policies include workplace and school travel plans, personalized
     travel planning, awareness campaigns, public transport information and marketing, car-sharing
     schemes, teleworking and teleconferencing. In cost-benefit analysis, these schemes typically
     perform strongly, with cost-benefit ratios in excess of 20 by comparison with highway and public
     transport schemes with ratios calculated to be in the low single figures. Concerted and sustained
     investment can realize emissions savings at a reasonable level of cost effectiveness.

The investment in infrastructure required to achieve modal shift from private cars towards public
transport depends on local circumstances and the extent of the targeted shift. It is important to
address needs for transport services holistically to ensure that public transport is able to attract new
users and realize its full climate and economic benefits. Rail transport or public transport can end up
being more emissions-intensive per passenger-km or ton-km than the use of private cars and trucks
if ridership remains low or declines further. A modal shift from road to much less emission-intensive
rail transportation, or to public transport more broadly (national rail system, and local bus, tram, or
trolleybus systems) could help contain road transportation demand and emissions, while also result-
ing in a co-benefit of reduced road congestion.

Institutional arrangement and coordination are also critical. Actions should start with collaboration
between transport stakeholders, such as government ministries, the rail sector, the City of Bucharest
and other municipalities, bus operators, and parking management organizations. More complicated
but also necessary actions in this area should aim at creating clear governance structures and con-
tractual arrangements, as well as increasing administrative and technical capacity to support strategy
development and project implementation.

Financing needs for the recommended measures in transport rise sharply between the Green and
Super Green scenarios but still remain modest, as incremental investments within a large sector.
Under the Green scenario, additional investments total about €135 million over 2015–5017 but almost
€1.7 billion in the more ambitious Super Green scenario. Most of the costs are incurred in the first
fifteen years, during 2015–2030. In the first five years, 2015–2020, the implementation of the recom-
mended transport measures will require just above €60 million in the Green scenario but approxi-
mately €608 under the Super Green scenario.

Can Urban Areas Lead on Greening?

CHAPTER SUMMARY



              rban areas are critical to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and despite some
              interest from Romanian cities, challenges are many. Rising suburbanization is lead-
              ing to less efficient urban forms but is not captured in Romanian urban statistics. The
              motorization or car ownership rate in Romania is currently low compared to the rest of
the European Union (EU), but it has been rising, exacerbating existing traffic congestion problems in
most cities. Buildings, and residential buildings in particular, account for the largest share of energy
consumption in Romania. Although Romania has the lowest per-capita energy consumption in the
EU, significant growth in electricity demand is already occurring, partly due to the decline of highly-
polluting and inefficient district heating. Lastly, Romania’s overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its
primary strategy for municipal solid waste disposal boosts the greenhouse gas emissions generated
by the country’s waste management sector.

Since the Bucharest-Ilfov Metropolitan Region (BIMR) dominates Romania’s population, economic
landscape and land-use development patterns, analysis of BIMR can provide a leading example
of lower-emissions urban development for Romanian cities. Suburban development pressures are
strong, as a richer population seeks bigger homes which are available only in service-poor outer
areas of BIMR. As in most cities, the distribution of total building stock in BIMR shows a radial pattern
driven by proximity to major roads. The ongoing shift towards private cars produces traffic conges-
tion that is increasingly a part of daily life in the Bucharest-Ilfov region, despite the fact that the City
of Bucharest is well-served by one of the most comprehensive public transport networks in all of
Europe. Since buildings, and residential buildings in particular, account for the largest share of energy
consumption in Romania, and since heating, especially in residential buildings, drives much of the
energy use in BIMR’s buildings, the sharp decline of Bucharest’s vast but already inefficient district
heating system contributes to rising GHG emissions. In addition, Bucharest-Ilfov recycles little of its
solid waste and captures none of the methane related to landfills. The situation in the Bucharest-Ilfov

region is critical to Romania’s overall GHG emissions path into the future, both because of its cur-
rent and future domination of the economy but also because it can provide a replicable example of
lower-emissions growth.

There have been multiple obstacles to a greener urban path to date. The financial resources avail-
able to upgrade major infrastructure systems have been limited by the regional economic slowdown
and Romania’s difficulty in absorbing EU funds. Low-carbon urban actions have been impeded by
institutional challenges, including the lack of formal roles in planning and implementing, policy-
planning disconnects between different government entities, and a lack of transparency. Also, subsi-
dized energy prices for households and selected energy-intensive state-owned enterprises have led
to low energy prices and an immature market for energy efficiency-focused firms.

The Rapid Assessment of City Emissions (RACE) model is a geospatial model that compares popu-
lation and development patterns for a region under different scenarios, in order to develop tech-
nical estimates of how they differ in terms of energy use, energy spending levels, air quality emis-
sions, and GHG emissions. First, a baseline inventory of metropolitan elements was constructed
from a wide variety of available data to develop baseline estimates of current energy demand,
energy spending, and GHG and air quality emission levels for each location in BIMR. Then a general
development scenario for 2050 was prepared, applying assumptions about future demographic and
economic conditions and the relative accessibility of each cell to the city center that drive estimates
of future demand for industrial and residential building stock, which RACE then uses to calculate
emissions. Next, a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario was modeled to reflect recent spatial patterns
of development while a Low Carbon (LC) Development scenario is modeled based on higher densi-
ties. These scenarios estimate the technical potential for change in energy demand, emissions, and
other variables, but not the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. By comparing the energy
and emission impacts of different development options, local and regional authorities can identify
the types of policies that affect the long-term economic and environmental sustainability of their city.
Action plans can then be prepared to comprehensively review and, where appropriate, adjust these
policies to minimize emissions.

A comparison of the two modeled scenarios provides useful insights on policies that can cut
GHG emissions in the Bucharest-Ilfov region. The Business-as-Usual scenario contains continued
low-density growth of residential, office and industrial development and lacks integration between
new development and public transit (trams, buses and metro). Overall energy use and associated
emissions continue to increase through 2050 although there are some efficiency gains in buildings.
Rising vehicle-kilometers travelled are somewhat offset by efficiency gains and a cleaner fuel mix,
while rates of recycling and biodegradable waste diversion in Bucharest would reach half the levels
mandated by EU targets. In contrast to the BAU scenario, spatial development in BIMR under the
Low Carbon (LC) Development scenario exhibits less sprawl, higher densities, mixed-use, and a
coordination of transit and spatial planning. Efficiency gains from urban land use and reduction in
travel distances are achieved in this scenario through spatial planning. Unsurprisingly, proactive spa-
tial planning leads to significant improvement in energy use, energy spending, and emissions, even
though the gross building area remains unchanged relative to the BAU scenario. Reduced energy
use cuts total energy spending by US$1.4 billion per year in real terms, and emissions from buildings,
transport, and solid waste in BIMR will see reductions by 2050 under the LC scenario.

The modeling of a greener path for BIMR summarized in this chapter provides local authorities with
insights into how policies affect the speed, location, and density of urban growth and the resulting

GHG emissions. Several cross-sectoral measures are recommended, including data-collection
improvements and strengthening of metropolitan governance and management. Recommended
land-use policies include promotion of mixed land-use, up-zoning, and transit-oriented develop-
ment. Overlapping land-use and transportation proposals include preferential space for public
transport, creation of pedestrian-only zones, parking policies, and completion of ring roads. Also
important will be congestion pricing for traffic management and district heating upgrades. Build-
ing efficiency-related recommendations include Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) finance;
green mortgages; point-of-sale efficiency upgrades/audits; and energy efficiency capacity-building
programs. Other Romanian cities interested in this type of assessment are encouraged to evaluate
the quality of data available for their city and consider application of the RACE model, keeping the
fundamental limitations of the model in mind.


CHALLENGES FOR GREENER GROWTH

Overview

Rising suburbanization is leading to less efficient urban forms but is not captured in Romanian
urban statistics. The official urbanization rate in Romania is roughly 55 percent, which is low com-
pared to other parts of Europe and has been fairly constant for the past two decades. Migration out
of rural areas has been to the outskirts of major cities, which are still categorized as rural. For exam-
ple, population in Ilfov County (on the periphery of Bucharest) has increased 69 percent between
1977 and 2011, jumping from 230,000 to 389,000 people. (See Figure 5.1). Other Romanian cities are
experiencing a similar phenomenon of expansion as built-up areas increase (See Table 5.1).

Romanian cities have shown some interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and some have
undertaken assessments to identify low carbon options. Sixty communities, together representing
25 percent of Romania’s population, have signed on to the European Commission’s Covenant of
Mayors program, which requires development and implementation of an energy action plan. The
World Bank’s Tool for the Rapid Assessment of City Energy (TRACE) has been deployed in seven
Romanian cities to support local energy efficiency planning efforts, by assessing energy use in six
key sectors, benchmarking against peer cities, and evaluating which interventions might be most
appropriate. TRACE is most useful in addressing sectors over which a local authority has the great-
est control—the public bus system, for example, rather than private automobiles—but it does not
address other options important to lower carbon emissions, such as renewable energy or other fuel
switching.

The motorization or car ownership rate in Romania is low compared to the rest of the Euro-
pean Union (EU), but it has been rising, exacerbating existing traffic congestion problems in most
cities. Many cities have public transport systems (including buses, trams and trolleys), but declining
ridership has made it difficult for system operators to finance those upgrades which might bring
riders back to the system. Taxis are plentiful in most cities, but many of the vehicles are old and fuel-
inefficient, mirroring the make-up of the nation’s vehicle fleet. Some cities have an age limit for taxi
vehicles, but this varies significantly from city to city. Finally, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure var-
ies greatly in quality and quantity between different towns and cities, and within city areas. Respon-
sibility for urban transport investment generally sits with the municipalities in Romania. Sustainable
urban mobility plans are currently under development in Romania’s seven growth pole cities and
Bucharest/Ilfov.1

Buildings, and residential buildings in particular, account for the largest share of energy consump-
tion in Romania. Buildings account for 44 percent of total demand, followed by industry (30 percent)
and transport (23 percent). Energy use in buildings is influenced primarily by the thermal efficiency
of the building, its size, its age, and its level of use. Approximately 80 percent of buildings-related
energy demand occurs in residential buildings. Heating constitutes 57 percent of all energy use in
buildings, though the ratio is even higher in residential buildings. Romania’s building stock is fairly
old, with nearly 90 percent of residential buildings constructed before 1989. In other words, they
were constructed at a time when there were no specific thermal performance standards. Such build-
ings are unlikely to have much insulation and are very likely to have mechanical systems that would
be considered unacceptable under today’s modern energy or building codes.

Although Romania has the lowest per-capita energy consumption in the EU, significant growth in
electricity demand is already occurring, partly due to the decline of highly-polluting and inefficient
district heating.2 Demand growth is coming from the residential and commercial sectors, some of
which is driven by households’ moving away from reliance on district heating. District heating sys-
tems were once a prominent feature of many Romanian cities, and in other countries, such systems
have become an energy-efficient and low-carbon heating option. Romania’s 300 systems operating
in 1995/96 had declined to 83 by 2011. In 16 of the 31 district heating systems with more than 10,000
customers, the number of customers had dropped by more than 50 percent. In many cities, district
heating has become a serious drain on public finances because tariffs for residential consumers are
highly subsidized, on average by 50 percent. Service quality, cost, and concern over high pollution

levels are among the primary reasons for declining demand. Most of the old, inefficient cogenera-
tion units and heat-only boilers have not been upgraded or replaced with modern generation equip-
ment, nor are they equipped with adequate burning equipment, resulting in SO2 and NOX emissions
that exceed EU norms. With an average of 275 tons of CO2 per gigacalorie,3 Romania’s district heat-
ing producers rank among the most polluting service suppliers in the EU. Heat distribution networks
suffer an average of 30 percent heat and water losses, compared to five to ten percent for newer
networks. As a result of those inefficiencies, the cost of district heating is about 18–20 percent higher
than in some other EU countries.

Romania’s overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its primary strategy for municipal solid waste
disposal boosts the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the country’s waste manage-
ment sector. The GHG emissions associated with municipal solid waste disposal in Romania total
approximately two percent of the country’s overall emissions, with the majority resulting from land-
filling. Organic waste entombed in a landfill decays anaerobically, producing methane, a GHG with
25 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide.

Since the Bucharest-Ilfov Metropolitan Region (BIMR) dominates Romania’s population, economic
landscape and land-use development patterns, analysis of BIMR can provide a leading example
of lower-emissions urban development for Romanian cities. With a population of 2.3 million, the
region ranks 37th in size among all metropolitan regions in wider Europe. The region’s share of
Romania’s population increased from 10.2 percent in 2000 to nearly 11.4 percent in 2011, a pattern
that will likely continue over the next few decades (Figure 5.2). This increase is in stark contrast to

other cities around the country, where the population has declined significantly. Moreover, BIMR
accounted for over 27 percent of the country’s GDP in 2011, up from 11 percent in 2000 (Figure 5.3).
Bucharest is the capital of Romania, its financial center, the leading industrial and cultural hub, and
home to many of Romania’s top universities. Located in the southeastern part of Romania, the region
is approximately 100 kilometers (km) south of the Carpathian Mountains, 200 km west of the Black
Sea, and 60 km north of the Danube River. The region’s climate is temperate, with hot summers and
cold winters. BIMR is composed of the city of Bucharest and Ilfov County.

Bucharest has administrative and political powers shared between the Municipality and local sec-
tor councils, with little overlap in authority. The city government is headed by a mayor (Primar Gen-
eral) and city council (Consiliu General). The city is further subdivided into six administrative districts
(Sectoare), each with their own mayor and city council. In general, the Municipality is responsible
for major city infrastructure systems such as the public transport network, major roadways, and the
water and sewage system. Sectoare town halls manage secondary roads, parks, schools, and street
cleaning.

Ilfov County is managed by a County Council that is responsible for basic public services and the
road and transport network outside of the administrative limits of each of the 32 communes located
within the County. As is the case with Sectoare governments above, Communes are responsible for
local infrastructure and other government service issues within their boundaries. While Bucharest’s
population has declined over the past two decades, Ilfov County—the nearly 1600-square-kilometer

administrative district that surrounds Bucharest—grew by 35 percent from 1992 to 2011. Ilfov County
now accounts for more than 17 percent of the metropolitan area’s population, up from 12 percent
in 1992. This population shift has largely resulted from Bucharest residents moving from urban areas
into new, single-family residences in suburban areas in Ilfov.

Suburban development pressures are strong, as a richer population seeks bigger homes. Popula-
tion distribution within the Bucharest-Ilfov Metropolitan Region reflects three historical conditions
typical of many eastern European cities: (i) lower population densities in the historical core area;
(ii) high densities in outer clusters of high-rise apartment complexes adjacent to industries, built dur-
ing the Communist era following the Soviet model; and (iii) scattered, low-density suburban sprawl
that has evolved since transition in 1989 and the subsequent privatization of land. Many of the high-
rise, prefabricated panel apartment blocks in Bucharest have small units. Public spaces have deterio-
rated over the years due to poor maintenance. With the privatization of land, suburban farmers are
now able to sell individual plots for the development of single-family homes. Growing incomes have
enabled many Bucharest residents to move to the suburbs, even though they continue to have weak
public services in terms of schools and commercial facilities.

Overall, the distribution of total building stock in BIMR shows a radial pattern driven by proximity
to major roads. The distribution of residential building stock clearly shows these spatial patterns.
Suburban low-rise development is occurring at very low densities, generally about six dwellings
per hectare. The medium-rise residential stock is largely comprised of three- to five-story walkup



108  	                                                       ROMANIA GREEN GROWTH COUNTRY ASSESSMENT        	
apartments in central areas. High-rise residential stock is principally panel blocks built during the
Communist era. Other salient characteristics of Bucharest’s building stock are the low quantity of
commercial offices and their central location, the high number of large-scale retail (big-box) in sub-
urban areas, and the distribution of industrial buildings, clustered around older industries in the inner
urban area and, more recently, scattered in the suburbs.4

The Bucharest-Ilfov region’s economy is still in transition, with an ongoing shift from manufacturing
to services. Only eight percent of employees worked for state-owned enterprises in 2012, in contrast
to 25 percent in 2000. Approximately 13 percent worked for foreign-owned firms in 2011, in contrast
to only five percent in 2005. Services currently account for more than 76 percent of employment, with
higher value-added producer services accounting for 31 percent of total employment. Manufactur-
ing is still the largest employer (159,800 employees in 2011), but numbers have decreased by almost
23,000 from 2008 to 2011. BIMR’s manufacturing sector is gradually innovating, but traditional indus-
tries (food, apparel, metal fabrication, printing machinery, furniture, tanning/dyeing) still provide the
largest share of employment. Exports grew by 69 percent from 2005 to 2011.5

Per capita GDP in BIMR is 2.5 times the national average; and the region has several major com-
parative advantages that will continue to drive its economic growth over the coming decades. The
GDP of BIMR grew by 12.3 percent between 2010 and 2011,6 and growth has been high for most
of the past 15 years. BIMR’s economic hinterland is large: within a one-day drive by truck from the
center of Bucharest is a population of 11 million; within a two-day drive, the hinterland reaches Buda-
pest, Vienna, Athens, Istanbul and Kiev, a market of 83 million. BIMR has the most educated human
capital in Romania: 33 percent of its working age population has vocational and tertiary educational
attainment, compared to less than 15 percent in other regions. Supplementing these advantages are
labor costs, which are the third lowest in wider Europe.

Traffic congestion caused by private cars is increasingly a part of daily life in the Bucharest-Ilfov region,
despite the fact that the City of Bucharest is well-served by one of the most comprehensive public
transport networks in all of Europe. Approximately 38 percent of trips in the region are made via auto-
mobile. Traffic congestion is becoming a serious problem, particularly in the urban core, at intersections
along the main ring roads, and on the main thoroughfares traveling through the city along a north-south
axis. A primary contributor to the congestion problem is rapid growth in vehicle ownership rates, which
have risen from 152 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants (2006) to 224 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants (2012). Also,
insufficient off-street parking facilities in the central area led many drivers to use illegal “parasite” spaces
on the roadway, narrowing lane space and further inhibiting the flow of vehicles. Non-motorized trans-
port is the second most utilized means of transport for daily trips: 31 percent of trips are made by walk-
ing, while two percent of trips are made on a bicycle. The growing dependence on the automobile has
occurred despite Bucharest’s dense public transport network, consisting of the 51-station metro system,
and the RATB’s (Regia Autonoma de Transport Bucuresti) network of 120 bus lines, 24 tram and light rail
lines, and 15 trolleybus lines. The bus is the most-utilized form of public transport, followed closely by the
metro. Metro stations are located approximately every 1.4 km. A fifth metro line is expected to open in
2017. The majority of the bus and tram fleet has been overhauled in recent years to improve passenger
comfort and vehicle efficiency.

Circumstances in Ilfov County are quite different, with little public transport and longer trips.
Nearly one-quarter of roadways in Ilfov County consist of high-speed motorways. Access to a bus
system is virtually non-existent, as there are just a few lines serving Ilfov County residents commuting
into Bucharest. There are 2.6 trips per capita per day in the BIMR, with Bucharest residents traveling
approximately 6.3 km on average and Ilfov residents traveling longer distances. The average trip
distance for the entire Bucharest-Ilfov region is approximately 6.8 km (Figure 5.4).

Heating, especially in residential buildings, drives much of the energy use in BIMR’s buildings,
and Bucharest’s vast district heating system is increasingly inefficient. Despite the importance of
thermal efficiency in buildings, the level of compliance in Bucharest with thermal performance stan-
dard (under the EU’s Building Performance Directive) is unclear. Heating systems in buildings around
Bucharest typically involve freestanding boiler units inside the building or, in larger buildings, a con-
nection to a large district heating system. Bucharest’s district heating system is vast—the second
largest urban system in the world—involving more than 4,000 km of distribution pipes and satisfying
72 percent of the city’s thermal energy needs. The number of customers linked to the system has
declined over the years, as has often been the case elsewhere in Romania. Service quality, cost, and
concern over high pollution levels have been the primary reasons for declining demand. Bucharest’s
district heating system is fired by natural gas (54 percent), fuel oil (26 percent), and coal (20 percent).
The electricity consumed in buildings in Bucharest and Ilfov is assumed to have the same character-
istics as across the national grid, meaning it is heavily dominated by coal and hydropower. Coal use
in Romania is considerably higher than in many other European countries. Energy prices for selected
industrial customers and all residential customers are subsidized.

Bucharest-Ilfov recycles little of its solid waste and captures none of the methane related to land-
fills. Nationally, Romania is reported to recycle only five percent of its total waste stream, with virtu-
ally all of the remaining material ending up in landfills. Data from the National Institute of Statistics in
2011 disclosed that Bucharest-Ilfov generated a total of 881,000 tons of municipal solid waste, with
Bucharest responsible for approximately 86 percent of that total. Approximately 45 percent of the
region’s waste is considered biodegradable (meaning it could be composted and converted into
a useful soil amendment), while another 30 percent of the waste stream is made up of commonly

recycled materials. No regional landfill facilities currently have any methane gas recovery system in
place, which is problematic because organic waste entombed in a landfill decays anaerobically and
produces methane gas. Unless the landfill is properly designed, capturing or flaring the methane via
a series of pipes embedded in the landfill, the gas will slowly leak out of the landfill for many years,
including long after it is formally closed. Proposals have been floated to develop a large waste-to-
energy facility that would convert waste heat into electricity. The status of this project is unknown.

Challenges

The financial resources available to upgrade major infrastructure systems have been limited by
the regional economic slowdown and Romania’s difficulty in absorbing EU funds. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) has generally been good for the BIMR: 60 percent of the country’s total FDI went
to the region ten years ago. However, by 2010, FDI levels had dropped by nearly 80 percent, a situ-
ation from which Bucharest is still recovering.7 The slowdown in the real estate market also has obvi-
ous implications in terms of the tax resources available to the Municipality for major infrastructure
projects. Another critical factor has been Romania’s difficulty in absorbing European Union Regional
Operating Program funds. As of the end of March 2015, the absorption rate for the period 2007–2013
was 49 percent. Between 2007 and 2009, however, the absorption rate was zero percent, as there was
considerable ramp-up time to train staff, prepare portfolios of projects, develop the necessary legal
framework and regulations, and focus on strategies and the analytic foundation.

Low-carbon urban actions have been impeded by institutional challenges, including the lack of
formal roles in planning and implementing, policy and planning disconnects between different
government entities, and a lack of transparency. Compelled by the problems of traffic congestion,
diminished air quality, and excessive energy spending, 60 Romanian communities have voluntarily
opted to create Sustainable Energy Action Plans under the auspices of the city-focused Covenant
of Mayors program. However, Romania lacks a formal urban climate strategy and action plan, and
clarity regarding the formal role of local authorities in crafting and implementing changes that are
necessary to reduce urban GHG emissions. High-level climate policy statements typically speak only
in terms of sectoral or infrastructure changes but do not specify who is responsible for planning or
implementing these changes. The ambiguity around the role of local authorities is an obstacle to
their engagement in ways that are more reflective of local considerations rather than national or
global imperatives. Moreover, policy and planning disconnects between different tiers of govern-
ment or ministries with overlapping functions have proven to be a major impediment to the resolu-
tion of several major infrastructure challenges. Examples can be found in all sectors. Two different
regulatory agencies are responsible for policies relevant to district heating systems. The metro sys-
tem in Bucharest is operated by METROREX under Ministry of Transport control, while the surface
transport system (trams, bus and trolley) is managed by RATB (Regia Autonoma de Transport Bucur-
esti), which is under city control.

Lack of transparency by different government agencies has made it hard to plan and set priorities.
For example, public access to information about the building stock in Romanian cities is limited, and
there are no reports published to date comparing the Energy Performance Certificate scores across
cities, despite the fact that the law has been fully implemented as of 2011.8 Were such information
available, local authorities could more easily compare building upgrade strategies or set priorities
among different types of buildings.

Subsidized energy prices for households and selected energy-intensive state-owned enterprises
encourage over-consumption and repress the market for energy efficiency-focused firms. As part
of its accession into the European Union, Romania agreed to move away from tightly regulated and
heavily subsidized energy prices to a market-based system. As of early 2015, businesses must now
pay market rates for electricity and gas, but energy prices for selected industrial customers and
all residential customers remain subsidized. Energy-intensive state-owned enterprises continue to
receive preferential electricity and gas prices. State and local subsidies for residential district heat-
ing cover roughly 50 percent of residential customer costs. Household energy prices will not be fully
liberalized until January 2018 (electricity) and January 2019 (gas) respectively, reducing the incentive
to adopt energy saving measures. No timeline has been given for removing district subsidies. In
addition to influencing energy demand, low prices have meant the market for energy efficiency-
focused firms and expertise has been slow to develop. That should change in the coming years,
either through firms in other European countries targeting the Romanian market, or through more
home-grown endeavors. Trade groups such as the Romania Green Building Council are becoming
more active, although membership rates remain quite low.9

METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS

Methodology

The Rapid Assessment of City Emissions (RACE) model is a geospatial model that compares pop-
ulation and development patterns for a region under different scenarios, in order to develop
technical estimates of how they differ in terms of energy use, energy spending levels, air quality
emissions, and GHG emissions. By changing assumptions about current and future land use pat-
terns, the design and location of different public transport system options, the energy and emission
factors assigned to different land use patterns in a city, and the solid waste management system
design, it is possible to compare a baseline scenario with one or more alternative scenarios in terms
of: (i) total energy demand; (ii) total energy spending (in real terms); (iii) total energy-related air qual-
ity emissions (PM10 and NOx); and (iv) total energy-related CO2 emissions (Figure 5.5).

Step 1: Compile a baseline inventory of metropolitan elements. Without the legacy of GIS-analyt-
ics or data tracking in the Bucharest-Ilfov region, digitized information on local land use patterns,
the location of roads or highways, population data, and building stock data was obtained from a
variety of sources and, in many cases, manually generated based on high-resolution satellite imag-
ery. A comprehensive land-use map with information on shape, dimensions and uses of individual
buildings was developed by leveraging data through OpenStreetMap, satellite imagery, field studies
and geo-referenced photographs. Population data was obtained from the 2011 census. The digital
representation of road, local rail, and public transport networks was obtained from the work on the

Bucharest Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and OpenStreetMap and manually created using
GIS and digital images. The 2012 Bucharest Statistical Yearbook provided the enterprise address
and employment data, which was used to develop maps of different types and locations of business
activity around the Bucharest-Ilfov region.

Step 1 was completed, once the spatial model was fully developed, by assigning population, land
use, and business activity across the region. This information was reallocated by superimposing
a 500m 3 500m grid scale over the entire Bucharest-Ilfov region.10 Data attached to an individual
cell or to an aggregation of cells is more easily extractable for analysis in a relational database or
a spreadsheet, as is the case with the RACE model. Once the data is transferred into the RACE
spreadsheet model, energy and emission factors are applied to develop baseline estimates of cur-
rent energy demand, energy spending, and GHG and air quality emission levels for BIMR. Solid
waste management system parameters are also entered into the analysis at this point, as the various
disposal options are not necessarily spatially linked. This information serves as the starting point for
the scenario analysis.



10.  This technique is commonly employed in GIS (Geographic Information System) analyses to help remedy the fact that
data is often available at wildly disparate scales (e.g., building scale vs. census tract vs. specific addresses).

Step 2: Prepare a development scenario for 2050. The future development scenarios modeled in
RACE posit assumptions about future demographic and economic conditions likely to exist in the
city/region. In making these calculations, the scenario must explicitly address the pace of expected
growth and shifts in the city’s reliance on manufacturing value chains (i.e., the expected shift from
low to high value-added manufacturing) and in consumer and product services. Collectively, these
assumptions drive estimates of future demand for industrial, commercial, and residential building
stock, which RACE then uses to calculate emissions. Moreover, transport infrastructure assumptions
are necessary to construct “accessibility indices” for each 500m grid cell, which measure the relative
accessibility of each cell to the city center or other areas of anticipated economic growth, thereby
defining areas most likely to attract development activity. At least two different spatial growth options
can be constructed to accommodate the projected population and building stock requirements: a
Business-as-Usual option and a Low Carbon option. These options articulate different visions for the
location of growth, the density of growth, the land use mix of growth, and the extent to which these
land uses are integrated with the city’s transport infrastructure.

Step 3: Model a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. The BAU scenario reflects recent spatial patterns
of development: the land-use mix is assumed to remain relatively segregated. In other words, large
residential areas with little or no formal employment spaces; growth driven by changes in popula-
tion levels and/or economic expansion continues to focus on suburban and peri�urban areas (with
little, if any growth distributed to the core and inner city areas), based on the assumption that land
values and resettlement costs are lower in the suburbs. Grid cells with building densities higher than
the city average are also excluded as growth areas. Finally, the BAU scenario assumes little attempt
is made to link development growth to public transport systems in the region. With these assump-
tions in mind, growth is then distributed around the city using GIS, factoring in accessibility indices
that prioritize available marketable land and recent growth trends. Once this is done, it is possible
to recalculate energy demand, energy spending, and emissions for the region. Any changes in the
solid waste management system structure (compared to the baseline period) are also accounted for
at this time.

Step 4: Model a Low Carbon (LC) Development scenario. The Low Carbon scenario presumes very
different growth parameters than the BAU scenario. High-density clusters of mixed use development
are proposed, minimizing the need for travel to places of work, education, commerce, and recre-
ation. Because growth is concentrated in areas with the best accessibility, there is tight integration
of land uses with transport infrastructure. The LC scenario can propose changes to transport routes
or the creation of new transit nodes to improve land use–transport integration and facilitate even
higher density development. Solid waste management system options known to increase a city’s car-
bon performance are also changed in the model. Energy demand, energy spending (in real terms),
and emission levels are then calculated for the new configuration.

Step 5: Compare development options. The models employed in this analysis have been used
to estimate the technical potential for change in energy demand, emissions, and other variables,
but not the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. It highlights indicative changes that can
be attributed to different policy decisions or estimates of how and where growth will manifest itself
around a city. By comparing the energy and emission impacts of different development options,
local and regional authorities can identify the types of policies that affect the long-term economic
and environmental sustainability of their city. Action plans can then be prepared to comprehensively
review and, where appropriate, adjust these policies to minimize emissions.

Findings

The first option is business-as-usual (BAU), which assumes the continuation of low-density growth
of residential, office and industrial development. For residential development, which accounts for
the majority of both floor space and energy use, residents in high-rise Communist-era apartment
blocks are assumed to continue the recent market trend of moving to single-family homes in the
suburbs around Bucharest. Consequently, low-rise’s share of total residential building stock grows
from 42 percent in 2014 to 60 percent in 2050. The BAU scenario involves extensive suburbanization
in the ring 10–15 kms from the center of the city, since there is insufficient land to accommodate low
density residential growth within Bucharest (Figure 5.6). Given the absence of public transport in this
outer ring, residents would need to rely on private vehicles for journeys to work, education, shop-
ping, and recreation. Indeed, the BAU scenario is notable for its lack of integration between new
development and public transit (trams, buses and metro).

In the BAU scenario, overall energy use and associated emissions continue to increase through
2050. While this is to be expected given the low density development and lack of coordination with
transport planning, what is most surprising is the slow rate of growth in GHG emissions. Even as
demand for energy continues to increase between 2014 and 2050 as a result of the demographic
and spatial trends—including a 30 percent increase in population and building area—carbon emis-
sions grow much less rapidly (at nine percent) over the same period. This is explained by a number
of positive trends in building (including anticipated improvements in building efficiency; changes
in carbon intensity of the electricity grid; and reduction in technical losses in the district heating

system), transport (fuel efficiency gains and cleaner fuel mix), and solid waste management (rates of
recycling and biodegradable waste diversion).

Under the BAU scenario, there are efficiency gains in buildings, which can be attributed to sev-
eral current trends. Key trends even in the BAU scenario include renovation of the existing building
stock at the current pace of one percent per year, energy savings from retrofits at a conservative
15 percent, new buildings with moderate energy savings of 45 percent (due to various EU policies)
compared with existing building stock.11 Total GHG emissions from buildings are also affected by
changes in the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, as coal-fired plants are largely replaced by
natural gas facilities. The thermal efficiency of buildings in the Bucharest-Ilfov region is also expected
to increase thanks to anticipated reductions in technical losses from the district heating system (from
15 percent to 13 percent).

Rising vehicle-kilometers travelled are somewhat offset by efficiency gains and a cleaner fuel mix.
As people move to the suburbs, the number and average length of trips increase while speeds
decrease as a result of increased congestion (and speed is an important determinant of emissions).
Under the BAU scenario, the number of trips is projected to increase by 30 percent and average
trip length by eight percent during 2014 to 2050. However, all vehicle classes will also experience
efficiency gains (of 40 percent in private vehicles and almost 20 percent in buses) as a result of cur-
rent EU directives on fuel efficiency and natural replacement of vehicles (an increase in Euro III/3 and
later vehicles and a decrease in less-efficient older models). In the absence of coordinated land-use
and transit policy, it is assumed in the BAU scenario that modal split will stay the same, but there is
a trend towards a cleaner fuel mix, with particularly notable growth in LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)
consumption in private cars.

Lastly, under the BAU scenario, it is anticipated that rates of recycling and biodegradable waste
diversion in Bucharest would reach half the levels mandated by EU targets. In the solid waste
sector, emissions are projected to increase along with population and income growth. While waste
composition is assumed to remain constant over the time period, management of waste is expected
to change in line with the current trend of improvement.

The second option modeled is a Low Carbon Development scenario under which spatial develop-
ment in BIMR exhibits less sprawl, higher densities, mixed-use, and a coordination of transit and
spatial planning when compared to the BAU scenario. The LC scenario assumes proactive local
action to reduce energy consumption in buildings and transport and to change local solid waste
practices, and ambitious national initiatives to promote clean power and cleaner vehicles. Spatially,
growth is concentrated in a number of strategic areas (Figure 5.7). The LC scenario creates two major
new sub-centers with high densities and a mix of residential, office, and retail uses. Very high-density
residential is distributed in the immediate vicinity of metro stations, reflecting a strong coordination
of transport and land use planning.

Efficiency gains from urban land use and reduction in travel distances can be achieved in the LC
scenario through spatial planning. In terms of residential development, the LC scenario halves the
share of low-rise development, doubles the share of high-rise development, and more than doubles

the share of very high-density development in 2050, compared to the BAU scenario. Retail becomes
more dispersed in high-density communities, reducing the need to travel to shops. Similar to the
BAU scenario, the Low Carbon scenario assumes that 100 percent of industrial development is in
industrial estates; spatially, these are concentrated in two large industrial parks strategically located
close to rail and expressways. For space of institutional buildings, the LC scenario assumes a drop in
government buildings’ share, accounting for e-government reforms that reduce the need for build-
ing space. Education’s share increases, reflecting a qualitative improvement in space per student.
The amount of land allocated to healthcare facilities increases, reflecting a growing demand from an
aging population. Transportation’s share grows only slightly, reflecting an increase in the number of
metro stations and hubs by 2050.

Unsurprisingly, proactive spatial planning leads to significant improvement in energy use, energy
spending and emissions, even though the gross building area remains the same as in the BAU sce-
nario. The scenario leads to carbon emissions reductions of 37 percent relative to a BAU pathway,
with buildings-related energy use delivering three-quarters of savings. (Figure 5.8) The biggest dif-
ference between the LC and BAU scenarios is the attention to land use planning. In particular, devel-
opment of high density buildings and mixed uses around transit nodes is reflected in a changed
modal split, with a nine percent increase in public transportation and a three percent increase in
non-motorized transit.

Reduced energy use cuts total energy spending by US$1.4 billion per year in real terms. In the
buildings sector alone, energy savings amount to US$956 million per year by 2050. Thermal energy
savings, relative to the BAU scenario, amount to as much as US$632 million. Given that retail prices

for heating are set by the government, it is likely that most of these savings will accrue to the municipal
budget—an important savings given the large burden of subsidizing thermal energy use in Bucharest.

Emissions from buildings, transport, and solid waste in BIMR will see reductions by 2050 under the
LC scenario, but with different key drivers. Under the Low Carbon scenario, reductions in building-
related emissions will come from reductions in fossil fuels for electricity generation and improvement
in transmission and distribution efficiency, in addition to the increase in the proportion of higher-
density buildings. Also important will be actions by both local and national governments to increase
the rate and depth of building energy efficiency above and beyond the BAU path. Together, these
factors push building-related emissions 38 percent lower relative to the BAU scenario. In transport,
new spatial patterns will lead to reductions in the number and length of trips and in traffic conges-
tion. Combined with measures to improve vehicle stock and efficiency, transport emissions in 2050
are 23 percent lower in the LC scenario than the BAU scenario, with a total (real) savings in energy
spending amounting to US$440 million per year by 2050. Moreover, particulate matter (PM10) emis-
sions will decline by 39 percent and nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions by 16 percent, relative to the
BAU scenario. These improvements in local air quality, along with improvements in urban mobility,
can make Bucharest a much more attractive and healthier place for people to live and work. While
its relative contribution to region-wide emissions is low, the solid waste sector under the LC option
shows a greater reduction proportionate to its BAU development trajectory than any other sector.
An 80 percent reduction in emissions relative to BAU is achieved if Bucharest-Ilfov meets all EU tar-
gets with regards to recycling and biodegradable waste diversion. Emissions reductions are driven
primarily by a reduction in methane, via a combination of composting and the capture of 100 percent
of the methane emissions from local landfills (Figure 5.9).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The modeling of a greener path for BIMR summarized in this chapter provides local authorities
with insights into how policies affect the speed, location, and density of urban growth and the
resulting GHG emissions. Government must consider the type, mix, and location of transport infra-
structure, the local waste infrastructure, and the degree of integration between different land uses
and transport services, which together can strongly influence the long-term economic and environ-
mental sustainability of a city. Delivering changes that lead Romania to a low-carbon future will take
considerable financial resources and strong political leadership on the part of a range of stakehold-
ers. The following table presents different categories of recommendations that focus more directly
on initiatives the Bucharest Municipal Government, District governments in Bucharest, and Ilfov
County, and Commune officials should consider.

Other Romanian cities interested in this type of assessment are encouraged to evaluate the quality
of data available for their city and consider application of the RACE model, keeping the fundamental
limitations of the model in mind. RACE should be used to obtain knowledge into indicative changes in
energy demand, energy spending, and emissions levels that can be attributed to different policy deci-
sions or strategic changes in how and where growth should be directed around a city. The RACE model
highlights the value of strategic planning in promoting more compact city design, transport-oriented
development (and other policies resulting in changes in modal-split), upgrades to more efficient vehicle
stock, and policies promoting building efficiency upgrades. Such changes in a city’s development path
can deliver sizable reductions in annual energy spending and emissions levels.

                                  management).

                                  Improve management of suburban growth: Design, enact as a statutory               Administrative and policy
                                  instrument, and enforce a growth management strategy for the metropolitan         reform
                                  region that limits uncontrolled suburban sprawl, and subsequent
                                  consumption of agricultural land and forests.

                                  Promote mixed land use: Adopt mixed land use policies, where different            Land use policy reform
                                  types of land use (housing, shops, offices, other urban amenities) are
                                  interspersed rather than segregated, thus providing more convenient access
                                  to goods/services and employment opportunities. Mixed land use policies
                                  are recognized for their ability to reduce the use of motorized transport.

                                  Up-zoning: Change the floor-to-area (FAR) ratio allowed on certain land           Land use policy reform

                                  or economic activity that can be accommodated. Note that these changes
                                  must be made to take into account the carrying capacity of local streets,
                                  sidewalks, and parking areas to ensure they do not become overloaded.

                                  targeting these changes in the vicinity of high-capacity transit nodes, thereby
                                  increasing the size of the population likely to make use of the mass transport
                                  system. Note that these changes must be made in close coordination with
                                  relevant transport agencies to ensure that transit system capacity (overall, or
                                  at specific nodes) does not become overwhelmed by higher rates of usage.

                                  Preferential lane space for public transport/high occupancy vehicles:             Roads policy reform
                                  Dedicated lane can ensure that high occupancy vehicles are not adversely
                                  affected by slow-moving vehicles. Interest in public transport use typically
                                  increases if it is seen as a time-saving option compared to private vehicles.

                                  used to facilitate vehicle movement around the city. Different parking policies
                                  (e.g., variable rate pricing with higher rates during peak travel periods,
                                  on-street parking bans, or time-based restrictions) should be considered
                                  for important thoroughfares. Land-use policies can also be amended to
                                  promote the creation of more off-street parking. On the periphery of the city,
                                  ‘Park and Ride’ facilities should be established at the end of high-capacity
                                  transit lines to encourage the use of public transportation when entering
                                  Bucharest. (Such systems are critically needed if congestion pricing programs
                                  are established in the urban core. See below.)

                                Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) finance: PACE systems create                Public finance
                                a revolving loan fund that can be tapped to support energy efficiency
                                upgrades. Property owners can apply for these funds, which are then paid
                                off via a surcharge on their energy bill (typically at a rate equivalent to the
                                energy savings the upgrades deliver to the building). Because the loan is
                                attached to an individual property rather than the owner of the property,
                                when the property is sold/transferred, the loan obligation is immediately
                                transferred as well. PACE programs can be capitalized by private investors or
                                other municipal finance strategies.

                                Green mortgages: Green mortgages typically enable borrowers to obtain             Public finance
                                larger mortgages (or preferred rates) because their properties have been
                                certified as meeting minimum efficiency standards. The monthly savings
          Building efficiency




                                on energy spending can thus be transferred to allow the borrower to afford
                                higher monthly mortgage payments. Local authorities can partner with and
                                promote the Romania Green Building Association’s new green mortgage
                                program that provides preferential rates to property owners buying or
                                investing in more efficient buildings.

                                Point of sale efficiency upgrades/audits: To bring older buildings closer         Energy policy
                                to the energy performance of new buildings, these requirements must be
                                satisfied before a property can be sold, transferred from one occupant to
                                another, or renovated beyond a certain limit. To ensure that the retrofit
                                burden does not become excessive, such policies typically cap the total cost
                                of required improvements at some fraction of the sale or rental price. These
                                requirements mesh well with EU-imposed building performance disclosure
                                requirements, because underperforming properties can easily be identified.

                                Energy efficiency capacity-building programs: Local authorities can create        Energy policy/education
                                programs to improve local knowledge of building efficiency upgrade
                                opportunities. These programs can be run centrally out of City Hall, or
                                support can be given to relevant community-based organizations in a strong
                                position to influence/inform the public.

          for its continued ability to meet demand for water from end-use sectors—households,
          industry, agriculture, and hydropower. The water sector in Romania is facing a dual chal-
          lenge: water availability is dropping and demand for water increasing, both due to climate
change. Irrigation supply is constrained by inadequate irrigation infrastructure, while irrigation avail-
ability is becoming critical for agriculture due to climate change. Similarly, supply reliability for indus-
trial and domestic use is most challenged for basins with lower water endowment during the summer
months. Hydropower generation will both constrain and be constrained by water demand in other
sectors in Romania. It is also sensitive to water scarcity in basins during the dry season. Adaptation
efforts are, therefore, important.

A series of models were used to analyze the impact of climate change on water availability and
demand and the offsetting impact of adaptation measures: climate models, water and agriculture
models, and adaptation scenario models for financial evaluation of proposed green investments.
Two green (adaptation) scenarios—Green and Super Green—were compared to the outcomes in the
Baseline scenario. The analysis found that climate change will lead to decreased river runoff, which in
turn will negatively affect the water demand-supply balance. In agriculture, water availability will be
threatened during the primary growing months, while demand for irrigation will increase due to rising
temperatures and decreasing and more variable precipitation. Unmet municipal demand will be mod-
est, but industrial activities may be more seriously affected if no adaptation efforts are undertaken.

Climate change presents a substantial risk to agricultural production, irrigation, municipal and indus-
trial water uses, and hydropower generation in Romania. However, these risks can be addressed
by green growth investments, which would significantly counteract the negative impact of climate
change on crop agriculture in most regions and even increase crop yields beyond current levels. The

most promising green growth investments—(i) rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure, (ii) optimizing
agronomic inputs, including fertilizer inputs, and (iii) adopting improved, drought tolerant, crop vari-
eties—were assessed for their impact on crop yields (productivity) and their financial impact. While
the first two measures have clearly positive productivity and financial outcomes across regions and
crops and should be implemented at the country level, the third one (crop varieties) is estimated to
provide benefits in particular regions and crops, to which it should be targeted.

Required investment in the Green scenario, with modest adaptation actions, amounts to €1.8 bil-
lion or 0.05 percent of GDP, while the Super Green scenario, with very ambitious and more expen-
sive adaptation actions, requires €11.0 billion in investment costs or 0.32 percent of GDP.1 The
schedule of investments generates a higher burden for 2015–2030 when approximately 65 percent
of the total required investment occurs.


CHALLENGES FOR GREENER GROWTH

Overview

Romania’s water resources are moderate but sufficient with prudent resource management that
would ensure conservation and sustainability; regional and interannual variation is, however, sig-
nificant. The utilizable level of water resources (surface and ground) in Romania, as defined by the
existing capacity to extract and use water, is 40 billion cubic meters (BCM) per year, while total water
demand stands at eight BCM per year. With a current population of 20.2 million, per capita water
availability in Romania amounts to approximately 2,000 cubic meters per capita per year. This value
is lower than the European average of 4,500 cubic meters and only slightly above the international

1.  Euro amounts are present values using a five percent discount rate.

threshold for water stress of 1,700. Water withdrawals, however, remain at a modest level, substan-
tially below the international benchmark for pressure on available water resources—water stress
is defined at 10 percent of water withdrawal as a share of water resources, and Romania’s level is
3.2 percent. (Figure 6.1) However, various uses and locations of water are interlinked, and Romania
faces a challenge from the significant interbasin and interannual variation in water availability. In the
driest years, water availability has fallen to 20 BCM. Water availability also varied across basins, and
the basins of Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzua-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and Dobrogea-Littoral are facing
water scarcity. (Figure 6.2)

There is a degree of overcapacity in the water supply system, due to the steady decrease in water
demand caused by structural changes in the economy starting in the 1990s. Current water demand
comprises industry (67 percent), agriculture (18 percent), and municipalities or households (15 per-
cent). Water demand has steadily decreased since the 1990s because of the reduction in industrial
activity and shutdown of economically unviable irrigation schemes, as well as due to the introduction
of water metering and tariffs and reduction of system losses in domestic water supply. Total demand,
in terms of volume of water made available to users, decreased from approximately 20 BCM per year
in the early 1990s to 8 BCM in 2012, while water consumption in the latter year equaled 6.5 BCM.

Challenges

Romania’s water sector is vulnerable to climate change, and adaptation efforts are essential for its

culture, and hydropower. The water sector in Romania is facing a dual challenge: water availability

is dropping, and demand for water increasing, both due to climate change. Water availability is
decreasing due to the warmer and shorter winters, with less snow volume and earlier and faster
snow melting, lowering of the groundwater table in summer months, and less precipitation. Water
demand is increasing due to higher summer temperatures and higher evapotranspiration, pushing
up demand for water not only from agriculture, but also from industry and municipalities. Further,
water quality will tend to degrade due to higher summer temperatures, through decreases in dis-
solved oxygen, eutrophication and algae growth. The wastewater sector will suffer from more fre-
quent floods, storm water infiltration in sewer systems, and direct inundation of treatment facilities.
The hydropower capacity factor, and therefore hydro generation output, will be adversely affected
by decreased water availability. Hydropower facilities and storage reservoirs will be also affected by
increased flooding.

Irrigation supply is constrained by the inadequate irrigation infrastructure, while irrigation avail-
ability is becoming critical for agriculture due to climate change. Irrigated area in Romania has
decreased from two million hectares (ha) in the early 1990s to approximately 0.8 million ha that
is currently considered irrigable with functional infrastructure, as economically unviable schemes
were closed down. Moreover, land under irrigation has remained below 300,000 ha for the past
five years. Irrigation volume fell from eight BCM per year in the early 1990s to one BCM per year
in 2012. There are areas of water scarcity in many basins, where summer droughts are a significant
concern. This situation is becoming more serious with the increasing impact of climate change,
including rising temperatures and reduced rainfall across Romania. Addressing this challenge
will require adopting climate-resilient agriculture and updating river basin plans—while taking

climate change impacts into account—to reassess the sustainable levels and modes of irrigation
in water-scarce basins.

Similarly, supply reliability for industrial and domestic use is most challenged for basins with lower
water endowment during summer months. The majority of the basins in Romania have no serious
problems in ensuring sufficient volume of water to meet municipal and industrial demands. However,
the basins with lower endowment of water (Jiu, Arges-Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and
Dobrogea-Litoral) face supply reliability challenges during the summer months, especially in dry
years. The Dobrogea-Litoral basin is the most severely affected in this regard: as a result, almost
95 percent of the supply for the city of Constanta is being sourced from groundwater, which is being
pumped from significant depths of 300–700 meters. A number of cities in the Banat and Moldova
basins also face water scarcity in summer months. These cases, however, stand apart from the sit-
uation in most of the urban areas in Romania, especially Bucharest, which have multiple sources of
water and offer significant buffer supplies and a high degree of reliability.

Hydropower generation will both constrain and be constrained by water demand in other sec-
tors in Romania. It is also sensitive to water scarcity in basins during the dry season. Romania’s
hydropower potential is estimated at 36 terawatt hours per year, and the generation in 2012 was
19 terawatt hours (using six gigawatts of generation capacity). Hydropower generation accounts
for 33 percent of Romania’s total electricity generation. While coal and other fossil fuels remain the
primary source of energy and electricity generation for Romania, the share of renewable sources
of energy is large and increasing. The government intends to decommission and modernize some

of the high-emission and obsolete thermal power plants and is considering options for promoting
growth of renewable capacity, including support of small- and micro-scale hydropower generation.2

While hydropower is not a consumptive user of water, operation of hydropower facilities reduces
the amount of water available for other uses. Therefore, the proposed new hydropower facilities
would need to be planned while taking into account existing and anticipated future water uses in all
sectors, as well as projected water availability in each basin under climate change. In the basins with
the highest climate change impact, where scarcity already arises in summers of dry years, new hydro-
power plants will not be viable and the existing hydropower production will be adversely affected
for a short duration. These constraints can be alleviated to a large extent by careful systems planning
and operations optimization accounting for climate change impacts. Furthermore, the development
of new hydro infrastructure will need to ensure that the environmental and hydro-morphological
impacts are managed in compliance with the requirements of the European Union’s Water Frame-
work Directive.


METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS

Methodology

The water analysis aimed to assess how climate change affects water availability and how green
(adaptation) policies and investments can offset the impact of changing water availability on sec-
toral outcomes in water-consuming sectors, especially agriculture. Financial evaluation of the pro-
posed green measures was also conducted. The analysis was based on scenario modelling. First,
climate scenarios were generated and used for water availability projections and crop yield and
hydropower impact estimates. Second, three scenarios were used to assess the impact of green pol-
icies and investments: the Baseline scenario and two adaptation scenarios, Green and Super Green.
The Green scenario required a moderate adaptation effort, while the Super Green involved ambi-
tious interventions necessitating significant investment. All three scenarios account for the impact
of climate change on water availability and water demand. Table 6.1 provides details of the green
measures (policies and investments included in each scenario) being evaluated. The emphasis is on
measures in agriculture, making the modeling findings important for both the water and agriculture
sectors.3 Water sector outcomes were measured using indicators of annual water availability and the
water demand-supply gap in agriculture (irrigation), in the municipal and industrial sectors, and in
the energy sector (hydropower demand). Agriculture sector outcomes were measured by crop yields
in irrigated and rainfed areas, before and after the implementation of green measures, and related
revenues and costs. Hydropower production outcomes were estimated by the indicators of annual
generation of hydropower and related revenues and costs.

The following models were used for the analysis: global General Circulation Models (GCMs), a water
run-off model (CLIRUN), an agricultural yield model (AquaCrop), and the Water Evaluation And Plan-
ning (WEAP) model. The models were implemented in the following sequence (Figure 6.3):

   were modelled.

In addition to modelling, analysis involved financial evaluation of the measures used in the Green
and the Super Green scenarios: the WEAP and AquaCrop output—hydropower generation and
crop yield results—were analyzed to produce projections of the cost and revenue flows from crop
production and hydropower and to calculate on that basis the net present value of the proposed
green investment in these sectors. Also, the benefit-cost ratio was calculated, where benefits were
estimated as direct financial flows that result from the investment. Evaluated investment options
included construction and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and optimization of its usage,
fertilizer enhancement, and improvement of crop varieties. The irrigation improvement measure was
only included in the Super Green scenario, while the other two measures were applied in both Green
and Super Green scenarios. A discount rate of five percent and a base year of 2014 were used for
the present value calculations.

The water and agriculture sector analyses address four policy-relevant issues: (1) the possible adap-
tive responses by farmers to climate change and the resulting marginal impact on agricultural pro-
duction and incomes; (2) projected impacts on energy (hydropower) production under the modelled
development and climate scenarios; (3) trade-offs between alternative water uses (for irrigation,
hydropower, and municipal and industrial use); and (4) financial implications of climate change and
green growth investments.

Findings

Unmet Water Demand

Climate change will have a negative impact on water availability in all climate scenarios by the
2040s, suggesting rising unmet demand for all types of water users. Water availability (mean
annual runoff) improves in early decades under the low climate change scenario, but suffers a gener-
ally negative effect under the medium and high climate change scenarios, particularly in the 2040s.
In the 2020s, the projected changes in annual runoff compared to 2014 range from a decrease of
seven percent to an increase of 20 percent. By the 2040s, the changes are dampened somewhat at
the national scale but are universally negative, ranging from a reduction of 0.7 percent to 8 percent.
Monthly figures tell a more nuanced story. Figure 6.4 shows total mean monthly runoff across the
91 subbasins under both the 1961–2000 observed trend and under the three climate change scenar-
ios during 2030–50. During April to September, runoff changes range from a 30 percent reduction to
a 30 percent increase. Importantly, the majority of months under two of the climate scenarios show
falling runoff throughout the April to September period.

Climate change will threaten water availability for agriculture during the primary growing months,
while raising irrigation water demand, resulting in larger unmet irrigation needs for a majority of
months for all climate scenarios. Falling runoff throughout the agricultural growing period of April to
September emerges in two of the three scenarios, suggesting threats to irrigation water availability.
(Figure 6.4). On the other hand, all climate change scenarios show a rising irrigation water demand
due to the uniformly increasing temperature effect. Under the high climate change scenario, there
is more than a doubling of demand of irrigation water in the more arid months between 2014 and
the 2021–2050 period. Although demands fall in the eastern part of Romania under the low climate
change scenario, all subbasins show increasing irrigation water demand of between 10 and 100 per-
cent under the medium and high climate change scenarios. As a result, unmet irrigation increases
in the majority of months for all scenarios, starting at between 5 and 14 percent in the observed
1961–2000 trend between April and September, and rising to between 9 and 17 percent under the
climate change scenarios. (Figure 6.5.a) The majority of unmet irrigation water demands occur in the
western part of Romania, and severe unmet water demands are confined to only a few subbasins.

Unmet municipal demands are modest but industrial activities (as well as agriculture) may be
adversely affected by climate change without adaptive efforts. Figure 6.5.b–c presents the percent-
age of mean monthly industrial and municipal demand that is unmet, within the observed 1961–2000

period and under each of the climate change scenarios. Unmet municipal demands are fairly mod-
est, ranging from zero to approximately one percent under the medium climate change scenario.
On the other hand, unmet industrial demands are more significant, particularly considering that they
constitute approximately 75 percent of the total water withdrawals of Romania. Under the observed
conditions, the unmet industrial demands are fairly constant over the year, and remain under five
percent. Under the low climate change scenario, unmet demand reaches nearly 15 percent in Sep-
tember, suggesting that many industrial activities may be adversely affected by climate change with-
out adaptive efforts. Unmet demands are as high as 25 percent in some subbasins, and increase
significantly between the observed conditions and three climate change scenarios.

Hydropower will also be affected by the decreased river runoff. At 19 terawatt hours in 2012, hydro-
power generation accounts for approximately one third of total electricity generation in Romania,
and is therefore an essential component of energy security. Mean annual hydropower generation
is projected to increase in the 2020s and 2030s under the low climate change scenario, due to the
projected increases in river runoff.4 However, hydropower generation declines under the other seven
scenario-decade combinations, most significantly in the 2030s and 2040s under the medium climate
change scenario where hydropower production falls by nearly 10 percent. Also of significance is that
hydropower generation decreases in the 2040s under all three climate scenarios. Within individual
subbasins, decadal average hydropower generation is projected to fall by a maximum of 50 percent,
and increase by a maximum of 30 percent.

While water sector modeling shows a decrease in water availability for all types of use including
hydropower generation, it did not aim at evaluating whether expansion of hydropower in the
future would be beneficial. Such analysis requires considering all sources of power generation as
a system, taking into account available energy resources. The energy supply analysis (Chapter 3)
aimed to find the least-cost solutions for the future structure of power supply taking into account
multiple constraints, including resource limitations. This analysis was done using an optimization
system model, TIMES. The findings showed that hydropower plants will still be producing power
to satisfy approximately one-third of the total power demand in Romania in 2050 under all three
scenarios—Baseline, Green, and Super Green. In each of the three scenarios, nine megawatts of
new hydro capacity would be constructed by 2050. This analysis took into account Romania’s current
hydropower potential and applied a low capacity factor of 35 percent to future hydropower genera-
tion, accommodating the water sector modeling projections of decreased river runoff.

The focus of the water sector investments was primarily on water demand management, rather
than on available augmentation alternatives. The investment options include improved irrigation
efficiency, municipal and industrial delivery efficiency, and municipal water use efficiency. Irrigation
efficiency options included both conveyance improvements (e.g., lining irrigation canals), and field
level improvements, such as converting from flood to sprinkler irrigation. Municipal and industrial
efficiency improvements would focus on repairing leaking delivery systems and potentially install-
ing leak prevention systems. However, the reductions in unmet demands resulting from these

4. Note that hydropower results are only presented under the “no investment” policy scenario, because differences in
generation under the ‘no investment’ and under the Super Green policy scenario were minimal. The effect of the Super
Green irrigation expansion is minor because (a) most of the expansions are anticipated to occur in basins with lower levels
of existing hydropower capacity and (b) the consumptive use of projected irrigation represents a small portion of the over-
all water budget of Romania. The future development of hydro generation capacity was modeled using an energy system
model, TIMES (see Chapter 3 (Energy)). The outcomes show that hydropower generation will constitute approximately
30 percent of total generation capacity in Romania by 2050 in both the Green and Super Green Scenarios. There are no
investments envisaged under either Scenario.

investments were minimal because the existing unmet demands in the system occur during years
when extremely low flows occur and are dedicated wholly to meet minimum environmental flow
requirements. If little or no water is available to be used consumptively, then decreasing withdrawal
requirements through efficiency improvements will have limited effect. More effective alternatives
may include increased basin storage, interbasin transfers, conjunctive use between surface water
and groundwater, improved reservoir management practices, or potentially allowing periodic relax-
ation of environmental flow requirements as needed.

Impact of Climate Change on Crop Yields

In the agriculture sector, analysis considered impact of climate change on yields of irrigated and
rainfed crops across administrative regions of the country and by type of crop. It is clear that rain-
fed crops will be negatively affected by higher temperatures and lower precipitation, and the analysis
of green scenarios aims at evaluating how to target adaptation efforts geographically and by crop.
Climate change affects crop yields through changes in soil moisture, direct temperature effects on
crop growth, and changes in the evapotranspiration requirements of the crop, among other effects.
Under the medium climate change scenario (which is considered to be the most likely one), rainfed
yields will generally decline but irrigated yields will tend to improve due to climate change, and this
effect is exacerbated over time.

The yields of rainfed crops differ significantly by crop and by region. Certain rainfed crops such as
maize, barley, and winter wheat tend to perform well in some regions. Some crops, such as rainfed
winter wheat in northern and some western mountainous regions, stand to gain as much as 20 per-
cent in yield increases from climate change in the 2040s owing to more mild and damp winters. The
most sensitive crops to forecasted climate change, with forecast yield reductions of 10 percent or
greater, are rainfed sugar beets, particularly in the Southeast, South Muntenia, and Bucharest devel-
opment regions (up to 35 percent yield reductions); rainfed potatoes and tomatoes in all regions (up
to 19 percent yield reduction in southern regions); rainfed alfalfa (lucerne) in southern and western
regions (up to 13.5 percent yield reductions); and rainfed maize in South Muntenia and Bucharest

(about ten percent yield reduction). In economic terms, the maize reductions are a great concern (the
reductions occur in the southern regions).5 (Figure 6.6)

There are substantial crop yield benefits from irrigation. Irrigated yields will tend to improve under
climate change. This finding indicates that if water stress is removed by irrigating, then the direct
temperature effects of climate change may have a positive effect on future crop yields. Climate
change expands the differential between rainfed and irrigated yields for almost all regions and for
almost all crops. The largest positive gains are in winter wheat, alfalfa, maize, and barley, while sug-
arbeets and tomatoes are projected to experience the largest declines. As a result of this general
finding, the primary investment option considered in Super Green was a significant expansion of
irrigated areas. By moving from rainfed to irrigated hectares, farming would become much more
resilient to the effects of climate change.

Off-setting Climate impact on Crop Yields with the Help of Adaptation Measures

The most promising green growth investments for yield improvement are (1) rehabilitating irriga-
tion infrastructure to restore irrigation production to certain currently rainfed areas, (2) optimizing
agronomic inputs, including fertilizer inputs, and (3) adopting improved, drought tolerant, crop
varieties. The latter two measures form the basis of the Green scenario, and all three options are
the focus of the Super Green scenario. Improved rainfed crop varieties generate between 0 and

5. These results coincide well with previous climate change analyses for the agriculture sector conducted jointly by the
National Meteorological Administration and the National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science Agro-
chemistry and Environment—ICPA Bucharest.

10 percent yield increase, whereas optimizing fertilizer application can produce anywhere from a
4 percent to a 70 percent yield improvement, depending on crop, region, and whether the farm
is rainfed or irrigated. A number of farm-level investments were evaluated for their potential yield
improvements, including adopting improved drought tolerant crop varieties, converting from rain-
fed to irrigated, improving soil drainage, improving soil aeration, optimizing fertilizer application
and optimizing the timing of irrigation water application. The yield improvements generated from
improved varieties and fertilizer application for each crop and administrative region (for 2040s) are
presented in Figure 6.7. Impact of improved crop varieties are presented for rainfed crops only, while
optimized fertilizer application is shown for both rainfed and irrigated crops.

Financial Assessment of the Proposed Adaptation Measures

Financial assessment estimated the costs of the identified adaptation measures and the resulting
revenues. Benefit-cost calculations suggest that the largest gains from the green investment would
be in the Southeast and South-Muntenia regions; the next tier of good investment potential is found
in the Northeast and West regions. The highest investment payoffs for optimized fertilizer applica-
tion programs are in the South-Muntenia, Northeast, and Northwest Development Regions. In gen-
eral, fertilizer programs show strong returns to investment throughout Romania, and for best results
could be targeted for the farms of medium size (roughly 10 ha), to ensure that the measures encour-
age consolidation of the smallest farms while also avoiding provision of an unnecessary subsidy to

the largest farms, which are already quite productive. These investments are consistent with those
being considered as part of Romania’s National Rural Development Plan, but would likely require a
larger investment in adaptation measures than is currently contemplated if they are to be deployed
at a sufficient scale to counteract the negative risks of climate change.

In both the Green and Super Green scenarios, revenues will exceed costs resulting in a significant
positive net present value of the overall investment (Figure 6.8 and Table 6.2). The overall net pres-
ent values of the proposed adaptation measures for Romania under the Green and the Super Green
investment options are projected to be positive at €1.8 billion and €11.0 billion, respectively.6 With
Super Green investments, the net present value is dramatically higher due to the broader set of
investment options that are considered. The schedule of investments puts a higher burden on the
period 2015–2030 when approximately 65 percent of the total required investment is made. The
benefit-cost ratio of the investments is above 1 in both scenarios, demonstrating that benefits
exceed costs: it equals 1.8 in the Green and increases to 1.9 in the Super Green scenario. While
financial outcomes are positive at the scenario level, they vary across the selected green measures.
Two of the measures—enhanced fertilizer application and rehabilitated irrigation—have positive
net present values and benefit-cost ratios exceeding 1 (benefits outweigh costs) in both scenarios
and across regions, while with the third measure—improved crop varieties—costs tend to outweigh

benefits in most regions. However, there are exceptions: clearly positive financial outcomes are
shown for improved crop varieties in two regions—South Muntenia (the benefit-cost ratio is 2.0 in
the Green and 2.3 in the Super Green scenario) and Bucharest-Ilfov (benefit-cost ratios in the Green
and the Super Green scenarios are 2.6 and 2.8 respectively),—as well as for particular crops, mainly
maize and wheat.


Conclusions and Recommendations

Climate change presents a substantial risk to agricultural production, irrigation, municipal and
industrial water uses, and hydropower generation in Romania. However, these risks can be
addressed by green growth investments. The greatest investment potential exists for optimizing
agronomic inputs, including fertilizer inputs, and rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure to restore irri-
gation production to currently rainfed areas. This would significantly counteract the negative impact
of climate change on crop agriculture in most regions and even increase the crop yields beyond
current levels. The highest net present value results for irrigation investments are in the Southeast
and South-Muntenia regions; high values were also found for the Northeast and West regions. The
second measure—optimized agronomic inputs—would require investment in high-quality extension
services, as well as increased and/or subsidized availability of fertilizers, with the payoff being a
significantly increased crop yield. Fertilizer programs show strong returns to investment throughout
Romania and for best results could be targeted to the farms of medium size (approximately 10 ha)
to encourage consolidation of the smallest farms while avoiding subsidization of the largest farms,
which already have high productivity.

A targeted approach to improved crop varieties—focused on particular regions and crops—is
likely to be most successful. Modeling shows that using this measure will lead to positive outcomes
in South Muntenia and Bucharest-Ilfov regions: net present values of investment are positive and
benefit-cost ratios range from 2.0 to 2.8. Positive financial outcomes of the implementation of this

measure are also observed with particular crops: maize (especially in selected southern regions)
and wheat. At the same time, other regions and crops generally show negative financial results in
response to this measure. Therefore, implementation of the improved crop varieties measure should
be well targeted by both region and crop because in many other regions and for many other crops,
the present values were negative and the benefit-cost ratios were below one.7

As a result of this assessment, a set of tools for water sector investment analyses has been devel-
oped and transferred to local counterparts in the Ministry of Environment, as well as other local
stakeholders. These tools can be applied to further assess the irrigation and other water and agri-
culture investment options, both individually and in combination with water-use efficiency options.
They can also be used to assess multi-sectoral water use strategies. The results developed in this
assessment, as well as further assessments using the tools transferred to local counterparts, can have
lasting benefits for evaluation and prioritization of a broad range of water and agriculture sector
investment options.

The required investment in the Green scenario amounts to €1.8 billion (present value8) or 0.05
percent of GDP, while a more aggressive Super Green scenario requires €11.0 billion in investment
costs (present value) or 0.32 percent of GDP. The schedule of investments puts a higher burden on
the period 2015–2030 when approximately 65 percent of the total required investment is made. It
is also worth noting that the Green investments would be a manageable increase from 2013 levels
of agricultural sector support of €1 billion direct payments, and €1.3 billion of rural development
expenditures. By contrast, Super Green investments would represent a substantial increase from cur-
rent spending and would quickly exhaust the 2014–2020 National Rural Development Plan’s financial
allocation for irrigation infrastructure, which is over �400 million or about �65 million annually.

                to a changing climate. Agriculture in Romania remains important to overall economic
production and the leading sector for employment, despite poor crop yields and low farm incomes.
An important cause of low productivity is the large share of subsistence agricultural holdings. The
ageing farm population and out-migration will likely trigger commercialization of the sector over
time, but effective policies will be essential to address the risk of land abandonment and the issue
of land fragmentation. The sector needs to consider adaptation to a changing and less favorable cli-
mate going forward, made more difficult by insufficient agricultural extension and inadequate infor-
mation on new research and techniques. At the same time, agriculture (which accounts for 17 per-
cent of Romania’s emissions of greenhouse gases, GHGs) needs to contribute to their containment
into the future. Although the sector stands at the bottom of the EU ranking of agriculture emissions
intensity due to the low productivity of the sector, this performance will worsen once agriculture
becomes more efficient, unless mitigation measures are taken. Romania’s National Rural Develop-
ment Program already specifies some measures for mitigation and adaptation in agriculture and
provides some funding, but more is needed.

The impact and costs of green adaptation policies and investments on sectoral outcomes in
agriculture was assessed through joint modeling of water and agriculture. A suite of interlinked
models was used in this analysis, including General Circulation Models (GCMs), the Water Evalua-
tion And Planning (WEAP) model, a climate runoff (CLIRUN) model and an agricultural yield model
(AquaCrop). The green scenarios applied in the models include the following measures: rehabilita-
tion of irrigation infrastructure, adjustment of crop varieties, and improvement of fertilizer applica-
tion. Analysis was concluded with a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, where two measures, currently

supported by the EU via the National Rural Development Program 2014–2020, were considered:
minimum tillage and manure management. The outcomes of modeling show the negative impact
of climate change under a baseline scenario on yields and the improvement in yields that can be
achieved using green measures. Irrigation was found to provide the largest gains in yields. A modest
‘Green’ scenario will require an expenditure of about two billion $US (discounted to present value)
and generate revenue of over four billion. In the more ambitious ‘Super Green’ scenario, costs rise
to over $US 13 billion while revenues rise to $US 31 billion. In both cases, benefits outweigh costs by
more than a factor of two.1

The recommendations emphasize the importance of rehabilitated and modernized irrigation, spe-
cifically in rainfed areas, as well as optimization of agronomic inputs such as fertilizer. Fertilizer
programs show strong returns to investment throughout Romania, and, for best results, could be
targeted at farms of medium size (roughly 10 hectares) to ensure that the measures encourage con-
solidation of the smallest farms while also avoiding provision of an unnecessary subsidy to the largest
farms, which are already quite productive. Recommendations also include encouraging forest belts2
and soil management to reduce soil erosion; promoting renewable energy sources, organic farming,
and good farming practices; improving awareness of climate change and of the need for adaptation;
and strengthening policy and institutional capacity. Financing needs for the two key recommended
measures—no tillage agriculture and manure management—total €516 million or 0.01 percent of
GDP. Most of the financing needs will occur during the last two decades of the period analyzed,
2030–2050.


CHALLENGES FOR GREENER GROWTH

Overview

Romania is endowed with high quality agricultural resources, has a history of being “the bread
basket of Europe,” and tops the EU ranking by the share of the agriculture sector in the economy.3
Romania is among the best endowed European countries in terms of its agricultural land, fertile cher-
nozem soils, and water resources, and agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of the Roma-
nian economy.4 While the share of agriculture in total gross value-added fell over the last decade by
more than 50 percent, to six percent in 2012, it remains the highest share in the EU (where agriculture
averages less than two percent of gross value-added). Romania ranks eighth in the European Union
in value of total agricultural output.5 Agricultural employment constitutes about 29 percent of Roma-
nia’s total employment (even after dropping by one-quarter over the last decade), compared to
the average of about five percent across the EU. Romanian agriculture is crop-oriented: near three-
quarters of agricultural output derives from crops, the highest share in the EU, where the average

is about half. Agricultural land occupies almost 62 percent of Romania’s total land area, and nearly
two-thirds of the 13.3 million hectares, which are considered highly-productive arable land, are used
mainly to grow maize and wheat (see Figure 7.1).6

Despite high quality land resources, Romanian agriculture is characterized by low productivity, and
rural areas have much higher poverty incidence. The modest contribution to national output but a
high share of employment points to the low productivity of the sector. In fact, average crop yields in
Romania are 30–50 percent below the EU average, and labor productivity per full time equivalent in
farming is four times lower than the EU average. The country was importing 70 percent of its food
in 20117 and consistently had a negative agriculture trade balance (i.e., imports exceeded exports)
during 1990–2012. While the 2013 trade balance was positive and there are preliminary estimates
that it will stay positive in 2014, it is unclear if this represents a stable trend, especially consider-
ing the long-term downward drift in agricultural production (see Figure 7.2). Also, the structure of
agricultural trade shows a prevalence of commodities in export and a domination of final products
in imports.8 Agricultural incomes are low, and the rural population is poor. Romania has the lowest
agricultural incomes in the EU, amounting to only 22 percent of the average EU farm income per

unit of full time employment.9 Romania’s rural population is poorer than the rest of the country: more
than 70 percent of Romania’s poor live in rural areas, while the share of rural population is 45 percent.

An important factor in low productivity is the large share of small and inefficient agricultural hold-
ings. Romania has the lowest average farm size in the EU, equaling 3.4 ha, placing it only ahead of
Malta and Cyprus.10 It has a large number of very small agricultural holdings: its 3.7 million farms
account for one-third of the total number of farms in the entire EU. Behind the averages lies a dual
farm structure: a very large number of subsistence and semi-subsistence farms and a small number
of large commercial agricultural holdings, with medium-size farms mostly absent. This structure of
landholding is a result of the redistribution of agricultural land soon after transition began in the early
1990s. Currently, more than 93 percent of Romanian agricultural holdings, managing over 40 percent
of the utilized agriculture area, are subsistence and semi-subsistence farms, while less than 0.4 per-
cent of the farms, averaging over 420 ha each, are large-scale commercial units (see Figure 7.3a).11

The ageing farm population and out-migration of the younger generation could trigger a sig-
nificant change in the structure of the sector in the next 15 years. Today, 40 percent of the farm
population is 65 and older, and by 2030, this share will grow to 60 percent (see Figure 7.3b), driving
an accelerating natural turnover in farm holdings. Rural out-migration is also high. It is estimated
that the population of rural areas is declining by 4.5 percent per year on average, with declines at
the county level varying from 1.0 to 11.6 percent.12 Within the next two decades, over two million

Romanian farms, occupying 75 percent of the utilized agricultural area, will be subject to inter-
generational transfer. Considering the high rate of rural out-migration by the younger generations
over the last two decades, this transfer will mean that the land will be inherited by non-farmers in
many cases. Whether this demographic shift will trigger modernization of the Romanian agriculture
sector by allowing the larger consolidated holdings required by a modern commercial sector will be
influenced to a large extent by policy choices by government. Effective policies will be essential to
address the risk of land abandonment and counter further land fragmentation. The incomplete land
reform of the past has become a major hindrance, and transaction costs for land registration today
are an almost impossible hurdle to overcome. Policymakers will be challenged to tailor the various
instruments available and the financing possible from EU and other sources to promote the transfor-
mational process without negative social impacts.

Romania’s agricultural agenda is connected to the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU (CAP),
which provides a framework for mainstreaming climate change mitigation and adaptation activi-
ties. Since EU accession and implementation of the two pillars of the CAP (direct payments and the
rural development program), Romanian agriculture has received access to financial support under
the CAP.13 With the reform of the CAP in 2013, climate change mitigation and adaptation has become
one of the cross-cutting objectives to be pursued by all member states through all agricultural sup-
port measures. The new direct payment scheme obliges member states to spend a minimum of
30 percent of their national envelope for “greening” activities: crop diversification, maintaining per-
manent grassland and maintaining the ecological focus areas.

13. During the first programming cycle of implementing the EU CAP, Romania was entitled to receive €13.7 billion, of
which €5.6 billion was primarily used to support farmers by direct payments (Pillar I of CAP) and €8.1 billion for a co-
financed National Rural Development Program (NRDP 2007–13). For the current programming cycle 2014–20, the finan-
cial allocation increased to €19.8 billion. European Commission (EC). Multiannual Financial Framework 2014–20. Available

Romania’s National Rural Development Program (NRDP 2014–20) provides a strategy and mea-
sures for mitigation and adaptation in agriculture. The NRDP is eligible for co-financing under the
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Within rural development measures, a
minimum of 30 percent of the total expenditure in Romania has to be earmarked for mitigation and
adaptation.14 Direct payments are available for holdings with a minimum farm size at one hectare
(ha) or the minimum size of the crop parcel at 0.3 ha; over 70 percent of the farms in Romania do not
qualify. Only 46 percent of the national envelope for direct payments has been secured by 99 percent
of the qualifying farms.


CHALLENGES

Adaptation

Climate change will be a significant factor in the future of Romania’s agriculture sector; and the
negative impacts of a changing climate are already a reality. The farming (or crops) sector is most
vulnerable to climate change, while livestock is less so. It has been estimated that from 1980 to 2011,
Romania suffered average annual weather-related losses of $US 8,452 million, or 0.26 percent of
GDP, of which 34 percent was linked to drought. The crops that experience the most severe impacts
are typically rainfed crops grown in the traditional summer season, such as maize, sunflower, and
fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, some crops may benefit from the direct effects of climate
change (as well as elevated CO2 levels), notably those that gain from longer and warmer growing
seasons such as autumn-sown winter wheat or pastures (see Findings). The extent of vulnerability
is related to farm size. Large-scale crop farms commonly have very specialized production, and low
diversification increases the risk of crop loss due to weather variability and localized extreme weather.
At the same time, large-scale farmers have better resources to adapt: they have access to financing,
and economies of scale allow for the installation of irrigation systems and climate-resilient farming
practices and technologies. In contrast, small-scale subsistence farmers are socially and economi-
cally vulnerable to climate change. However, in some cases, intrinsic resilience can be found within
communities of small farmers due to their low use of inputs and recycling of resources, existing low-
carbon economies, diversity of production within the community, strong social relations and (in some
regions) alternative sources of off-farm income. The resilience and adaptive capacity of these more
diverse communities has the potential to be further developed.15

The vulnerability of Romanian agriculture to climate change is worsened by insufficient agricultural
extension and inadequate information flow from results of research. The dissolution of the National
Agency for Agricultural Consultancy has disabled the effective delivery of advisory services and has
deprived the agriculture and rural development administration of its most important information dis-
semination instrument. Farmers have lost access to government-supported knowledge and support
services, which are of greatest importance to subsistence farmers. With inadequate advisory ser-
vices, farmers benefit only marginally from the results of research, increasing their vulnerability. With-

out government support, the existing research network is failing to provide advice to subsistence
farmers that is relevant for the specifics of small-scale agriculture.

To adapt to the changing climate, Romanian agriculture will need reliable irrigation infrastructure.
The existing irrigation systems are old, and only those owned by water-user organizations (WUO)
have been recently partially rehabilitated. The infrastructure was built in the pre-transition years for
a non-market rural economy based on large state farms and is not fully relevant for today’s irrigation
demand and farm structure. Also, the infrastructure was built without taking into account the climatic
characteristics of various regions nor the cost of water and electricity (for pumping). Much of cur-
rent irrigation is in the semi-arid areas of the south and south-east, where non-subsidised irrigation
can be unaffordable for farmers. Irrigated area significantly declined in the 1990s and, by 2010, cov-
ered only 75,000 ha or 0.6 percent of the total utilized agricultural area. A governmental emergency
decree in 2013 led to an increase of irrigated area to 180,900 ha.

Mitigation

Agriculture is a significant contributor to overall GHG emissions in Romania, and Romania faces cur-
rent, imminent, and prospective mitigation obligations. Romanian agriculture accounts for 17.4 per-
cent of the total emissions in the country and is the third biggest emitter after the energy and trans-
port sectors. This level exceeds the EU average of 10 percent.16 Romanian agricultural emissions are
closely connected with the management of soils, livestock numbers, and rural biomass usage: the
main components are nitrous oxide (N2O), which comes from soil nitrification and manure manage-
ment, methane (CH4) from enteric fermentation by ruminants, and carbon dioxide (CO2) from fuel used
mainly for heating and for operating machinery (with the overall composition of emissions at 50 per-
cent N2O, 45 percent CH4, and five percent CO2) (see Figure 7.4). Romania already faces obligations to
reduce emissions under the EU ‘2020 climate and energy package’ which is under implementation until

2020. Agriculture is a ‘non-ETS’ sector, meaning that the sector does not participate in the EU Emis-
sions Trading System. Romania’s non-ETS sectors altogether (including housing, agriculture, waste and
transport) cannot increase emissions by more than 19 percent by 2020 relative to 2005. (See Chapter 2
for more details on Romania’s current and future mitigation obligations.)

Romanian agriculture’s current low emissions intensity is driven by the sector’s low productivity
and will worsen as agriculture becomes more efficient. The country ranks as the fifth lowest in the
EU by emissions intensity of its agriculture (see Figure 7.5).17 It also has relatively low emissions inten-
sity by the main components: it ranks sixth lowest in the EU by carbon dioxide (CO2), tenth lowest
by nitrous oxide (N2O), and eleventh lowest by methane (CH4). This outcome is mainly explained
by a high share of subsistence farms, which rarely use non-organic nitrogen fertilizers and have low
mechanization, by a limited area of rice cultivation (a big producer of CH4), and by a low share of
livestock production. Decreasing livestock numbers show a strong correlation with the reduction
of agricultural GHG emissions (see Figure 7.6), and a potential recovery of livestock farming will be
accompanied by a rise in emissions. Livestock farming in Romania declined through the 1990s; how-
ever, there are signs of recovery. While cattle numbers are still declining (and are projected to decline
for the next 10 years), the number of other ruminants (sheep and goats) have been increasing since
2005.18 Once the livestock sector revives, agricultural GHG emissions will rise unless measures are
taken to control them: in particular, changes in livestock feed need to be implemented to mitigate
methane emissions.

METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS19

Methodology

The impact and costs of green adaptation policies and investments on sectoral outcomes in
agriculture was assessed through joint modeling of water and agriculture. A suite of interlinked
models was used in this analysis, including General Circulation Models (GCMs), the Water Evalua-
tion And Planning (WEAP) model, a climate runoff (CLIRUN) model and an agricultural yield model
(AquaCrop). The models forecasted yields and prices of the crops that account for more than
50 percent of Romania’s total agricultural production: maize, barley, potatoes, soybeans, sugar
beets, sunflower, wheat, tomatoes, and alfalfa. AquaCrop was used to model crop yields and irri-
gation demand (see Figure 7.7). Last, the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) model
was applied, using the inputs from CLIRUN to analyze potential basin-level shortages in water
available to agriculture. Any estimated water shortage from the WEAP model was fed back to the
biophysical step to estimate the net effect of the shortage on irrigated crop yields. (See Chapter 6
for more details).

The agriculture sector modeling addresses the issue of the possible adaptive responses by farm-
ers to climate change and the resulting marginal impact on agricultural production and incomes.
Modeling outcomes were measured by crop yields in irrigated and rainfed areas before and after

19. Note that the agriculture sector was modelled together with the water sector, and the methodology and outcomes
on adaptation are derived mainly from water sector analysis (see Chapter 6) while outcomes on mitigation are distinct.

the implementation of green measures and related revenues. Evaluated green investment options
included the following:
n	   adopting improved, drought-tolerant crop varieties;
n	   converting from rainfed to irrigated crops;
n	   improving soil drainage;
n	   improving soil aeration;
n	   optimizing fertilizer application; and,
n	   optimizing the timing of irrigation water application.

The most promising options for improving yields were: (i) improving crop varieties, (ii) optimizing
fertilizer application, and (iii) converting from rainfed to irrigated farming. The first two options are
included in the Green scenario, and all three options are the focus of the Super Green scenario.
Importantly, investment in improved irrigation systems was included in the Super Green scenario.

Modeling started with a baseline scenario for agriculture through 2050. This baseline scenario
assumes that the economy of today would evolve over the next 35 years according to the pattern of
west European countries, while policies would gradually align with regional norms and no significant
new infrastructure investments would be made in agriculture beyond those already funded and/or
under construction. The baseline scenario incorporates the expected impact of climate change on
the demand for irrigation water and the impact of climate on water supply for all demand sectors
including irrigation.

Two green scenarios for agriculture—Green (modest adaptation effort) and Super Green (ambi-
tious adaptation effort)—were formed. While the baseline scenario involves no green improve-
ments, the Green and Super Green scenarios include the following adaptation measures:
n	   In the Green scenario, measures are applied over 530,000 ha identified as medium productivity
     areas that have potential for high productivity, and include: (i) improved fertilizer application,
     which results in yield increases in primarily rainfed crops, and (ii) improved drought-tolerant crop
     varieties (irrigated and rainfed), a measure supported by farmer training in their use.
n	   The Super Green scenario has: (i) extended application of improved fertilizer and varieties as in
     the Green scenario but applied over 2.1 million ha identified as areas of medium productivity
     with potential for high productivity, and (ii) expanded irrigation by 430,000 ha or five times the
     existing level, in areas identified as viable for irrigation expansion.

In addition to modeling, analysis involved evaluation of infrastructure investment options for
agriculture. Financial assessment of several water and agriculture sector investments used in mod-
eling provided a ranking. The financial assessment calculated the benefit-cost ratio and the net
present value of the cash flow of benefits and costs. Costs included both capital and annual oper-
ating and maintenance costs. Benefits were calculated as direct financial flows that result from the
investment.

Analysis of mitigation options in the agriculture sector were undertaken using a Marginal Abate-
ment Cost Curve (MACC). This approach evaluates costs and abatement potential of two mitigation
measures included in the NRDP: manure management and no tillage agriculture. The analysis is
done using a simple Excel-based tool.

Findings

The projected decrease in water availability due to rising temperatures will push up the demand
for water for irrigation, thus increasing the already existing demand-supply gap. Green actions
address this issue through several measures. The first set of measures is aimed at increased efficiency
of irrigation, e.g., lining irrigation canals and replacing flood irrigation by sprinklers. These measures
help reduce losses but are insufficient when not enough water is available for supply. In this case,
measures to improve reservoir management, increase basin storage, transfer water from basin to
basin, use surface and ground water interchangeably are applied. (See Chapter 6 for details.)

Water sector modeling analyzed the impact of climate change on yields of nine crops over 12
basins in the baseline scenario and found that rainfed yields mostly decrease under all climate
scenarios, with a varying severity of impact among types of crops and increasing impact over
time. In particular, maize, barley, and winter wheat will experience the least damage and will even
have higher yields with climate change in some basins, while sugarbeets, potatoes, and tomatoes
will suffer the highest yield loss. The regions that are projected to have the largest declines in yields
are South-East, South-Mutenia, and Bucharest-lifov. The pattern is different for irrigated crops: their
yields increase due to climate change because the impact of higher temperatures is positive if not
accompanied by reduced water availability (see a more detailed discussion of the impact of climate
on crops in Chapter 6).

Irrigation was found to be the most significant adaptation measure providing the largest gains in
yields. Among the green measures or investments aimed at increasing yields, irrigation is shown to

be necessary for the efficiency of crop farming for most of the crops and in all regions of the country.
Also, selecting climate change resistant crops would be important for productivity of agriculture. In
addition, optimizing fertilizer application will help achieve even higher yields. Selection of climate
resistant crops increases yields by up to 10 percent for rainfed crops, and fertilizer application opti-
mization pushes the yields up by four to 70 percent depending on irrigation availability, region (cli-
mate), and type of crop.

What are the costs and benefits of the green adaptation scenarios? Water sector modeling assessed
that in the period from 2015 to 2040, the Green scenario will require an adaptation expenditure, addi-
tional to any expenditures in the baseline, of $US 2,003 million (discounted to present value) and will
bring revenue of $US 4,345. The resulting net income will be $US 2,342 million. In the Super Green
scenario, measures applied over the same time period of 2015–2040 require significantly higher
investment but also result in much higher revenue than in the Green scenario. Costs are $US 13,304
million, revenues are $US 30,664 million, and net income is $US 17,360 million. In both cases, benefits
outweigh costs by more than a factor of two. The benefit-cost ratio is the highest for rehabilitated
irrigation and enhanced fertilizer: fertilizer’s benefit-cost ratio is 2.4 in the Green Scenario and 2.33 in
the Super Green scenario; while irrigation’s ratio is 2.59 in the Super Green scenario (a measure not
included in the Green scenario).20

Two mitigation measures are considered in the agriculture mitigation analysis using the Marginal
Abatement Cost Curve: minimum tillage and manure management. Both of these measures are
supported by the EU and the NRDP. The NRDP program includes afforestation, no tillage or low

20.  Unless noted, all multi-year costs are discounted to present value using a four percent discount rate; costs include
investment and operations and maintenance.

tillage crop agriculture, crop rotation, manure management (including composting and storage),
organic farming, and the promotion of renewable energy sources. Based on the available data, four
of these measures are included in the Romania Marginal Abatement Cost Curve: no tillage agricul-
ture, manure management, afforestation, and renewable energy sources. While the analysis of the
latter two measures is presented in the Forestry and Energy chapters of this report, the former two
measures are presented in the chart below. The ‘no tillage’ measure reflects the benefits of using no
tillage as compared with the current practice of using full tillage in fields. In the baseline scenario,
the measure is applied to a limited area of 90,000 hectares. Under the Green scenario, the area
where no tillage is applied is expanded to 300,000 hectares in the first five years of implementa-
tion and later to 900,000 hectares. The 300,000 ha are based on arable land which is susceptible to
desertification. While desertification is the threat and motive of the minimum tillage scheme, the
poor manure management (collecting, storage, treating, applying) of the past is the motive for the
new measure of “composting manure.” Farmers applying this measure implement stringent prac-
tices in storage and treatment of manure, which generates GHG savings per animal unit (not per
ha). The MACC analysis shows that the two evaluated measures have a low cost of abatement and
a reasonably high abatement potential, amounting to 7.6 percent of the total abatement potential
from the following sectors and subsectors: power supply, energy efficiency, transport, forestry, and
agriculture (see Figure 7.8).21

Financing needs were assessed for the recommended measures that were evaluated no tillage
agriculture and manure management (see Table 7.1). The measures are relatively inexpensive,
deliver high level of abatement, and are beneficial for sector development. The total discounted net
cost of both measures in the period 2015–2050 equals €516 million or 0.01 percent of GDP. The costs
increase over the period significantly, and almost half of the total financing will be needed during the
last ten years of the period. The benefits appear with a very slight delay, almost immediately after the
implementation of the measures.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The most effective adaptation measures for Romanian agriculture are rehabilitated and mod-
ernized irrigation to restore irrigated production to currently rainfed areas and optimization of
agronomic inputs accompanied by high-quality extension services. Expanded irrigation has a very
high potential for a positive investment payoff, provided water is available for the irrigation sector,
with the highest investment payoffs in the South-Muntenia, Northeast, and Northwest Development
Regions. In general, fertilizer programs show strong returns to investment throughout Romania, and
for best results could be targeted for those farms of medium size (roughly 10 ha) to ensure that the
measures encourage consolidation of the smallest farms while also avoiding providing an unneces-
sary subsidy to the largest farms, which are already quite productive. A targeted approach to new
varieties, focused on the South Muntenia region but also on maize production in selected southern
regions, is likely to be most successful. Recommendations also include encouraging windbreaks and
soil management to reduce soil erosion, promoting renewable energy sources, promoting organic
farming, improving good farming practices, improving awareness of climate change and the need
for adaptation, and strengthening policy and institutional capacity is vital to support the recom-
mended interventions.

Improvements in good farming practices, like manure management and minimizing erosion
through afforestation, can also reduce vulnerabilities.22 Other measures, such as promoting organic
farming and renewable energy from biomass, helping farmers and rural communities adapt to cli-
mate change, and improving awareness and better management of risks in the agriculture sector,
would complement the key investments in adaptation.

Financing needs for the two recommended mitigation measures—no tillage agriculture and
manure management—are low and are highly beneficial from the point of view of sector efficiency.
Emissions reduction is also relatively high. The total discounted net cost of both measures during
2015–2050 equals €516 million or 0.01 percent of GDP. Most of the costs are incurred later, with
43 percent falling in the last decade. In the first five years, 2015–2020, the implementation of the
measures will require only €69 million or six percent of the estimated financing need for 2015–2050.
Along with the key adaptation measures, all the measures proposed here are aimed at moderniza-
tion of agricultural holdings as well as at climate action in agriculture. Therefore, sufficient invest-
ment support should be earmarked for these measures within the NRDP 2014–2020.

Strengthening policy and institutional capacity is vital to support the recommended interventions.
The capacity of current research and development should be broadened, e.g., to strengthen applied
sciences on new climate-resilient crop varieties, but also to improve systematic monitoring of soil,
surface water, groundwater, and overall biodiversity. The EU- and national-funded support schemes
should be revisited to review how to improve the uptake of all farmers participating in climate change
mitigation and adaptation measures.

and Adaptation Potential?

CHAPTER SUMMARY




f       orests provide a substantial contribution to mitigation in Romania by sequestering car-
        bon and so countering carbon emissions from elsewhere in the economy. Romania has
        the largest remaining intact tract of contiguous natural and naturally-regenerated forest
        in Europe. Forests are important for sequestering (removing) greenhouse gas emissions
from the atmosphere, thus contributing to mitigation. In Romania, the Land Use, Land Use Change
and Forestry (LULUCF) has been removing an average annual 27 percent of emissions produced by
other sectors during 2000 to 2011 and 24 percent during 1990 to 1999. At the same time, forests in
Romania are being negatively affected by a changing climate, and adaptation efforts are needed to
preserve them and their ability to sequester carbon.

Sustainable forest management is challenged, in particular, by fragmented ownership and insuf-
ficient financial resources. The transition to a market economy in Romania generated significant
changes in the forest sector. As a result of the restitution, holdings are now mostly small, and the
forest system is fragmented, making sustainable forest management a challenging task. Incentives
are not aligned for owners of small private holdings to comply with the forest regulatory framework.
Limited road accessibility to forests is another constraint, negatively affecting harvesting, as well as
fire and pest control efforts. Lack of adequate financial resources, especially to assist smallholders, is
also a barrier to afforestation of agricultural land and establishment of forest belts.

A summary of key existing analytic studies and the construction of a marginal abatement cost
curve (MACC) for mitigation actions in the forestry sector were the basis for identifying key adap-
tation and mitigation measures for Romania’s forests. The package of measures that provides for
the largest CO2 removals includes afforestation of degraded lands at the rate of 10,000 ha per year,
creation of biomass from fast growing crops at a rate of 5,000 ha per year, implementation of “no-
till” practices for 40 percent of the arable land per year, in rotation, and increasing the area of nature

conservation and biodiversity protection. In addition to the national and international analytic out-
comes, a MACC was estimated by this Assessment for three measures: afforestation, sustainable
management of protection forests, and sustainable management of production forests. These mea-
sures can provide cost-efficient abatement for Romania of an estimated 1,828 kt CO2 per year in 2050
at a total cost of €115 million (discounted) for the period 2015–2050 or just 0.002 percent of GDP.
When benefits are taken into account, the total discounted net cost is a negative €86 million.

Recommendations stress the importance of sustainable forest management for Romania and the
desirability of the EU’s moving rapidly towards defining the rules (including the country level
targets and the flexibility rules) for LULUCF-based mitigation within its 2030 Framework. These
actions would enable Romania to use forests as an important component of the country’s mitigation
strategy. Adaptation measures in forestry, including those that benefit other sectors, in particular
agriculture and energy, should be supported. Policies aimed at reducing forest fragmentation and
engaging smallholders in sustainable forest management activities should be implemented. Creat-
ing and implementing a transparent and updated monitoring system for CO2 removal in forestry
together with a review of the modeling and analysis would support climate change mitigation. The
system for forest fire detection, monitoring and management should be upgraded. It is critical to
improve road accessibility. Necessary financing could be met by mainstreaming forestry actions into
the EU-funded programs (such as ecological reconstruction, small and medium enterprises, educa-
tion and extension, and other aspects of the NRDP), and reforming the policy and regulations for
forest management, to bring in private funds.

CHALLENGES FOR GREENER GROWTH

Overview

Romania has the largest remaining intact tract of contiguous natural and naturally-regenerated
forests in Europe. Forest removals are below the allowed annual cut level of 22.3 million ha: in 2013,
only 59 percent of the growing stock volume was removed (Figure 8.1). Romania’s forest stock is
young and, therefore, has a high potential to absorb CO2. The Romanian Network of Protected Areas
includes areas of national importance, reserves, parks and Natura 20001 sites, covering approxi-
mately 23 percent of the forest area. More than 693 nature reserves and natural monuments are out-
side the large protected areas and cover 102,534 ha.2 The biomass potential of Romania is estimated
at 88,000 GWh per year. The forestry sector in Romania, including industry, contributes between two
and five percent of Romania’s GDP.3 It is also an important employer, especially in rural areas. Export
of logs is a significant part of total forestry exports. At the same time, there has been a decline in the
wood processing industry. The reasons include poor road accessibility, outdated technology, and
inefficient production processes. An increasing part of the valuable wood resources has been used
for heating.

Challenges

Sustainable forest management has been made more difficult by the fragmentation of forest land
ownership that accompanied economic transition. The restitution process has fragmented the for-
est system and raised challenges for ensuring sustainable forest management. Restitution of forest
land ownership completely modified its structure: holdings are now predominantly small, and the forest
system has been left fragmented, making sustainable forest management a challenging task.4 By 2013,
36 percent of forest land was privately owned, while 64 percent remained in the public domain, includ-
ing state and municipal ownership. There are an estimated 830,200 forest owners, and most of them
(99.8 percent) own small forest parcels under 10 ha (Table 8.1). Incentives are not aligned for owners of
small private holdings to comply with the forest regulatory framework. The main reason for poor perfor-
mance of the afforestation programs was that the owners were not properly compensated.

Coupled with fragmented ownership, the lack of resources to approve and subsequently imple-
ment available management plans, is a serious challenge for sustainable forest management. There
are 272 management plans covering the protected areas, of which only twelve have been approved.
This also has consequences for flood management as investments in flood management in upper
forested watersheds were traditionally done by the forest administrators within forested areas. With-
out approval and budget these areas cannot have flood management. Investments in implementing
the management plans are important for decreasing the incidence of the flooding, water turbid-
ity and regulation of debris. However, due to the changes in ownership and the lack of budgetary
allocation to National Forest Administration (NFA) to continue those investments, the incidence of
flooding and fast moving water is increasing.

Limited road accessibility to forests is a significant constraint to sustainable forest management
in Romania. As a result, harvesting levels are below the recommendations of forest management
plans in inaccessible areas, while accessible forest stands are over harvested. Fire and pest control
are inefficient due to lack of access. The average road density for Romania is 6.4 m/ha, which is sig-
nificantly below other European countries with broadly similar topography.5 A low density of forest
roads implies the lack of access to timber resources in inaccessible sites, and/or the need to skid logs
for longer distances from the point where they are felled to roads where they can be loaded onto
trucks. Exploitation costs are higher since they increase with the length of skidding. Longer skidding
distance also results in erosion and soil compaction on arterial skidding trails.

Adaptation

Projected changes in precipitation and temperature in Romania are anticipated to weaken for-
est systems and decrease forest growth. Climate change causes shifts in ecozones, and the new
ecozones can be unsuitable for the existing trees. Climate change also compounds biological risks
to forests including pest infestation. Climate change can cause the drying of plants and species
and decrease the growth of forests. Already, approximately 1 million m3 of timber in Romania is lost
annually to wind and snow, and approximately 130,000 ha of the designated forest areas in the low-
land are affected by drying due to soil water deficit. Up to 30 percent reduction in tree population
and a decrease in growth, especially for forests in the plain areas, has been projected.6 With climate
change, ecozones shift, and previously planted trees might now be in an ecozone not suitable for
them. Tree species outside of their natural areas are more susceptible to negative biotic factors—
pests, water stress, and so on. Also, regeneration patterns change. In the mountains, forests are
invading pastures. In some places, the naturally regenerated areas at the border of forests and alpine
pastures are afforested with resinous species that now require special management. In the plains,
non-native species are invading natural forests. An example of climate change-related pest infesta-
tion is an increase in outbreaks of the bark beetle at higher altitudes and latitudes.7

Forest fires are intricately linked with forest pests and diseases-infested forest, with dying trees
more susceptible to forest fire, and fire damaged stands more prone to pest infestation. Forest
fires incidence in Romania under current climatic conditions is rather low. In the future, however, the

occurrence of forest fire in the south and southwest of the country is highly likely.8 This area is similar
to the area with the biggest incidence of forest fires in Europe (the Mediterranean region), where
85 percent of the forest fires are presently recorded, in its exposure to drought and its level of man-
agement.9 The current forest fires’ monitoring and intervention system is capable of coping with the
present level of fire incidence, but its effectiveness is negatively affected by many issues including
forest accessibility.

In the face of climate change, Romanian forest managers need to improve and choose the appro-
priate management approaches for maintaining and increasing ecosystem services from forests.
Romania has a national strategy for combating drought, land degradation and desertification. Activi-
ties included planting of trees to reduce soil erosion and restore degraded lands. The draft of the
New Forest Development Strategy (2013) envisages a role for forests in climate change mitigation
and highlights necessary measures for adapting forests. A new Forest Code was adopted by the
Romanian Parliament in March 2015. The key changes include: (1) judicious administration of national
forest on the principle of territoriality, with solutions for managing small forest properties which are
currently not covered by forest management and services; (2) establishment of national targets for
afforestation; (3) differentiation in the requirements for management planning based on the size of
the property; (4) restrictions on the total quantity of wood (per species and varieties) that can be
processed by companies to avoid monopolistic situations. Also, a new Government Decision seeks
to prevent illegal harvesting of wood, by establishing a system for control and supervision of wood
material traceability.

Forests are important in ecosystem-based adaptation strategies for other sectors, such as agricul-
ture In particular, forest belts should be used more to provide climate resilience and benefit agri-
cultural systems. Forest belts can help improve microclimatic conditions of growth for protection
of agricultural crops, up to a distance 25 times the height of belt in the sheltered areas and 5 times
in the exposed areas, due to the reduction of wind speed by 31 to 55 percent in the sheltered area
and by 10 to 15 percent in the exposed one. Belts are estimated to sequester 40 tCO2e/ha/year.
Other benefits include increased humidity and level of ionization of air at soil level, which enhances
soil fertility, reduces depth and duration of freezing, and decreases evapotranspiration. However, in
Romania, forest belts are not used enough and are even being eliminated.

Mitigation

Forests are important for sequestering (removing) CO2 emissions, and Romania’s forests are con-
tributing significantly to emissions reduction. Romania’s LULUCF sector (mostly its forestry compo-
nent) removed an annual average 27 percent of emissions produced by other sectors during 2000 to
2011 and 24 percent during 1990 to 1999 (Figure 8.2). Romania’s 2013 National Inventory Report shows
that from 1989 to 2011, GHG emissions calculated without taking LULUCF into account decreased by
55 percent; however, when factoring in LULUCF, they decreased by 61 percent.10 LULUCF sector emis-
sions are largely a result of land conversion to settlements, industrial uses, and similar uses, while for-
est land is the largest contributor of emission removals. In particular, afforestation of degraded lands
with limited agricultural potential offers the opportunity to reduce GHG emissions while generating

METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS

A summary of key existing analytic studies and the construction of a marginal abatement cost
curve for forestry mitigation actions serves to identify key adaptation and mitigation measures in
Romanian forestry.

The Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the Romanian Forest Research and
Management Institute (Institutul de Cerceta        ¸ i Amenaja
                                              ˘ ri s         ˘ ri Silvice, ICAS) undertook a forestry sector
modeling exercise in 2012, constructing a baseline and three green scenarios. The baseline included
a projected shift of trees to older age classes under current forest management norms and acces-
sibility conditions, a large scale investment in forest infrastructure, and natural disturbances resulting
in larger cuttings—all this will reduce carbon sequestration.11



11. It should be noted that a recent submission on LULUCF actions to the European Commission (dated January 2015)
noted that what has to be avoided is the lack of enforcement of laws that facilitate sustainable forest management
across both private and public forest lands. The main concern is related to practices that delay biomass regeneration and
encourage larger emissions from bare forest soils, stand degradation by selective cuts, and regeneration with native forest
growing low wood-density tree species.

A second study, led by ICAS, examines GHG projections for 2015–2030 under three scenarios:
n	 Scenario 1 (S1) assumes the current practices of resource management for all types of lands. This
   scenario also includes afforestation of 2,000 ha annually.
n	 Scenario 2 (S2) includes measures to improve land use by increasing annual harvest of wood to
   the pre-1989 levels, when there was excessive logging, and allowable annual extraction levels
   were constantly exceeded by 15–30 percent.12 The other measures included in the scenario are
   afforesting degraded lands at the rate of 5,000 ha per year, including re-vegetation and forest
   belts, from 2012 to 2030; and implementing “no-till” practices for 30 percent of the arable land
   per year, in rotation.
n	 Scenario 3 (S3) includes interventions to improve land use and additional financial incentives for
   specific public good services. In particular, it combines measures to increase annual harvest of
   wood to pre-1989 levels through intensification of forest management; afforestation of degraded
   lands at a rate of 10,000 ha annually, including re-vegetation and forest belts; creation of woody
   biomass from fast growing crops at a rate of 5,000 ha/year; implementation of “no-till” practices
   for 40 percent of the area of arable land per year from 2015 to 2030, in rotation; and increasing
   the protected area of nature conservation and biodiversity protection.

This study concludes that for the timeframe considered (2015–2030), the highest benefit (most CO2
removal) is under scenario S3, while the benefits under scenarios S2 and S1 are lower (Figure 8.3).

Based on recent projections, the highest CO2 removal benefits of Romania’s forests will continue
coming from the existing forests and their sustainable management. Afforestation (including con-
version of all other types of land to forest land and reforestation) is projected to bring significant
gains as well. Managing the existing forest resources is critical to maintain their sequestration poten-
tial. Projections show that forest management efforts will continue adding most value to the total
CO2 removals in forestry going forward, followed by keeping the existing forest intact. However,
other actions are also important. In particular, afforestation (conversions of land to forestland) will be
adding more value with time, after the initial investment is made. A projected decrease in the abso-
lute level of sequestration from the existing forest reflects a slightly diminishing value of the forest
stock going forward and the need to improve its management. (Figure 8.4).

Intensive management of forests and increasing sustainable harvesting of timber can increase
the level of CO2 sequestered compared to maintaining forest stands13 (see Figure 8.5). The rate at
which the forest is growing and thus absorbing CO2 should be highest when the stand is young, with
the exception of the first two or three years. If forests remain unmanaged, there will be more mature
trees. As the tree growth slows with maturity, they over-shade and suppress the growth of younger
and more vigorous stems. The young stock provides a lower CO2 removal per ha at an early stage,
but their sequestration potential is higher than in the mature stock. Increased management intensity
would result in a greater proportion of older trees being removed, leading to a better growth of the
younger trees and therefore increased CO2 removal ability of the forest. Also, trees removed can be
used in such carbon beneficial processes14 as construction using lumber, manufacturing of various
wooden products, e.g., chipboard or paper, or replacing fossil fuels with fuelwood.

Afforestation or conversion of all types of land, including degraded or abandoned lands, to for-
est, as well as reforestation, is an important option for mitigation in the forestry sector in Romania
due to the large area where such measures are applicable. Afforestation represented over 26 per-
cent of the total changed land area in Romania in the period 1990–2006. The National Program for
Afforestation projects a 422,000 ha increase in area under forest cover by 2035.15 Afforestation is a
cost effective mitigation measure. In order to estimate the cost of afforestation per hectare and the
expected sequestration, four afforestation projects have been analyzed for this Assessment. The
resulting growth of the carbon stock, assuming average site conditions, is reflected in Figure 8.6.
The average cost, without transaction expenses, is €6,000 per hectare, which corresponds to the unit
abatement cost of €120/tCO2/ha.16

A marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for three key mitigation measures in Romania’s forest
sector was estimated in addition to the review of analytic studies of forestry.17 The three main
measures examined for the forest sector are afforestation, sustainable management of protection
forests, and sustainable management of production forests. The measures examined are presented
according to two parameters of the MACC: potential mitigation impact (kt of emissions abated) and
the unit cost of abatement (cost per ton of CO2e abated).18 The estimates were made on the basis
of recent local data, collected and validated by Romanian experts.19 The outcomes are presented
in Figure 8.7, which shows that the proposed measures provide a significant potential abatement
level of 1,828 ktCO2 per year in 2050. The examined measures are evaluated as highly cost efficient:
two of them—protection forest management and production forest management—have positive
net benefits (or negative net costs) while the third measure—afforestation—has negligibly positive
net costs (Figure 8.7).

The afforestation measure focuses on degraded lands to address the problem of the declining share
of forest land and ongoing land degradation. This focus means higher costs but higher long-term
benefits. An average annual growth of 10 m3 per ha is assumed and an average of 1,000 ha per year is
afforested (a conservative assumption), resulting in the abatement (sequestration) of 10,000 tCO2 per
year. The initial cost is €6,000 per hectare, in line with actual current costs in Romania; it is projected
to decrease during 2015–2050 to €3,500 per hectare due to increased implementation efficiency and

learning curves for technology. Revenues are also assumed, from fuelwood produced by clearings
and non-commercial thinnings. The calculations were made using a composition of species and soil
conditions typical for degraded lands.

For sustainable management of production forests, constraints and solutions are considered when
estimating the MACC. For example, there is evidence that shorter rotations mean less distur-
bances, hence more valuable and healthy trees for harvest and a better CO2 accumulation in
wooden construction materials. The measure was estimated for Norway spruce. Shortening its rota-
tion from 110 to 100 years is assumed to result in a wood yield increase of 10 percent (a conservative
estimate). The average growing stock in this period is about 650 m3 and we have assumed that 10 percent
more wood will be graded for lumber, having this average growing stock. Having 65 m3/ha more wood,
the abatement potential is 65 tCO2/ha. The measure would cover 50 percent of the Norway spruce
forests, or 850,000 hectares. Considering a 10 percent higher carbon sink, the cost-effectiveness of
the shortened rotations is estimated, considering average productivity, harvestable volumes from
the yield tables, and operational costs (tending works, thinning and final harvesting operations).
The revenues were estimated using data provided by the NFA, current prices for different grades of
wood (obtainable from an average stand, with an average productivity), and the average assortment
of grades estimated on the basis of yield tables. The operational costs were also documented by
Romanian National Forest Inventory harvesting companies.

Sustainable management of protection forests was the third measure considered for MACC. The
measure is based on the assumption that Natura 2000 management plans will be enforced, resulting
in compulsory environmentally-friendly harvesting operations, the reduction of timber harvested as

salvage product, decreased damage to remnant trees, and less salvage products, in the long run.
The impact on CO2 sink is assumed to equal the amount of timber currently harvested as salvage
products from protection forests, which is 5 m3 per year per hectare. The measure is assumed to be
applied on 5,000 hectares per year. Net baseline benefits were calculated based on average cost
paid by the NFA for the protected areas. Green benefits (after the implementation of the measure)
have two components: the EU level of €33 per hectare from the implementation of this measure and
the compensation of €25 per year per hectare, to be paid through the Rural Development National
Program.20 The cost and revenue data were provided by the NFA.

To ensure the long-term maintenance of forest, sustainable management has to occur on both
state and private forest lands. The private landholders will need to be provided with the neces-
sary support to comply with the requirements including technical services, markets, and infrastruc-
ture. Many of these will require public investments or financial support to buffer the upfront cost.
In Romania, climate-sensitive sustainable management of production and protection forests will
require reversing existing constraints to technology, infrastructure, knowledge, research, and other
enabling conditions. Additional investments in afforestation would enable the Romanian Govern-
ment to increase harvesting of forest to the annual allowable cut while minimizing any associated
reduction in CO2 sequestration.

A simplified regulatory regime for small privately owned forest areas that still requires sustainable
forest management is required. The simpler regulation should enable owners of forests under 10 ha to
adhere to good forest practice and sustainable forest management guidance with simplified require-
ments for planning, marking, harvesting and sale of timber and non-timber forest products. The technical
norms need to be revised to better reflect advances in forest management, forest operations and asso-
ciated technologies (for example, nursery technology, seed quality, plant handling and site cultivation),
and knowledge of climate change and its impacts on forests.21 Incentives will be important for successful
afforestation initiatives. Of the 115,129 hectares of degraded area found suitable for restoration through
afforestation in 16 counties (roughly 14 percent of the total land area), more than 80 percent is under pri-
vate ownership or community management of public lands.

Financing needs for the three priority measures were evaluated: afforestation, sustainable man-
agement of protection forests, and sustainable management of production forests. (See Table 8.3).
The measures evaluated as highly cost efficient: two of them—protection forest management and
production forest management—have positive net benefits (negative net costs), and the third
measure—afforestation—has negligible positive net costs. The total discounted net cost of all three
measures for the period 2015–2050 is negative (or provides higher revenue than required costs)
and equals –€86 million. If benefits are not taken into account, the cost is €115 million for the same
period or just 0.002 percent of GDP. The schedule of costs requires approximately equal amounts
of funding annually. The benefits, however, appear later in the projected period, mostly after 2030,
because forestry measures require significant time to produce benefits.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations stress the importance of sustainable forest management for Romania and the
desirability of the EU’s moving rapidly towards defining the rules (including the country level
targets and the flexibility rules) for LULUCF-based mitigation within its 2030 Framework. These
actions would enable Romania to use forests as an important component of the country’s mitigation

strategy. Forestry in Romania is a key sector for mitigating climate change, as it removes 27 per-
cent of GHG emissions annually. Forest based mitigation measures can include conserving existing
CO2 sinks, enhancing carbon sinks and reducing the trade-off between the sinks, and tangible and
intangible benefits from other land uses. Adaptation measures in forestry are critical to enhance the
mitigation capacity of the forests. These measures also benefit other sectors, in particular agriculture
and energy. Romania should promote afforestation outside of forests and invest in afforestation of
degraded lands, create forest belts, and enhance management of forests in watersheds to reduce
flooding.

Policy measures that mitigate climate change and contribute to growth are critical, as well as
capacity building. Policies related to reducing forest fragmentation should be implemented, in par-
ticular those aimed at engaging smallholders in sustainable forest management activities. Capacity
for monitoring the contribution of forest management to mitigation should also be improved. Creat-
ing and implementing a transparent and updated monitoring system for CO2 removal together with
a review of the modeling and analysis would help provide more accurate assessments of the contri-
bution of forests to climate change mitigation. The system for forest fire detection, monitoring and
management should be upgraded. It is critical to improve road accessibility. To achieve it, financing
provided for forest roads should be based on the economic rationale, including the contribution to
climate change mitigation.

A greener path for forest will require additional public spending. Financial support to landholders,
especially private ones and in particular small landholders, will be necessary. This could be provided
in the form of public investments or financial support to buffer upfront costs associated with generat-
ing the larger public benefit. Other financing needs will fall primarily on the private sector, including
for forest roads. Necessary financing could be met by mainstreaming some of the necessary forestry
actions into other EU-funded programs (such as ecological reconstruction, small and medium enter-
prises, education and extension, and other aspects of the NRDP), prioritizing where interventions
are financed, and making sustainable management of forests profitable by reforming the policy and
regulatory requirements for forest management, to help bring in private funds. Financing needs for
all three priority measures that were evaluated—afforestation, sustainable management of protec-
tion forests, and sustainable management of production forests—equal €115 million (discounted )
for the period 2015–2050 or just 0.002 percent of GDP. When benefits are taken into account, the
total discounted net cost is a negative €86 million.

CHApTER SUMMARY



                      arginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC) are commonly used as a tool in eval-
                      uating emission reduction technologies in terms of their potential greenhouse
                      gas mitigation impact (emissions abated) and unit cost (cost per ton of CO2e
                      abated). They are also considered to be a most efficient communication instru-
ment used in discussions of abatement policies. MACC charts are designed to be a “brief”: they
compare technologies to be considered for implementation in a simple (easy to comprehend in a
limited time) but informative way. The technologies can be presented one by one or at various lev-
els of aggregation, including by blocks of technologies, by economic sector, or even by groups of
sectors. In the MACC, each technology has two characteristics: the level of abatement expressed
as millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), which equals the difference in emissions
produced by the new technology as compared to the technology it replaces (abatement potential)
and the cost of the technology per unit of abatement expressed as euros per ton of carbon dioxide
equivalent (€/tCO2e).

The MACC analysis presents a cross-sectoral snapshot of the benefits and costs of the mitigation
measures recommended on the basis of the sectoral modeling and analysis. Four sectors (energy,
transport, forestry and agriculture) were found to have significant potential for abatement. Sector
analysis summarized in the preceding chapters of this report resulted in a selection of a short list
of measures that constitute a green policy package in each sector. The mitigation measures from
this list are evaluated in the MACC analysis. The timeframe of 2015–2050 is driven by Romania’s EU
commitments: the current 2030 climate package, for which most details have been agreed, and the
Roadmap 2050. The long run target of 2050 is central in the analytic work of the assessment, because
the 2030 targets do not require much additional effort from Romania.

The Romania MACC ranks the selected measures from most cost effective to least cost effective.
The top measures in both cost effectiveness and abatement potential are in energy demand and
electricity supply; however, several other measures also provide significant benefits, particularly in
forestry and agriculture. Measures in transport are more expensive and provide more limited abate-
ment. Green actions across the four sectors have the potential to reduce emissions in the country by
38 MtCO2e in 2050, an equivalent of a 23 percent decrease from the level projected in the baseline
in 2050. The largest share of abatement—45 percent of the total—is projected for electricity sup-
ply. Energy demand will provide a third of the overall abatement, agriculture and transport close to
one-tenth, and forestry five percent. The unit cost of abatement ranges from €–78/tCO2e in energy
demand, to €16/tCO2e in energy supply, €–0.1/tCO2e in forestry, €12/tCO2e in agriculture, and €
154/tCO2e in transport.


CHALLENGES OF GREEN GROWTH ASSESSMENT AND MARGINAL
ABATEMENT COST CURVES
Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC) have become a commonly used tool in evaluating emis-
sion reduction technologies, presenting them in terms of their potential greenhouse gas mitigation
impact (emissions abated) and unit cost (cost per ton of CO2e abated). They are also considered
to be a most efficient communication instrument used in discussions of the abatement policies. In
the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in
2014,1 MACCs are described as a standard policy communication tool in assessing emission reduc-
tions and their cost effectiveness and one of “major approaches to reveal the economic potential of
mitigation measures.” In addition, they are an efficient way to present complicated mitigation data in
a clear way and a concise format, accessible for all audiences, including nontechnical stakeholders.
MACCs are specifically useful for decision makers, who, due to time limitations, cannot study the
details of research and analysis of green technologies and who usually make decisions on the basis
of briefs and summaries. MACC charts are designed to be a “brief”: they compare technologies to
be considered for implementation in a simple (easy to comprehend in a limited time) but informative
way. (Figure 9.1)

How can MACCs increase the quality of decisions regarding prioritizing abatement measures?
Clearly, they support budgeting decisions by showing the cost per abatement unit of various mea-
sures and compare abatement potential of measures relative to each other and across sectors. MACCs
also facilitate more detailed reviews of the mitigation measures. First, the way the measures are pre-
sented (ranked by unit cost and not grouped by sector) helps discussions of various combinations of
measures cross-sectorally, increasing the efficiency of the resulting mitigation program (lowering its
cost and maximizing abatement) and leading to budgetary savings. Second, MACCs produced for
different time periods (e.g., 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050) help to schedule the implementation of the
measures, and this is especially important because green growth requires long-term planning and
also because the sequence of measures affects the level of the total effort needed, both in terms of
the overall cost and institutional support. MACCs produced for different time periods help realize
that some measures provide benefits faster than other measures, and the implementation should be
scheduled accordingly. For example, energy demand actions provide swift returns, but energy sup-
ply actions require large up-front investments with benefits delivered years into the future. Forestry
measures require a stable investment flow, and benefits occur with a time lag but increase over a

long term. This is reflected in a set of MACCs produced for different periods. With this knowledge,
investments can be scheduled in an efficient way to guarantee that the results are achieved sooner
rather than later and to maximize the present value of the benefits long term, a standard approach
for green growth and climate change studies.

However, MACCs also have several limitations. They do not reflect all costs of the abatement mea-
sures. A way to think about it is to rationalize the negative net costs of some of the measures that
can be seen in various MACCs. Such negative net costs are typical for energy efficiency and forestry
measures, but can appear as characteristics of abatement options found in other sectors as well. If
the net costs are negative, does it means that benefits exceed costs and the measures should be
implemented with a profit, making them an investment opportunity for the private sector. However,
it does not happen because there are hurdles (both financial and nonfinancial) that are not captured
by the MACC analysis. First, there is a cost of making an up-front investment. While such cost is
lower for energy efficiency measures than for many other types of abatement interventions, it can
be quite large for the household or business who would implement a measure. Second, there is a
principal-agent problem (such as the owner, operator, occupant, and bill payer of a building are sep-
arate entities). Third, there is a problem with information about the measures, the benefits they bring
and the ways to receive subsidies. Fourth, there is a cost of implementation among a large num-
ber of small entities (households, businesses). In addition to these hurdles, MACCs do not support
nonfinancial decisions related to implementation of the abatement measures, including capacity
building, behavior change effort, reactions of nongovernmental stakeholders, and other institutional
considerations, and this has an implication for ease of implementation. While being useful for deci-
sion makers, MACCs do not supply complete information needed to select technologies, but rather
provide a quick insight into the subject. More information is needed to make an implementation
decision or have an informed discussion.

                              . . . a MAC curve is usually built for a future year, 10–50 years from now.



MACCs are charts showing a set of technologies that would reduce emissions from economic
activities. The technologies can be presented one by one or at various levels of aggregation, includ-
ing by blocks of technologies within a sector (e.g., demand-side energy sector technologies), by
economic sector (e.g., energy or transport), or even by groups of sectors (e.g., ETS sectors). In the
MACC, each technology has two characteristics: the level of abatement, MtCO2e, which equals the
difference in emissions produced by the new technology as compared to the technology it replaces
(abatement potential) and the cost of the technology per unit of abatement, €/tCO2e. The cost is
computed in the following way. First, it is calculated as the net present value of the flow of invest-
ment and operational costs over the period of time from the base year (today or in the recent past)
to a year in the future, which is selected as the final point of time for projections, e.g., 2050 or 2030.2
Second, the cost is calculated as marginal cost of technology replacement; as such, it equals the dif-
ference in cost between the new “green” technology and the current “non-green” options. Usually,
the difference in cost is a positive number because new technologies tend to be more expensive
than the old ones, but there are exceptions. Third, the cost is computed as net of benefits, which
could also push the resulting net cost into negative numbers. In cases when the net marginal cost
is negative, the technology is depicted on the left side of the chart, among the technologies that
provide net benefits3 (Figure 9.2). The technologies in the MACC chart are ranked using the second
characteristic, the unit cost of abatement. The abatement potential is usually presented for a year
in the future, e.g., 2050. It is also common to present cumulative abatement potential, combining
expected abatement for all the years between the present and the final year in the projections,
e.g., 2015–2050. MACCs are produced using modeling, and an overview of modeling approaches to
MACC creation is presented in Box 9.1.

2.  MACCs usually have a long timeframe because many of the measures require years or even decades to implement and
the benefits are fully realized with a time lag from the conclusion of the implementation.
3.  This issue has been extensively discussed elsewhere. A commonly asked question is why the green options that pre-
sumably provide net revenue are not being implemented by the private sector. The answer is that they do not provide
net revenue: the MACC costs only include direct costs of the technology (e.g., in electricity supply, it would be costs of
building and operating a power plant), but do not include other costs, such as transaction costs, financing hurdles, high
up-front costs, the costs of information failure, or nonfinancial costs (e.g., in housing energy efficiency, the costs of incon-
venience of moving out of one’s house or tolerating construction noise).

  BOX 9.1.   Overview of MACC approaches
  Multiple methodologies are available
  Marginal Abatement Cost Curves are created through modeling, which is used to calculate two charac-
  teristics of the technologies used in MACCs: unit cost and abatement potential. Prior to modeling, a list
  of technologies should be created, and a baseline defined, since both costs and abatement are calculated
  marginally to the baseline.

  The first stage of MACC analysis is the selection of greenhouse gas mitigation technologies to replace
  existing or standard ones. MACCs can be built at a sector (or subsector) level, for the economy overall,
  or even globally. If more than one sector is to be included, then sector selection comes first, followed
  by selection of technologies within those sectors. It is recommended to involve stakeholders at this step
  to have in-country information regarding barriers to technology transfer and measures to address these
  barriers, such as regulation, fiscal and financial incentives, and capacity building. Consultations are usually
  conducted in the form of workshops. Also, it can be useful to increase awareness using dissemination of
  technology information, expert lectures, visits, and demonstration projects.

  Modeling to estimate the marginal cost and abatement potential of each technology is the second stage
  of the MACC analysis. Three basic modeling approaches to constructing MAC curves are: a bottom-up
  individual assessment of technologies/abatement measures, bottom-up system modeling, and top-down
  macroeconomic system modeling. Hybrid approaches are also being used.

  The individual technology approach is the most common, despite some flaws. In this approach, abate-
  ment costs are defined at a technology level, commonly using cost-benefit models and often involving
  expert opinion. Each technology’s costs and abatement potential are evaluated separately, and the total
  is the sum of the individual technology characteristics. The problem with a technology-by-technology
  approach is that in real life, climate policies overlap, implementation costs vary, and sector-specific pol-
  icies can interact with each other. As a result, this approach can cause problems such as negligence of
  technical, behavioral, intertemporal and economic interactions, double counting, limited coverage of
  costs, path dependency, agency issues, and a limited treatment of uncertainty. On the other hand, this
  approach is popular and has been widely used, including by McKinsey & Company management consul-
  tants and by the Government of the United Kingdom. It is the most common approach to constructing a
  MACC, mainly due to its transparency, the relative ease in understanding the calculations and outcomes,
  and lower costs.

  System modeling approaches are receiving increasing acknowledgement. System modeling (both
  bottom-up and top-down) can include interactions among technologies and policies in the construction
  of a MACC, allowing assessment of the complicated joint impact of many variables that determine costs
  and emissions. For example, bottom-up models in transport take into account vehicle ownership and trav-
  elled distance; include energy demand for all modes of transport (air, cars, buses, heavy goods vehicles,
  light goods vehicles, rail); and track fuel use by vehicle technology (internal combustion engine, hybrid,
  plug-in, battery, other).

  In a top-down macroeconomic (or computable general equilibrium) model, emissions can be modeled
  via fuel use, and fuel emission coefficients and then constraints on emissions can be introduced with the
  price (cost) of emissions balancing demand and supply. However, system modeling is highly complex,
  often lacking in transparency, and difficult for non-experts to understand.

  Recently introduced advanced approaches hold promise but increase the complexity of MACC con-
  struction. Such approaches include generating MACCs by combining system modeling, decomposition

  costs suggests that top-down models should include an explicit representation of abatement technol-
  ogies with options such as production factor substitution, output demand reduction, and installation of
  abatement equipment other than fuel substitution.

METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS

Methodology

The Romania MACC analysis presents a cross-sectoral outlook of the benefits and costs of the
green technologies/measures that are recommended on the basis of the sectoral modeling and
analysis for the time period 2015–2050.4 The MACC analysis is the last step in the Romania Green
Growth Country Assessment and is connected and coordinated with the preceding modeling and
analysis. It uses the technologies/measures recommended by that analysis and the same input data,
but only mitigation measures are represented in the MACC: energy supply, energy demand, trans-
port, agriculture, and forestry. Urban measures are not included in the MACC to avoid double count-
ing: urban green measures are mainly a combination of transport and energy sector interventions
at the urban level, and these two sectors are already represented in the MACC. The timeframe is
driven by Romania’s EU commitments: the current 2030 climate package, for which most details have
been agreed, and the Roadmap 2050. The long-run target of 2050 is central in the analytic work of
the Country Assessment, because the EU’s 2030 targets do not require much additional effort from
Romania.

Romania’s energy, forestry, agriculture, and transport sectors all demonstrated potential for abate-
ment in the preceding sector analysis. In the energy sector, while the country has a relatively high
and growing share of renewable sources in power generation, energy supply remains dominated by
fossils fuels, with more than a third of primary energy supply in coal and oil and another third in gas.
The remaining third is almost equally divided between nuclear and biofuels. At the same time, the
country has some of the best wind resources in Europe, which, combined with the low price of wind
power, creates an opportunity for abatement. Also, bioenergy resources are significant and should
be utilized to lower emissions from the energy sector (since the emission factor of bioenergy is less
than half that of coal). Energy supply-side measures take a long time to implement, but the horizon
in the Assessment of 2050 provides enough time for benefits to be realized. Afforestation is a central
measure in forestry and promises to provide high abatement at a negative net cost (with benefits
exceeding costs in the long term). Forest management is a critical preventive measure, aimed at
keeping trees healthy and able to sequester maximum carbon. Agriculture measures would support
the abatement of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; these are low cost measures with a
high abatement outcome. Finally, in transport, regulatory measures could be used to create incen-
tives for households and businesses to buy less emission intensive vehicles and reduce the frequency
and length of driving.

The preceding sector analysis selected a short list of mitigation measures that constitute green
packages for 2015–2050 in each sector and that can be evaluated in the MACC analysis. This
approach provides consistency between the sector analyses and the MACC analysis. Also, this
approach supports a more detailed discussion of the mitigation measures (since the measures are
described in detail in the sector chapters), as opposed to a more superficial overview of a broader
set of available, but not necessarily recommended, technologies.

Romania’s MACC is a combination of sectoral curves, each of which was built using the most
appropriate approach for each sector. The approach used in each sector depends on data avail-
ability, accessibility and quality, as well as on the availability of the models. For electricity supply, the
specifications of the curve (potential abatement and cost of the generation technologies per unit of
abatement) were calculated using the TIMES energy supply model, which was also used for energy
supply analysis (see Chapter 3). For energy demand, a bottom-up detailed engineering model was
used (see Chapter 3). In forestry, agriculture, and transport, a bottom-up Excel-based approach was
used, and the measures were evaluated individually. In both agriculture and forestry, the calculations
were based on detailed sector data provided by Romanian experts. In transport, local data were not
available for many of the measures because there is no experience with these measures in the coun-
try; therefore, data from comparator countries were used. As a result, transport sector estimates are
based on a combination of local and global data. In all sectors, the timeframe for the analysis was
2015–2050. Discounting was used for both net costs and emissions. The same discount rate used in
the sector modeling was applied to the MACC calculations, ranging from three percent in forestry
to five percent in energy—typical social discount rates. Costs (before discounting) are in real terms,
and the base year for discounting is 2015. The overall process of building a MACC for Romania is
reflected in Figure 9.3.

Key green technologies in electricity supply for Romania were identified using a system model TIMES.5
In the MACC analysis, the model helped determine the marginal cost and abatement potential of each
of the following eight green (renewable or low carbon) generation options: solar photo­  voltaic (solar PV),
concentrated solar power (CSP), more hydropower (as compared with installed capacity), more wind,
biomass, natural gas plants with installed carbon capture and storage (gas with CCS), coal plants with
carbon capture and storage (coal with CCS), and nuclear power. The model constructed the best (mini-
mum cost) mix of generation sources to achieve a desired abatement level in eight different cases, cor-
responding to eight green generation technologies. This meant eight scenario runs, one for each of the
green generation options. The abatement level was set as a constraint, and each scenario maximized
generation from one out of the eight generation sources, considering many other variables/constraints in
the model: production/transformation facilities; transportation, transmission, and distribution networks;
various resource, technical, socioeconomic, environmental and other constraints including the size of the
plants, their capacity factor, and the need for back-up capacity. For example, in scenario 1, solar PV was
set to be maximized in the electricity supply system, and the rest of the generation technologies were
selected by the model. The model also calculated the cost of such a system and the cost of the baseline
system. The difference between these two costs constituted the marginal cost, which was then converted
into net present value.6

5.  TIMES (an acronym for The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) provides a technology-rich basis for estimating energy
dynamics over a long-term, multi-period time horizon. The model performs multiyear optimization (computing the least
cost path of an energy system for the specified time frame) and can be used to test a series of policy options, such as CO2
constraints, taxes or subsidies.
6. The energy sector MACC analysis differs from the energy supply optimization analysis described in Chapter 3. As
compared with the MACC approach for energy supply, the energy supply optimization analysis in Chapter 3 uses all avail-
able technologies as an input, then optimizes the projected generation structure based on costs, demand and resource
constraints and proposes a particular “best” structure of generation, which does not necessarily include all technologies.

The energy supply model is data intensive, and the input data included a number of variables.
These variables include those related to energy demand (GDP, population, households, and elas-
ticities of demand), primary energy and material resource potential and costs, policy settings (emis-
sion restrictions, emission taxes, and subsidies to technologies), and a description of technologies
(or processes) that transform commodities (fuels, materials, energy services, and emissions). The
key data sources were Eurostat, the World Bank, International Energy Agency, and World Energy
Resources. In addition, the energy demand data from the bottom-up demand model developed
in-house to compute energy demand by various types of energy consuming services was used.

Key technologies in energy demand and related calculations for the MACC used an Excel-based
bottom-up model and are based on very detailed data. The MACC for energy demand includes
end-use energy efficiency improvement to be applied in the household sector, because these mea-
sures bring the most immediate and effective (with high potential abatement) results. Energy con-
sumption in the household sector includes all energy using activities except personal transporta-
tion. Common end-uses associated with this sector include space heating, water heating, cooking,
lighting, air-conditioning, refrigeration and running a variety of electric and nonelectric appliances.
Future energy consumption in the residential sector is driven by various factors, including changes
in population, urbanization rates, household income, dwelling size and type, dwelling floor area,
energy mix, energy efficiency of appliances, appliances diffusion rate and standards, and household
preferences and behaviors.

The approach used for energy demand required collecting a wide range of data, which can be
grouped into three categories: energy consumption data, socioeconomic and demographic data,
and technology data. Socioeconomic and demographic data includes population, household size,
and housing stock attributes. Technology data includes technology penetration, emissions inten-
sity, and unit costs. The data were collected from many different sources including several national,
regional and international publications and, in particular, Romania’s National Institute of Statistics,
the EU’s Eurostat, and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Household activity parame-
ters were used to project future end-use service demand. With a base year of 2015, the projections
of end-use service demand were made through the year 2050 in five-year intervals.

The energy demand model used a simple Excel-based bottom-up framework for projecting the
penetration of each technology during the period of 2015–2050 under two scenarios—Baseline
and Green. The Baseline scenario reflects a moderate view of future energy demand based on a
continuation of current trends and provides a useful point of comparison for the impacts of choices
and/or of changes in alternative low carbon policies. In the Baseline scenario, population increase
and economic growth are the key driving factors that influence the outlook of energy demand in the
household sector. The Green scenario is designed to reflect the EU’s energy and climate strategies,
including the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework and the 2050 Roadmap for moving to a low
carbon economy. The Green scenario includes two phases: the first one runs from 2015 to 2030 and
follows the EU 2030 strategy. The second phase follows the EU’s 2050 Roadmap and runs from 2030
to 2050. The Green scenario involves increased (as compared with the Baseline scenario) energy
efficiency improvements by households. Major energy efficiency improvement measures include use
of more efficient lighting and electric appliances; retrofitting buildings with wall, window and roof
insulation; and heating and air conditioning system improvements.

Key technologies for mitigation in forestry focus on CO2 sequestration, achieved through plant-
ing more trees and supporting forest health through sustainable forest management. The main
mitigation measures selected in the Romanian forestry sector as a result of the sector analysis are
afforestation, sustainable management of production forests for timber, and sustainable manage-
ment of protection forests.
•	 Afforestation of agricultural lands helps with both mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
   New forests contribute to CO2 sequestration; they also, if established as forest belts, can support
   adaptation. Afforestation of degraded or abandoned lands is still the main option for mitigation
   in the forestry sector in Romania due to the large area where such measures are applicable. The
   degraded lands inventory, conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in
   2012, estimated that approximately 115,000 hectares or 14 percent of degraded land is suitable
   for afforestation.
•	 Improving sustainable management of production forests will increase forest yields. Romania
   lags behind many EU and other countries in its forest rotation, which is too long and exceeds 100
   years for most indigenous species of forest trees. The proposed measure shortens the average
   rotations for the most important forest species, which will mean less disturbance and more valu-
   able and healthy trees available for harvest. The results could be significant: in 10 years, yields
   can increase by 10 percent.
•	 Enhancing protected area management will also improve greenhouse gas mitigation from for-
   ests. Romania has an obligation to meet the directives associated with Natura 2000, the network
   of nature protection areas in the EU. To achieve Natura 2000 objectives, there is the need for
   Romania to develop a simpler way of compensating private property holders, clarifying how
   compensation is determined, and identifying a way to compensate communities managing pub-
   lic lands.

Key technologies in agriculture comprise two mitigation measures: minimum tillage and manure
management. The ‘no tillage’ measure reflects the benefits of of avoiding desertification by elim-
inating tillage in agricultural fields; and the area covered by the measure is based on arable land
susceptible to desertification. Manure management or “composting manure” aims to counter the
poor manure management (collecting, storage, treating, applying) of the past. Farmers taking up
this measure adopt stringent practices on storage and treatment of manure, which generates green-
house gas savings per animal (rather than per hectare).

In contrast with the other sectors, key mitigation measures in the transport sector are policies
rather than technological interventions. The sector analysis identifies a wide range of measures
including pricing instruments, technology, regulatory measures, operational efficiency measures,
and investments. The transport MACC data were collected from various sources including the
National Transport Model, an EU model TREMOVE, EUROSTAT, and some other sources. Most of
the transport measures included in the analysis have high costs of abatement, the average cost is
much higher than in other sectors and equals €154/tCO2e abated, but they also deliver valuable (but
difficult to quantify) co-benefits.

agriculture, and transport—and the two characteristics of these options: net present value of their
cost over the period 2015–2050 and the abatement they are projected to provide in year 2050 when
the implementation is completed and the benefits are fully realized. This longer time frame is nec-
essary to capture the full benefits in the calculations. Total annual abatement in year 2050 reaches
38 MtCO2e. The chart shows that several household energy efficiency and forestry measures have
negative net costs (because benefits exceed costs), including energy efficient lighting, energy effi-
cient air-conditioning, energy efficient household appliances (refrigerators and washing machines),
and protection and production forest management. Also, several technologies in power supply and
demand, forestry, and transport have positive, but very low costs, including afforestation, scrappage
scheme, solar PV, wind, and housing insulation. The least cost-efficient technologies are in the trans-
port sector and include eco driving, low emission zones, and walking and cycling zones.

A review by sector shows that energy efficiency measures are most beneficial because they have
both high abatement potential and low, even negative, net cost. Electricity supply measures also
deliver significant abatement at a relatively low (but positive) cost. Forestry provides large abatement
potential. Agriculture measures—no tillage and manure management—are relatively cost efficient;
they also promise to provide a significant abatement benefit. Transport measures, however, mostly
have very high costs and, at the same time, limited abatement potential. This finding is consistent

with transport MACCs constructed for other countries and is explained by the nature of transport
mitigation: transport measures have multiple objectives apart from abatement, including reduced
pollution, lowered traffic, controlled noise, reduced number of accidents, and improved quality of
life. Abatement is not necessarily the main objective or the main benefit of these measures; for
example, urban congestion control is generally aimed at economic and social development (urban
growth and improved quality of life). Therefore, the transport measures have many valuable co-­
benefits such as avoided traffic injuries (including saved lives) or potential municipal budget revenue
from developing urban business-friendly infrastructure. However, including these co-benefits in the
calculation of net cost is outside the scope of this assessment: no precise estimates of most such
co-benefits are available.

The energy sector provides the most cost-efficient measures and the highest overall abatement.
The most effective measure (providing the highest abatement potential) in energy demand is building
insulation, followed by efficient lighting. In electricity supply, the highest abatement can be achieved
from electricity generation using natural gas plants with installed carbon capture and storage (gas
with CCS), and a similar level of abatement will result from the expanded usage of coal-fuelled plants
with carbon capture and storage (coal with CCS). Among renewable energy options, the highest
abatement potential is in wind, followed by biomass, then solar PV, then hydropower generation
and CSP. Development of nuclear generation could also provide abatement, in an amount compa-
rable to hydropower generation. The most cost-efficient electricity supply options are solar PV and
wind, followed by hydropower, solar CSP, biomass, and nuclear. Gas with CCS would require higher
expenses, and coal with CCS is the most expensive option, reaching €40 per tCO2e abated. Several
demand-side measures provide absolute net benefits (or have negative net costs); these include the
recommended measures to expand usage of efficient lighting, efficient air-conditioning, efficient
refrigerators, and efficient washing machines.


Conclusions AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The MACC work derives from the analysis and modeling of all the relevant sectors in the Country
Assessment. The MACC chart is simply a presentation of the findings of the sector work, trans-
formed using the MACC approach. When the MACC data from all sectors is put together in one
chart, it creates a clear and simple cross-sectoral picture of the costs and benefits of green mea-
sures, relative to each other. The MACC analysis is based on a detailed sector analytic and mod-
eling work that identified the areas where mitigation efforts would be most effective and proposed
particular mitigation measures for implementation. For each of the selected mitigation measures,
the parameters for the MACC curve—the unit cost of abatement in the period 2015–2050 and the
potential for abatement in 2050—were estimated. The resulting MACC ranks the selected mea-
sures from most cost effective to the least cost effective. The top measures in both cost effective-
ness and abatement potential are in energy demand and electricity supply sectors; however, several
other measures also provide significant benefits, this relates to forestry and agriculture. Measures
in transport are expensive and characterized by a limited abatement, an outcome that might alter
if a reliable methodology of estimating the cost of a wide range of transport sector externalities is
developed and applied (a task outside of the scope of this analysis).

Green actions across the four sectors will reduce emissions in the country by 38 MtCO2e in 2050,
an equivalent of a 23 percent decrease from the level projected in the Baseline for 2050. The larg-
est share of abatement—45 percent of the total—is projected for electricity supply. Energy demand

will provide a third of the overall abatement, agriculture and transport close to one-tenth, and for-
estry five percent. The abatement potential and the average costs in each of the five sectors ana-
lyzed are also reflected in Figure 9.5. They range from €–78 (negative cost) per ton of CO2e abated
in energy demand, to €16/tCO2e abated in energy supply, to €–0.1/tCO2e abated in forestry, to €12/
tCO2e abated in agriculture, and to €154/tCO2e abated in transport (Figure 9.5). Costs of each mea-
sure are in Table 9.1.

The Romania MACC can increase the quality of decisions regarding prioritizing the proposed
abatement measures. In addition to supporting budgeting decisions by showing the cost per abate-
ment unit of various measures and comparing abatement potential of measures relative to each
other and across sectors, it can support decisions regarding the implementation of the proposed
green actions. MACCs help realize that some measures provide benefits faster than other measures,
and the implementation should be scheduled accordingly. In particular, the Romania MACC can help
to schedule investments in an efficient way to maximize the present value of benefits over the long
term, a standard approach for green growth and climate change studies. In the case of Romania, not
surprisingly, the MACC shows that the scheduling of green actions should start with energy efficiency
measures because they have the lowest (negative) net cost, low investment cost, bring benefits
very quickly, and have low implementation barriers. Next, the measures in forestry also need to be
scheduled to start early on. They have a relatively low annual cost, require no upfront investment,
and, while benefits occur with a time lag, they accumulate in the future, so an early start is possible

and desirable to maximize the benefits. These are no-regret measures. Measures in energy supply,
vice versa, require large up-front investments with benefits delivered years into the future and imple-
mentation requiring strategic, complicated, and politically charged decisions. In the case of energy
supply measures, the MACC provides only one element of a very large and complicated picture
needed to make decisions. In transport, the proposed measures have high unit cost, and their imple-
mentation should be guided by co-benefits (benefits other than emission reduction); they should
be implemented where and when they can bring important health benefits (by lowering pollution),
reduction in the rate of traffic accidents, decrease in traffic congestion, and improved quality of life.

conclusions
The Romania Green Growth Assessment outlines a green growth path for the country for the
period from 2015 to 2050. The report was prepared on the basis of technical economic analysis—
including macroeconomic modeling, sector modeling and analysis, benchmarking analysis and mar-
ginal abatement curve analysis—to recommend particular green measures relevant for Romania and
estimate their costs over the modeling timeframe.

This report presents the technical outcomes of the Romania green growth modeling and analysis
in language for a non-technical audience of green growth reform stakeholders, both within the
government and outside it. In today’s world, where climate change has become a serious factor of
development, green growth decisions and action are essential for all countries and should be embed-
ded in economic policy making. In the past decades, understanding of climate change mitigation
and adaptation has evolved in separate technical disciplines. Translating scientific and socio-eco-
nomic knowledge into economic policies and actions and integrating knowledge across sectors is
essential and there is an urgency for doing so, considering the pace of climatic changes and the
expected damage from climate change in the absence of global and local action. This report was
designed as a tool for such communication and aims at presenting the outcomes of technical anal-
ysis to policymakers, government officials, experts outside of government, and the general public.

Government must make a commitment to ongoing and ever-improving in-country analyses to provide
up-to-date assessments for policy decisions. While the outcomes of the Romania Green Growth Assess-
ment are expected to be applied in designing greener economic policies today, policymakers and other
stakeholders need to keep in mind that the methodologies used in this Assessment evolve continuously,
the situation on the ground changes and data collection techniques improve, and approaches to address
uncertainties progress. Analysis needs to be repeated regularly using the newest methods, data, and
models. Therefore, the value of this Assessment, in addition to outlining a green growth path today, as
a combination of a particular set of recommended actions, is in providing a set of re-usable and update-
able assessment tools and models to the government. Using new data, the Romanian government can
update the projections and the recommendations. Also, with time, new versions of the tools and models
will become available, and the current ones should be updated and eventually replaced.

There are several types of uncertainties in green growth modeling, and repeated updates of the
analysis are a reliable way to reduce them. First, technical progress creates an enormous source of
uncertainty over the 35-year horizon. Technological breakthroughs could substantially decrease the
costs of climate action. Secondly, global developments—on natural resource prices and on global
economic growth—will drive local costs and benefits but are almost impossible to predict. Third,
projections of the global climate models vary considerably—more pessimistic climate developments
translate into higher economic losses in the future and larger benefits of adapting. Fourth, ‘adaptive
capacity’ determines how well countries cope with a changing climate, but a precise definition that
would allow this factor to be integrated into analysis is lacking. Updating analysis using new data,
methods, techniques, and models is a guaranteed way of significantly lessening the uncertainties
of the green growth assessments produced today. Despite technical complexity and the ongoing
need for revision, policy makers and other stakeholders need to keep in mind that the value of green
growth assessments is continuously translating knowledge into decision making and action.

Romania faces requirements to cut its greenhouse gas emissions as a member of the European
Union and also opportunities for adapting to coming climate change. This Green Growth Country
Assessment for Romania draws a green growth path from 2015 to 2050, based on technical economic
analysis—including macroeconomic modeling, sector modeling and analysis, benchmarking analysis
and marginal abatement curve analysis. The assessment proposes mid- to long-term interventions
for the energy, transport, urban, water, agriculture, and forestry sectors while maintaining economic
growth.

A greener energy sector needs to accelerate the transition towards low carbon fuels and away from
coal while improving energy efficiency (on a path guided by demand and supply-side energy model-
ing). Limiting the growth of emissions is a tough challenge for the fossil fuel-dependent transport
sector, especially as Romania’s motorization rate converges with the EU average. New transport
policies and significant investments are needed in both public and private transport to limit emis-
sions growth. The challenges of emissions intensity are magnified in urban areas in the wake of fast-
sprawling development. Data-intensive geospatial modeling of the Bucharest region estimates the
contributions to mitigation of more compact city design, transport-oriented development, and more
efficient vehicles and buildings.

At the same time, Romania needs to adapt to coming climate change. A warmer dryer climate will
threaten water availability in many river basins in summer when irrigation demands are high and ris-
ing. Innovative modeling of water quantifies the tradeoffs that will be needed to balance competing
demands from agriculture, the power sector, and municipalities and industry and proposes afford-
able adaptation actions in water and agriculture. Next, Romania’s expansive forests are found critical
to removing emissions, but a changing climate threatens forests’ ability to sequester carbon, arguing
for policy action.

Economy-wide macroeconomic modeling provides an integrated multi-sectoral assessment of a
greener and low carbon path, concluding that the upcoming EU 2030 framework for climate policy
is affordable although challenging for Romania, but the prospective EU Roadmap 2050 will prove
expensive and demanding. To assist with government planning, the investment costs to 2050 of
low carbon green growth have been estimated. An average annual 1.2 percent of GDP of addi-
tional investment will be needed to meet the EU’s 2030 targets and 2.0 percent to meet prospective
2050 targets. Importantly, the likely share of public investment is modest. These estimates are based
on available data and today’s technology considered practical for green action. New technologies
will certainly emerge over coming decades that will change these costs and benefits, providing an
important reason why governments need to update such analysis periodically.
