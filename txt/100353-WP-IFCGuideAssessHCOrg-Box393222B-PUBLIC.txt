•	 Columns for assessing compliance and noting observations and
   comments.

Part 2: Interviews with senior management and clinical staff
To support this part of the assessment the guide is organized in three
columns:
•	 The first column lists each standard along with several “measureable
   elements”. It is likely that the assessor will not be able to cover all of
   the measureable elements during the visit. Therefore a judgment will
   usually be made on where to focus, based on the specific circumstances
   of the project.
•	 The second column lists questions that can be used to measure
   compliance with the standard.
•	 The last column is for noting observations and comments.

11. Organ Donation and Transplant
The organization complies with the WHO Guiding Principles on
Human Organ Transplantation.

Organ retrieval from living persons is not undertaken where there are
reasonable grounds to suspect that the donation is coerced or that a
financial consideration is expected by the donor.

The organization permits the allocation of organs on the basis of
morally relevant criteria only.

Transplantation is prohibited when the chance of success is insufficient
to justify the risks.

The buying and selling of organs are not performed or condoned by
the organization.

The harvesting of organs without prior consent from dead patients
(or their legal representative) are not performed or condoned by the
organization.

12. Gender Selection
Sex selection, by selectively terminating a pregnancy for non-medical
reasons, is not performed or condoned. This encompasses a number
of related practices, including pregnancy ultrasound scanning,
where there are reasonable grounds to suspect a risk of termination
of pregnancy dependent upon the determined sex of the embryo of
fetus.

13. Assisted Reproductive Technologies
Interventions of human procreative processes [e.g. invitro fertilization
(IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), artificial insemination
by donor (AID)] are carried out with due consideration to donor
confidentiality, parental age limits, same sex couples, ownership of
donated sperm/eggs, multiple embryo transfer and genetic testing.
All such procedures are carried out within the laws and regulations
of the country.

Exploitation of clients seeking reproductive assistance (e.g. non-
required testing procedures or procedures unlikely to yield results),
or of egg donors is prohibited.

Harvesting of stem cells must only be done with the express permission
of the donor under the laws and regulations of the country.

14. Female Genital Mutilation
Female circumcision is not performed or condoned by the
organization.

utility system
  Organization-wide system and equipment that support the
  following: electrical distribution; emergency power; water; vertical
  and horizontal transport; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning;
  plumbing, boiler, and steam; piped gases; vacuum systems; or

variation
  The differences in results obtained in measuring the same event
  more than once. The sources of variations can be grouped into
  two major classes: common causes and special causes. Too much
  variation often leads to waste and loss, such as the occurrence of
  undesirable patient health outcomes and increased cost of health
  services.
