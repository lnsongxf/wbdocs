Abstract: This paper builds on the global experience and Mali’s context to identify an effective
nutrition approach as well as costs and benefits of key nutrition programs, as part of a resilience
agenda after the crisis. It is intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective
interventions as well as strategies for scaling these up. The paper looks at both relevant
“nutrition-specific” interventions, largely delivered through the health sector, and at multisectoral
“nutrition-sensitive” interventions delivered through other sectors such as agriculture, social
protection, and water and sanitation that have the potential to strengthen nutritional outcomes in
Mali. We first estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific
interventions in all regions of Mali would require a yearly public investment of $64 million. The
expected benefits are large: annually about 480,000 DALYs and more than 14,000 lives would be
saved and over 260,000 cases of stunting among children under five would be averted. However,
because it is unlikely that the Government of Mali or its partners will find the $64 million
necessary to reach full national coverage, we also consider three potential scale-up scenarios
based on considerations of their potential for impact, the burden of stunting, resource
requirements, and implementation capacity. Using cost-benefit analyses, we propose scale-up
scenarios that represent a compromise between the need to move to full coverage and the
constraints imposed by limited resources. We identify and cost six nutrition-sensitive
interventions that are relevant to Mali’s context and for which there are both evidence of positive
impact on nutrition outcomes and some cost information. These findings point to a powerful set
of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that
represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition in Mali.

Keywords: nutrition-specific interventions, nutrition-sensitive interventions, cost-effectiveness of
nutrition interventions, cost-benefit analysis, nutrition financing.

Aflatoxins are a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds, especially Aspergillus
flavus, which contaminate stored food supplies such as animal feed, maize, and peanuts.
Research shows that human consumption of high levels of aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis
(Kuniholm et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt Associates 2014). It is widely understood
that there is a relationship between aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, but this relationship has
not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt
Associates 2014).

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or proposal. It is the ratio of the
benefits of a project or proposal, expressed in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed
in monetary terms. The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of monetary gain realized
by implementing a project versus the amount it costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio,
the better the investment. A general rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than its
cost, the project is a good investment.

Biocontrol (also called biological control) is the use of an invasive agent to reduce pest or mold
population below a desired level. Aflatoxins can be reduced through biocontrol; the most
effective method involves a single application of a product (such as aflasafe™) that contains
strains unique to the specific country or location.

Biofortification is the breeding of crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done
either through conventional selective breeding or through genetic engineering.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that involves increasing in-country
human capacity and systems to design, deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions
(World Bank 2010). This includes developing skills by training public health personnel and
community volunteers to improve the delivery of services. These efforts typically accompany
program implementation or, when possible, precede program implementation. In this costing
analysis we allocate 9 percent of total programmatic costs to capacity development for program
delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs the cost of an intervention
against its benefits. The approach involves assigning a monetary value to the benefits of an
intervention and estimating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the net
present value. Net benefits are the difference between the cost and monetary value of benefits of
the intervention. The net present value is defined mathematically as:




                                                xiii
where is net cash inflows,        is the initial investment, the index is the time period, and is
the discount rate. A positive net present value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates
that the present value of cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash outflows (cost
of financing). Interventions with net present values that are at least as high as alternative
interventions provide greater benefits than interventions with net present values equal to or lower
than alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis can also be expressed in terms of the
benefit-cost ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that is intended to identify
interventions that produce the desired results at the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis
requires two components: the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention’s
impact, such as the number of lives saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio can be defined as:




The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among alternative interventions
with the same outcomes. The intervention with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the
most cost-effective intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a year of healthy life lost due
to a health condition. The DALY, developed in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of
life lost from a disease (YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the disease (YLD).
DALYs count the gains from both mortality (how many more years of life lost due to premature
death are prevented) and morbidity (how many years or parts of years of life lost due to disability
are prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a metric that is recognized and understood
by external audiences such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases relative to the overall
burden of disease by geographic region or health area. Combined with cost data, DALYs allow
for estimating and comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions in
different countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the current value of future cash
flows. The concept of the time value of money suggests that income earned in the present is
worth more than the same amount of income earned in the future because of its earning potential.
A higher discount rate reflects higher losses to potential benefits from alternative investments in
capital. A higher discount rate may also reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The internal rate of return is the discount rate that produces a net present value of cash flows
equal to zero. An intervention has a non-negative net present value when the internal rate of
return equals or exceeds the appropriate discount rate. Interventions yielding higher internal rates
of return than alternatives tend to be considered more desirable than the alternatives.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates measured coverage changes
into estimates of mortality reduction and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to
project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal survival. It is part
of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum policy modeling system.

Monitoring and evaluation, operations research, and technical support for program
delivery are all elements of cost-effective and efficient program implementation. Monitoring
involves checking progress against plans through the systematic and routine collection of
information from projects and programs in order to learn from experience to improve practices
and activities in the future, to ensure internal and external accountability of the resources used
and the results obtained, and to make informed decisions on the future of the intervention.
Monitoring is a periodically recurring task. Evaluation is the assessing, as systematically and
objectively as possible, of a completed project or intervention (or a phase of an ongoing project).
Operations research aims to inform the program designers about ways to deliver interventions
more effectively and efficiently. Technical support entails ensuring that training, support, and
maintenance for the physical elements of the intervention are available. In this costing exercise
we allocate 2 percent of total intervention costs for monitoring and evaluation, operations
research, and technical support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect impact on nutrition and are
delivered through sectors other than health such as the agriculture, education, and water,
sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops, conditional cash
transfers, and water and sanitation infrastructure improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate determinants of child
nutrition, such as adequate food and nutrition intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and
treating disease. Examples include community nutrition programs, micronutrient
supplementation, and deworming.

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of findings when key variables
change. It helps to identify the variables with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of
the intervention, and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe the impact of
the variable on the outcome.

SMART (Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions) is a
standardized, simplified field survey methodology that produces a snapshot of the current
situation on the ground. It is used to measure responses to emergencies such as famine, war, and
natural disaster and for surveillance. The methodology is based on the two most vital and basic
public health indicators for the assessment of the magnitude and severity of a humanitarian crisis:
the nutritional status of children under five and the mortality rate of the population. These
indicators are useful for prioritizing resources as well as for monitoring the extent to which the
relief system is meeting the needs of the population, and therefore the overall impact of relief
response.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is an indicator of chronic
undernutrition and is the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is
measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a child is
considered stunted with a height-for-age Z-score of −2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age. It is used as a composite
indicator to reflect both acute and chronic undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between
them. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below); a
child is considered underweight with a weight-for-age Z-score of −2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is an indicator of acute
undernutrition and the result of more recent food deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of
Z-score (or standard deviation score; see definition below). A child with a weight-for-height Z-
score of −2 or lower is considered wasted.

A Z-score or standard deviation score is a calculation used to explain deviations from an
established norm. It is calculated with the following formula:

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The overall objective of this paper is to support the Government of Mali in developing a strategic
approach to addressing its malnutrition challenge and to cost a scale-up plan for nutrition. The
executive summary is written for policy makers; it highlights the study’s main findings and
discusses their implications for nutrition policy and programming in Mali. The paper itself is
more technical in nature and is written for planners and programmers. The analysis is expected to
bring evidence of potential for impact and allocative efficiency into Mali’s nutrition
programming.

Between 2001 and 2010 chronic malnutrition in Mali declined dramatically, with an annual
reduction rate in stunting of 4.4 percent per year. Between 2010 and 2012 there was an increase
in stunting as a result of the 2011–2012 crisis, although by 2013 stunting rates had begun to
decline again. The prevalence and severity of stunting (stunting gap) worsened across the South
and most likely the North (as documented by the case of Gao) following the crisis. Children aged
0–12 months in 2011–2012 were particularly affected by the crisis and will likely suffer life-long
consequences.

In 2013, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 28 percent of children under five
were stunted, 17 percent were wasted, and 9 percent were underweight. These very serious levels
of malnutrition require action. Chronic and acute malnutrition affect, to different extents, the
whole country—North and South alike. In addition, many segments of the population are highly
vulnerable to malnutrition; in times of crises, this vulnerability translates into increases in
malnutrition rates, as seen in 2011–2012. At the same time, micronutrient deficiencies (hidden
hunger) are also prevalent in Mali, with vitamin A and anemia rates particularly high. In light of
the above, Mali needs a two-pronged strategy to address malnutrition. This strategy must address
the immediate effects of the crisis on nutrition in the North and South, with emphasis on very
young children; and it must also invest in nutrition interventions that increase the resilience of
vulnerable populations (including the poor, farmers, women, children, populations in vulnerable
regions, etc.) while fostering long-term benefits.

Prompt action is warranted because malnutrition, particularly in very young children, leads to
increased mortality rates, increased illness, and longer-term effects on cognitive abilities, thereby
producing irreversible losses to human capital that contribute to later losses in economic
productivity. Undernutrition is responsible for about one-half of under-five mortality and one-
fifth of maternal mortality in developing countries. Children who have been malnourished early
in life are more likely to experience cognitive deficiencies and poor schooling outcomes. Longer-
term stunting results in a 10 to 17 percent loss of wages. In addition, a World Bank study
estimated that Mali loses over $235 million in gross domestic product (GDP) annually to vitamin
and mineral deficiencies alone (World Bank 2013b).

At the same time, nutrition interventions are consistently identified as among the most cost-
effective development actions, with huge potential to contribute to the World Bank Group’s twin
goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Cost-benefit analysis shows that

                                                xvii
nutrition interventions are highly effective (World Bank 2010; Hoddinott et al. 2013). It is
estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country’s GDP by at least 3 percent annually
(Horton and Steckel 2013). The global cost to scaling up key nutrition interventions is estimated
at $10.3 billion per annum (World Bank 2010). These investments would provide preventive
nutrition services to about 356 million children, save at least 1.1 million lives and 30 million
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and reduce the number of stunted children by about 30
million worldwide.

This report builds on the global experience and Mali’s context to identify an effective nutrition
approach as well as costs and benefits of key nutrition programs in Mali. It is intended to help
guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions and strategies for scaling these up.
The report looks at both relevant “nutrition-specific” interventions, largely delivered through the
health sector, and at multisectoral “nutrition-sensitive” interventions, delivered through the
agriculture sector and through social protection, water and sanitation, and poverty reduction
programs. It uses the costing framework established by Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost?
(World Bank 2010) and applies it to the country-specific context of Mali. Combining costing
with estimates of impact (in terms of lives saved, DALYs saved, and cases of stunting averted),
and cost-effectiveness analysis will make the case for nutrition stronger and aid in priority-setting
by identifying the most cost-effective packages of interventions in situations where financial and
human resources are constrained.

We first estimate the costs and benefits of implementing 10 nutrition-specific interventions in all
regions of Mali. We refer to this as the full-coverage scenario and estimate that it would require
an annual public investment of $64 million. The expected benefits are large: annually about
480,000 DALYs and more than 14,000 lives would be saved, while over 260,000 cases of
stunting among children under five would be averted.

Given resource and capacity constraints, few countries are able to effectively scale up all 10
nutrition-specific interventions to full national coverage immediately. We therefore consider
three potential scale-up scenarios, based on considerations of burden of stunting and alignment
with the most pressing Mali’s structural and crisis-induced needs, potential for impact, costs, and
capacity for implementation:


      Scenario 1: Scale up by region
      Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
      Scenario 3: Scale up by intervention and region

Our analysis reveals significant differences in the cost-effectiveness of the various scenarios,
with Scenarios 2 and 3 being the most attractive. Scenario 2 offers the most cost-effective
solution, with a cost per DALY saved of just $51 (as compared with $197 for Scenario 1 and $57
for Scenario 3). While all scenarios offer significant benefits, a combination of cost-effectiveness
considerations and resource limitations make Scenarios 2 and 3 the most attractive options (see
Box 1 for a summary of key findings).

and training. The estimate of costs presented here is therefore high because it does not account
for expected economies of scale. With respect to the benefits of these programs, estimates are

likely to be underestimates of the true benefits because the LiST tool we use has limitations,
making it possible to estimate the benefits of only some of the interventions that are proposed to
be scaled up.

As mentioned above, this analysis takes an innovative approach to nutrition costing not only by
estimating the costs and benefits of nutrition-specific interventions, but also by exploring costs
for a selected number of nutrition-sensitive interventions implemented outside of the health
sector. We identify and cost six nutrition-sensitive interventions highly relevant to the Mali’s
context, for which there is some evidence of positive impact on nutrition outcomes and for which
there is some cost information. First, we consider a nutritional package delivered as part of a
conditional cash transfer program. We also consider two potential interventions delivered
through the agriculture sector—aflatoxin reduction in groundnuts and nutrition education via
agricultural extension workers—and two delivered through the education sector—school-based
deworming and school-based promotion of good hygiene. Finally, we report the costs and
benefits identified by Hutton (2012) of reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for
improved access to water and sanitation. The estimated annual costs are relatively modest: $49.4
million for the nutrition package in the conditional cash transfer program; $1.3 million for
aflatoxin control via improved granaries; $19.0 million for nutrition education delivered via
agricultural extension workers; $0.3 million for school-based deworming, and $6.2 million for
school-based promotion of good hygiene. DALY estimates from global sources suggest that
aflatoxin control via improved granaries would cost $272 per DALY saved and school-based
deworming $4.55 per DALY saved. These results must be considered rough approximations, as
there are significant limitations in the available data and in the methodological approaches.

Despite the resumption of bilateral development assistance and the mobilization of resources for
the emergency response, additional financing for nutrition in Mali will be needed to scale up
even the most modest scenarios (Scenarios 2 and 3) presented here. At the central government
level, there is currently no dedicated budget line item for nutrition. Thus resources will need to
be mobilized from national budgets, with additional support from official development assistance
(ODA) from donors. Within the national budgets, it will be important to prioritize health sector
funds for nutrition-specific interventions. It will also be important for other sectors—such as
water and sanitation and social protection—to engage in the cost-effective nutrition-sensitive
interventions the report has identified.

Overall, these findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate
list of nutrition-sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing
the high levels of child malnutrition in Mali. An important next step will be to leverage the
additional financing needed to implement the scale-up. Most of the malnutrition that occurs in
the first 1,000 days of a child’s life is essentially irreversible. Investing in early childhood
nutrition interventions offers a window of opportunity to permanently lock in human capital.

                            COUNTRY CONTEXT AND NUTRITION DIAGNOSTICS
Mali is a vast, landlocked, and sparsely populated country in the Sahel of West Africa. It shares
borders with seven countries and has an area of about 475,000 square miles and a population of
15 million, 10 percent of whom are living in the northern regions that represent two-thirds of the
country’s area (Figure 1). Delivery of services to the large, sparsely populated territory poses
severe challenges; the scarcity of services has a negative impact on geographic equity and social
cohesion. In 2012, Mali experienced institutional and political turmoil as well as conflict and
insecurity in the North.2 In combination with the 2011 drought, this unrest resulted in a
humanitarian crisis and food insecurity across the country. As a result, over 400,000 Malians
have been displaced and 3 million are now at risk of food insecurity, of which 800,000 are in
need of immediate food assistance (ECHO 2014). Following a good rainfall in 2012, the Malian
economy has held up fairly well against the 2012 crisis: agricultural production increased by 14
percent in 2012 (but was down again in 2014 as a result of poor rainfall), gold production
increased by 9 percent in 2012, and the economic growth rate was expected to reach almost 5
percent in 2013. But the effects of the crisis on food insecurity and malnutrition have persisted
(detailed in the next section). Prior to the 2012 political crisis, Mali was ranked 175 on the UN
Human Development Index. The country’s poverty rate declined from 49 percent to 36 percent
between 2001 and 2010, yet the high population growth rate has kept the absolute number of
poor unchanged. Since 2010, poverty has almost certainly increased.




2 In January 2012, an armed conflict broke out in the North of the country after a group of insurgents began fighting
      a campaign against the Malian army. In March 2012, these events were further complicated by the fact that
      mutinous soldiers took control of the capital, Bamako, and suspended the constitution of Mali after a coup
      d’état. This led to increased instability and to the control by the rebels of the three largest northern cities of
      Kidal, Gao, and Tombouctou. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad and the Islamist armed
      forces of Ansar Dine then battled over the control of the North. The Government of Mali asked for foreign
      military assistance to re-conquer the North of the country; military operations began in January 2013. By early
      February 2013, the Malian military and the international coalition had regained control of the northern territory,
      and a peace deal was signed between the government and the Tuareg rebels in June 2013. However, the rebels
      pulled out from the peace agreement in September 2013 and fighting is still ongoing.

                         HEALTH AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS 2001–2013

Until the 2012 political crisis, health indicators—although still serious—were improving in Mali.
Life expectancy increased from 49 years in 2000 to 55 in 2012 (World Bank 2014a). Child
mortality rates in Mali declined by 3 percent between 2005 and 2010 (Figure 2), although they
remain high—at 128 per 1,000 live births in 2012 (World Bank 2014a); the figure also shows
that many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa improved more than Mali did. Furthermore,
infant mortality in Mali improved from 111 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 80 in 2012.
Nevertheless, the country still has the 3rd highest infant mortality rate in the world (ECHO 2014).

Levels and Trends in Malnutrition
Starting from very high levels, Mali’s malnutrition rates dropped dramatically between 2001 and
2010, though they increased between 2001 and 2012 as a result of the food, political, and security
crisis. The situation began to improve again by 2013, at least in the South (Figure 3).3 These
levels—28 percent of children stunted, 17 percent underweight, and 9 percent wasted—indicate a
serious problem of malnutrition according to the WHO classification.




3
    Because the 2012 and 2013 Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys
       did not cover the whole country but focused mainly on the southern regions (where 90 percent of the population
       lives), we needed to verify how different the trends in nutritional outcomes between the North and the South
       were before these dates. The analysis shows that, most of the time, the level and trend of undernutrition are not
       significantly different between the North and the South, validating the interpretation of the latest trends. It is
       likely, however, that the 2013 improvement would not be reflected in the data on the North, as also later
       illustrated by the case of Gao.

       Sources: Mali DHS for 2001, 2006; MICS/ELIM for 2010; SMART surveys for 2011 –2013.


A closer examination of trends in stunting prevalence shows that stunting declined steadily in the
years leading up to the recent crisis (Figure 4). Evidence since the crisis suggests a negative
impact on child stunting. Without more recent survey data on the North, it is impossible to know
whether or not the ongoing conflict in the North caused stunting prevalence to exceed that of the
southern regions, but this is likely.

           Note: HAZ = height-for-age Z-scores.



A detailed analysis of recent survey data found an increase in stunting in the first months of life
in 2013, both overall and for the region of Gao (World Bank 2014b). This is illustrated by the
evolution in age distributions of height-for-age Z-scores (Figure 5):4 up until 2011, the overall
age distribution of height-for-age Z-scores improves from one survey to another. However,
between 2011 and 2012, we observe lower height-for-age Z-scores for children aged 18 months
and older. A similar important change can be observed between 2012 and 2013 among children
aged 0–12 months. This drop in height-for-age Z-score during the first months of life in 2013
probably reflects deterioration in maternal health during the 2011–2012 crisis, in turn at least
partly related to disruptions in the delivery of health services in both North and South. Along the
same lines, using 2013 SMART data, the cohort of children born after the 2012 crisis in Gao had
significantly worse nutrition outcomes than the same cohort born before the crisis.5 This is
especially noticeable for chronic undernutrition, since postcrisis height-for-age Z-scores are, on
average, 21 percent lower than precrisis scores. In absolute value, the difference is about 0.15

4
    Figure 5 shows fractional polynomial curves of height-for-age Z-scores across ages, which from 2001 to 2012
       follow a familiar shape wherein children begin life with a height-for-age Z-score near 0 that declines rapidly
       before stabilizing around 24 months.
5
    Since the SMART survey in Gao was conducted in May 2013, the focus was on the cohort of children aged 6 –14
       months, comparing their nutritional outcomes with the cohort of children aged 6–14 months in the surveys
       conducted before the crisis.

standard deviations in height for age, which translates into a difference of 0.7 centimeters on
average for this cohort of children aged 6–14 months old. This is a significant difference for such
a young age and is likely the result of poor maternal health and nutrition following the significant
disruptions at all levels in the North. It will probably contribute to significant differences later in
life in terms of mortality, morbidity, and cognitive development. Overall, in the absence of
interventions to improve their nutrition status, children younger than 24 months are at high risk
of negative long-term consequences in the form of increased mortality, increased morbidity,
lower cognitive ability, and lower adult productivity in the future.

       Note: The arrow indicates the substantial shift in the HAZ/age relation for the youngest children, aged 0 –12
       months. This relation is usually very similar to the other years in many countries: that is, the difference in
       HAZ is usually close to zero after birth, but height then falters after inadequate breastfeeding and
       complementary feeding and multiple fever/diarrhea episodes during young infancy. What is noticeable in
       this figure is that even newborn babies are shorter than the reference, indicating serious nutritional
       challenges during pregnancy.



Figure 6 shows the regional distribution of children exposed to multiple nutritional deficits.
Between 2001 and 2012, more than half of the children with at least two nutritional deficits were
concentrated in Sikasso, Segou, and Mopti. Interestingly, in 2013 we also observe a noticeable
increase in the share of children living in Gao exposed to multiple nutritional deficits—further
evidence of negative effects of the crisis in Gao. Also notable is the decline in the share of these
children in Kayes in 2013, the most recent year.

The impact of the 2011–2012 crisis on nutrition outcomes becomes even clearer when examining
changes in the “stunting gap,” which measures the severity rather than the prevalence of stunting.
Similar to the poverty gap, the stunting gap is defined as the average distance below a given
reference line (in this case, a −2 height-for-age Z-score). Figure 7 presents the spatial distribution
in the stunting gap, which continued to improve until 2011 before reversing course in the
southern regions beginning in 2012. Some partial recovery was made in 2013, although stunting
is not yet back to 2011 levels in Koulikoro and Ségou. Between 2011 and 2012, deterioration in
nutritional status was most pronounced in the region of Ségou; the decline in that region
continued even further between 2012 and 2013 (World Bank 2014b).

Determinants of Malnutrition
The determinants of malnutrition in Mali show geographic disparities and an association with
poverty that both vary according to the definition of malnutrition being used. Figure 8 depicts the
regional variation in population, poverty, and stunting in 2010; it is important to keep in mind
that the population of Mali is concentrated in the south of the country. Rates of stunting are
highest in the south and southwest provinces of Sikasso, Ségou, and Mopti. Stunting rates are
also very high in the northern region of Tombouctou, although this accounts for a very small
proportion of the population. It is expected that the crisis may have exacerbated the North-South
divide. It is important to recognize that chronic undernutrition (stunting) in Mali is strongly
correlated with household income, while the correlation is much weaker with acute malnutrition
(wasting). Along the same lines, overall, acute malnutrition rates (Figure 9), with the possible
exception of Ségou, seem consistently higher in the northern (relatively less poor) regions,
especially in Tombouctou and Gao, than in the South.

Despite an association between poverty and stunting, undernutrition is also exacerbated by
improper infant and young child feeding practices, poor hygiene, and inadequate prevention and
treatment of childhood illnesses. This is evidenced by the continued prevalence of child stunting
in Mali’s wealthiest households (Figure 10). In 2010, 13 percent of children in the wealthiest
income quintile were stunted, suggesting that undernutrition is not simply the result of limited
access to food but also of poor feeding practices and exposure to disease. This underscores the
continued need for effective communication on optimal child feeding and caregiving practices, as
well as disease prevention and treatment. Nevertheless, Figure 10 reveals the progress made by
Mali over the past decade in reducing stunting prevalence across all income quintiles. The 2011–
2012 crisis affected this progression not only through reduced access to food but also and
importantly through disruption in health care facilities.

These findings on key determinants of malnutrition are confirmed by an analysis of vulnerability
to stunting, which points to variations in vulnerability across regions and household
characteristics.6 Unlike previously mentioned descriptions of chronic malnutrition, vulnerability
measures the risk of a child becoming stunted—an important factor when considering
interventions designed to increase resiliency to crisis and prevent chronic undernutrition. To
measure vulnerability to stunting, we adapt the methodology in Chaudhuri (2003), which
estimates household vulnerability to poverty based on cross-sectional data.7 Comparing mean
vulnerability across different selected groups allows us to draw a vulnerability profile for Mali.

We show this in Table 1 below by simply testing for the mean difference in vulnerability
between selected groups and the rest of the population. We also present the results of the
vulnerability by region in Figure 11. We start by comparing the northern regions (Tombouctou,
Gao, Kidal) with the rest of the country. Although the northern regions comprise less than 10
6
    Because of data and analytical limitations, it was not feasible to perform a rigorous causal analysis of the
      determinants of changes in malnutrition. First, most if not all of the traditional determinants of nutrition are
      endogenous to nutrition outcomes, making the estimation of the causal effects challenging when using
      traditional statistical techniques (such as ordinary least squares regression). It is possible to overcome those
      challenges using simultaneous equation modeling with instrumental variables, but the available data do not
      include data points that could be convincingly used as instrumental variables. Furthermore, the time span (the
      number of time points) of the data is short and does not allow for the consideration of dynamic panel
      estimators.
7
    We transpose this method to study children’s vulnerability to stunting, and we measure vulnerability as the
      conditional probability of a child’s height-for-age Z-score falling below the −2 standard deviation reference line
      in the next period.

                                                           11
percent of all Mali’s children under the age of five, the average vulnerability is about 10
percentage points higher than in the rest of the country. This difference is statistically significant,
and we also reject equality in distribution. Children of farmers (especially those of cotton
growers who are concentrated in the region of Sikasso) are more at risk of falling into chronic
undernutrition. Children living in female-headed households are also more at risk, although the
magnitude of the difference is smaller. Household head’s and mother’s education influence the
risk of children falling below the HAZ reference line. Old household heads and poverty
significantly increases children’s vulnerability to undernutrition. Being born during a lean month
(July–October) is associated with a higher risk, as does being born a boy. Households with more
than two children under the age of two are more likely to face risks of chronic undernutrition
than households with fewer than two children under the same age range.

We defined adequacy variables for children’s diets, health, and environment. Food and health
adequacy are defined according to standard recommendations and depend on the age of the child.
Environment adequacy is related to household level characteristics in terms of access to
improved sanitation, improved sources of water, and handwashing stations. The exact definition
                                                13
of these variables is given in Appendix 1. Children with adequate diets, and those with adequate
health care, are less likely to be exposed to chronic undernutrition risk. This is also the case for
children living in households with an adequate environment, and the effect is larger for this
dimension (an adequate environment yields a difference of 16 percentage points in mean
expected vulnerability).

On the one hand, the importance of these factors confirms the relation between poverty and
malnutrition. The difficulty some farmers have in providing sufficient food for their families and
the high vulnerability of the largely pastoralist North is likely to have translated into higher
malnutrition than the national average after the 2011–2012 crisis (in particular in Tombouctou).8
On the other hand, these findings also point to the importance of other factors—such as poor
knowledge of feeding and hygienic practices—in determining malnutrition. The significance of
knowledge is illustrated by the role that education can play in improving outcomes and the fact
that malnutrition is higher in rural areas where, in principle, there should be more access to food.
The results of this vulnerability analysis demonstrate the need to invest in interventions that
increase the resilience of the poor, farmers, women, and populations living in the North and other
vulnerable regions in the face of ongoing crises. Such interventions should include efforts to
tackle the issues of lack of knowledge of feeding and hygienic practices.

Finally, beyond access to food, dietary quality is also an issue: vitamin and mineral deficiencies
(hidden hunger) are pervasive in Mali. About 60 percent of preschool-aged children and almost
one in five pregnant women are deficient in vitamin A (World Bank 2013b). Of children under
five, 42 percent suffered from anemia in 2010, down from 53 percent in 2001 (Figure 12a);
anemia is a widespread problem and not limited to one income or geographic group (Figure 12b).
Although over 45 percent of children in the poorest quintile were anemic, over 33 percent of
children in the richest quintile were also anemic. Similarly, both rural and urban children suffer
from high rates of anemia, although it is worse in rural areas. Coverage of salt iodization is also
low: one-fifth of households do not consume iodized salt (World Bank 2013b).

    This supposition is confirmed by the recently published AGIR Regional Roadmap (see AGIR/OECD 2013).

Another health burden in Mali is the high levels of aflatoxins found in groundnuts. Aflatoxins are
naturally occurring carcinogenic byproducts of common fungi on crops, especially groundnuts
and maize. A study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Mali in 2009–
2010 found that the proportion of groundnut samples taken from farmers’ fields with aflatoxin
levels greater than 20 parts per billion was 33 to 59 percent. Analysis of more than 2,500
groundnut samples collected at regular intervals from traders, processors, wholesalers, and retail
markets revealed no exception in the prevalence of unacceptably high levels of aflatoxins,
including in markets in Bamako. The study also found great variation in levels across time
(IFPRI 2012). The prevalence of aflatoxins in maize in Mali is not known but thought to also be
high. Consumption of high levels of aflatoxin can lead to growth impairment in children
(Khlangwiset 2011) and liver cirrhosis (Kuniholm et al. 2008) and liver cancer in adults (Abt
Associates 2014). It is widely understood that there is a relationship between aflatoxin exposure
and stunting, but this burden has not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature
(Unnevehr and Grace 2013; Abt Associates 2014).

Infection with parasitic intestinal worms is concentrated in the south of Mali, as the northern
desert is too dry and hot for these worms to survive (Global Atlas of Helminth Infections 2014).
In the short term, parasitic intestinal worm infections potentially cause anemia, increase
morbidity and undernutrition, and impair mental and physical development (Hotez et al. 2008).
In the long term, infected children are estimated to have an average IQ loss of 3.75 points per
child, and they earn significantly less (43 percent) as adults than those who grow up free of
worms (Bleakley 2007).

To summarize: Mali’s high levels of chronic and acute malnutrition affect, to different extents,
the whole country—North as well as South. The situation is made worse by the high vulnerability

                                                15
of certain segments of the population to malnutrition. In times of crisis—as in the 2011–2012
back-to-back food, political, and security crises—this vulnerability translates into higher
malnutrition rates. For example, the effects of the crises on stunting prevalence persisted in 2013
in children aged 0–12 months. In the North, this is documented by the poor nutrition outcomes of
children in Gao, including those born after the 2012 crisis. The South—Ségou, for example—
was affected by severe and multiple nutritional deficits. These findings point to the need for a
two-pronged strategy to address malnutrition in Mali that would (1) tackle the immediate effects
of the crisis on nutrition in the North and in Ségou, in children 0–24 months old, and in
pregnant/lactating women; and (2) invest in nutrition interventions aimed at increasing the
resilience of the poor, farmers, women, children, and vulnerable regions in the face of ongoing
crises while at the same time fostering long-term benefits.


                         THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN NUTRITION

Undernutrition is an underlying cause of approximately half the deaths in children under five and
one-fifth of maternal deaths in developing countries. The joint effect of suboptimum
breastfeeding and fetal growth restriction in the neonatal period alone contributes 1.3 million
deaths or 19 percent of all deaths of children under five (Black et al. 2013). Undernourished
children are more likely to die from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, measles,
pneumonia, malaria, or HIV/AIDS.

Those malnourished children who survive face long-lasting health and schooling consequences,
including cognitive deficits and poorer schooling outcomes. Children with impaired cognitive
skills have lower school enrollment, attendance, and graduation, which in turn results in lower
productivity, earnings, and economic well-being. Stunted children lose 0.7 grades of schooling
and are more likely to drop out of school. An adequate intake of micronutrients—particularly
iron, vitamin A, iodine, and zinc—is critical for growth and cognitive development. Iodine-
deficient children lose on average 13 IQ points, and iron deficiency anemia reduces performance
on tests by 8 IQ points, making these children less educable and less productive in the long run
(World Bank 2006). Berhman et al. (2009) showed improved schooling and test scores from food
supplementation in early childhood.

Malnutrition costs developing countries billions of dollars in lost revenue through reduced
economic productivity, particularly through lower wages, lower physical capability, and more
days away from work as a result of illness. At the individual level, childhood stunting is
estimated to reduce a person’s potential lifetime earnings by at least 10 percent (World Bank
2006). Other studies have shown that a 1 percent loss in adult height results in a 2 to 2.4 percent
loss in productivity (Strauss and Thomas 1998; Caulfield et al. 2004). In addition, micronutrient
deficiencies in childhood and adulthood have tremendous economic cost for both individuals and
countries. Childhood anemia alone is associated with a 2.5 percent drop in adult wages. Anemia
in adults has been estimated to be equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP; this estimate goes up to 3.4
percent when including the secondary effects of retarded cognitive development in children
(Horton 1999). Horton and Ross (2003) estimate that eliminating iron-deficiency anemia would
result in a 5 to 17 percent increase in adult productivity. Annually, Mali loses over $235 million

                                                16
in GDP to vitamin and mineral deficiencies (World Bank 2013b). The economic costs of
undernutrition have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable in the developing world. A recent
analysis estimates these losses at 11 percent of GDP in Africa and Asia each year (Horton and
Steckel 2013)—equivalent to about $149 billion of productivity losses.

Because most of the detrimental effects of malnutrition that occur in the first 1,000 days of a
child’s life are essentially irreversible, the window of opportunity for preventing these effects is
the first 1,000 days, until the child is two years of age. After that age, most actions are too little,
too late, and too expensive (World Bank 2006; Black et al. 2008, 2013). Figure 13 shows that the
rates of return from nutrition investments are highest for programs targeting the earliest years,
since these investments build a foundation for future learning and productivity, prevent
irreversible losses, and lock in human capital for life (Heckman and Masterov 2004).

       Note: Age refers to the child’s age from birth, depicted in years for infancy and preschool, then in aggregate
       for school age and adulthood.

Malnutrition and poverty are interrelated and exacerbate each other. A recent study (Hoddinott et
al. 2011) concluded that individuals who are not stunted at 36 months are one-third less likely to
live in poor households as adults. Poverty increases the risk of malnutrition by lowering poor
households’ purchasing power, reducing access to basic health services, and exposing these
households to unhealthy environments, thereby compromising food intakes (both quality and
quantity) and increasing infections. Poor households are also more likely to have frequent
pregnancies, larger family sizes with high dependency ratios, more infections, and increased
health care costs. Conversely, malnutrition causes poor health status, poor cognitive

development, and less schooling, resulting in in poor human capital and long-term productivity
losses.

Nutrition interventions are consistently identified as cost-effective development actions, and the
costs of scaling up nutrition interventions are modest. Global benefit-cost ratio of micronutrient
powders for children is 37 to 1; of deworming it is 6 to 1; of iron fortification of staples it is 8 to
1; and of salt iodization is 30 to 1 (World Bank 2010).

A recent World Bank study estimated that investing in nutrition can increase a country’s GDP by
at least 3 percent annually (World Bank 2010). The same study estimated these costs at $10.3
billion per annum globally, to be financed through domestic public and private sector and donor
resources. These investments would provide preventive nutrition services to about 356 million
children, save at least 1.1 million lives and 30 million DALYs, and reduce the number of stunted
children by about 30 million worldwide. Bhutta et al. (2013) came up with similar estimates. In
another study, Hoddinott, Rosegrant, and Torero (2012) estimate that, for just $100 per child,
interventions including micronutrient provision, public provision of complementary food for the
prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, treatments for worms and diarrheal diseases, and
behavior change programs could reduce chronic undernutrition by 36 percent in developing
countries. Clearly there is huge potential pay-off for dedicating more resources to the scale-up of
evidence-based, cost-effective nutrition interventions.

Investments in improved nutrition outcomes also support the efforts of the World Bank Group
and its partners to increase the resilience of Malians to shocks. Ensuring equitable access to
evidence-based nutrition interventions can prevent unforeseen crises from pushing vulnerable
children into chronic undernutrition, with its severe consequences for their future health and
productivity. The recent food and nutrition crisis demonstrated the potential for shocks to
threaten the nutritional status of otherwise healthy children, so an investment in nutrition is also
an investment in resilience.


                   A MULTISECTORAL APPROACH FOR IMPROVING NUTRITION

The determinants of malnutrition are multisectoral. Therefore, to successfully and sustainably
improve nutrition outcomes, a multisectoral approach is needed. At a proximate level, access to
food, health, hygiene, and adequate child care practices is key to reducing malnutrition. At a
more distal level, poverty, women’s status, and other social factors play an important role. It has
been demonstrated that direct actions taken to address the proximate determinants of
malnutrition can be further enhanced by action on some of the more distal levels. For example,
programs supporting improved infant and young child feeding practices will be more effective if
they are complemented with programs to address gender issues by reducing women’s workloads,
thus allowing women more time for child care. Similarly, conditional cash transfer programs that
target the poor, if designed appropriately, have the potential not just to address poverty but also
to increase demand for nutrition services and good nutrition behaviors.

increasing     policy coherence         through
government-wide attention to policies or
strategies and trade-offs, which may have positive or unintended negative consequences for
nutrition. The synergy with other sectors is critical to breaking the cycle of malnutrition and
sustaining the gains from direct nutrition-specific interventions (World Bank 2013a).

Guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions is currently very limited for at least two
reasons. First, evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive interventions with respect to
nutritional outcomes is limited. Second, compared with nutrition-specific interventions,
estimating and attributing the costs of nutrition-sensitive interventions is quite complex since
these interventions have multiple objectives and improved nutrition outcomes is only one of
them. Notwithstanding these limitations, the availability of costing information is crucial to
assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This series of papers on nutrition
interventions makes a first-ever attempt to address these issues.

For Mali, beyond 10 key nutrition-specific interventions, we identify and cost six nutrition-
sensitive interventions that are well aligned with the current challenges, for which there is some
evidence of positive impact on nutrition outcomes, and for which there is some cost information.
First, we consider the incremental costs of adding a nutrition component to cash transfer
programs for poor households in Mali. We also consider two potential interventions delivered
through the agriculture sector—aflatoxin control in groundnuts and nutrition education through
agricultural extension—as well as two delivered through the education sector—school-based
deworming and school-based promotion of good hygiene. Additionally, we include cost and
benefit estimates for achieving the MDG targets for access to improved water and sanitation
infrastructure. Costs and benefit estimates (where possible) for the six nutrition-sensitive
interventions described here are presented in Part IV.

                                                     19
The World Bank Group is currently supporting a cash transfer program entitled Emergency
Safety Nets Project (Jigiséméjiri), which will be complemented by a package of preventive
nutrition interventions provided to project beneficiaries. In certain villages, all households with
children 0–59 months of age and/or with pregnant women are selected to receive the preventive
package while also participating in behavior communication sessions. The package will deliver
key vitamins and minerals (micronutrient powders, vitamin A supplementation, oral rehydration
solution with zinc, iron-folic acid supplementation, and deworming tablets) for young children
and pregnant women. While the nutrition package will be piloted only in select villages during
the first several years, this study uses the project budget as the basis for estimating the costs of
reaching full national coverage (World Bank 2013c).

Control of aflatoxins has the potential to reduce aflatoxins in groundnuts by at least 50 percent
(IFPRI 2012). Several promising pre- and post-harvest interventions have been analyzed in the
Malian context, including the use of improved seed varieties, better granaries, and practices such
as hand sorting and drying on wooden mats. Evidence shows that consuming high levels of
aflatoxins can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer in adults (Kuniholm et al. 2008; Abt
Associates 2014). Furthermore, it is widely understood that there is a relationship between
aflatoxin exposure and child stunting, albeit the evidence base for this relationship is more
tentative and it has not yet been adequately quantified in the published literature (Unnevehr and
Grace 2013; Abt Associates 2014). However, although the evidence of the links between
aflatoxins and child stunting is still tentative, its links with liver cancer are well established:
aflatoxin-induced liver cancer in Mali could lead to nearly 10,000 DALYs each year.9 This
provides sufficient impetus for actions to control aflatoxin exposure in Mali.

Providing farmers with information directed at behavior change can increase the likelihood of
positive nutritional outcomes (World Bank 2007). When producers understand the nutritional
significance of the foods that they produce and consume, it allows them to make better
consumption choices for themselves and their families. Using agricultural extension agents to
provide nutrition education on food safety and preparation, child feeding practices, and growth
monitoring and promotion allows behavior change communication strategies to achieve greater
coverage by building on existing program capacity.

School-based deworming has been proven to be an efficient and cost-effective intervention to
address health and nutrition outcomes in other settings, with cost per DALY saved estimated at
$4.55 (J-PAL 2012). Delivering deworming tablets through schools is inexpensive because it
uses existing infrastructure and delivery platforms in schools and community links with teachers.
Teachers need only minimal training to safely administer the tablets, so their workloads are not
significantly increased. On the other hand, the benefits of school-based deworming are
enormous. Bi-annual deworming significantly boosted school attendance and reduced self-
reported illness and anemia, while providing modest gains in height-for-age Z-scores (J-PAL
2012). In the long term, deworming improved self-reported health, increased total schooling
years, and raised earnings by 20 percent (Baird et al. 2011).

Improved hygiene behaviors through school-based promotion of handwashing and other good
hygiene behavior could decrease the risk of stunting in one in three children. Diarrheal episodes
exacerbate the relationship between malnutrition and infection, as children experiencing these
episodes tend to eat less, absorb fewer nutrients, and exhibit reduced resistance to infections.
Prolonged diarrheal episodes lead to impaired growth and development (Ejemot et al. 2008).
Correct handwashing at critical times can reduce the severity of diarrhea by 42 to 47 percent,
lower the incidence of diarrhea for children by 53 percent, and reduce the incidence of acute
respiratory infections by 44 percent in Nigeria (where the World Bank conducted a study on the
impact of poor sanitation; World Bank 2012a)—thereby reducing child stunting. A recent
campaign (WASH) to promote handwashing with soap in primary schools in China, Colombia,
and Egypt demonstrated significant reduction in absenteeism related to diarrhea and respiratory
illness (UNICEF 2012). A study in Brazil showed a relationship between the effects of early
childhood diarrhea on later school readiness and school performance, revealing the potential
long-term human and economic costs of early childhood diarrhea (Lorntz et al. 2006).

The effectiveness of promoting good hygiene behavior in schools is demonstrated by the long-
term impact and broad effect of good hygiene on communities. Schools are ideal settings for
hygiene education: children can learn and sustain lifelong proper hygiene practices through peer-
to-peer teaching, classroom sessions with focused training materials, and role playing or
interactive songs. A study on the long-term effects of hygiene education programs for both adults
and children found that hygiene behaviors are sustained beyond the end of an intervention. The
study also found that educated students can also influence family members by sharing this
information, which may in turn affect behavior change at the community level (Bolt and
Cairncross 2004).

At the same time, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions—which provide
improved water sources, hygienic latrines, and behavior change communication programs—can
help to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and child mortality. Gunther and Fink (2011) argue that
the reduction in diarrhea from improved WASH ultimately depends on both the quality of
existing WASH infrastructure and child mortality levels in the country. Given the high levels of
child mortality in Mali and the poor quality of its current infrastructure, it follows that WASH
interventions could have a significant impact. In studying the potential benefits of scaling up
WASH interventions globally, the WHO cites estimates that the benefits of reaching MDG
targets for water and sanitation in Mali would outweigh the costs 2 to 1 (Hutton 2012).



           NATIONAL AND PARTNER EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MALNUTRITION IN MALI

Given the country’s ongoing political and food crises, efforts to improve nutrition in Mali are
integrated into both the humanitarian response and long-term development programming. These
nutrition interventions are coordinated by the Nutrition Division (Division Nutrition; DN) of
Mali’s Ministry of Health’s National Health Directorate (Direction Nationale de la Santé; DNS).
While the humanitarian response has prioritized the prevention and treatment of acute


                                               21
malnutrition, development efforts continue to focus on preventing chronic malnutrition and
micronutrient deficiencies.

National efforts to address widespread malnutrition are guided by the government’s 2013
National Nutrition Policy. In line with this policy, the government is currently in the process of
elaborating a costed Multisectoral Strategic Action Plan for Nutrition, which will cover the
period from 2013 to 2017 and aim to coordinate interministerial efforts to combat malnutrition
by scaling up both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions. REACH has supported
the elaboration of the government’s Strategic Plan, including the costing of its activities
conducted in collaboration with Inner City Fund (ICF) International.

Although consolidated information on the partner landscape for nutrition is lacking, this analysis
attempts to provide a broad overview of support for nutrition in Mali. Despite efforts to provide a
holistic review of nutrition activities in Mali, significant gaps likely remain. A more detailed
mapping exercise is currently being undertaken by REACH and ICF as part of the collaborative
Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) process.

The Ministry of Health is in charge of six nutrition-specific programs, including the Acute
Malnutrition Management Program, the Food Standards and Procedures Policy, the People
Living with HIV/AIDS Nutrition Management Program, the national campaigns for the
intensification of nutrition activities (SIAN), the Infant and Young Child Feeding Program, and
the Essential Nutrition Actions Program (SUN 2012). Because national nutrition resources and
capacities are limited, international and local partners provide funding, technical support, and
implementation assistance for many of these interventions.

Several other government ministries and agencies also contribute to multisectoral efforts to
address malnutrition (SUN 2012). These stakeholders are regularly convened by the Comité
Technique Intersectoriel de Nutrition (Multisectoral Technical Committee on Nutrition), which is
chaired by the Ministry of Health and includes representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture,
Education, Social Development, and Humanitarian Action, as well as the Food Security
Commission. The National Nutrition Policy also oversees the creation of a National Nutrition
Development Council under the direction of the Prime Minister; this council is responsible for
coordinating national multisectoral nutrition activities (SUN 2012). REACH, which is funded by
Canada and consists of representatives from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the
WHO, the World Food Program (WFP), and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), has been involved in developing the government’s multisectoral approach.

Direct aid from the international community to the Malian government was suspended following
the 2012 coup that overthrew the country’s elected leadership. The suspension of bilateral official
development assistance (ODA), combined with a food crisis in the South and an ongoing
insurgency in the North, led donors and implementing partners to focus their efforts on delivering
an effective emergency response. However, following the government’s adoption of the Road
Map for the Transition in early 2013, donors have begun to resume bilateral development
assistance.


                                                22
Since 2013 a number of nutrition-related programs have been implemented in Mali as emergency
assistance. The European Commission for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) has
been providing funding for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition and food distribution, as
well as growth monitoring in community settings and nutrition-related training. Those activities
have been implemented by UNICEF, the WFP, and a number of nongovernmental organizations.
The WFP is also implementing blanket feeding programs as well as targeted supplementary
feeding and treatment for moderate acute malnutrition. As part of the Food for Peace program,
the US Department of Agriculture and the Office of Disaster Assistance, in collaboration with
nongovernmental organizations including ACTED, Mercy Corps, Near East Foundation, Save
the Children, and Catholic Relief Services are providing emergency assistance including food
distribution.

There are also ongoing programs to strengthen technical capacity in the nutrition sector. USAID,
in collaboration with the University Research Center and as part of the Assist project, is
providing technical assistance at primary health care facility level to strengthen the health
infrastructure, including technical assistance related to deworming, management of acute
malnutrition, and the SIAN (the intensification of nutrition activities week) initiative. A project
to establish a systeme d’information sanitaire (sanitation information system) is in the
preparatory stage. Similarly, a project aimed at developing local capacity and expertise in
nutrition by establishing a Master’s program in nutrition at the University of Bamako, funded by
Canada and spearheaded by UNICEF, is underway.

In addition to nutrition-specific interventions and programs described above, a number of
activities aimed at strengthening resilience and decreasing vulnerability and food insecurity are
also being implemented in Mali. These include activities implemented as part of the US
government–funded Feeding the Future program, which includes several projects focusing on
horticulture, agricultural innovation, the provision of cattle and the commercial integration of
animal husbandry, enhancement of the cereal value chain and improvement in the production of
rice, millet, and sorghum. The European Union (EU) has funded several iterations of the
Programmes d’appui à la sécurité alimentaire (Program to Support Food Security; PASA) project
(PASA 5 is currently ongoing), which aims to improve food security among the most vulnerable
communities in Mali. The EU is also providing funding for Africa’s Nutrition Security
Partnership, which is implemented in partnership with UNICEF in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
and Uganda. In Mali, this partnership includes infant and young child feeding interventions, as
well as multisectoral interventions to improve nutrition at the community level. The EU is also
funding nutrition-sensitive interventions aimed at improving resilience and decreasing food
insecurity under two other programs: AGIR (Global Alliance for Resilience Initiative) and the
Initiative pour le renforcement de la Résilience par l’Irrigation et la Gestion appropriée des
Ressources (Initiative for Strengthening the Resilience of Irrigation and proper management of
resources; IRRIGAR). The WFP has also engaged in activities related to improving resilience
and decreasing vulnerability and has implemented activities concerned with the distribution of
food and nutritional inputs, cash transfer programs, and capacity strengthening at the community
level through sensitization, training, institutional development, and support for income-
generating activities. The US government is currently funding the Annual Program Statement
project whose goal is to improve the nutritional status of women and children through behavior

change communication and nutrition-sensitive interventions such as support for small-scale
agriculture and the promotion of community and household vegetable gardens to encourage the
consumption of foods rich in micronutrients, as well as interventions related to water, sanitation,
and hygiene. Appendix 2 provides an overview of implementing partners involved in nutrition
activities.

         PART II – COSTED SCALE-UP SCENARIOS: RATIONALE,
                   OBJECTIVES, AND METHODOLOGY

                         RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS

The overall objective of this report is to support the Government of Mali in developing a
strategic approach to its malnutrition challenge and in providing a costed scale-up plan for
nutrition. It is designed to provide the Government of Mali with the rationale needed to design an
effective nutrition strategy and the tools required to leverage adequate resources from domestic
budgets as well as from development partners. Within this context, the objectives of the analysis
that follows are:

      To estimate scale-up costs in Mali for a set of well-proven nutrition-specific interventions
       that have the potential to be scaled up through tested delivery mechanisms
      To conduct a basic economic analysis to calculate the potential benefits and cost-
       effectiveness associated with the proposed scale-up
      To propose a series of scenarios for a costed scale-up plan that rolls out this package of
       nutrition-specific interventions in phases, based on considerations of impact, geography,
       implementation capacity, and cost
      To explore initial costs for a limited number of nutrition-sensitive interventions through
       social protection programs as well as through the agriculture, education, and water and
       sanitation sectors

Although the economic arguments for increasing investments in nutrition are sound, one of the
first questions raised by key decision makers in any country is “How much will it cost?” In 2010,
the World Bank spearheaded a study called Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost? to answer
that question at the global level. The analysis estimated the level of global financing required to
scale up 10 evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions in 36 countries that account for 90
percent of the world’s stunting burden and 32 smaller countries that also have a high prevalence
of undernutrition. The results of the study highlighted the global financing gap, underscored the
importance of investing in nutrition at the global level, and laid out a methodology for estimating
the costs for nutrition-specific interventions. However, these global estimates did not capture the
nuances and context in each country, nor were they contextualized to every individual country’s
policy and capacity setting or its fiscal constraints. This report builds on the early work to address
this gap and to contextualize the cost estimates for Mali.

The multisectoral approach requires nutrition-sensitive approaches or interventions that can be
delivered through other sectors. As discussed above, globally there is currently very limited
guidance on costing for nutrition-sensitive interventions. Therefore this present report provides
an exploratory analysis to be used primarily to engage other sectors in planning for improved
nutritional outcomes. This initial exercise will contribute to a broader discussion about
methodological and other issues for costing nutrition-sensitive interventions, and will thereby
encourage the formulation of standard definitions, methodologies, and guidance for costing these
interventions in the future.

               SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTIONS

The costed scale-up plan is presented in two sections. The first section presents estimated costs
and benefits for the set of 10 nutrition-specific interventions that were included in the World
Bank’s Scaling Up Nutrition report (2010) and are delivered primarily through the health sector.
These interventions and the associated target population and current coverage for each
intervention are specified in Table 2.

The nutrition-specific interventions considered are a modified package of the interventions
included in the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition, tailored to
the Mali context. These 10 interventions are based on current scientific evidence and there is
general consensus from the global community about the impact of these interventions. Some
interventions—such as deworming and iron-fortification of staple foods—that were included in
the 2008 Lancet series but not listed in the 2013 Lancet series are included here because they
remain relevant to Mali. Others—such as calcium supplementation for women and prophylactic
zinc supplementation—are excluded because delivery mechanisms are not available in client
countries, including Mali, and/or there are no clear WHO protocols or guidelines for large-scale
programming. In other cases, there are limited capacities for scaling up the interventions. Only
those nutrition-specific interventions that are relevant to the Mali context and that have strong
evidence of effectiveness, a WHO protocol, and a feasible delivery mechanism for scale-up are
included in the proposed scale-up package below. As this evidence base grows, other
interventions can be added over time.

The analysis in the following section focuses on nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant
to the Mali context and that have the potential to have an impact on nutrition outcomes. A
description of these interventions, associated target populations, and responsible sectors are listed
in Table 3. As discussed above, the evidence base for nutrition-sensitive interventions is not as
strong as that for nutrition-specific interventions. Therefore these estimates are exploratory and
are limited to six potential interventions, relevant to the Mali context, that can be scaled up and
that have some potential for impact on nutrition outcomes. Additional interventions were not
included in these initial estimates because their impact on nutrition is yet to be clearly
documented (Masset et al. 2011; Ruel et al. 2013; World Bank 2013a), because this is an
exploratory instead of an exhaustive effort, or because they were not considered relevant to
Mali’s needs. Furthermore, cost attribution is complex because nutrition-sensitive interventions
are designed for multiple purposes.

ESTIMATION OF TARGET POPULATION SIZES, CURRENT COVERAGE LEVELS, AND UNIT COSTS

Target population estimates are presented in Appendix 3. These estimates are based on
projections from the 2009 Census that used 2.84 percent as the annual population growth rate.
Data on the prevalence of child stunting (height-for-age Z-score <−2), underweight (weight-for-
age Z-score <−2), and severe wasting (weight-for-height Z-score <−3) among children under five
years of age in each region were obtained from the 2010 Mali MICS/ELIM, complemented as
needed with recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Standard Monitoring and
Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) data.

Data on current coverage levels were obtained from various sources. To avoid underestimating
costs, the current coverage levels for iron fortification of staple foods and therapeutic zinc with
oral rehydration salts (ORS) were set at 0 because either program coverage of these treatments is
currently minimal or current reliable coverage data were not available. Programmatic data on the
coverage of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition were provided by UNICEF. Coverage data
on salt iodization were obtained from the 2010 Mali MICS/ELIM. Because of a lack of more
recent data, coverage of iron-folic acid supplementation for pregnant women comes from DHS
2006. For coverage of vitamin A supplementation and deworming campaigns, survey data from
SMART 2013 were used for the South; data from DHS 2006 were used for the North because of
a lack of more recent data. Finally, because there are no consolidated national data on the
coverage of behavior change interventions delivered through community nutrition programs, the
percent of households living within 5 kilometers of a community health center was used as a
proxy; these data are from the Ministry of Health (2013).

The unit costs and delivery platforms for the nutrition-specific interventions are listed in Table 4.
Whenever possible, the unit costs of the nutrition-specific interventions were estimated using
programmatic data based on the preliminary results of a nutrition costing exercise conducted by
the ICF and REACH, Ministry of Health sources, or implementing partners such as UNICEF and
the WFP. In cases where the intervention was not being implemented or local data were not
available, unit cost estimates from Nigeria or from the global costing study World Bank (2010)
were used. A complete index of data sources and relevant assumptions for each intervention can
be found in Appendix 4.

The unit costs and the delivery platforms for selected nutrition-sensitive interventions are listed
in Table 5. These interventions are delivered through a range of sectors and are based on
programmatic data and ex-ante estimates from both Mali and neighboring countries.

The first nutrition-sensitive intervention provides a package of preventive nutrition interventions
to pregnant mothers and children in poor households that are receiving cash transfers as part of
the Emergency Safety Nets Project..10 The unit cost is derived from the World Bank Group–
financed Emergency Safety Nets Project in Mali, which includes a nutrition pilot to be
implemented in 10 percent of target villages over five years (World Bank 2013c). Because this is
based on the planned budget for an upcoming pilot project, actual costs may be higher or lower,
especially when the nutrition package is scaled to full national coverage as envisioned in this
study.

For the nutrition-sensitive interventions in the agriculture sector, unit costs were estimated using
cost data from both Mali and Niger. The unit cost (per producer per year) for nutrition education
delivered through agricultural extension workers comes from program budgets from FAO Niger

     A preventive nutrition package would include behavior change communication, vitamin A supplementation,
       therapeutic zinc supplementation as part of diarrhea treatment with ORS, micronutrient powders, deworming
       treatment, iron-folic acid supplementation, and iodized oil capsules.

Unit costs for interventions in the education sector are based on the cost of similar programs
delivered in other African countries. For school-based deworming, the unit cost ($0.08) used in
the calculation is obtained from regional estimates of delivery cost in schools for Ghana (Guyatt
2003), assuming twice-a-year treatment. These estimates compare well with recent regional
bottom-up cost analysis, based on the neglected tropical disease national plans from 36 Sub-
Saharan countries (Seddoh et al. 2013),11 which estimates the unit cost of preventive
chemotherapy of five neglected tropical diseases in the Africa region at $0.26. The major cost
components for deworming are human resources, surveillance and mapping, non-donated drugs,
advocacy, infrastructure and logistics, and implementation and management. No unit cost

estimate is available for school-based promotion of good hygiene for Mali, so the unit cost of $2
per student obtained from UNICEF (2012) on WASH in schools is used as the unit cost. This
includes the cost of capacity building, monitoring, advocacy, and social mobilization.


                                     ESTIMATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS

The program experience methodology employed in World Bank (2010) is used for calculating
the cost of scaling up in Mali. This approach generates unit cost data that capture all aspects of
service delivery, including the costs of commodities, transportation and storage, personnel,
training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), relevant overhead, wastage, and so on
for each intervention from actual programs that are already in operation in Mali. Another
commonly used method is the ingredients approach, in which selected activities are bundled into
appropriate delivery packages (for example, number of visits to a health center) (see, e.g., Bhutta
et al. 2013). Although the program experience approach tends to yield cost estimates higher than
those of the ingredients approach, these estimates more accurately reflect real programmatic
experience, including inefficiencies in service delivery. It should, however, be noted that the
calculated costs are reported in financial or budgetary terms. They do not capture the full social
resource requirements, which account for the opportunity costs of the time committed by
beneficiaries accessing the services.

We calculate the annual public investment required to scale up the interventions as follows:



where:

           Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage12
             = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
             = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
             = cost covered by households living above poverty line for selected interventions

Appendix 5 describes the methodology in detail.

The expected benefits from scaling up nutrition interventions are calculated in terms of (1)
DALYs saved, (2) number of lives saved, (3) cases of childhood stunting averted, and (4)
increased program coverage. To calculate the number of DALYs, we use the method employed
by Black et al. (2008) to estimate the averted morbidity and mortality from scaling up different
nutrition interventions. The method uses population attributable fractions (PAF) based on the
comparative risk assessment project (Ezzati et al. 2002; Ezzati et al. 2004) to estimate the burden
of infectious diseases attributable to different forms of undernutrition using most recent Global
Burden of Disease Study (IHME 2010). DALY estimates in this study are neither discounted nor

12
     Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for community-based
       treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to be 80 percent.

                                                           32
age-weighted, in line with the methodology used in the Global Burden of Disease Study and the
WHO Global Health Estimates (2012). Appendix 6 describes the methodology for estimating
DALYs. The projected number of lives saved and the cases of childhood stunting averted are
calculated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which translates measured coverage changes into
estimates of mortality reduction and changes in the prevalence of under-five stunting. This
analysis included all ten interventions to calculate the number DALYs saved. However, because
of methodological limitations of the LiST tool, the calculation for number of lives saved is based
on only six of the ten interventions,13 and cases of childhood stunting averted is based on only
four of the ten.14 As such, the estimates presented here are likely to underestimate the number of
lives saved and cases of childhood stunting averted. Appendix 7 describes the methodology for
the LiST estimates.

The measures for cost-effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions are calculated in terms of
cost per DALY saved, cost per life saved, and cost per case of stunting averted. Estimates of
benefits were combined with information on costs to produce the cost-effectiveness measures for
each intervention as well as for the overall package of intervention. The evaluation of cost-
effectiveness ratio in terms of DALYs saved is based on the categorization used by WHO-
CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective):15 an intervention is considered to be
“very cost-effective” if the range for the cost per DALY averted is less than GDP per capita;16 it
is considered to be “cost-effective” if it is between one and three times GDP per capita; and it is
considered “not cost-effective” if it exceeds three times GDP per capita (WHO 2014).

The cost-benefit analysis is based on the estimated economic value of the benefits attributable to
nutrition-specific interventions. In order to arrive at a dollar value of the impact on mortality and
morbidity of a five-year scale-up plan, we use estimates of the number of lives saved and the
reduction in stunting prevalence produced by the LiST tool. Following established practice, a life
year saved is valued as equivalent to gross national income (GNI) per capita; this is considered to
be a conservative measure because it accounts for only the economic, not the social, value of a
year of life. In order to estimate the value of the reduction in stunting, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), which values a year of life lived without stunting
based on the assumption that stunted individuals lose an average of 66 percent of lifetime
earnings. Future benefits are then age-adjusted and discounted at three potential discount rates (3,
5, and 7 percent) in order to arrive at their present value. The present value of future benefits is
then compared with the annual public investment required, which allows us to estimate the net

     The six interventions are community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A supplementation,
       therapeutic zinc supplementation with ORS, iron-folic acid supplementation, the public provision of
       complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, and community-based
       management of severe acute malnutrition.

present value (NPV) and internal rate of return of the investment. A detailed explanation of the
benefit estimation methodology can be found in Appendix 8.

The annual increase in economic productivity attributable to each package of interventions is
calculated based on the same estimates of future benefits. Although these benefits occur only
once beneficiaries have reached productive age, we assume that these benefits approximate the
present value of economic productivity lost each year as a result of mortality and morbidity that
would otherwise be prevented by scaling up nutrition interventions. Values presented are taken
from a year in which all beneficiaries have reached productive age.

The approach for estimating the potential costs and benefits of nutrition-sensitive interventions
differs from the methodology used for nutrition-specific interventions. Similar to nutrition-
specific interventions, the total cost for scaling up the interventions is calculated by multiplying
the unit cost by the target population (whether local unit costs or regional unit costs are used
depends on their availability). However, since most nutrition-sensitive interventions have
multiple objectives, it is not always feasible to attribute the nutrition-related benefits to the
overall costs of the interventions. Because these constraints limit the accuracy of cost-
effectiveness estimates, we instead rely on secondary sources and published literature when
available, with cost-effectiveness presented in terms of cost per DALY saved.


                   SCENARIOS FOR SCALING UP NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS

When estimating the costs and benefits of scaling up nutrition interventions, we begin with
estimates for scaling up all 10 interventions to full national coverage and follow this with
estimates for various scale-up scenarios. The full-coverage estimates can be considered the
medium-term policy goal for the Government of Mali, but resource constraints will probably
limit the government’s ability to achieve full national coverage in the short term. Therefore we
also propose three scenarios for prioritizing the scale-up of nutrition interventions, which also
allow for some alignment with Mali’s most pressing structural and crisis-induced needs:

      Scenario 1: Scale up by region
      Scenario 2: Scale up by intervention
      Scenario 3: Scale up by intervention and region

Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except for
community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition, for which full coverage is assumed to
be 80 percent. This definition is consistent with the methodology used in World Bank (2010),
and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs have successfully
achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

   PART III – RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS


                TOTAL COST, EXPECTED BENEFITS, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS

The total additional public investment required to scale up 10 nutrition-specific interventions
from current coverage levels to full coverage (so that 100 percent of the target population is
covered) at the national level in Mali is estimated at nearly $64 million annually (Table 6). This
cost includes the additional cost of scaling up all 10 interventions ($91 million per year) from
current coverage levels, plus additional resources for M&E, operations research, technical
support, and capacity development for program delivery (about $10 million). We anticipate that,
of this total amount, part of the costs of iron fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt
iodization, and public provision of complementary food could be covered by private resources
from households above the poverty line, accounting for an estimated $37 million.

The expected benefits from scaling up these 10 nutrition-specific interventions are large (Table
7). About 482,000 DALYs and more than 14,000 lives would be saved annually,17 while over
260,000 cases of stunting among children under five would be averted.18 Programs are estimated
to expand as follows:

        The families of 1.6 million children 0–59 months of age would be reached by community
         programs for behavior change communication and growth promotion
        429,000 children 6–59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
         vitamin A supplementation
        377,000 children 6–23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
         multiple micronutrient powders
        2.9 million children 6–23 months of age would be treated for diarrhea with zinc and oral
         rehydration solution
        820,000 children 12–59 months of age would receive deworming medication
        311,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal care
        17.3 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
        6.2 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
        71,000 children 6–59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
         community-based management practices
        431,000 children 6–23 months of age would receive a small amount of nutrient-dense
         complementary food for the prevention or treatment of moderate acute malnutrition

Most of the proposed nutrition-specific interventions are highly cost-effective, but there are two
exceptions (Table 8). Seven of the ten interventions are considered “very cost-effective”
according to the criteria set forth by WHO-CHOICE (WHO 2014), which considers an
intervention to be “very cost-effective” if the cost per DALY saved is less than GDP per capita
($715 for Mali). These include community nutrition programs for growth promotion, vitamin A
supplementation, zinc supplementation, micronutrient powders, deworming, iron-folic acid
supplementation for pregnant women, and the community-based management of severe acute

malnutrition. The public provision of complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute
malnutrition is $5,034—a substantially higher cost per DALY saved. This is more than three
times the Mali GDP per capita and is therefore not considered to be cost-effective. Given the low
benefit-cost ratio and fiscal constraints in Mali, the public provision of complementary food for
the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition should be assigned the lowest priority in terms of
scale up. Logistical constraints and potential issues of governance and accountability can further
hinder a successful scale-up of this intervention.

                                THREE POTENTIAL SCALE-UP SCENARIOS

Scenario 1: Scale Up by Region
Table 9 shows the estimated costs and benefits of scaling up the 10 nutrition-specific
interventions according to the stunting burden found in each region. As discussed above, the

                                                         38
regions display significant disparities in malnutrition rates, with Sikasso, Ségou, Mopti, and
Tombouctou (highest burden regions) all suffering from under-five stunting prevalence of 40
percent or above, while stunting rates in the other provinces fall between 30 and 40 percent
(middle burden regions), with the exception of Bamako (the lowest burden region), where
stunting prevalence is 21 percent (DHS Program 2012).19 The highest burden regions account for
an overwhelming portion (over two-thirds) of the total cost of scaling up nutrition interventions.
These regions will disproportionately benefit from such interventions, as demonstrated by their
high expected benefits in terms of DALYs saved, lives saved, and cases of stunting averted

b. Regions exhibiting the middle burden of stunting (30 to 40 percent) are Kayes, Koulikoro, Gao, and Kidal.
c. The region with the lowest burden of stunting (21 percent) is Bamako.



Given the high burden of stunting as well as the population’s vulnerability to malnutrition in
Sikasso, Ségou, Mopti, and Tombouctou, these regions should be prioritized for scale-up. This
scenario would require an investment of $44 million annually, and would save over 280,000
DALYs and 9,000 lives. It would also increase program reach as follows:

          The families of 259,000 children aged 0–59 months would be reached by community
           programs for behavior change
          147,000 children aged 6–59 months would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
           vitamin A supplementation

     Stunting rates for Gao, Tombouctou, and Kidal are from DHS 2006. The DHS 2006 data are an overestimate of
        the 2010 MICS/ELIM data but may be more closely aligned with the latest 2013 numbers when taking into
        account the strong effects of the crisis on the North.
20
     These calculations take into account population variation across the regions and, accordingly, the numbers of
       children not currently served who can benefit from each of the interventions. The later are reported in
       Appendix 3.

                                                               39
      1.6 million children aged 6–59 months would receive zinc supplementation as part of
       diarrhea management
      148,000 children aged 6–23 months would receive vitamins and minerals through
       multiple micronutrient powders
      363,000 children aged 12–59 months would receive deworming medication
      161,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal
       care
      9.2 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
      2.5 million people would gain access to iodized salt
      59,000 children aged 6–59 months would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
       community-based management practices
      136,000 children aged 6–23 months would receive a small amount of nutrient-dense
       complementary food (~250 kilocalories/day) for the prevention or treatment of moderate
       acute malnutrition

Scenario 2: Scale Up by Intervention
The primary considerations for choosing the interventions in each step are cost-effectiveness,
recommended phasing of interventions, implementation capacity, and the presence of already-
existing delivery mechanisms. The proposed plan for a step-wise scale-up by intervention is
summarized below and illustrated in Figure 14.

      Step 1 includes community nutrition programs for behavior change and growth
       promotion, in addition to all micronutrient and deworming interventions. The cost of
       scaling up Step 1 interventions to reach full coverage (100 percent of the target
       population) is $15.7 million per year. In this step, an additional $1.4 million is allocated
       for capacity development and approximately $300,000 is allocated to M&E and
       operations research. Households above the poverty line are expected to cover $2.6 million
       toward the costs of micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and iron fortification of flour,
       bringing the total public resources required to $14.9 million.
      Step 2 includes the scale up of community-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition
       (CMAM) from existing coverage levels to 80 percent. We estimate that the cost of
       increased CMAM coverage is $8.2 million per year. We also allocate approximately
       $734,000 for capacity development and $163,000 for M&E and operations research, for a
       total of $9.1 million.
      Step 3 includes only the public provision of complementary food for the prevention of
       moderate acute malnutrition. The estimated cost of this intervention is $67.2 million.
       However, we anticipate that households above the poverty line would be able to
       contribute $34.7 million. After allocating approximately $6 million to capacity
       development and $1.3 million for M&E, the total public investment required for Step 3 is
       $39.9 million.

It should be noted that when the public provision of complementary food for moderate acute
malnutrition is included in the package of interventions, the cost of providing multiple
micronutrient powders will decline. This is because of an overlap between the populations
targeted by micronutrient powders and the public provision of complementary food: when

                                               40
children aged 6–23 months who suffer from moderate malnutrition are provided with
complementary food, they do not receive micronutrient powders. Those children 6–23 months
old who are not at risk of developing moderate malnutrition will continue to receive
micronutrient powders even when the provision of complementary food is included. In this case,
the total public resources required for micronutrient and deworming interventions declines from
$14.9 million to $14.7 million.


        Figure 14. Proposed Scenario 2: Stepwise Scale-Up by Intervention




 Note: When the public provision of complementary food for moderate acute malnutrition is included in the package
of interventions, the cost of providing multiple micronutrient powders will decline because of an overlap between the
populations targeted by micronutrient powders and the public provision of complementary food. See text for details.



Given cost-effectiveness and implementation capacity considerations, we propose that Mali scale
up only Step 1 and Step 2 interventions, which would require an annual public investment of $24
million (Table 10), and save at least 456,000 DALYs and 14,000 lives. Step 3 is given the lowest
priority for three main reasons: (1) recent findings from the 2013 Lancet series suggest that, in
most situations, the prevention of moderate malnutrition with a strong focus on counseling and
education achieves similar results with or without public provision of complementary foods; (2)

                                                         41
at $39.9 million, the cost of providing complementary food accounts for nearly half of the overall
cost. In contrast, the cost of all micronutrient and deworming interventions (in the absence of the
provision of complementary food) is only $5.9 million, and these have much more attractive
benefit-cost ratios; and (3) governance and accountability challenges for providing
complementary food, as well as logistics and supply chain constraints, are considerable.

The scale-up of Step 1 and Step 2 interventions would benefit the following target groups:

    The families of 1.6 million children 0–59 months of age would be reached by community
     programs for behavior change communication and growth promotion
    429,000 children 6–59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving
     vitamin A supplementation
    775,000 children 6–23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through
     multiple micronutrient powders
    2.9 million children 6–23 months of age would be treated for diarrhea with zinc and oral
     rehydration solution
    820,000 children 12–59 months of age would receive deworming medication
    311,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal care
    17.3 million people would be able to consume staple foods fortified with iron
    6.2 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
    71,000 children 6–59 months of age would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using
     community-based management practices

combined impact to be different than the individual sums.




Scenario 3: Scaling Up by Intervention and by Region
Scenario 3 seeks to balance political and local context considerations with the most effective
allocation of resources. Because allocating resources based purely on technical considerations
can alienate excluded groups and not be fully aligned with local needs, this scenario seeks to
prioritize the scale-up of higher-cost interventions in regions with higher burdens of malnutrition;
such interventions are in addition to less costly interventions implemented by the government in
all regions of the country. We therefore propose that the government implement all micronutrient
and deworming interventions in each of the nine regions, while prioritizing the scale-up of
community-based management of severe acute malnutrition and community nutrition programs
in regions with under-five stunting rates above 40 percent. This scenario would help address
some of the structural chronic and acute malnutrition issues that require targeted interventions
(pregnant women and children in the four regions with the highest levels of chronic malnutrition
and vulnerability to malnutrition, in Tombouctou and Ségou with very high levels of acute
malnutrition, and so on). At the same time, this approach would help tackle some of the effects of

                                                         43
the recent crisis, seen by the worsening nutrition outcomes of very young children and in a region
such as Ségou.

Scaling up interventions under Scenario 3 would require $18 million in public resources (red
cells in Table 11). Scenario 3 would save approximately 319,500 DALYs and 11,000 lives.
Program coverage would increase as follows:

   The families of 259,000 children 0–59 months of age would be reached by community
    programs for behavior change communication and growth promotion
   429,000 children 6–59 months of age would receive twice-yearly doses of life-saving vitamin
    A supplementation
   2.9 million children 6–23 months of age would be treated for diarrhea with zinc and oral
    rehydration solution
   775,000 children 6–23 months of age would receive vitamins and minerals through multiple
    micronutrient powders
   820,000 children 12–59 months of age would receive deworming medication
   311,000 pregnant women would receive iron-folic acid tablets as part of their antenatal care
   17.3 million people would be able to consume flour fortified with iron
   6.2 million people who do not currently use iodized salt would be able to obtain it
   59,000 children 6–59 months would be treated for severe acute malnutrition using

                      COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE SCALE-UP SCENARIOS

Our analysis reveals significant differences in the cost-effectiveness of the various scenarios,
with Scenarios 2 and 3 being the most attractive. Table 12 summarizes the costs, DALYs saved,
projected number of lives saved, and projected cases of child stunting averted (where possible)
for each scale-up scenario. Scenario 2 offers the most cost-effective solution, with a cost per
DALY saved of just $51. However, Scenario 3 offers the lowest annual cost—$18 million—
while also achieving a relatively high degree of cost-effectiveness with a cost per DALY saved of
$57. Although all scenarios offer significant benefits, a combination of cost-effectiveness
considerations and resource limitations make Scenarios 2 and 3 the most attractive options.

Recognizing the difficulty of scaling to full coverage in one year, we also consider the costs of
scaling up gradually over five years rather than in one year for all scenarios (Table 13). Scenarios
2 and 3 would require $67 and $50 million, respectively, as compared with $174 million for the
full coverage scenario. Interventions are assumed to scale from current coverage as follows: 20
percent of coverage in year 1, 40 percent in year 2, 60 percent in year 3, 80 percent in year 4, and
100 percent in year 5. For these calculations, we consider the expenditures on capacity
development and system strengthening required to scale to full coverage to be a fixed cost, with
some additional funds allocated to refresher training and rehiring in the years after the
intervention has scaled to reach 100 percent. Thus, the average annual amount spent on capacity
development is allocated across the five years rather than increasing in proportion to coverage as
is the case with the other costs.

A high burden of malnutrition negatively impacts a nation’s human capital. Therefore, an
investment in improving nutrition outcomes among children is also an investment in Mali’s
economic future. The two main ways in which malnutrition affects economic productivity are
increased mortality and morbidity—in other words, lives lost and years lived with a disease or
disability. For the purposes of this analysis, we estimate the potential economic benefits of
scaling up nutrition interventions in terms of lives saved (reduction in mortality) and cases of
stunting averted (reduction in morbidity). Because each life lost results in one less citizen
contributing to the nation’s economy, and because stunted children tend to earn and consume
less, these impact estimates help us to arrive at approximations of the return on investment
attributable to the scale up over five years of a particular package of interventions. Our analysis
of the economic productivity of the investment in nutrition is limited to the full coverage
scenario because we were only able to estimate cases of stunting averted for this one scenario.

It should be noted that these estimates of economic benefits are based on a highly conservative
methodology that does not necessarily account for all of the potential benefits associated with
improving nutrition outcomes among Malian children. However, even such conservative
estimates clearly demonstrate that the opportunity costs of not scaling up nutrition interventions
are substantial: we estimate that an investment in bringing all 10 interventions to full national
coverage over five years (the full coverage scenario) could produce $194 million in annual
returns over the productive lives of the children affected (Table 14).

We also find that the investment yields positive net present values, large benefit-cost rations and
a high internal rate of return (Table 14). Because any increase in the assumed discount rate
reduces the present value of future benefits, we perform a sensitivity analysis using 3 potential
discount rates: 3, 5, and 7 percent. We identify net present values ranging between $0.81 and
$2.7 billion depending of the discount rate (7 and 3 percent, respectively). The investment yields
an internal rate of return of almost 18 percent.

                                 FINANCING NUTRITION IN MALI

Despite the resumption of bilateral development assistance and the mobilization of international
resources for the emergency response, there is broad agreement among stakeholders that current
financing for nutrition in Mali is inadequate (SUN 2012). At the central government level, no
budget line item is currently dedicated to nutrition. Instead, government allocations to nutrition
share space in the budget with other health activities, including malaria and hygiene (MOH
2011). As shown in Figure 15, the budget allocation to the Nutrition Division is relatively small,
amounting to CFAF 564 million in 2010 (approximately $1.2 million) and just CFAF 356
million in 2011 (approximately $750,000). In 2010, nutrition funding represented only 1.9
percent of the DNS budget and a mere 1 percent in 2011 (MOH 2011).

Over the last decade, nutrition ODA to Mali has increased significantly in both value and as a
share of overall ODA (Figure 16). In fact, even as overall ODA declined sharply following the
2012 coup, international financing for nutrition grew from $23.5 million in 2011 to over $27
million in 2012 (OECD 2014). Although ODA figures have yet to be released for subsequent
years, nutrition funding for the humanitarian response alone reached a total of $27.97 million in
2013, indicating sustained growth in donor funding for nutrition in the midst of an ongoing
nutrition crisis (UN OCHA 2014). However, given the large proportion of donor nutrition
funding currently allocated to the humanitarian response, it remains unclear whether this level of
funding can be sustained over the long term.

                          UNCERTAINTIES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Because actual unit costs may differ from our estimates, it is important to consider the effects of
either an increase or decrease in these costs on the overall price of the interventions. This
uncertainty is greatest for higher-cost interventions and less significant for those with lower
costs. For example, given the prevalence of information on and experience with less expensive
micronutrient and deworming interventions, there is a high degree of certainty about their
estimated costs. On the other hand, the costs of community nutrition programs can vary greatly
depending on their context, the intensity of behavior change campaigns, the number of
community health workers employed, and the amount of incentives provided to them—all of
these affect unit costs. Finally, there is limited experience in the public provision of
complementary food for the prevention of moderate acute malnutrition, while unit costs depend
on the type of food provided as well as the choice of targeting method. Other factors, such as
widespread concern about governance and diversion of the food, also need to be considered. In
order to account for these uncertainties, we perform a partial sensitivity analysis that describes
the impact of variation in unit costs while holding other variables constant. These results are
presented in Appendix 9.

  PART IV – RESULTS FOR NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS

This section presents cost-effectiveness estimates for six nutrition-sensitive interventions that are
highly relevant for Mali: a preventive nutrition package delivered as part of a targeted cash
transfer program; aflatoxin reduction in groundnuts with improved granaries; nutrition education
via agricultural extension workers; school-based deworming; and school-based promotion of
good hygiene. The sixth intervention is the effort to reach MDG targets for improved access to
water and sanitation. Table 15 summarizes the cost of scaling up these interventions and, when
available, the projected DALYs saved and cost per DALY saved.

          INCORPORATING NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS INTO SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS

The costs of scaling up the provision of preventive nutrition interventions to the children of all
cash transfer beneficiaries are estimated to be $49 million annually. These calculations are based
on the anticipated budget for the safety net program financed by the World Bank Group, which
includes a pilot for providing preventive nutrition services to beneficiaries. The cost of reaching
national coverage is based on a target population equivalent to the total number of children under
five years of age multiplied by the poverty headcount ratio found in the MICS/ELIM 2010
survey. However, it may be possible to reduce costs by targeting the nutrition package
geographically so that it is included in cash transfers only to those households living in the
country’s most vulnerable regions. One weakness in the methodology is that it was not possible
to calculate the incremental (or separate) cost of delivering the nutrition interventions within the
bundle of services.


      NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR

Several pre- and post-harvest options exist for controlling aflatoxins in groundnuts in Mali, each
with varying degrees of cost-effectiveness. Based on the limited data available, the use of
improved granaries offers the most cost-effective approach—this approach has an estimated
annual cost of $1.3 million, the potential to reduce aflatoxin concentrations in groundnuts by an
average of 55 percent, and a cost per DALY averted of $272. According to Liu and Wu (2010),
aflatoxin consumption in Africa leads to an average of 3 to 56 cases of liver cancer per 100,000
people each year, which in the Malian context could equate to an annual loss of nearly 10,000
DALYs.21 Table 16 provides an overview of four approaches to control aflatoxins in groundnuts,
as well as the cost-effectiveness of scaling up to national coverage.

Extending nutrition education nationally to all persons working in agriculture would cost an
estimated $19 million annually. This is based on the unit cost of $4.17 per producer from
program budgets from the FAO Niger Nutrition Education Program (FAO 2014).22 These costs
would probably decrease over time because they include the cost of training extension workers to
deliver nutrition messages. We can assume that the impact of this nutrition education would be
similar to that of community-based behavior change communication programming, which is
estimated in previous sections.


        NUTRITION-SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED THROUGH THE EDUCATION SECTOR

The cost of scaling up school-based deworming is estimated to be $300,000 annually. The target
population is school-aged children (6–19 years old) enrolled in primary and secondary schools;
current coverage is assumed to be negligible.



22
     In order to calculate the cost of scaling up nutrition education programming in the agriculture sector, we derive our
        target population of producers by multiplying the total population by the proportion of working age adults (age
        15+) found in the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Next we multiply this number by the labor
        force participation rate and by the percent of the workforce employed in agriculture for 2006 from the World
        Development Indicators (World Bank 2014a).

                                                            52
The cost of scaling up school-based promotion of handwashing and good hygiene behavior is
estimated to be $6.2 million. Although the promotion of WASH in schools normally includes
sustainable, safe water-supply points, handwashing stands, and sanitation facilities, this costing
includes only the component for hygiene education. The target population is school-aged
children; current coverage is assumed to be negligible.


       IMPROVING NUTRITION THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN THE WASH INFRASTRUCTURE

An ex-ante assessment completed by the WHO found that reaching the MDG targets for access
to improved water and sanitation in Mali would cost a total of $331 million (Hutton 2012).
Although this cost estimate does not include the recurring costs maintaining existing
infrastructure, it finds that the economic benefits of improved infrastructure could be twice as
high as the costs.

                  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

Systematic costing of highly effective nutrition interventions is important for setting priorities,
mobilizing resources, and advocating. Combining costing with estimates of impact (in terms of
lives saved, DALYs saved, and cases of stunting averted) and cost-effectiveness analysis will
make the case for investment in nutrition stronger and will aid in priority-setting by identifying
the most cost-effective packages of interventions in situations where financing is constrained.
This will potentially be a powerful evidence-based advocacy tool for policy makers—for
example, to assist the Ministry of Finance to make efficient budget allocations—because it
provides useful evidence of what the government can “buy” (in terms of lives saved, DALYs
saved, or cases of stunting averted) given available resources.

Reaching full national coverage of the 10 nutrition-specific interventions will be expensive and
will require a significant increase in the amount of public resources devoted to nutrition in Mali.
Because it is unlikely that the government or its partners will find the $64 million annually
necessary to reach full national coverage for all nutrition-sensitive interventions, it is important
to consider strategies that make the most of the resources available. Thus the findings and
recommendations presented here are based on cost-benefit analyses that can help policy makers
prioritize the allocation of resources more effectively so as to achieve maximum impact.

The scenarios recommended in this report represent a compromise between the need to increase
coverage and the constraints imposed by limited resources and capacities, while taking into
account Mali’s most pressing needs. Two scenarios (Scenarios 2 and 3) stand out as especially
attractive. Scenario 2 would require an annual public investment of $24 million and would save
more than 468,000 DALYs and over 11,000 lives. Scenario 3 would require an annual public
investment of $18 million and would save about 319,000 DALYs and over 10,000 lives.

Recognizing the challenges of scaling to full coverage in one year, we estimate the investment
required to scale up over five years to be $67 million for Scenario 2 and $50 million for Scenario
3. These total costs for five years are significantly less than the $174 million needed for full
coverage (of 100 percent of the target population), but still represent a significant increase over
current spending on nutrition in Mali.

Every attempt has been made to use real programming costs for these estimates, but the costs
estimated here are likely to be slight overestimates while the benefits are likely to be
underestimated. In effect, not all of the expected economies of scale are accounted for. With
respect to the benefits, these estimates are likely to be underestimates of the true benefits because
of the limitations of the LiST tool used, which make it possible to estimate the benefits of only
some of the interventions that are proposed to be scaled up. In many cases, actual program costs
will be lower than estimated because they can be added to existing programs. The incremental
costs of adding to an existing program are lower because existing implementation arrangements
can be used, thereby minimizing costs for staffing, operations, and training. For example,



                                                 54
behavior change communication programs, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming are all
delivered in Mali as part of the SIAN activities. Similarly, deworming and behavior change for
improved hygiene can and often are delivered together in school settings.

Our analysis partially considers this overlap: the analysis of outcomes using the LiST software
allows us to estimate the effects of several interventions implemented simultaneously to take
account of the synergies among the interventions. On the other hand, the scope of the analysis in
this paper did not include a rigorous comparison of the cost and cost-effectiveness of different
delivery platforms for specific interventions. Such a comparison would be able to determine, for
example, whether behavior change communication in the community setting is more effective
than it is in schools.

Based on the analyses, we cannot suggest specific methods to integrate the delivery of the
interventions to capitalize on and coordinate the overlap across the intervention, but it is clear
that policy makers in Mali could and should consider how the interventions overlap and identify
how to implement overlapping interventions in a coordinated fashion in different settings or
sectors. This process of coordination is already partially underway in the Multisectoral Strategic
Action Plan for Nutrition: strategic axis 13 of the Plan focuses on coordinating and integrating
nutrition into existing and new policies. Some of the actions incorporated under that strategic
axis call for joint advocacy across different sectors (health, education, nutrition, and food
security) to emphasize the need to link and coordinate across the sectors. Those actions can result
in joint policy actions (e.g., a common national behavior change communication policy for
nutrition) that would help capitalize on the overlap between the interventions.

Even though this report focuses extensively on nutrition-specific interventions, the causes of
malnutrition are multisectoral so any longer-term approach to improving nutrition outcomes must
include nutrition-sensitive interventions. This report therefore also explores costs and benefits for
six highly relevant nutrition-sensitive interventions implemented outside the health sector. These
include a nutritional package delivered as part of a conditional cash transfer program, aflatoxin
reduction in groundnuts, nutrition education via agricultural extension workers, school-based
deworming, school-based promotion of good hygiene, and the program to reach MDGs for
improved access to water and sanitation. However, the analysis presented here is only a starting
point meant to spur more analytical work to identify interventions that substantially improve
nutritional status. As the government refines its multisectoral nutrition policy, it will be useful to
consult across sectors and ministries in order to identify other possible nutrition-sensitive
interventions that are cost-effective. More robust data on nutrition-sensitive interventions are
needed to do this.

Overall, the findings presented in this report point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific
interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-sensitive interventions that represent a cost-
effective approach to reducing the high levels of child malnutrition in Mali. An important next
step will be to leverage the additional financing needed to implement the scale-up. Resources
will need to be mobilized from national budgets and from international donors and ODA. Within

the national budgets, it will be important to prioritize health sector funds for the nutrition-specific
interventions. It will also be important for other sectors—such as water and sanitation and social
protection—to engage in the cost-effective nutrition-sensitive interventions the report has
identified.

                APPENDIX 5: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING COSTS FOR MALI

The following steps lay out the methodology used to estimate costs for each intervention:

1. Describe each intervention
2. Define target populations for each intervention
3. Estimate the size of the target populations for each intervention in each state/region using the
   most current demographic data
4. Specify the delivery platform or channel(s) for each intervention, based on the country
   context and the accepted delivery modes
5. Identify data on the current coverage levels for each intervention in each state/region
6. Estimate the unit cost per beneficiary for each intervention from program experience in Mali,
   whenever possible, and/or Africa region
7. Calculate additional costs of scaling up to full coverage by multiplying the unit cost for each
   intervention with the size of the “uncovered” target population for each intervention by
   state/region. The formula for calculation is:



   where:

          = additional costs of scaling up to full coverage
          = unit cost per beneficiary
          = current coverage level (percentage)

8. Estimate additional resources for (1) capacity development for program delivery and (2)
    M&E and technical support, estimated at 9 percent and 2 percent of total cost of
    interventions, respectively
9. Estimate a portion of the total cost that can be covered by private household resources. It is
    assumed that households above the poverty line could cover their own cost of iron
    fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, salt iodization, and complementary foods from
    private resources
10. Calculate the annual public investment required to scale up these interventions to full
    coverage using the following formula:



   where:

       Y = annual public investment required to scale up to full coverage
         = additional total cost to scale up to full coverage
         = additional cost for capacity development, M&E, and technical assistance
         = cost covered by households living above the poverty line for selected interventions



                                                65
Full coverage is defined as 100 percent of the target population for all interventions except the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which is set to 80 percent. This is consistent with World
Bank (2010) methods and is based on the reality that few community-based treatment programs
have successfully achieved more than 80 percent coverage at scale.

                APPENDIX 6: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING DALYS FOR MALI

The following steps were undertaken to estimate the impact in DALYs averted of implementing
the various nutrition interventions:

   1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
      targeted cause
   2. Calculate the rate of years of life lost (YLL) and years of life spent with a disability
      (YLD) that result from each cause-risk factor combination for the target population
   3. Calculate the DALYs averted under current or counterfactual coverage scenario
   4. Calculate the DALYs averted under the proposed intervention coverage scenario
   5. Calculate the net DALYs averted by the proposed intervention


1. Estimate the effectiveness of each intervention on mortality and morbidity for each
targeted cause
To estimate the effectiveness of the interventions, key articles by Black et al. (2013) and Bhutta
et al. (2013) in the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition were first consulted.
Additional literature searches for the latest evidence were conducted in the Pubmed online
database and the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Effectiveness
figures that were reported as statistically significant were extracted and used for the calculations.

2. Calculate the rate of YLL and YLD
The WHO’s 2012 Global Health Estimates (GHE 2012) data tables provide country-specific
YLL and YLD rates for each cause of death or disease. GHE 2012 morbidity and mortality
estimates were used in combination with country-specific population attributable fractions (PAF)
from the 2010 global burden of disease (GBD). This assumes that the risk factor impacts on
morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between the two estimates.

To calculate the rate of morbidity and mortality from a cause due to a specific risk factor, the first
step is to calculate the PAF for the cause–risk factor combination. The PAF was extracted from
the country-specific risk factor attribution table from the 2010 GBD data. This was done
separately for YLL and YLD. In the second step, the country-specific YLLs and YLDs for the
target population—in most cases children under five years old—were extracted from the GHE
2012 estimates. To calculate the YLL rate, the country-specific YLL is multiplied by the YLL
PAF and then by 100,000. The final figure is divided by country-specific population of interest
(usually children under five) to get the rate. The same final steps are followed to calculate the
YLD, although instead multiplying country-specific YLDs by the YLD PAF. The population
estimate for the rate calculation was extracted from GHE 2012.

         YLL per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLL * YLL_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_ population
         YLD per 100,000 = (U-5_cause_total_YLD * YLD_PAF * 100,000)/U-5_population

where:

                                                 67
       U-5_population = the population of children under five


3. Calculate counterfactual DALYs averted
To calculate the DALYs averted if current intervention coverage were maintained, the following
formula was used:


       YLL = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
             * intervention_mortality_reduction * YLL_rate

       YLD = U-5_population_intervention_year * current_coverage
             * intervention_morbidity_reduction * YLL_rate

       DALY_current = YLL + YLD

4. Calculate total DALYs averted under intervention coverage
To calculate the potential DALYs averted under the intervention coverage, a similar formula as

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is a part of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spectrum
policy modeling system. These tools include DemProj for creating demographic projections;
AIM to model and incorporate the impact of HIV/AIDS on demographic projections and child
survival interventions; and FamPlan for incorporating changing fertility into the demographic
projection. LiST is used to project how increasing intervention coverage would impact child and
maternal survival. The table below summarizes data sources used for the Mali LiST estimates.

Once the demographic and health data have been updated, the coverage and scale-up plan for
each intervention is introduced into LiST. With the exception of community nutrition programs
(CNPs), lives saved and reduced stunting prevalence were estimated separately for each
intervention. This assumed that each intervention is implemented independently, and therefore
may slightly inflate the estimates for interventions with overlapping impacts on the target
population. CNPs are considered to be a package of three interventions: breastfeeding promotion,
complementary feeding education, and handwashing promotion.

Note on Estimates of Cases of Stunting Averted
In order to estimate the number of cases of under-five stunting averted attributable to the annual
investment in the scaling up of nutrition interventions, we use LiST to model changes in the
prevalence of stunting over five years, during which the interventions are projected to have
reached 100 percent of the target population. Next, we model changes in the prevalence of
stunting over five years with no scale-up of the interventions. We then take the difference
between the estimated stunting prevalence in year 5 with the scale-up and the prevalence in year
5 absent the scale-up, and multiply this percentage point difference by the total population of
children under five years.

Our reason for using stunting prevalence in year 5 concerns the assumptions built into the LiST
model. The model assumes that stunting is itself a risk factor for becoming stunted in the next
time period. As a result, stunting prevalence remains flat during the first two years of the scale-
up, before dropping precipitously until year 5, after which the prevalence begins to level out. We
assume that continuing investments in maintaining the level of intervention after year 5 will
serve to maintain the gains in stunting prevalence reduction, and therefore we present this
reduction as a benefit attributable to a one-year investment in scaling up nutrition.

On the other hand, when estimating stunting reduction (and lives saved) attributable to a five-
year scale-up plan, we model this scale up directly in LiST and use the annual results over five
years in our cost-benefit analysis. Using annual results over five years provides a more accurate
                                               70
portrayal of the direct benefits attributable to a five-year scale up plan, and it does not assume
that the scale will necessarily be maintained following the end of the period covered in the plan.




                                               71
                   APPENDIX 8: METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING ECONOMIC BENEFITS

There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the best methodology for monetizing the
value of a life saved. In this analysis, we focus solely on the economic value of a life year, which
we measure as equal to GNI per capita. Other studies attempt to estimate the social value of a life
year as well as its economic value; because we do not, we acknowledge that our results are an
underestimate of the true value of a life year saved.

Still, valuing years of life saved alone does not account for the economic benefits of reduced
morbidity, which includes the long-term, nonlethal impacts of malnutrition on individuals.
Although there are a number of long-term impacts of nutritional deficiencies, we choose to focus
on stunting because of the availability of country-specific impact estimates produced by the LiST
tool.23

In order to estimate the economic value of a case of childhood stunting averted, we follow the
methodology used in Hoddinott et al. (2013), who begin by assuming that stunted individuals
lose an average of 66 percent of lifetime earnings, based on direct estimates of the impact of
stunting in early life on later life outcomes found in Hoddinott et al. (2011).24 This estimate for
the effects of stunting on future consumption is used as a proxy for the effect of stunting on
lifetime earnings. Additionally, Hoddinott et al. (2013) account for uncertainty by assuming that
only 90 percent of the total gains will be realized, which we also include in our calculations.
However, unlike those authors, we adjust our calculations to reflect the country’s labor force
participation rate.

For both lives saved and cases of stunting averted, the benefits of a five-year scale-up plan are
attributed to a group of children that is assumed to enter the labor force at age 15 and exit the
labor force at age 55, which is equivalent to life expectancy at birth in Mali. Benefits from both
stunting and lives saved are then multiplied by a lifetime discount factor (LDF) in order to obtain
the present value of benefits incurred during the expected years of productivity (years between
the age of entry into and exit from the workforce). The LDF is derived from three potential
discount rates (3 percent, 5 percent, and 7 percent), an adjustment for age at the time of
investment (for simplicity, we assume an average age of two years for all children), and the years
of lifetime productivity expected. The LDF represents the years of productivity that are
“counted” in the calculation, discounted back to their present value in the year in which the
investment in nutrition is made. Because we assume an average age of two years for all
beneficiaries, we use an LDF that assumes that these children will enter the labor force 13 years
from the time of investment. Importantly, given the time frame considered under this analysis, we


23
     It should be noted that because stunting is just one of many long-term consequences of poor nutrition, actual
         economic benefits of improving nutrition may be much higher than estimated here.
24
     Hoddinott et al. (2011) provided direct estimates of the impact of stunting in early life on later life outcomes,
       which found that an individual stunted at age 36 months had, on average, 66 percent lower per capita
       consumption over his or her productive life.
                                                             72
do not attempt to account for projected growth in the country’s GDP and per capita incomes.
This downward bias contributes to the conservative nature of our estimates.

The following equations are used to estimate (1) the economic value of lives saved (reduced
mortality) and (2) increased future productivity (reduced morbidity):



   1. Present value of reduced mortality = (lives saved attributable to intervention scale-up)
          *(GNI per capita) * LDF

   2. Present value of reduced morbidity = (cases of child stunting averted)
          * (coefficient of a deficit) * (percent of income actually realized) * (GNI per capita)
          * (LDF)

where:

        Lives saved attributable to the intervention scale-up are estimated using the LiST tool.
        Cases of child stunting averted are calculated by subtracting the projected under-five
         stunting prevalence (%) after the interventions are scaled up calculated by LiST from the
         projected stunting prevalence under a scenario with no scale up and multiplying it by the
         total under-five population.
        The coefficient of deficit is equal to the reduction in lifetime earnings attributable to
         stunting.
        The lifetime discount factor (LDF) is used to discount future benefits to their value at the
         time of investment. It is derived from a discount rate, age at the time of investment and
         the estimated age of entry and exit into the workforce. The equation used to calculate the
         LDF is:




         where:

         LDF = the lifetime discount factor
           r = is the discount rate
           t = the time period since the initial investment in scaling up the interventions (we
           assume that children are 2 years old at the time of investment and enter the labor force
           at 15 years old, which is reflected in the starting value for t)

                                                  73
            T = the last time period before individuals exit the labor force (we assume individuals
            are out of the workforce at life expectancy at birth)


Note, the beginning time period t and ending period T is adjusted for each cohort based on the
year of investment. For example, the first cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time
period t=13 and exit at time T, the second cohort is assumed to enter the labor force at time
period t=14 and exit at time T+1, and so forth.

The following values and sources are used in our calculations:

To arrive at a net present value (NPV), we use the following equation:




where c is the cohort group and t is the time period.


Finally, the annual addition to economic productivity is measured by taking the total economic
benefits for the year in which all beneficiaries of the initial one-year investment have reached
productive age. These benefits are not discounted back to their present value, as they are
considered the annual opportunity cost of not investing in scaling up nutrition interventions. It
should be noted that these benefits are derived from a progressive, five-year scale-up plan, and
therefore subsequent investments that maintain the target scale will increase the total annual
benefits as new beneficiaries are reached.

This paper builds on the global experience and Mali’s context to identify an effective nutrition approach as
well as costs and benefits of key nutrition programs, as part of a resilience agenda after the crisis. It is
intended to help guide the selection of the most cost-effective interventions as well as strategies for
scaling these up. The paper looks at both relevant “nutrition-specific” interventions, largely delivered
through the health sector, and at multisectoral “nutrition-sensitive” interventions delivered through other
sectors such as agriculture, social protection, and water and sanitation that have the potential to
strengthen nutritional outcomes in Mali. We first estimate that the costs and benefits of implementing 10
nutrition-specific interventions in all regions of Mali would require a yearly public investment of $64
million. The expected benefits are large: annually about 480,000 DALYs and more than 14,000 lives
would be saved and over 260,000 cases of stunting among children under five would be averted.
However, because it is unlikely that the Government of Mali or its partners will find the $64 million
necessary to reach full national coverage, we also consider three potential scale-up scenarios based on
considerations of their potential for impact, the burden of stunting, resource requirements, and
implementation capacity. Using cost-benefit analyses, we propose scale-up scenarios that represent a
compromise between the need to move to full coverage and the constraints imposed by limited
resources. We identify and cost six nutrition-sensitive interventions that are relevant to Mali’s context and
for which there are both evidence of positive impact on nutrition outcomes and some cost information.
These findings point to a powerful set of nutrition-specific interventions and a candidate list of nutrition-
sensitive approaches that represent a highly cost-effective approach to reducing child malnutrition in Mali.
