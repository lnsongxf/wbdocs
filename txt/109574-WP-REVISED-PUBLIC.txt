Year Review discussed with Executive Directors on April 9, 2015 (World Bank 2015e).
Management agrees with the majority of the review’s recommendations, and concurs
with most of its observations.

Context. PforR is the first new World Bank instrument in 30 years. It was carefully
crafted to enable the World Bank to better respond to changing development needs,
meet demand from client countries, and enhance development effectiveness by
supporting a government program of expenditures, building institutional capacity, and
tying financing to achievement of results. Client countries are increasingly
implementing their own programs for development and poverty reduction that are
rooted in their own legal, policy, regulatory, and institutional environments, and they
are asking development partners for financing and expertise to improve the programs’
effectiveness and efficiency in achieving results. There is a consensus, including in the
IEG review, that PforR covers an important need in meeting this client demand. The
design, key features, and initial implementation were based on intensive consultations
with clients, staff, and development partners. The uptake of the instrument and its
positive reception by clients has also led other donors to adopt it as a model. As the
instrument matures, Management remains committed to taking a learning approach,
including making policy and process adjustments, if needed. The IEG report is a
valuable input into the learning process.

PforR Portfolio Growth. IEG’s work was based on a review of a relatively young PforR
portfolio—the 27 operations approved by end-FY15. At that point, the average age of an
operation was 1.3 years; of the 27 operations, 23 were effective and 18 had started to
disburse. The portfolio continues to grow. By the end of September 2016, the number of
approved operations has increased to 52, Bank financing has increased from $4.9 billion
to $12.9 billion, and government programs leveraged have grown from $14.7 billion to
$60 billion. The number of countries has also increased: 15 new countries have
approved or pipeline PforR operations. As the portfolio evolves, Management expects

to learn more about the effectiveness of the instrument and to use this evaluation and
continued feedback from clients to help improve it.


World Bank Management Comments
Although Management welcomes and is in general agreement with the analysis and
findings of the review, we have some comments on specific aspects.


Results Framework and Nature of Results. The report discusses PforR results
frameworks and suggests reflecting the “theory of change” in those frameworks.
Management partially concurs with this view. While Management will provide
guidance on improving clarity regarding the drivers for change and the results chain,
the World Bank’s role is to assist governments in improving, and financing a slice of,
their own programs. Such results frameworks are part of the government overall
program and the ownership of that is critical for the instrument. Moreover, when
financing a slice of a program, part of the challenge is for the clients and World Bank
team to work together to develop an operation that is of manageable size and within the
implementation capacity of the government, and that can lay the groundwork for
sustainable and substantial change. A single operation may not be able to include the
complete set of the changes envisioned by the theory of change; moreover, the changes
might be a set of institutional actions that do not easily map into a theory-of-change
results framework.

Disbursement-Linked Indicators. The report comments that in the first set of
operations, “in some cases the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) are not well
integrated with the results frameworks.” Management notes that the PforR instrument
has two key features: helping build institutions and focusing on results. DLIs, by design
of the instrument, can be derived from the results framework or the Program Action
Plan (PAP). Moreover, DLIs related to institutional strengthening are important in
many cases to improve the systems that support results—for example, DLIs for
strengthening the program’s environmental and social systems, monitoring and
evaluation systems, or grievance redress systems. The use of such DLIs has been seen to
be critical and effective in many sectors, including health, education, water and
sanitation, and public sector reform. These “institutional strengthening” DLIs are
therefore key to achieving the outcomes of the program.

Partnership. The report notes “there is no evidence that the instrument has encouraged
much additional financing by other donors.” Management would like to note that, as
the PforR policy paper emphasized, partnership goes beyond financing. It is about
enhancing the World Bank’s ability to partner with the government as well as other


                                                                                         xix
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


development partners. The partnership could be in the form of joint preparation or
implementation support through parallel financing. The evaluation notes that virtually
all PforRs rely on the availability of technical assistance for capacity building—
assistance that is mainly provided through other development partner funds.

Sustainability. The report raises concerns about the sustainability of operations,
indicating “there is relatively little attention to the sustainability of the targeted
improvements.” Management would like to note that despite PforR’s broader program
orientation, the World Bank’s financing remains time-bound and discrete (just as it does
for development policy and investment project operations). There is no assumption on
the part of teams and the government that World Bank financing or support will
continue indefinitely, and, while factors contributing to sustainability are built into
programs, there can be no guarantee. The expectation is that World Bank financing will
help the government program consolidate and accelerate progress that can then be
sustained independently.

Costing Methodology. The report assumes that the theory of change rests on the
assumption that the “costs of achieving the intended results have been accurately
estimated and presented by the borrower and can be tracked.” It also says “unclear
costing methodology [was] used to prepare expenditure frameworks that support
programs.” Management notes that PforR policy requires the World Bank to assess the
expenditure framework supporting the program and to look at efficiency and
effectiveness issues. It is through this analysis that PforR can help focus on the totality
of the expenditures of the program and identify measures to enhance efficiency and
effectiveness.


Recommendations
Management welcomes the report’s approach in formulating a limited number of
focused recommendations, with some specific actions listed as possible options or
suggestions for Management’s consideration. In principle, Management welcomes the
recommendations and is planning to incorporate the majority of the proposed actions
through Operations Policy and Country Services advisory support for PforR operations
and in updated guidance notes and outreach, including e-learning modules, Global
Practice thematic workshops, and client events.

Recommendation 1: Strengthen the design of the results framework and DLIs to
ensure that the PAD presents a clear line of sight to development results.
Management is generally in agreement with this recommendation. Specifically,
Management agrees on the principles that there should be a clear explanation of why
the DLIs were selected and how they will help achieve the desired outcomes of the

program and project development objectives (PDOs); that the financing associated with
each DLI should reflect, among other things, the possible incentive effect of the size of
such financing; and that individual DLI targets need to have the right balance between
predictability of disbursement and achievement of results. Management will update
PforR guidance and training content to strengthen these messages. Management cannot,
however, commit to reflecting the “theory of change” in all operations, and linking each
DLI to PDOs. As noted above, clients and the World Bank team work together to
develop an operation that is of manageable size and within the implementation capacity
of the government, and that can lay the groundwork for sustainable and substantial
change. A single operation may not be able to include the complete set of changes and
outcomes envisioned by a results framework based on a theory of change. As for
linking each DLI to the PDO of an operation, some DLIs may be used for strengthening
the program’s systems, and as such, may not necessarily be included in the results
framework of the operation.

Recommendation 2: Strengthen the design and monitoring of the PAPs. Management
welcomes this recommendation. It is fully consistent with current guidance and training
material that clearly point out that the PAP should focus on being strategic in selecting
actions, and should be a main element of implementation support. Most PforR
operations are already aligned with the guidance. The Implementation Status and
Results Report (ISR) for PforRs is being revised, partly to address such improvements
as better monitoring of PAPs. Management will work on reflecting lessons learned and
best practices to improve the implementation of PforR—both in the context of the
revised guidance notes that are being prepared as part of the follow-up to
Management’s Two-Year Review, and in the PforR Academy for task team leads that will
be delivered this year.

Recommendation 3: Minimize the overly cautious interpretation of the “high”
environmental and social risks exclusion. Management agrees that some of the earlier
operations may have taken an overly cautious approach. Management will continue to
raise awareness among task team leads and environmental and social staff and
consultants on how to consistently address environmental and social risks under PforR
operations.

Recommendation 4: Strengthen the monitoring and reporting of results to cover
systematically the entire results framework as well as the environmental and social
effects of the projects. Management agrees with this recommendation to ensure that
the reporting of results covers the entire results framework. The ISR already includes
the results framework, and Management has recently revised the framework following
the Two-Year Review. The ISR also includes the risk framework (now revised to use the

the PAP. Hence, all recommended requirements are in place.


Conclusions
Management sees this review as an important resource that adds to its own Two-Year
Review and will be a good input to future assessments. Management is committed to a
learning-by-doing process and will use the lessons of experience to refine the PforR
instrument. This review and its analysis and recommendations are already contributing
to ongoing and planned PforR learning and outreach, including improved e-learning
modules, other training activities in Washington, D.C., and in field offices, and events in
which PforR clients can share their experiences. Detailed responses to the
recommendations are set out in the Management Action Record.

Chairperson’s Summary: Committee on
Development Effectiveness
The Committee on Development Effectiveness discussed the report of the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) entitled Program-for-Results: An Early-Stage
Assessment of the Process and Effects of a New Lending Instrument and the draft
response of Management of the World Bank Group institutions.


Summary
The committee welcomed the early-stage assessment of the Program-for-Results
(PforR) instrument, which was approved in January 2012, and endorsed the findings
and recommendations. Members expressed robust support for PforR, and were
pleased that IEG found that the instrument is performing well to date. They agreed
the assessment will strengthen and contribute to PforR’s further development.
Members saw PforR as an important addition to the World Bank’s menu of
instruments, and valued the main objectives of PforR, including responding to client
demand for financing.

Members underscored the importance of focusing on fine-tuning implementation to
lead to even better results, emphasizing quality assurance and risk management;
they appreciated the report’s focus on these aspects. In this context, members
acknowledged the complexity of linking results frameworks, Disbursement-linked
indicators (DLIs), the Program Action Plans (PAPs), and considerations when using
the program environmental and social systems. They welcomed the findings that
there is a considerable degree of government ownership and commitment to work
towards results, and underscored that part of the challenge is developing PforR
operations that are of manageable size, are within the implementation capacity of
the government, and contribute to the long-term sustainability of results. Members
noted that while there are donor partnerships in conjunction with PforR operations,
this support has not been reflected in official project cofinancing. Donors’
enthusiasm for the instrument could be improved if the World Bank were to share
the success of its initial experience using PforR.

Members urged the World Bank to consider the complementarity of PforR to the
other World Bank lending instruments, namely investment policy financing (IPF)
and development policy financing (DPF). Some members commented that a review
may be warranted of the consistency of application of environmental and social

safeguards/considerations across all instruments. Members underscored that
capacity building measures have been satisfactorily identified but there was a need
to strengthen capacity and performance of programs and the implementation of
capacity building programs.

Members agreed with the need to strengthen the monitoring and reporting of results
to cover the entire results framework systematically. They also highlighted the
importance of aligning the expected results of PforR operations with the respective
country’s development agenda and with the World Bank’s overall objectives, e.g.,
through Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs).


Recommendation and Next Steps
Members generally agreed with the report’s findings and recommendations. They
encouraged Management to continue with PforR reviews and impact evaluations
once operations are completed and looked forward to future reporting through the
quarterly Operations Update.


Issues Discussed
Recommendation 1. Management noted its general agreement with
recommendation 1 and the need to strengthen the design of the results framework
and DLIs. Management however disagreed with the recommendation that the
Results Framework reflect PforR’s “line of sight” or “theory of change” and that the
DLIs should clearly link to this “line of sight.” Management noted that a single
operation may not be able to include the complete set of changes and outcomes
envisaged by a “line of sight”–based Results Framework and, with respect to linking
each DLI to the project development objectives (PDOs) of an operation, added that
some DLIs cannot be directly mapped into a Results Framework that relates directly
to the “line of sight.”

Some members agreed with Management that it is unrealistic to expect that a perfect
link can/will be made between output and development outcomes; but at the same
time, indicators should not be solely focused on institutional aspects. They generally
agreed with the spirit of the recommendation, that the design of the results
framework and DLIs could be strengthened to ensure that the project appraisal
document (PAD) presents a line of sight to development results. A few commented
that the weaknesses identified by IEG in establishing DLIs were not idiosyncratic to
PforR operations, and that the linkages likely depend on the type of sector and
financing of a slice of a program. While acknowledging the difficulties in designing

                                                 COMMITTEE ON DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
DLIs, they concurred that there should be a clear rationale for the selection of DLIs
and how they contribute to achieving results that support the PDOs. They
encouraged Management to explore how the Results Frameworks might reflect the
development expectations and logic of the PforR.

Implementation. Members queried how different country conditions, including
institutional frameworks, affect the implementation of PforR. Members observed
that the average implementation support costs have been significantly higher than
for IPF operations, and commented that consideration might be given to exploring
how to increase efficiency in implementation. In this regard, they suggested that one
viable approach may be to increase collaboration through harmonization of
operations and technical assistance with other donors and development partners,
including those who provide parallel financing. Management informed that the
initial costs for preparation are higher than IPF due to the newness of the
instrument, including World Bank teams conducting technical, fiduciary, and
environmental and social assessments of the program, but if there is a subsequent
PforR in the same country, the costs tend to go down. For implementation support,
the increased costs are mainly driven by the greater role the Bank is carrying in
supporting the selected program, rather than a more focused scope in a traditional
project.

Members welcomed IEG and Management’s agreement on the need to strengthen
the design and monitoring of the Program Action Plans (PAPs). They asked how
clients are incentivized to implement institutional improvements when they are not
linked to disbursements. They noted that there was a mandate to reporting the
implementation of all PAPs in the Implementation and Status Reports (ISRs), and
some emphasized the benefit of public ISRs to ensure accountability and improve
implementation. Management agreed going forward to including PAP
implementation information in the publicly available ISRs.

1. The Program-for-Results Instrument and
the Evaluation Approach
The PforR Instrument
The World Bank introduced the Program-for-Results (PforR) instrument in 2012
(World Bank 2011a). In 2015, as mandated by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors, Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) reviewed the first two
years of PforR operation (World Bank 2015e). This review assessed the early
experience with the design and implementation of operations and the challenges
faced by borrowers, development partners, and Bank staff. The Board of Executive
Directors requested an early Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation of the
instrument as well.1 This process evaluation responds to that request.

This new instrument is designed to enable the Bank to respond to changing
development needs, meet demand from country clients, and enhance development
effectiveness. By directly supporting government programs, PforR operations are
expected to help countries strengthen institutions, build capacity, and enhance
partnerships with stakeholders to achieve lasting impact. They link disbursements
to achievement of results that are tangible, transparent, and verifiable. The design of
the instrument is intended to accommodate a broad range of countries, sectors, and
programs. It is also expected to enable the Bank to leverage its own financing and to
partner with other development organizations in supporting country programs (see
World Bank 2011a, para. 88).

PforR responds to country demand for financing and expertise to support their
efforts in implementing their own programs for development and in improving
program effectiveness and efficiency in achieving results. The Bank’s ability to meet
this demand has been constrained by the limitations of its long-standing investment
policy financing (IPF) and development policy financing (DPF) instruments. As
stated in the Board paper (World Bank 2011a, para. 14), neither instrument fully
allows support to a government program of expenditure, building institutional
capacity, and tying financing to achievement of results.2 With PforR, the Bank now
has three complementary lending instruments to offer country clients: policy
support (DPF), project support (IPF), and program support (PforR).

The design of the PforR instrument benefited from the experience the Bank has
gained in designing and implementing IPF and DPF operations: specifically, with
technical and design issues, results definition, fiduciary systems, environmental and

THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
social impacts and risk management, and improving policy environments. It also
built on decade-long experience—both inside and outside the Bank—with
sectorwide, program-based, and results-focused operations (see appendix B). Some
key lessons incorporated into the design include the importance of using the
institutional setup of the government program, ownership of the results framework,
and transparency and accountability, such as having credible verification processes.

PforR operations, as described in the original Board paper (World Bank 2011a), are
expected to do the following (these points are discussed as relevant later in this
report and are summarized in chapter 6):

       Finance and support borrowers’ programs, which can be ongoing or new,
        sectoral or subsectoral, national or subnational, as well as community
        development programs.
       Disburse upon achievement of program results, as determined by the
        achievement of indicators that can be monitored and verified rather than
        disbursing for inputs. Advances of up to 25 percent of outstanding
        commitments are allowed. Together with funds from other sources, Bank
        disbursements will finance a borrower’s expenditure program rather than
        being linked to individual transactions.
       Provide support for the use of a government’s own systems to implement
        the program, including for financing planning, procurement, anti-corruption,
        and environmental and social standards.
       Provide assurance that Bank financing is used appropriately and that the
        environmental and social impacts of the programs are adequately
        addressed. To this end, the Bank will assess a program’s fiduciary and
        environmental and social management systems, and agree as necessary with
        a borrower on any additional measures to provide assurance that potential
        impacts to the environment and affected people are adequately addressed.
       Focus on strengthening the institutional capacity needed for programs to
        achieve their desired results, thereby enhancing development impact and
        sustainability. The strengthening of capacity to implement a program will be
        a priority area for both preparation and implementation support.
       Support improvements in governance and transparency by making program
        information publicly available and monitoring the achievement of results,
        including through enhancing the role of beneficiaries and civil society
        organizations.
       Help strengthen partnerships with governments and development partners,
        and increase efficiency by reducing transaction costs for the government
        and development partners. While the Board paper (World Bank 2011a) found
        it difficult to predict the budget implications for the Bank, experience with

                          THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
       IPF projects with PforR features suggested that costs might be within the
       norm for IPF projects.

THE THEORY OF CHANGE
The theory of change of the PforR instrument is that PforR operations, working
alongside the other two instruments, will enable the Bank to assist country clients in
delivering priority results more efficiently by working through their own country
systems, leveraging Bank financing with that of partners and other development
organizations, and strengthening their own systems. The theory of change rests on
three assumptions. The first is that working with country program systems will help
strengthen them. This is a reasonable assumption for three reasons. First, sector
ministries engage directly in the budget process and are less likely to work off-
budget because of their close relationships with donors. Second, donors have
developed heightened concern about public financial management (PFM) and
combating corruption, because of fiduciary concerns about their resources passing
through national PFM systems, and because of the key role of these systems in
linking policy and implementation. Third, it reduces transaction costs by avoiding
multiple donor procedures and adopting the government standard.

A second assumption is that the costs of achieving the intended results have been
accurately estimated and presented by the borrower and that the borrower can track
these costs. This is important to provide reasonable assurance that program
expenditures are used with due attention to the efficient use of resources. A third
assumption is that it is possible to carry out technical, fiduciary, and environmental
and social assessments, and in each case come to a clearly formulated, reliable
conclusion. When systems are not adequate, they can be made so through targeted
strengthening.3

PforR operations focus on the behavioral and institutional changes that are required
to realize this targeted strengthening, and in turn achieve results and manage
associated risks. Hence it is expected that many will require some level of capacity-
building activities, which will be informed by the technical, fiduciary, and
environmental and social systems assessments. Capacity-building support, where
needed, can be provided through different modalities, from direct technical
assistance and training to specific actions or indicators that will strengthen
performance.

The PforR instrument is intended to complement, not replace, the Bank’s two
existing lending instruments. While all Bank instruments focus on development
results, borrowers are now able to choose from a wider range of instruments to suit
their objectives, desired results, and risks. The description below, largely taken from

CHAPTER 1
THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
the Board paper (World Bank 2011a), summarizes the differences and
complementarities among the instruments (see also table 1.1).

       Development policy financing. DPFs remain the primary Bank instrument to
        support policy and institutional actions. They focus on discrete policy actions
        that are under the direct control of governments, and they link disbursements
        to evidence that such actions have been adopted. As stated in the Board paper
        (World Bank 2011a), Bank management sees the DPFs as a practical and
        effective way of supporting policy actions that help create the enabling
        conditions for improving results—for example, when new regulations are
        required for the better functioning of markets or new policy frameworks are
        necessary to improve government efficiency. DPFs provide general budget
        support and do not earmark loan proceeds for specific programs. Moreover,
        DPFs disburse against specific policy and institutional actions and not against
        the results or outputs and outcomes associated with sector and program
        expenditures.
       Investment project financing. IPFs support a heterogeneous range of
        operations, but their common characteristic is typically the financing of
        specific investment activities that involve a set of expenditure transactions,
        most of which are used for the purchase of works, goods, and services. As
        stated in the Board paper (World Bank 2011a), Bank management sees the
        IPFs as a practical and effective way of supporting the achievement of results
        when risk management and controls are needed on the inputs side (such as
        construction or technology) and when technical design and implementation
        challenges are critical bottlenecks to achieving results. Often such situations
        involve discrete, one-off activities (for example, the construction of a large
        infrastructure project or the purchase of expensive and technically complex
        equipment). By focusing on the proper implementation and risk management
        of individual transactions, IPF operations put the emphasis of Bank-client
        relations on making sure that the right inputs and technology are in place and
        the operation is implemented as planned.
       Program-for-Results. Many of the development challenges countries face
        cannot be addressed solely through discrete policy actions or the proper
        technical implementation of a program. For example, improving service
        delivery (such as better-maintained roads, functioning schools and health
        clinics, effective agricultural extension services) may require both policy
        actions (such as a decentralization law) and some discrete investment activity
        (such as constructing new schools or contracting works for road
        maintenance). But in many cases, these are not sufficient for the achievement
        of results. Schools can be built, but teachers may remain absent; health clinics

        may have new equipment, but essential drugs may not be available at the
        point of service; and rural roads may remain unmaintained, despite the
        existence of contracts. Addressing such bottlenecks involves improvements in
        the governance of institutions and systems, including capacity building and
        changes in management practices and behaviors by service providers and
        users alike. PforR can be the instrument of choice when the objective is to
        support the performance of a government program using the government’s
        own systems, when the results require expenditures, and when the risks to
        achieving the program’s objectives relate to the capacity of the systems—for
        example, the monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary, and environmental
        and social systems—to achieve better results.

SELECTION, APPRAISAL, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES
The Bank will determine the choice of lending instrument for specific countries,
sectors, and programs in the context of its Country Partnership Framework and its
assessment of the country’s policies, programs, and institutional capacity. PforR has
the potential for significant development impacts, though it also has risks. For that
reason, certain high-risk activities have been excluded from PforR operations:
activities that pose a risk of potentially significant and irreversible adverse impacts
on the environment or affected people (activities classified as Category A under IPF)
and activities that involve procurement of works, goods, and services under
contracts whose estimated value exceeds specified monetary amounts.

CHAPTER 1
THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
For each PforR operation, the Bank carries out a process of identification,
preparation and assessment, appraisal, and implementation support. Appraisal of
each operation is informed by assessments in three areas that are then applied to the
overall program and its expenditures. The technical assessment focuses on the
strategic relevance and technical soundness of the program and its expenditure
framework, the results framework, and the M&E arrangements. The fiduciary
assessment, covering the procurement and financial management arrangements,
seeks to make sure that program funds are used appropriately. Both national and
international competitive bidding systems are assessed. The environmental and social
systems assessment seeks to make sure that the potential environmental and social
impacts and risks are adequately addressed. These assessments are expected to
identify measures to enhance performance, build capacity, and mitigate key risks,
and are reflected in an integrated risk assessment. The resulting Program Action Plan
(PAP) is then reflected in the legal agreement between the Bank and the
government. A central focus of preparation is the identification of disbursement-
linked indicators (DLIs), each with a verification protocol to ensure that a credible
mechanism is in place for monitoring and verifying its achievement.

During implementation, the Bank task teams are expected to monitor overall
program progress, associated expenditures, and the achievement of results
(including the DLIs). Task teams monitor progress in implementing the PAP,
changes in the program’s risks, and compliance with the provisions of the legal
agreements. Technical support from the Bank team focuses on improving systems
performance and resolving implementation issues. Operations are subject to the
same corporate oversight functions as other Bank lending instruments, and the Bank
retains the right to carry out investigations that it deems necessary and to sanction
entities that are found to have engaged in fraud or corruption. The Bank’s
debarment list applies to PforR operations.

The monitoring and verification of results is an essential feature of the instrument,
and the DLIs require a credible verification process that is acceptable to the Bank
and is agreed at the time of appraisal. Where appropriate, the verification process
may also include independent or third-party monitoring. DLIs are public
information and their progress is supposed to be reported in the implementation
reports. PforR documents are available to the public, giving stakeholders access to
information about the performance of the public institutions and programs.

MANAGEMENT’S TWO-YEAR REVIEW
The OPCS Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e) addressed the initial experience of
PforR operations from the management perspective. It summarized the Bank’s
experience, drawing on a literature and desk review organized thematically and

                                                                                CHAPTER 1
                          THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
with participation of task teams and managers who had worked on the instrument,
internal and external surveys, structured interviews with government officials and
senior Bank managers, and consultations with key stakeholders.

The review concluded that the instrument had been successfully rolled out across a
broad range of countries and sectors, policy requirements had been met, and
implementation was broadly on track for all but one of the approved operations. On
this basis, the paper found that no major changes in the design of the instrument
appeared necessary, but it identified some adjustments and areas for improvement.
In this regard, the report recommended that the 5 percent cap on PforR
commitments (as a percentage of total Bank commitments) be increased to 15
percent, although the volume of approved operations had not yet reached the 5
percent level, and that limited exceptions should be permitted to the procurement
exclusions. If the 15 percent cap should be exceeded, management is expected to
inform the Board and discuss how best to address the future demand. The paper
also suggested other editorial and technical changes to Operational Policy (OP) 9.00,
the Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACG), and Bank Procedure (BP) 9.00. (OPs and BPs
have now been replaced by Policy, Directive, and Procedure.4) The suggested
changes were endorsed by the Board and put into implementation as of July 1, 2015.


The Evaluation
An independent assessment, as requested by the Board. This IEG evaluation
provides an independent assessment of the early experience with the PforR
instrument. It uses the findings of the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), but goes
beyond it in several respects, most importantly through a desk review of all
approved PforR projects (until the end of fiscal 2015), supplemented by field visits to
11 countries (IEG 2015a).

Conceptual aspects of the evaluation. This is a real-time process evaluation of an
instrument that has no completed operations, and thus no available IEG-validated
data on final outcomes and only partial data on disbursements, results, and outputs.
Through a review of all the PforR operations approved by the end of fiscal 2015 (27
operations), the evaluation has assessed project designs and the early
implementation experience against the stated expectations in the 2011 Board paper
(World Bank 2011a) and, in particular, the key issues highlighted in discussions at
the Committee on Development Effectiveness and the Board: institutional capacity
building, expected results, management of fiduciary risks, environmental and social
aspects, and eventual evaluability.5

CHAPTER 1
THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
Evaluation objectives. This evaluation provides early feedback on how the PforR
instrument is working and its adherence to the stated objectives and intentions in
the Board paper (World Bank 2011a). It has two objectives: (i) to assess the early
experience with the design and implementation of PforR operations and (ii) to
provide lessons and recommendations relevant for the use and possible
improvement of this instrument. Since this is a new instrument, the evaluation has
also paid significant attention to possible risks—particularly the fiduciary,
environmental, and social risks that have been in the forefront during discussions so
far.

Specific audiences are the Board, which is guiding the rollout of this new
instrument; Bank senior management, which is implementing the instrument; and
country-client stakeholders, who would stand to benefit from the appropriate use of
the instrument. The evaluation is also expected to be helpful in informing future
Board decisions on the further mainstreaming of this instrument. In addition, the
evaluation should be useful for program task teams engaged in the identification,
preparation, and supervision of PforR operations.

Evaluation questions. The report seeks to answer the following questions:

       What has been the overall experience to date with the design, preparation,
        and early implementation of PforR operations and the associated
        opportunities and challenges?
       What is the quality of the program assessments, including the technical,
        fiduciary systems, and environmental and social assessments?
       How effective has the PforR instrument (including policies, procedures, and
        guidelines, and their application) been in identifying, assessing, and
        mitigating critical risks?
       To what extent is the PforR instrument being used to strengthen national
        systems for financial management, procurement, environmental and social
        safeguards, and M&E?

Analytical framework. The evaluation consists of the following activities:

       A literature survey of relevant material concerning the results focus for
        development activities, the use of country systems, and political economy
        issues. This included a review of literature from or about relevant program
        initiatives of other multilaterals (in particular, the Inter-American
        Development Bank [IDB] and the Asian Development Bank [ADB]) and
        leading bilateral aid agencies (including the United Kingdom’s Department
        for International Development [DFID]).

                          THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH
      Systematic assessment of approved PforR projects. This covered all 27
       operations approved by the end of fiscal 2015—a review of the full universe
       of operations was possible and desirable because of the small number of
       programs. The assessment was done as a desk review by the evaluation team
       using a standardized approach to focus on the new aspects of PforR
       operations and their implications. (Appendix A describes this standardized
       approach.)
      Field visits carried out in eight countries with PforR operations approved
       in fiscal 2012–14 (Bangladesh, Brazil, Croatia, Ethiopia, Morocco,
       Mozambique, Rwanda, and Vietnam). There were also brief, abbreviated
       visits to three countries (Kenya, Nepal, and Uganda), undertaken in the
       context of other tasks. The main purpose of these field visits was to seek the
       views of government counterparts and other relevant donors on various
       aspects of their PforRs—what works well or not so well, and how they see
       advantages and disadvantages compared with other Bank lending
       instruments.

Limitations of the evaluation. The newness of the PforR program and its short
implementation experience set clear limitations for the evaluation. A few operations
have had significant results during the evaluation period, but none has been
completed.6 This process evaluation, therefore, cannot discuss final results. At the
same time, this limitation enables the evaluation to focus on the assessment of the
objectives, structures, and risks identified and addressed during preparation and the
early performance of the approved operations (without the possibility of biased
judgment of design based on knowledge of the eventual results). The evaluation also
devotes special attention to the quality, relevance, and use of results frameworks
and DLIs, including verification protocols. In addition, the evaluation looks at the
strengths and risks of the PforR programs and reviews the extent to which PforR
operations are helping to build national systems for the monitoring of results.

Organization of the report. The rest of the report is organized into five chapters.
Chapter 2 provides a response to the first evaluation question: What has been the
overall experience to date with the early implementation of PforR operations?
Chapter 3 summarizes the findings on quality of program assessments. Chapter 4
provides a response to the third question: How effective has the PforR instrument
been in identifying, assessing, and mitigating critical risks? Chapter 5 looks at the
extent to which the PforR instrument is being used to strengthen national systems
for financial management, procurement, environmental and social safeguards, and
M&E. The concluding chapter summarizes the key findings and provides
recommendations for strengthening the PforR instrument.

THE PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS INSTRUMENT AND THE EVALUATION APPROACH




1The request was made at the meeting on October 24, 2014, and reiterated at the discussion
of the paper by the full Board on April 9, 2015.
2The Board paper (World Bank 2011a) gave several examples of how it was possible to use
the IPF instrument for programmatic purposes, but this required modification of
counterpart procedures, exclusions of significant classes of expenditures, drawing
significantly on preparation resources to find acceptable ways of adapting to prescriptive
IPF requirements, and high expected costs of implementation support.
3An additional implicit assumption is that Bank staff will not succumb to the usual
disbursement pressures, and hence conclude that inadequate systems are “adequate.” See
IEG 2015b.
4In August 2013, the Executive Directors approved a Policy and Procedure Framework to
replace the OPs/BPs that governed existing Bank operations. (“Bank Procedure: Policy and
Procedure Framework” [R2013-0156; IDA/R2013-0214] (World Bank 2013a), approved by
the Executive Directors on August 9, 2013.) With respect to PforR operations, OP and BP
9.00 have been replaced by “Bank Policy, Program-for-Results Financing” (World Bank
2015b), issued and effective July 10, 2015, Catalogue Number OPCS5.04-POL.01; “Bank
Directive, Program-for-Results Financing” (World Bank 2015a), issued and effective July 10,
2015, Catalogue Number OPCS5.04-DIR.01; and “Bank Procedure, Program-for-Results
Financing” (World Bank 2016), issued December 31, 2015, effective January 1, 2016,
Catalogue Number OPSVP5.04-PROC.62. These new requirements are supported by the
Program-for-Results Financing: Interim Guidance Notes to Staff on Assessment (World Bank
2012c).
5 In accordance with the Board paper, all PforR operations will be evaluated upon
completion (separately from the present study). These self-evaluations by Bank teams (to be
followed by IEG validations and selective Project Performance Assessment Reports) will
analyze the results of each operation as well as efforts to build institutional capacity
(building on the various assessments and their outcomes). The self-evaluations will also
look at the performance of the Bank and the borrower in carrying out their respective roles.
6Only two PforR operations will be closed by June 30, 2016: the Morocco Human
Development Project and the Uruguay Road Maintenance Program. Implementation
Completion Reports for these operations will be available by December 2016.

2. Experience with the PforR Program
After its approval by the Board, the Bank rolled out the PforR program cautiously,
seeking a balance between responding to the potentially strong client demand and
learning from implementation experience. There was also a limit to aggregate PforR
operations, determined by the Board, of 5 percent of total International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development
Association (IDA) commitments for the first two years from Board approval. The
Board reviewed the progress in rolling out the instrument as part of the Two-Year
Review in 2015 (World Bank 2015e) and increased this limit to 15 percent of the three-
year average of total IBRD and IDA commitments. The PforR portfolio has grown
rapidly, and with significant design coherence that is broadly in line with the
original expectations.


Growth and Diversification of the PforR Portfolio
From a modest start, the Bank’s PforR portfolio has grown rapidly. As of March 31,
2016, the Board had approved a total of 39 PforR operations, providing $9.5 billion
of Bank financing to support a total of $49.9 billion in government programs (table
2.1), with an additional 21 operations under preparation (having completed the
concept stage), totaling $5.4 billion in expected Bank financing.

As of March 31, 2016, all Bank Regions had at least two approved PforR operations
(figure 2.1A). The introduction of PforR to different Regions appears to be
influenced by a range of factors. In Africa, for example, it has been influenced by the

CHAPTER 2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
perspective that the PforR is a good instrument for supporting the regional agenda
of building stronger institutions and delivering better services. In the Middle East
and North Africa and East Asia and Pacific Regions, the instrument is regarded as a
good fit for efforts to increase the emphasis on results and institutional capacity
building. PforR operations cover most of the sectors in which the Bank traditionally
provides financing. In terms of global practices (sectors), Water; Social, Urban, and
Rural; and Health, Nutrition, and Population are the leading practices (figure 2.1B).

                                                      EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
Early approvals were largely for IDA countries, with a recent increase for IBRD
countries. During consultations on the design of the instrument, many observers
expected the strongest uptake to come in IBRD countries. However, of the 27
operations approved by end of fiscal 2015, IBRD countries accounted for only 8
operations (35 percent of total PforR Bank financing), while 19 operations (65
percent by amount) were under way in IDA countries (see appendix C, table C.1). In
the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, there was a stronger uptake of the instrument
for IBRD lending, with 6 out of 12 approvals, accounting for around 75 percent of
total Bank PforR financing (see appendix C, table C.2), and with the IBRD
accounting for a majority of the operations in the pipeline (17 out of 21 operations).

Some PforRs were combined with IPF lending. The PforR policy framework
provides flexibility through the possible combination with other Bank instruments.
Thus 3 of the 27 operations approved through the end of fiscal 2015 included IPF
components for technical assistance activities.1 During interviews, task teams
indicated that they like having this hybrid option available. This approach, however,
can create some complexities, because it requires the use of a separate set of policies
and procedures. (This is consistent with the Bank’s earlier experience with hybrid
operations, when using IPF and DPF for the same operation.) For example, in Brazil,
the technical assistance IPF incurred a multiplicity of procurement processes for
capacity building and institutional development programs, with 14 of the agencies
participating in the 4 programs supported by the PforR. This overwhelmed the
capacity of both the project management unit and the Bank team, with attendant
delays, including a delay in the achievement of three of the DLIs.

The programs do a good job of covering both partnerships and ownership. The IEG
team rated 82 percent of the operations approved through the end of fiscal 2015 as
moderately satisfactory or better on partnership relationships with donors—for
example, that previous relationships have been continued under the PforR
instrument, and/or that donors are working in parallel with the Bank’s instrument,
when relevant, and all but one was so rated on borrower ownership. (See appendix
A for methodology.) In one case—Rwanda Agriculture—to enhance ownership by
all stakeholders, the government signed a memorandum of understanding with the
private sector, civil society, and development partners supporting the principles and
objectives of the program, building on previous work. This program also includes
cofinancing by DFID through a multidonor trust fund, with common results and
DLIs. Mozambique PFM had an extensive participatory process, building wide
understanding and clarity of goals, and enabling greater commitment from officials
and other stakeholders that have been part of the process of setting goals and
program design. The processing of this PforR took a long time—time that was

needed to create a reasonable internal understanding and acceptance of the concept
and the proposed modalities.

There is little formal cofinancing with other development partners. Only 2 of the 27
approved operations involved formal cofinancing of the PforR instrument using the
DLIs—Rwanda Agriculture with DFID, which for formal reasons was very difficult to
put together (see para 2.6) and Tanzania Education with the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). However, many PforR operations involve some
sort of parallel financing with development partners, through various means,
including partners’ financing of technical assistance requirements, or the Bank and
other partners supporting the same government programs. For example, in Ethiopia,
the Bank supports the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Performance Fund for
the health sector together with nine other multilateral and bilateral partners. Based on
estimates in the project appraisal documents (PADs), the share of Bank financing
varies from 13 to 100 percent of the program in approved operations (appendix C,
table C.2), but there are no indications that the PforR instrument has encouraged any
other donor financing. Bank financing and development-partner financing as a share
of these overall government programs averages 15 and 24 percent, respectively. The
participation of other donors seems to have increased for operations approved in
fiscal 2016—six out of eight operations have financing from other donors (appendix C,
table C.2).

Approved PforR operations largely follow PAD expectations. As of March 31, 2016,
32 of the 39 approved operations were effective. Bank disbursements have been on
track relative to expectations, with annual disbursement amounts increasing from

$108 million in fiscal 2013, to $479 million in fiscal 2015, and to $1,056 million for the
first three quarters in fiscal 2016 (figure 2.2). Of the 32 effective operations, 21 have
been effective for over a year, and have disbursed 35 percent on average. Most of the
effective operations have shown a steady pattern of disbursement, but a few either
disbursed a lot in a relatively short period (the Tunisia Urban Development Project
disbursed 0.1 million in fiscal 2015 as front-end fee payments, but $65.5 million in
fiscal 2016) or experienced difficulties in disbursing (the India Maharashtra Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Program [RWSSP], effective in August 2014, had 4
percent disbursement in early 2016). Overall implementation of PforR operations is
also broadly on track, with performance ratings satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory and risk ratings stable through early implementation, except the
Moldova Health Transformation Project, where ratings for progress toward
achievement of project development objectives (PDOs) and implementation
progress have both been downgraded, from moderately satisfactory to moderately
unsatisfactory, and the associated overall risk from moderate to substantial.
Domestic political problems underlie many of these issues.

Thus far, PforR operations have shown themselves to be no less expensive for the
Bank than IPF projects. Expenses directly related to the preparation of PforR
operations average $554,000, with a median of $547,000, both somewhat higher than
for IPF operations (with Track II regular processing requirements) in fiscal 2013 and
fiscal 2014 ($548,0002 average and $466,000 median). Average supervision costs for
the 27 programs were $261,000 for fiscal 2015 and $180,000 for fiscal 2016 (through
April for the first nine months of the fiscal year), but with wide differences between
high- and low-cost programs (depending, in part, on the amount of continued Bank
engagement with institution building during implementation), and thus with the
median numbers a bit lower. These supervision costs are significantly above the
Bank-wide average for IPFs of about $110,000, although it is possible that the
average PforR preparation and supervision costs will decline somewhat over time as
programs mature. It is likely that introducing the instrument to clients and the
learning process for the clients and Bank staff contributed to relatively high early
costs for preparation and implementation support. In addition, Bank PforR work
includes the preparation of the fiduciary and environmental and social assessments.
The Bank’s work during both PforR preparation and implementation can thus
involve an amount of public goods work, with potential benefits beyond the specific
programs and participating institutions. Overall, however, there is not yet sufficient
evidence to derive any conclusions about the overall efficiency of PforRs.

The average Bank financing of a PforR operation has been about $241 million, larger
than the average IPF operation. There may be potential for further increases, since
there may be potential for supporting larger programs in some countries, and since


                                                                                        15
CHAPTER 2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
some borrowers welcome what they see as the predictability and general nature of
disbursements under PforRs. Operations approved in fiscal 2016 have an average of
$363.8 million in Bank financing, which is significantly larger than those approved
between fiscal 2012 and 2015 ($185.2 million, on average), an average increased, in
particular, by a $1.5 billion operation for India.

As reported in the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), the average preparation
time for a PforR was 13.6 months, which is slightly shorter than the 15 months for
Track II IPF operations in fiscal 2014, although actual preparation time ranged from
6.9 to 28.7 months. Short preparation times were feasible primarily when working
with established government programs and where governments themselves focused
on results, as was the case for the first two PforRs in Rwanda.

PforRs account for a growing share of the Bank’s operations. Table 2.1 shows that
since their inception, there has been a steady increase in the share of PforR
commitments in Bank approvals, from $0.4 billion in fiscal 2012 (1.1 percent of
overall Bank approvals) to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015 (5.3 percent). In addition, as of
March 31, 2016, 12 fiscal 2016 operations had been approved by the Board, totaling
$4.4 billion in commitments, or 14.5 percent of the total Bank lending for this period.
There is also a marked tendency that when a country has one PforR operation, more
are likely to follow. As of end fiscal 2015, almost half (13 of the 27 operations) were
in six countries with two PforRs, and, in one case, with three operations (appendix
C, table C.1), and these countries also accounted for one-third (4 out of 12
operations) of the approvals in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, while three
countries accounted for their second PforRs in this period. Based also on the
findings of the field missions, IEG expects that PforRs will—over time—account for
substantial shares of the overall lending programs in a number of countries.


Design Coherence
RESULTS FRAMEWORKS AND DLIS
The 2011 Board paper (World Bank 2011a) on PforRs makes clear that the programs
are aimed at achieving results, but otherwise the paper does not provide much
discussion of what should be understood by results, beyond a brief discussion of the
wide range of possible DLIs. The Guidance Notes stipulate that results are “the
output, outcome, or impact of a development intervention. In general, the Bank
seeks to encourage results that support sustainable improvements in country
outcomes—that is, evident changes in peoples’ lives, and/or the behaviors of
targeted organizations, households, or firms” (World Bank 2012c, p. 16). During
program preparation and, in particular, implementation, the DLIs may get the most

                                                       EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
attention since their progress will determine the pace of disbursements. However, as
discussed in chapter 6, a comprehensive assessment of the eventual results of a
PforR must cover several dimensions, with the PforR results framework at the core.

The PforR frameworks consist of an overall PDO, a few PDO indicators, and a larger
number of intermediate results indicators. Together, these three components
constitute the results framework for a PforR. Although there is usually good
coherence among the three, in some cases the indicators are not coherent with the
PDO, or the PDO is not fully aligned with PAD discussion or the indicators.

The PforR objectives are expressed in the PDOs, supplemented by the few PDO
indicators for each PforR. For the PforRs approved by the end of fiscal 2015, the
targeted results are mostly institutional, such as “To improve transparency and
resource management of targeted departments of the Province of Punjab,” in the
Pakistan Punjab Public Management Program, or they represent intermediate
outcomes, such as “To improve the delivery and use of a comprehensive package of
maternal and child health services,” in the Morocco Improving Primary Health Care
in Rural Areas PforR. Objectives that lead to clear results at the outcome level are
rare. PADs could benefit from pushing the envelope further in terms of
concentrating on outcomes that are achievable during the program period (such as
increased immunization coverage or improved reading levels). There is seldom a
discussion of the longer-term prospects and objectives for the programs, and thus
also relatively little attention to the sustainability of the targeted improvements
beyond the program periods.

Issues with the results frameworks are not limited to PforRs, but are also found in
other instruments. Thus, as noted in The Quality of Results Frameworks in Development
Policy Operations (IEG 2015d), some development policy operations (DPOs) suffer
from a lack of clear statements of objectives and outcomes. Their results frameworks
lack explicitly stated outcomes, while results often fall short of meaningfully
measuring the impact of a DPO. In some cases, the identified prior actions lack
significant additionality, because they have little or no tangible implications for
overall policy, involve recurrent government functions, or pilot actions without a
clearly defined scaling-up strategy. In other cases, the results frameworks lack
essential triggers or accept partially met triggers that do not capture the true essence
of intended reforms and may substantially undermine the quality of the DPO.

The PforR instrument finances the implementation of a program, and the support
for program implementation should, in turn, determine the choice and design of the
DLIs, but the DLIs should not be considered the results of a PforR. Unlike output-
based aid, which directly links financing to outputs or outcomes (that is, program or


                                                                                      17
CHAPTER 2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
project implementation is financed elsewhere), the design of a PforR must provide a
way to ensure that there is a sufficient flow of funds during program
implementation through the DLI disbursements. In some PforRs, IEG found quite
close and clear integration between the results framework and the DLIs (and with
the PAP). One example is the Ethiopia Health MDGs PforR (box 2.1).

However, overall the DLI sets may be more or less representative of the results
frameworks. In two cases (among the 27 in the IEG sample) the DLI set consists of
all the indicators in the respective results frameworks, and they are thus fully
representative of those frameworks. For some PforRs, the DLI sets are well
structured and explained in relation to the results framework. However, there are
other cases where the DLIs are focused on intermediate steps for which the

relevance and the linkage to the program objectives and results framework appear
weak, or at least have not been made apparent. Box 2.2 describes one example.


 Box 2.2. Example of a DLI Set Different from the Results Framework
 In the Tanzania Big Results in Education Now Program, there is a clear difference
 between the results framework (PAD annex 2) and the set of DLIs (PAD annex 3):
    The PDO is to improve the quality of education in Tanzanian primary and secondary
     schools, and the results framework supports this through appropriate PDO indicators
     that include reading levels, subtraction levels, teachers found in classrooms, and
     knowledge levels of teachers.
    But the six DLIs are overwhelmingly (80 percent by amounts) institutional—
     completion of foundational activities, resource flows, annual reporting, and
     deployment of teachers across districts, and schools receiving incentive grants. Only
     one DLI addresses education results—for reading improvements.
    It is thus hypothetically possible for all DLIs to be met in full, and on time, with 100
     percent disbursements, but with only one of the four PDO indicators (reading levels)
     being met. (However, management believes in this case that the DLIs will support the
     achievement of the PDO indicators).

The extent to which DLIs incentivize performance may depend on the financing
attached. The role of DLIs to incentivize performance is mentioned regularly in
PforR PADs, in particular in the risk assessments. There can be two aspects to
incentives. A well-structured set of DLIs responding to borrower priorities will help
to encourage performance through a set of logical, achievable steps, and this has
been observed by IEG field missions. But it is a separate question whether the
prospects for an amount of financing will encourage prompt and timely actions—
and the missions saw examples where such prospects did not appear to do so.3 A
related question is whether small DLIs (in dollar terms) can have much of an
incentive effect. As one example, for the relatively recent Vietnam National Urban
Development Program, one DLI accounts for 1 percent of total financing, one for 3
percent, and two others for 4 percent each—at the other end of the scale, one DLI is
expected to account for 62 percent of overall disbursements.

It is unclear whether DLIs represent stretch targets. The Two-Year Review did not
discuss the degree of difficulty or stretch in the DLIs, but noted that the formulation
of the DLIs (and the associated disbursement mechanisms) had been one of the most
challenging aspects of the preparation of PforR operations (World Bank 2015e, para.
37). This evaluation has not been able to determine the degree of difficulty in the
DLIs—more appropriately assessed ex post, but field missions noted several cases

CHAPTER 2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
where DLIs seemed relatively easy. As illustration, Box 2.3 offers one example of an
apparently unambitious set of DLIs.


 Box 2.3. Vietnam—DLIs in the Results-Based National Urban Development Program in the
 Northern Mountains Region
 The program has eight DLI indicators, divided among four DLIs:
    DLI 1.1: Enhanced annual city plans approved and disclosed to the public. These
     plans to be produced annually. Presumably, once a plan has been produced it will be
     easy for the cities to modify it as appropriate in the following years.
    DLI 1.2: Professionally staffed management units in place within each participating
     city People’s Committee. Presumably, once a unit is in place it will be straightforward
     to maintain it.
    DLI 2: Local urban infrastructure investments delivered as per each participating
     city’s approved enhanced annual city plan. One of two DLI indicators concerning
     outputs on the ground.
    DLI 3.1: Asset management plan adopted and local urban infrastructure subprojects
     in full service after completion. This indicator also concerns outputs on the ground.
     For the first two years, the indicator concerns asset condition assessment and asset
     management plans. From the third year, condition that at least 80 percent of
     completed local infrastructure subprojects are free of physical damage and
     operational.
    DLI 3.2: Increased annual own-sources revenue in participating cities. The
     requirement (12 percent increase in nominal terms) may not appear difficult
     considering an inflation rate of 6-7 percent and a GDP growth rate of 7 percent in 2014,
     but at least one participating city is concerned because of limitations on their revenue-
     generation possibilities by central government policies.
    DLI 4.1: Implementation strategy for National Urban Development Program
     adopted with annual milestones. A set of gradual milestones, with approval of a
     policy note in year one and management capacity in place in year four.
    DLI 4.2: Professionally staffed unit in place in the Ministry of Construction,
     preparation of annual capacity development plans, and capacity-building support
     provided to cities in accordance with such plans. So the degree of progression under
     this DLI will depend on the degree of progression of the annual capacity building. No
     apparent progression in requirements after year one, but annual disbursements based
     on continuation of the requirement.
    DLI 4.3: Completed program report. An annual report.
 Of the eight indicators, six are institutional (and therefore under the control of the central
 or city authorities), and two concern the investments on the ground, with a modest degree
 of apparent progression over the years.

                                                       EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
PROGRAM ACTION PLANS
The PAP is a key component of the PforR instrument. It contains a set of actions
agreed with the government, based on the outcomes of the different assessments.
Among the examples of improvements that the Board paper (World Bank 2011a)
mentions for inclusion in the PAP are the following: actions to improve the technical
dimensions of the program and formal rules and procedures governing the
organization and management of the systems used to implement the program;
actions to enhance the capacity and performance of the agencies involved; and risk-
mitigating measures to increase the potential for the program to achieve its results
and to address fiduciary, social, and environmental concerns. The implementation of
all actions in the PAP is a contractual obligation incorporated in the Financing
Agreements. However, such a general obligation can have little impact on a
government’s interest in executing individual PAP items.

In general, there is room to improve the discussion of PAP design in the PADs of the
projects examined by IEG. The PforR guidelines state that a PAP should be selective
regarding areas of focus (four or five areas), with a few specific actions in each. This
implies a need to make trade-offs among recommended actions from the
assessments. However, in some recent cases, IEG noted a tendency toward an
increasing number of PAP actions, with 49 actions in one case (Ethiopia—Shared
Prosperity Operation). It is likely that this will dilute the impact of the individual
PAP items. In contrast, the 13 PforR programs visited had a total of 190 actions, of
which 35 percent were fiduciary, 40 percent technical, and 25 percent environment
and social. About 40 percent of the actions in the PAPs reviewed were actions to
enable the achievement of DLIs or were incorporated in the DLIs—it is not clear
why it is considered necessary to include such actions (or actions also included
separately in the Financing Agreements). Most PADs identified the PAP actions as
“critical” or “key” to the achievement of program objectives or to mitigating risks.
However, in some cases, the PAPs included “opportunities for strengthening”
institutional capacity, where the actions may not be critical to the program. Also,
there are PADs that do not provide a clear basis for inclusion of actions in the PAPs,
specifically the articulation of trade-offs among the actions recommended in the
assessments.

IEG found the overall quality of PAPs at entry to be satisfactory. IEG rated 6 of the
13 programs visited as satisfactory, and rated four moderately satisfactory for
“appropriateness of PAP and conditionalities.” A related quality measure in the IEG
template is “appropriateness of risk-mitigation measures,” many of which were
supported by the actions in the PAPs—IEG rated nine programs satisfactory and
four moderately satisfactory using this measure. (See appendix A for methodology.)



                                                                                      21
CHAPTER 2
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM
Implementation performance has been more uneven, however. Based on the IEG
program assessments, the implementation performance of PAPs has not matched
the quality at entry. Of the eight reviewed PAPs with implementation ratings, two
were rated below the line, while the majority (five programs, accounting for about
30 percent of total actions) of the PAPs were rated moderately satisfactory for
implementation. One reason may be that, in practice, there seems to be no penalty
for slow or poor implementation of a number of PAP items, except for the actions
linked to DLIs and effectiveness conditions. Another reason may be the inclusion of
actions that are not critical to the achievement of program objectives. If the PAPs
were to focus on (non-DLI) critical actions, there may need to be greater clarity on
the consequences of slow progress.

Reporting on individual PAP actions is not systematic. The Implementation Status
and Results Reports (ISRs) typically do not provide information on the status of
PAPs, mainly because the format does not allow for it except through notes and
comments. In the aide-memoires, there is variability in the quality of the reporting
on PAPs—discussion of PAP actions is sometimes spread across the various topics
covered in the text. A good practice found in half of the reviewed PforR aide-
memoires is the use of a table or annex that summarizes the status of the each of the
PAP actions and the next steps and consolidates the information on PAP actions
discussed in various sections of the aide-memoire.

There may be room for greater selectivity and focus in designing the PAPs.
Generally, the PADs should do a better job of articulating the rationale for the choice
of actions included in the PAPs. This would result in a smaller number of more
critical actions. For example, the PAPs could give attention primarily to areas with
substantial and moderate risks. In addition, it may not be necessary to include DLI-
related actions, which are already being tracked through the DLIs.

Emerging Messages
The PforR instrument is an increasingly important lending vehicle for the Bank.
The PforR portfolio has been growing steadily and is becoming an increasing share
of the Bank’s operations. There are now PforR operations in all Bank Regions and in
most of the key sectors. Approved operations are largely on track. Early approvals
were largely for IDA countries, but there has been a recent increase in IBRD country
participation, with IBRD countries accounting for a strong majority of the operations
in the pipeline. The programs do a good job of covering ownership by counterpart
stakeholders, which is essential for development effectiveness. There has been a
pronounced tendency for a country with one PforR to be interested in more such
operations.


22
                                                                                  CHAPTER 2
                                                         EXPERIENCE WITH THE PFORR PROGRAM

The PforRs also cover partnerships well, but have resulted in little formal
cofinancing with other development partners. While many PforR operations involve
some sort of parallel financing with development partners, there is little evidence that
the PforR instrument has been conducive to more or stronger partnerships—and the
theory of change may thus not have been fully met. Only 1 of the 27 operations
approved through the end of fiscal 2015 has involved cofinancing of the PforR
instrument using the DLIs, and this was very difficult to put together for formal
reasons. Partners who cofinance and participate in the disbursement aspects of a
PforR operation may face challenges because their internal procedures and practices
relating to the flow of funds may need to be modified to participate efficiently and
effectively in the DLI aspects of an operation. Each potential partner will know best
how to adjust its own systems, but for the blending of the systems to work smoothly,
it is important that the Bank team be able to explain clearly and accurately the details
of the DLI procedures at the outset. Such clear information will alleviate any lack of
understanding and will allow a partner not only to tweak its own funding
mechanisms, but also to keep its expectations in line with the realities of the new
instrument.

The results frameworks, DLIs, and PAPs are often reasonably coherent, but there
is room for improvement in several areas. PforR objectives in the projects examined
are mostly institutional or focused on intermediate outcomes. Objectives in terms of
outcomes are rare, and the focus in the PADs on objectives and supporting
discussions could go beyond the program period itself to consider longer-term
objectives and sustainability of program improvements. Some DLI sets do not seem
to represent adequately the results frameworks that they are supporting, while
others may be unduly modest, probably to ensure steady progress and
disbursements. The incentives among staff and government counterparts are largely
for achieving the DLIs; the risk-mitigation activities captured in the PAP supervision
receive less attention. There is also room for greater selectivity and focus in
designing the PAPs, including a reversal of the trend in some PforRs toward an
increasing number of PAP actions. Also, the PAP implementation performance has
been somewhat uneven, and the reporting on individual PAP actions has not been
systematic.

3One reason can be that timely disbursements may have different effects at different
government levels (for example, at a Ministry of Finance compared to a Ministry of Health).
There may also be circumstances where the timing of disbursements may not be all that
important, as long as the funds are likely to be disbursed during the life of the program.

3. The Quality of Program Assessments
The Bank carries out three kinds of assessments for each PforR. These are technical
(including expenditures and results), fiduciary, and environmental and social
assessments. Each of these should consider the overall quality of a program
(including its expenditures) and its systems in its area—the framework and rules,
implementation capacity, and actual performance under the program—and should
identify improvements, including measures to mitigate major risks that the program
will not achieve its expected results. The program assessments for the 27 operations
approved by the end of fiscal 2015 have been comprehensive in scope and
particularly strong with respect to addressing each program’s technical soundness,
implementation capacity, fiduciary, and environmental and social impacts.

Technical Assessments
The technical assessments are a critical step for the processing of PforR operations.
They consider strategic relevance, appropriateness of program structure and
implementation arrangements, the expenditure framework, and the economic
justification. They also cover the quality of the results framework for M&E (see
chapter 2). The assessment is meant to identify strengths in the government
programs and how they will be used for leverage, and weaknesses and risks in the
government programs, and how they will be addressed or mitigated as needed by
the PforR in an integrated and coherent manner (see World Bank 2011a).

Overall, these assessments are credible and comprehensive. IEG’s review of the
PforRs approved through fiscal 2015 found that they were mainly prepared in
collaboration with clients and, in some cases, with other development partners. They
place the PforRs in the context of the Bank’s country programs and demonstrate the
importance of the sectors for the countries’ development. Strategic relevance is
generally good. The IEG team rated only 3 out of 27 PforRs as moderately
unsatisfactory in this regard (with the other 24 rated from highly satisfactory to
moderately satisfactory). Even these three operations were generally consistent with
country and country assistance strategy priorities, but were found to have
weaknesses such as the balance of program priorities or design.

The IEG team rated all but 1 of the 27 PforR operations moderately satisfactory or
better on program structure and implementation arrangements. Operations
supported government programs, which are well defined and clearly bounded, with
adequate borrower capacity, borrower participation in design and implementation,



                                                                                        25
CHAPTER 3
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
defined program management mechanisms, and coordination processes with other
development partners.

Expenditure frameworks are often covered reasonably well. The IEG team rated the
frameworks of 89 percent of the operations as moderately satisfactory or better, with
only three operations rated below the line. Assessments look at the efficiency and
effectiveness of a government program, along with its sustainability and linkage
with priorities and results. For example, Kenya’s Medium-Term Expenditure and
Financing Framework supports the expansion of safety nets, with government
resources gradually increasing the country’s share of total program financing
relative to donors. In the Rwanda PFM, the PforR would finance 58 percent of the
overall program, with contributions from government and other development
partners. However, here and elsewhere, tracking government expenditures can be
difficult because of budget classifications and coding.

The role of PforRs can be unclear where they finance modest shares of overall
programs. As one example, in Tanzania Education, the program expenditures seem
reasonable, with a results focus incentivized by DLIs, and a useful typology of costs
provided in the PAD (although the financing of technical assistance could have been
broken out more clearly). However, the program will account for less than 10
percent of total basic education expenditures. The more than 90 percent of spending
outside the program, depending on circumstances, may have greater influence over
educational results. In this case, is it also not clear whether the program will be
sustained after its completion, or even whether the program (if successful) ought to
be sustained for the long haul, separate from the overall education programs.

Some operations may be too ambitious. Thus, the Mexico Water and Sanitation
Program aims to triple the annual investment level of the sector in Oaxaca State,
which the PAD itself deems “very challenging in a context of limited counterpart
financing and limited capacity to absorb such an increased amount of investments”
(World Bank 2014c, p. 6). While extensive technical assistance will be provided, such
a rapid increase seems overambitious when considering the more rigorous controls
required by the program and the sector’s poor past performance record.

Some operations may fail to address key sectoral issues. Thus, the Tunisia Urban
Program supports reforms in the public expenditure framework to make the capital
investment allocations from the central budget to local governments more
transparent, predictable, and efficient, and the government has passed several legal
changes in that regard. However, the trajectory of growth of allocations to local
governments outlined in the program is consistent with historical trends, which
means that levels of investment in municipal infrastructure will remain modest and

                                                                                            CHAPTER 3
                                                                    THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
below expected requirements. In addition, the program does not address the modest
growth in municipal revenues, which fund operations and maintenance of
infrastructure and are critical to sustainability and effectiveness. It is also unclear how
the PforR program supports the local governments that are in financial distress;
however, the program and the underlying policy reforms seek to address the causes
for such distress.

Costing methodologies in many programs are unclear. A common shortcoming is
that there are few details in the PADs on the costing methodology used by the
government to prepare the expenditure frameworks for the programs being
supported. Without accurate costing, budgeting, procurement, and performance
measurement can be compromised. Most PforRs seem to base their costing estimates
on the costing of the underlying government program, but with few or no details on
the methodology used by the program. An exception and example of good practice
is the Ethiopia Health Millennium Development Goals PforR, where costing was
done using Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks, a tool created by development
partners and the national ministries of health from several countries (box 3.1).


 Box 3.1. Good Practice in Costing: Ethiopia Health Millennium Development Goals PforR
 Costing for the Ethiopia Health PforR was done by the government using the Marginal
 Budgeting for Bottlenecks tool, which was created by development partners and the
 national ministries of health from several countries. The tool contributes to the removal of
 health system bottlenecks by helping to prepare strategic plans and expenditure programs
 to increase the quality of high-impact health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and
 malaria interventions. The approach focuses on three service-delivery modes: family-
 oriented, community-based services; population-oriented schedulable services; and
 individual-oriented clinical services. It helps to assess current performance of health
 services and to identify bottlenecks in both supply and demand, and it enables a tailored
 approach to each country’s specific situation. This helps to facilitate selection of the types,
 quantities, and costs of salaries, drugs, training, and other inputs that are needed to
 overcome bottlenecks and achieve optimal results.

The economic justifications in the PADs are broadly reasonable. The IEG team rated
89 percent of the economic justifications moderately satisfactory or better. Program
teams looked at the rationale for public financing, the economic impact of the
program with and without PforR support, and the added value of the latter. For
example, the economic evaluation of Croatia Health estimated the economic benefits
from seven key interventions supported by the PforR. The technical assessment used

CHAPTER 3
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
evidence from other country experiences in estimating cost savings from a variety of
activities, such as the outpatient versus inpatient costs of various procedures.

The PforR programs often do not estimate economic or internal rates of return,
instead using other or partial measures. Thus, for Rwanda PFM, the PAD cited
research by the Overseas Development Institute pointing to general economic
benefits of PFM reforms: macroeconomic stability, timely and reliable fiscal and
financial information, service delivery enhanced by regular payment of salaries, and
state building. (However, the PforR results framework is not set up to measure most
of these aspects.) The economic evaluation of Pakistan (Punjab) Public Management
is generally reasonable. Expected benefits during the program’s lifetime—increases
in property tax collection and labor productivity and reductions in transaction cost
for accessing services—are valued at 1.7 times the present value of the cost of
intervention. However, the property tax estimates assume a level of enforcement for
ensuring that tax bills are paid for new properties added to the registry, despite the
huge challenge of nonpayment of taxes in Pakistan. The economic evaluation gives a
range of estimated benefits (low, medium, high), but it is not clear to what extent
property tax payment compliance has been factored into these estimates, and the
benefits achieved will be, in part, the result of other initiatives, so they cannot be
attributed entirely to the program. In addition, the PAD points out that it
underestimates the net present value, since it does not take into account all the
benefits that program interventions will bring about through subsequent systems
improvements.


Fiduciary Assessments
The Bank has for some time been committed to increasing the use of country
systems. Country systems would include, for instance, designation of the project as
on-budget, aligning with the fiscal calendar, relying on the range of national budget
preparation and execution procedures, as well as intergovernmental transfers, audit,
and national competitive bidding procedures for procurement. PforRs are part of
this long-term attempt to design operations that are a better fit for country contexts.
The PforR approach to country systems is different from the Bank’s earlier country
systems pilots. First, it uses the systems that are responsible for the program being
supported, which may be at a higher standard than those for other programs.
Second, it does not insist that these program systems be at the same standard as the
Bank’s policies and procedures for investment lending operations.

Overall, IEG finds that the fiduciary assessments have been comprehensive, and that
they cover most of the key aspects that one would expect to find. Each area of

                                                                              CHAPTER 3
                                                     THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
discussion typically begins with an overview of the laws and processes applied in
the relevant areas of the government’s program, the shortcomings in practice, and
how the shortcomings will be addressed and monitored. Most PforRs have also
drawn from extensive previous analytical work on fiduciary systems, including
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessments, Country
Procurement Assessment Reports (CPARs), and a range of fiduciary assessments
done by development partners in connection with budget support operations. The
assessments are generally thorough in identifying relevant transparency measures,
such as timely provision of information to stakeholders, disclosure of tender notices
and award decisions, and parliamentary oversight. But some contextual or political
economy issues may not be addressed, as discussed below, and the assessments are
generally stronger for the formal systems (such as procurement laws and
regulations) than for the practical realities (such as actual fraud and corruption).

PforRs assess most program procurement systems as consistent with good public
procurement principles, although implementation is often uneven because of a lack
of political commitment, rigorous follow-up, trained staff, and effective demand-
side processes. Challenges are sometimes pointed out without corresponding
actions being proposed, such as possible entry barriers for contractors due to their
mandatory registration.

The fiduciary systems used for PforRs are broadly the same as for other areas of the
government programs. One exception is the PforR for Brazil—Strengthening Service
Delivery for Growth, Poverty Reduction and Environmental Sustainability in the State
of Ceará, where technical assistance procurement (10 percent of Bank-funded project
costs) uses Bank rules because local rules were not thought to give enough attention to
quality. However, IEG’s field mission found that the technical assistance component
had become unduly complex and had turned into a source of implementation delays.
In hindsight, it might have been more efficient for the Bank to have provided some
initial capacity building and training for the government’s own procurement staff in
participating agencies to implement their own “technical quality + price”
methodology. Although rarely used, this methodology had been legally available
from the start.

Another exception is the high-value procurement exclusion, which has reportedly
excluded some financing in areas supported by the PforRs. PforR financing cannot
normally be used for procurement packages of high-value contracts above
thresholds based on the type of procurement and the level of fiduciary risk.
Following the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), a provision was added that such
contracts may be financed if they are important to the integrity of the program and
their cost is less than 25 percent of the overall program cost. This exception needs to

CHAPTER 3
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
be approved by the Bank’s managing director and chief operating officer. In the
absence of such exceptions, high-value procurements may be handled outside the
programs, and thus outside Bank oversight. IEG finds that this exclusion has not
been a major obstacle in the PforRs reviewed, in part because these areas can be
financed from other sources. The PforR fiduciary risk is then transformed into a
funding risk to the non–Bank-funded part of the program, which could, in turn,
become a risk to the development objective supported under the program.

It can be problematic to include high-value contracts under the PforR instrument.
High-value procurements necessarily impose special risks, and they are likely to
create more work for the clients as well as the Bank. One example is the Bangladesh
value added tax (VAT) Improvement Program, which included financing for a large
information technology system. The procurement of this system had been prepared
carefully and in great detail. As agreed, the hardware and software components
were initially bid as separate procurements, using international competitive bidding
procedures. However, the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase decided not
to accept the successful bidders from the initial procurement, as recommended by
the Technical Committee, to cancel the initial tender, and to retender, merging the
two components. The resulting new tender was for $29 million, above the $20
million threshold allowable under the program. As a result, and following lengthy
discussions, the full component (hardware and software) will now be financed by
the government, while the PforR will support the implementation of the system in
other ways. In this case, a hybrid approach may have been better, with the IPF
instrument financing this component.

Some borrowers have raised concerns about the ACG. Under PforR financing, the
borrower is responsible for taking actions regarding possible fraud and corruption,
and the Bank can investigate allegations and sanction parties if appropriate, which
has raised some borrower concerns. In Brazil, some activities were taken out of the
scope of the PforR to avoid inconsistency at the local-government level. In Morocco,
government counterparts repeatedly raised this issue with the IEG mission. They
questioned why the Bank agreed to the use of all other aspects of national systems,
but insisted on the application of its own ACG, without even assessing the quality of
the country’s own anti-corruption system.

Following the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), the above rights and
responsibilities did not change, but a provision was added that the Bank and the
borrower will formulate a program-specific protocol on how to take actions. The
protocol may be a legal agreement, a memorandum of understanding, or part of the
negotiation minutes. In addition, new language was added, emphasizing that the
country has the sovereign right to take actions in this area, and that Bank actions are

                                                      THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
administrative, for the purpose of determining compliance with Bank policies. If any
actions taken by the borrower conflict with the laws and regulations of the country,
the Bank and borrower will consult to agree on alternative actions that will avoid
such a conflict.


Political Economy Aspects
Political economy issues are behind many of the constraints raised in fiduciary
assessments, but are rarely discussed directly. Any critical analysis tends to address
only low-level issues. For example, in one case, “The membership of the district
council internal audit committee cannot be easily controlled since they are elected
politicians. This can be addressed by co-opting competent members based on an
agreed sitting fee.” Through simple literature searches, the IEG evaluation found
several examples where outside parties, such as researchers, had raised critical
views about the actual state of procurement and other fiduciary practices that do not
seem to be reflected in the PforR assessments, where the focus instead is typically on
institutional reforms to address corruption, including program-specific measures.
There are seldom any convincing arguments that such measures will work in the
case of the new programs. Several interviews with team members confirmed their
awareness of such information and issues; the lack of published analysis is
reportedly because of borrower-government sensitivity in this area.

An example of good practice is the Mozambique PFM PforR. The PAD includes a
good summary of the political economy challenges, the identification of winners and
losers, and design features that address these challenges: strong, senior-level
ownership across key ministries; a shift in incentives that creates greater benefits for
cooperation; flexibility to account for unexpected impacts; the use of change agents
at the deconcentrated levels to drive change; and sharing of risk between the Bank
and the client. The design also addresses the complex political economy of medicine
supply-chain reform, including interdepartmental coordination and competing
policy aims.


Environmental and Social Systems
PforRs seek to ensure that the environmental and social effects of the program are
adequately addressed, as stated in the fiscal 2012 Board paper. During the
preparation of a PforR operation, the Bank is expected to assess, against the
requirements of OP/BP 9.00, the degree to which a program’s systems manage and
mitigate the environmental and social impacts of the overall program. The
assessment will also identify and exclude high-risk activities, specifically those that


                                                                                      31
CHAPTER 3
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
pose a risk of potentially significant adverse impact on the environment or affected
people (activities classified as Category A under the IPF safeguards).

OP statement 9.00—Program-for-Results Financing, sets out requirements for
assessing a program’s environmental and social systems. An assessment is expected
to consider to what degree the program’s systems:

        Promote environmental and social sustainability by avoiding, minimizing, or
         mitigating adverse impacts and promoting informed decision making.
        Avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts on natural habitats and
         physical cultural resources.
        Protect public and worker safety against potential risks associated with
         construction activities, exposure to hazardous materials, and natural hazards.
        Manage land acquisition and loss of access to natural resources in a way that
         avoids or minimizes displacement, and assist the affected people in
         improving, or at the minimum restoring, their livelihoods and living
         standards.
        Give due consideration to the cultural appropriateness of, and equitable
         access to, program benefits, giving special attention to the rights and interests
         of the indigenous peoples and to the needs or concerns of vulnerable groups.
        Avoid exacerbating social conflict, especially in fragile states, post-conflict
         areas, or areas subject to territorial disputes.

In contrast with the practice for IPFs, the Bank itself is expected to undertake the
environmental and social systems assessment (ESSA) for a PforR, and an ESSA is
required for every operation. It is to identify any actions needed to enhance the
systems during program preparation and implementation (the latter to be included
in the PAP). The Bank is also expected to consult with program stakeholders and
disclose the results and recommendations of its ESSA before the appraisal of the
PforR. In addition, the environmental and social risks—and the related mitigation
measures—are expected to be inputs to the integrated risk assessment of the PforR.
During implementation, the Bank is expected to pay particular attention to
reviewing the borrower’s compliance with its contractual undertakings in the
environmental and social management areas, including those related to the PAP;
monitor the evolution of risks; and make adjustments as appropriate.

All reviewed ESSAs have been of reasonable quality. IEG’s desk review assessed the
27 ESSAs (for operations approved through fiscal 2015) against the above criteria.
On this basis, IEG rated all of these as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory.




32
                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                                    THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
But there are some shortcomings in the assessments. The most frequent
shortcomings related to the extent to which the capacity-building measures
recommended in the ESSAs were followed up in the PAPs and the technical
assistance provisions; the coverage of social issues; the adequacy of outreach and
consultation with poor and vulnerable beneficiary groups; and the absence of
monitoring indicators and reporting on safeguards implementation in the results
frameworks of the operation. These issues are discussed further below.

Stakeholder engagement associated with the programs’ social systems was being
fully implemented and supervised by the Bank teams, as IEG found for the projects
visited. Thus, the Brazil Ceará Strengthening Service Delivery Program had
established a publicly accessible website with all the program’s documents, as well
as the results framework, targets, and status. In addition, the level and frequency of
stakeholder engagement seemed appropriate for the type and implementation status
of the program. The skills development program involved consultations with
private sector organizations, and the family assistance program involved
consultations with local community leaders for the development of an outreach
strategy for indigenous peoples and other vulnerable minorities.

Preexisting capacity and budgetary constraints continue to limit the effectiveness of
the program systems. IEG’s field visits found that the planned technical assistance
and PAP actions—mostly involving the preparation of specific guidelines and
training for program staff—were being implemented, but had been unable to
address the existing constraints. For example, the PAD of the Vietnam Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project appropriately mentions the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment—and, by implication, the provincial Departments of
Natural Resources and Environment—as responsible for monitoring and evaluating
the environmental aspects of program implementation. During IEG’s visit, the
provincial departments confirmed that they were responsible for monitoring and
enforcing environmental requirements, but they had been unable to carry out these
functions as regularly and promptly as expected under the law due to continuing
staff and budgetary shortages that had already been identified in the PAD.

Reporting on the monitoring of environmental and social effects of the PforRs has
been sparse. While most (78 percent) of the PforRs reviewed have been rated as
facing moderate or substantial environmental and social risks, and two-thirds (63
percent) of the ESSAs point to the need for monitoring and reporting, only 10 (37
percent) of the PADs discuss specific provisions for the monitoring of environmental
and social effects, and five (18 percent) of the ISRs provide any information on their
implementation. During its country visits, IEG found that the systems were being
implemented, but with virtually no reporting of environmental and social effects,


                                                                                     33
CHAPTER 3
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAM ASSESSMENTS
even at the program-management level. The country teams were adequately up to
speed on the status and extent of land acquisition, involuntary resettlement,
community consultations, extent of compliance with environmental permitting
regulations, and similar issues, but little of this information was (with some
exceptions) reflected in the progress reports, and even less in the ISRs.

It would seem that environmental and social effects have not normally been seen as
integral to PforR reporting. This is indicated by the evidence from the review of
program documents and field visits. This is surprising, because environmental and
social risks have been rated as moderate or substantial in all but six (77 percent) of
the sample portfolios and, as already noted, these risk ratings were raised during
supervision in five (18 percent) cases. Thus, IEG found no evidence that
environmental and social risks are not being managed, but the very limited
reporting of environmental and social effects available in the Bank’s systems is a
major concern, given the essential role of monitoring for the environmental and
social management framework and the important place of environmental and social
risks within the PforRs’ integrated risk management framework.


Emerging Messages
Overall, the structure of the Bank’s assessments for the PforRs—technical, fiduciary,
and environmental and social—has proven to be appropriate, and the assessments
have been credible and comprehensive, but there is some room for improvement. In
particular, costing methodologies used to prepare the expenditure frameworks for
the supported programs are often unclear. In addition, some contextual or political
economy issues may not be addressed in the fiduciary assessments, which are
generally stronger on the formal systems (such as procurement laws and
regulations) than on the practical realities (such as actual fraud and corruption). The
most frequent shortcomings for the environmental and social assessments relate to
the extent to which the capacity-building measures recommended in the
assessments were followed up in the PAPs and the technical assistance provisions;
the coverage of social issues; the adequacy of outreach and consultation to poor and
vulnerable beneficiary groups; and the absence of monitoring indicators and
reporting on safeguards implementation in the results frameworks of the operation.

There are issues surrounding high-value procurements. The high-value
procurement exclusion has reportedly prevented some financing in areas supported
by the PforRs. Following the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), a provision was
added that such contracts may be financed if they are important to the integrity of
the PforR program and their cost is less than 25 percent of the cost of the overall

program. In the absence of such exceptions, these procurements may be handled
outside the programs, and thus outside Bank oversight. IEG finds that this exclusion
has not been a major obstacle in the PforRs reviewed. Experience has demonstrated
that it can also be problematic to include high-value contracts under the PforR
instrument; this is likely to impose special risks and more work on the clients as well
as the Bank.

Some borrowers raised concerns that the ACG limited the scope of PforR operations.
Clients wondered, for instance, why the Bank agreed to the use of all other aspects of
national systems, but insisted on the application of its own ACG, without even
assessing the quality of the country’s own anti-corruption system. The Integrity Vice
Presidency has received only 5 complaints alleging corruption in 3 of the 27 PforR
operations assessed by IEG. The complaints were judged to not warrant an
investigation and no investigations were carried out. The guidelines have been
modified in accordance with the findings of the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e)
to address these concerns and to be clearer about their applications to PforR
operations, but it is too early to determine the result.




                                                                                     35
4. Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation
of Risks
The identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks is expected to play a central
role in the appraisal and implementation of PforR operations. As stated in Bank
Policy—Program-for-Results Financing, “the Bank’s assessment of a proposed program
(will) evaluate the relevant risks and the scope for improvement and managing such
risks, including proposed institution strengthening activities to be undertaken
before, if deemed appropriate, and during program implementation” (World Bank
2015b, para. 5). The ability of PforRs to rely on and support the strengthening of the
government programs’ own risk management systems during program
implementation constitutes one of the defining features of the instrument.

The integrated risk assessment in the PAD identifies and consolidates the risk-
related findings for each PforR. As provided in the Bank Directive—Program-for-
Results Financing (World Bank 2015a), the programs’ integrated risk assessment is
expected to consolidate the risk-related findings of the technical, fiduciary, and
environmental and social systems assessments and provide a key input into the
Bank’s decision to provide PforR financing (World Bank 2015a, para. 31). In line
with the Interim Guidance Notes to Staff on Assessments for PforR Financing, the
integrated risk assessment will arrive at an overall risk rating for the project based
on the consolidation of risks associated with the operating environment—country
risk and stakeholder risk—and the following program-level risks (World Bank
2012c):

        Technical risk: related to the programs’ economic rationale, technical
         soundness, institutional capacity, implementation arrangements, and M&E
         arrangements.
        Fiduciary risk: related to the programs’ fiduciary systems arrangements and
         capacity, including fiduciary-related integrity issues.
        Environmental and social risk: related to the potential environmental and social
         impacts of the program and capacity for avoiding, mitigating, or managing
         those impacts and risks.
        DLI risk: related to the programs’ results framework, the selection and level of
         DLIs, and the risks associated with the verification arrangement for DLIs.

The Two-Year Review of the implementation of the PforRs concluded that “in general
terms, technical, fiduciary, environmental and social, and DLI risks seem to have
been reasonably well identified” (World Bank 2015e, p. 30). It also found that the


36
                                                                                      CHAPTER 4
                                             IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
risk assessments had influenced the design of PforRs through the selection of DLIs
and certain exclusions, and that risk aversion might have resulted in limiting the
scope and content of particular programs. The review also found that, in general, the
risk-mitigation measures embedded in the design of PforR operations and usually
included in PAPs seemed to be relevant and achievable.


Appropriateness of the Identification and Assessment of Program Risks
Fiduciary risks appear to be the main drivers of overall program risk, followed by
technical risk (table 4.1). The integrated risk assessments in the PADs of the 27
approved PforR operations indicate that Bank teams have rated the overall risks
associated with these programs as substantial in the majority of cases, as moderate
in about a quarter of cases, and as high in four cases. To assess the effectiveness of
the PforR preparation process in identifying and assessing critical risks, IEG has
reviewed the appropriateness of these ratings.

Table 4.1. Risk Ratings in PforR PADs
 Risk ratings in
 PforR PADs            High       Substantial       Moderate         Low        Total

 DLI risk               1               8               18            0           27
 Overall risk           4               16              7             0           27
Technical risk ratings: IEG found most of the technical risk ratings to be satisfactory,
but underrated in some cases. The most significant differences were in relation to the
Nepal Bridges and Rwanda Agriculture Programs. In both cases the PAD rated the
technical risk as moderate, but it should—in IEG’s view—have been rated high. In
the Nepal Bridges Program, this was due to a lack of commitment to the budget
reforms supported by the PforR and the weak and untested capacity of the
implementing agency. In the Rwanda Agriculture Program, it was because of the
weak capacity of the private sector to implement a critical component and the lack of
clarity concerning such a response.

The challenges to the implementation of reforms were underestimated in some
cases. For the Tunisia Urban PforR, a high rather than substantial rating would have
been more appropriate, given the implementation challenges, including ownership
risks—the program involves major changes in the roles of central and local
governments and an active role of the citizens, who had previously been excluded


                                                                                             37
CHAPTER 4
IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
from the decision-making and monitoring processes. For the Vietnam Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Operation, the technical risk rating of moderate appears
optimistic in light of the substantial risk to the financial sustainability of capital
investments, considering the borrower’s historic unwillingness to raise tariffs to
cost-recovery levels.

Fiduciary risk ratings: The fiduciary risks associated with the PforRs have been
satisfactorily identified and rated in most cases, though a few PADs underestimated
the risk. Thus, for Nepal Bridges, the fiduciary risk should have been rated high,
rather than substantial, in light of the high level of accountability and governance
issues, the prevailing weaknesses of a dysfunctional budget process, and vacancies
in key anti-corruption positions.

Environmental and social risk ratings: Environmental and social risks were
satisfactorily rated in most cases. Given the exclusion of high-risk components, as
mandated by the Bank Directive (World Bank 2015a), the actual environmental and
social risks faced by the sample PforRs ranged from low to substantial, but seemed
too cautious for two PforRs. For the Kenya National Safety Net Program, which has
no direct environmental effects and only a very limited range of potentially adverse
social effects, the risk would have been appropriately rated as low rather than
moderate. Similarly, a risk rating of moderate would seem more appropriate than
the rating of substantial for the Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban Development
Program, since it has excluded investments in environmentally sensitive areas,
avoided investments in ethnic minority areas, and is addressing identified social
risks through appropriate PAP actions.

DLI risk ratings: The DLI risks have been appropriately rated in over half of the
cases. While DLI risks are generally rated a bit lower than overall program risks,
indicating that they are not normally seen as risk drivers, there is a substantial share
of underratings. The most frequent source of underratings has been related to the
risk that some of the DLIs could not be achieved. Thus, for the Tanzania Health
Program, the risk was rated as moderate in the PAD, although concerns were raised
about timely availability of resources, including technical assistance to support
program implementation. The formulation of the DLIs was also quite complex. Risk
would have been more appropriately rated as substantial. For the Moldova Health
Program, a major risk relates to the timing of two DLIs (smoking prevalence among
adults and adults with hypertension whose blood pressure is under control), given
the possible lag between reforms and the achievement of such outcomes. On this
basis, IEG would rate the DLI risk as high, compared with the moderate rating in the
PAD. Finally, while it is important to have accurate ratings for DLI risk, it is also



38
                                                                                   CHAPTER 4
                                          IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
important to note that DLI ratings are an indicator of the level of expectation set by
the PforR, so they do not necessarily need to be low.

Overall risk ratings: Overall risk ratings have been appropriate in most cases. In line
with the policy mandate and guidelines, program risk ratings were integrated into
an overall risk rating for each PforR, which also reflected the risks to the operating
environment—country risk and stakeholder risk. Based on IEG’s desk review of the
27-project portfolio and its field missions to 8 countries, most of these risks had been
satisfactorily identified, and the overall risk ratings were appropriate. In a few cases,
the overall risk rating was lower than called for in light of the underlying
information, as illustrated by the examples below.

      For the Brazil Ceará Service Delivery Program, the overall PAD risk rating of
       moderate looks optimistic in light of the substantial risks related to the ability
       of the skill development program to place its trained technicians in
       productive sector jobs during the ongoing recession; the ability of the family
       assistance program to reach its intended beneficiaries among the most
       vulnerable household groups, given the exclusion of municipal-level
       components from the scope of the PforR; and the ability of the water quality
       program to improve water quality in the target reservoirs, given the
       increasing length and frequency of droughts brought about by climate
       change.
      For the Croatia Health Program, the integrated risk rating of substantial also
       seems optimistic, considering the complexity of the program, which involves
       wide-ranging reforms. Program implementation would be challenging even
       with technical assistance, which the PforR does not include. It would have
       been more appropriate to rate the program risk as high, and then lower it if
       warranted by the quality of implementation progress.


Appropriateness of Risk-Based Exclusions
Risk-based exclusions have been built into the PforR design. Bank Policy—Program-
for-Results Financing (World Bank 2015b) provides for two types of exclusions
intended to reduce the risks associated with the instrument: activities that involve
procurement of goods, works, and services under high-value contracts above certain
thresholds based on the type of procurement and the level of fiduciary risk, and
those with potentially significant and irreversible adverse impacts on the
environment or affected people.

IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
HIGH-VALUE PROCUREMENTS
The exclusion of high-value procurement has not been a major obstacle in the PforRs
reviewed, though it has led to the exclusion of certain areas supported by PforRs in
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Uruguay, and Vietnam. The ensuing financing gaps have
stimulated some creative solutions. Thus, in Ethiopia Health, to ensure that there
was no financing of contracts exceeding the PforR thresholds, the IDA credit (and
the associated Health Results Innovation Trust Fund grant) went into a subaccount
within the MDG Performance Fund. This still allowed IDA funds to be harmonized
with the rest of the Performance Fund activities, excluding high-value contracts. The
processes for procurement, reporting, audits, and anti-corruption are the same for
all donors. (The Bangladesh case is described in chapter 3.)

HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES
All of the PforRs reviewed have appropriately excluded high-risk environmental
and social risk activities. In one case, however, the interpretation of this policy
requirement appears to have been overly cautious, to the extent of having an impact
on the achievement of the PDO. For the India Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Program (World Bank 2014a), the ex-ante exclusion of “schemes involving
highly polluted water sources” (p. 6) without comparison of treatment options with
alternative raw water sources may needlessly foreclose the most feasible option in
specific locations. It thus appears to be at variance with the operation’s PDO “to
improve access to quality and sustainable services in peri-urban villages and in
water-stressed and water-quality affected areas” (p. vii).

In a few other cases, an excessively risk-averse application of this exclusion has
significantly reduced the scope of the PforRs in relation to the supported
government programs and the attendant challenges and opportunities associated
with strengthening the programs’ systems. For example, the Uganda Municipal
Development Program excludes water treatment plants and sanitary landfills, and
the Ethiopia Local Government Program excludes roadways outside existing rights-
of-way. All projects exclude any investments with potential impacts on natural
habitats or cultural areas. This raises the concern of how such small- and medium-
scale investments, which are integral to the investment programs of a variety of
sectors, will be handled if they are not subject to the oversight associated with Bank
involvement. In addition, as already noted in the Two-Year Review, the exclusion of
potentially significant environmental and social impacts causes differences between
PforRs and the government programs they support (World Bank 2015e, p 15).

The observed overly cautious interpretation of the high environmental and social risk
exclusion detracts from the integrity of the PforRs and may represent a missed

                                            IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
opportunity to strengthen country systems. While the exclusion of high risks is in line
with the Bank Policy on Program-for-Results Financing (World Bank 2015b), IEG’s
review has found that the substantial and moderate risks encountered throughout the
PforR portfolio were being diligently supervised by the Bank teams and were
reasonably well managed by the country systems. On this basis, it would seem
appropriate for PforRs to include the full range of what would be classified as
Category B projects under the IPF safeguards, rather than excluding subprojects
perceived to be at the riskier end of the Category B spectrum. This would mean the
inclusion of all small- and medium-scale investments that are integral to the
supported programs and are likely to cause mostly local and short-term negative
environmental and social impacts for which effective mitigation measures are readily
available. An implication would be that the PforRs would need to strengthen, where
necessary, the capacity of the country systems to enable them to handle all the
investments in the government program in an environmentally and socially sound
manner, rather than creating a two-track system, which can undermine the integrity
of the program and of the country systems.


Risk Management Implementation Experience
Based on the ISRs, the integrated risk management framework used for the PforR
portfolio appears to be working reasonably well. A comparison of the five risk
ratings in the PAD—technical, fiduciary, environment and social, DLI, and overall—
with those in the latest ISRs for the 12 projects visited by IEG (in 8 countries) found
that the ratings had been changed in only 3 projects, involving 6 of a total of 60
ratings. These ratings had been lowered in three cases and raised in another three.
This impression of stability is consistent with the ISR’s reporting that the
implementation of the numerous program risk management measures associated
with these PforRs—between 5 and 13 for every project—was “in progress” in every
case, except for 2 that had been delayed and 4 that had been completed.

MANAGEMENT OF FIDUCIARY RISKS
Overall, IEG country visits found the implementation of fiduciary risk management
to have been “in progress,” but often subject to delays. While Bank supervision
missions have been actively dealing with these delays and other shortcomings, and
their actions are promising, it is still too early to establish their final results. Thus, for
the Ethiopia Health Project, the ISRs have reported an improvement in the
transparency of the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA), as
demonstrated by the launch of the PFSA website, as well its disclosure of agreed
procurement information and the completion of pending audits that had been
delayed since December 31, 2013. Given the multiple requests for extensions, the


                                                                                            41
CHAPTER 4
IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
task team has diligently followed up with the PFSA management to identify the root
causes of the delays, and jointly identified areas of weakness in the capacity of the
PFSA to undertake sound financial management and procurement processes. For the
Rwanda Agriculture Project, the first ISR raised a number of issues about the
adequacy of the agricultural expenditure framework (level, allocation priorities,
management arrangements, and effectiveness at both the national and subnational
levels), and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the funding modality to help
ensure strong alignment and harmonization of the funding being provided by a
multiplicity of development partners and to help leverage expanded private sector
financing. The Bank had requested that the borrower prepare an operational action
plan to address these issues, but its implementation is still under way.

MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISKS
The ISRs generally report that the environmental and social risk management
measures are “in progress,” but provide little information on actual environmental
and social effects. This is surprising, since environmental and social risks have been
rated as moderate or substantial in most PforRs, and the monitoring of impacts is an
essential element of the environmental and social risk management framework. This
finding parallels that of IEG’s recent review, Managing Environmental and Social Risks
in Development Policy Financing (IEG 2015c), which also found that there is no formal
system in place in the Bank to monitor and report on the actual environmental and
social effects of DPFs.

However, during its country visits, IEG found that the environmental and social
risks were being diligently supervised by the Bank teams and generally
implemented as expected. No serious issues were anticipated, especially since the
programs had excluded investments in environmentally sensitive areas and
generally minimized land acquisition. In the few instances (Vietnam and Brazil)
where the programs involved indigenous peoples, adequate provisions for their
culturally sensitive participation had been addressed through the PAP and
supported by technical assistance.

Even so, IEG’s field visits provided an understanding of important challenges faced
in the adequate implementation of the PforR policy requirements. One recurrent
challenge relates to the adequacy of the program systems, which most ESSAs have
described as adequate from a legal and policy perspective, but as stretched and
uneven in terms of implementation capacity. IEG found that this situation continued
for the programs visited. While technical assistance has been provided in every case
to prepare environmental and social guidelines and train program staff to
implement them, the missions found no indications that the resource and staffing
shortages diagnosed in the ESSA had been addressed. Thus, the enforcement of

                                                                                      CHAPTER 4
                                             IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
environmental requirements and monitoring of environmental performance
continued to be sporadic and uneven.

Another recurrent challenge relates to the adequacy of compensation for land
acquisition. Overall, IEG missions found that the programs that required land
acquisition had supported the preparation of the land acquisition and resettlement
guidelines and trained staff to implement them in conformity with Bank
requirements. Verifying the adequacy of land compensation, however, remains a
difficult challenge, as illustrated by the Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban
Development Program (box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. Compensation for Land Acquisition—Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban
 Development Program
 In this program, the PAP supports “independent market-based assessments” of land
 prices. IEG was informed that such assessments had arrived at prices that were 2–5
 percent higher than established government guidelines, but that it was difficult to
 establish market prices because of the common practice of underreporting the actual
 transaction prices in the official records to minimize land transfer taxes. A possible
 indication of the distortion created by this underreporting and underassessment is that
 out of the 40+ households that needed to be relocated for the first investment project in a
 major city, all had accepted the land compensation option in an outlying resettlement
 area, and not a single household chose the cash compensation option that was based on
 the “independent market-based assessment.”

Emerging Findings
The PforR risk management framework has worked largely as intended. Risks
related to PforR operations have generally been well identified and assessed.
Overall, IEG’s findings concur with those of the Two-Year Review (World Bank
2015e), which concluded that the risks associated with PforRs have been reasonably
well identified and assessed, with only a few exceptions. IEG found that most of
these exceptions involved the underrating of risks, particularly those related to
technical, fiduciary, and DLI risks. Environmental and social risks, in contrast, had a
slight tendency to be overrated.

The exclusion of high-risk environmental and social activities has unnecessarily
reduced the scope of several PforRs in relation to government programs. IEG has
concluded that the high-value procurement exclusion has not been a major obstacle
for the achievement of the PDOs. The exclusion of high-risk environmental and


                                                                                               43
CHAPTER 4
IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND MITIGATION OF RISKS
social activities, however, has reduced the scope of the PforRs in relation to the
supported government programs in several cases. This is consistent with the finding
of the Two-Year Review that this exclusion was one of the most important factors
accounting for differences between the scope of the PforRs and the government
programs. In one case (the India Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Program), the exclusion of “schemes involving highly polluted water sources”
appears to be at variance with the operation’s PDO to improve access to quality and
sustainable services (World Bank 2014a).

The management of risks is progressing well, though the reporting system is
inadequate. The PforRs appear to be making good progress with the management of
all kinds of program risks, although the ISRs do not adequately reflect the frequency
of delays, and they provide no information on the environmental and social effects
of the operations. This is surprising, because environmental and social risks have
been rated as moderate or substantial in most PforRs, and the monitoring of impacts
is an essential element of the environmental and social risk management framework.

5. Strengthening National Systems
The potential for strengthening the institutional capacity of national systems is a key
feature of PforRs. As stated in the Board paper (World Bank 2011a), the PforR
focuses on the behavioral and institutional changes that are required to achieve
results and manage associated risks. Hence, strengthening the capacity of national
institutions to implement the program is expected to be a priority for both
preparation and implementation support. This chapter discusses the use of the
PforR instrument to strengthen the countries’ systems for the financial management,
procurement, environmental and social safeguards, and M&E of the supported
programs.


The Identification and Assessment of Capacity-Building Measures
Assessments of technical, fiduciary, and environmental and social systems have
identified numerous measures to strengthen the performance of program systems to
ensure that they achieve the expected results. IEG has reviewed these measures for
the 27 PforR operations in the portfolio and assessed their appropriateness in light of
the gaps identified.

MEASURES FOR STRENGTHENING TECHNICAL CAPACITY
Measures for addressing gaps in technical capacity are largely adequate. This was
the case for all but 1 of the 27 PforR operations assessed. Operations supported
government programs that are well defined and clearly bounded, with adequate
borrower capacity, borrower participation in design and implementation, defined
program management mechanisms, and coordination processes with other
development partners.

Countries are eager to rely on their own financial management systems, including
designation of aid funds as on-budget, aligning with the fiscal calendar, and relying
on existing procedures for budget preparation and execution, intergovernmental
transfers, and audit. Among the advantages to governments of the use of the PforR
instrument, the ability to use and strengthen their own country systems instead of
employing Bank processes is an important one. For example, under the Ethiopia Local
Government Program, urban local governments have achieved targeted budgetary
improvements in capital investment plans and value-for-money audits as measured in
annual performance assessments linked to DLIs. The Kenya Safety Net PforR has
implemented program information systems using agreed standards for internal



                                                                                     45
CHAPTER 5
STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS
payroll controls, making payments electronically using two-factor authentication, and
disbursing to payment-service providers in a timely manner.

In many cases, the PforR approach offered greater accountability, scope, and
flexibility when compared with the earlier Bank operations. This is illustrated by the
example of the Uganda Urban PforR (box 5.1).


 Box 5.1. Support to Municipal Urban Development in Uganda
 The Uganda PforR built on a 10-year period during which three operations implemented
 performance-based disbursements: Local Government 1 and 2 and Municipal
 Government 1. In contrast to these IPFs, the PforR linked specific disbursements to DLIs,
 instead of channeling local development grants based on local government performance
 assessments. Another difference is that the scale of the infrastructure investments
 supported by the PforR was much larger than in the previous operations. A final
 difference is the use of an independent assessment firm to verify performance, rather than
 using the government’s own monitoring processes, which in the previous operations
 proved unreliable and subject to excessive delay.
 Capacity building under the PforR focuses on providing training, essential tools, and
 systems, such as renovated offices and internet access, and the resulting capacity
 improvement is monitored through DLIs. Previous capacity building had focused on
 skills training and certification, but was not monitored through the results frameworks,
 and it was found that the best-trained people would leave. Retention is reportedly much
 better under the new approach, and is enforced by an annual assessment of municipalities
 to ensure that strategic positions are filled. A program support team provides seven
 professional staff to the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Urban Development to help
 manage the program. This was requested by the ministry because of its staffing
 constraints. Staffing levels in the ministry show that only 50 percent of positions are filled,
 and the project budget is bigger than the budget of the ministry itself. This challenge of
 unfilled positions is the same in other institutions.
 Source: World Bank 2013c.



In some cases, the capacity and other system gaps were avoided or mitigated
through the purposive bounding of the PforR versus the government program. The
portion of the program supported by the PforR can be defined in different ways.
Thus, the Croatia Health PforR covers a slice of the government program based on
duration, priorities, and institutions. The Moldova Health PforR covers 5 of the 17
subprograms in the government program that are expected to have the greatest
impact on the achievement of the 2 PforR objectives. In two of the five subprograms,
the PforR further limited or focused its coverage to some specific performance-based
incentives.

                                                                                    CHAPTER 5
                                                               STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS

In a few cases, the institutional capacity measures could have been more clearly
defined. For example, the PAD for the Ethiopia Health MDG’s operation (World
Bank 2013b) points to the weak audit capacity of the Pharmaceutical Fund and
Supply Agency and aims to have adequate professionally qualified and trained staff
for internal audit. It also targeted completion of pending audits at that agency by
December 2013. As of February 2016, these issues still had not been addressed,
although progress was being made. The India Teacher Effectiveness PAD (World
Bank 2015d) does not discuss the capacity of the various entities, except to note that
the academic authority for all teacher education programs and the nodal agencies
for training delivery are in a “deplorable state of disrepair” (p. 27). The specific gaps
and appropriate mitigation measures could have been elaborated.

 Box 5.2. Mozambique Public Financial Management Capacity Support
 The Mozambique PforR has a number of innovative features in capacity support. The
 program has an allocation of $8 million for capacity development. This support is
 implemented by the government, not a separate component executed by the Bank or
 other donors, as in some other PforRs. The program includes a substantial emphasis on
 change management, which is appropriate. An innovative approach, for Mozambique,
 uses a system of 5 coaches (recruited internationally) and 22 national facilitators. This is
 only mentioned briefly in the PAD, though it is discussed in detail in the aide-memoires
 of February and June 2015. A related innovation is the use of the rapid results initiative,
 not mentioned at all in the PAD, but briefly discussed in the aide-memoires, drawing on
 examples from Kenya and Madagascar. Both innovations are supported by a Bank team
 member with special background and interest in such efforts. A World Bank-managed
 trust fund has also provided support for the coaches and facilitators to participate in a
 training workshop in Accra on rapid results initiatives. It will be interesting to see how
 this will work out—clearly there are teething problems and a widespread expectation by
 many stakeholders, particularly in the provinces, that coaching should be the same as
 technical assistance by experts. A challenge for coaching is also that government health
 technical staff are stretched thin and face rapid turnover, because government staff are
 recruited by private health clinics and nongovernmental organizations. The recent
 introduction of the rapid results initiative concept seems to represent a hope that results
 can be fast-tracked after a long start-up delay.
 It is not clear on what basis it was determined that the coaching and technical assistance
 provided under the program and by other donors will be sufficient. The concept for
 coaches and facilitators originated from the design facilitation supported by a former
 Bank staff member and was taken onboard by the government.


MEASURES FOR STRENGTHENING FIDUCIARY SYSTEMS
In almost all cases, the measures for strengthening fiduciary systems were adequate.
The exception is Nepal, which Transparency International has ranked as the second-
most corrupt country in South Asia, and 139th out of 183 countries surveyed


                                                                                                47
CHAPTER 5
STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS
worldwide. This would seem to call for intensive anti-corruption measures, such as
arrangements for random post-audits, on-site field verification of the quality and
quantity of outputs and appropriateness of unit costs, and provision for rigorous
follow-up of audit reports and management letters, including audit committees with
external stakeholders, such as civil society, professional organizations, and
government representatives from outside the project entity. There is not enough
attention to such measures in the PAD or the Institutional Fiduciary Assessment.

In many cases, addressing fiduciary capacity gaps required the design of innovative
features, as illustrated by the Mozambique PFM operation in box 5.2.


In several cases, the measures to strengthen fiduciary systems drew from earlier
projects and other donor support. This was the case in the Rwanda PFM PforR,
where a key constraint is the high turnover of procurement officers. The Bank’s
earlier Public Sector Capacity Building Project had worked to address this issue,
which is pervasive across professional positions in the public sector. But despite
extensive support provided by that operation, and related capacity-building
operations funded by other donors, the problem has persisted. The PAD correctly
points out that better incentives for attracting, promoting, and retaining staff are
needed to reduce high (by regional standards) vacancy and turnover rates. It was
apparently awkward to address this issue through the PforR, but the PFM fund
donors are addressing it through other support.

Institutional strengthening may be supported by DLIs, as in Tanzania Education,
where the six DLIs are institutional (five in number, 80 percent by amounts) —
completion of foundational activities, resource flows, annual reporting, deployment
of teachers across districts, and schools receiving incentive grants. The PDO in the
Rwanda PFM is itself institutional—to enhance the country’s public financial
management and statistics systems to improve transparency and accountability in
the use of public funds, revenue mobilization, and the quality and accessibility of
development data for decision making.

In a few cases, fiduciary system gaps are identified in the assessments, but it is not
clear how they are all being addressed. For example, the India Maharashtra Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (World Bank
2014b) points out a challenge: lack of comprehensive instructions for all steps of the
procurement process, with rules and guidelines spread across many documents, and
inadequate rules for service procurement. To address these, it supports the action:
“Compile the rules and procedures on procurement, including for selection of
consultant services, into a comprehensive procurement manual for the RWSS [rural

                                                                               CHAPTER 5
                                                          STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS

water supply and sanitation] sector and adopt it” (World Bank 2014b, p. 15), but
other challenges are pointed out without corresponding proposed actions, such as
possible entry barriers for contractors created by mandatory registration
requirements. Later information could indicate that such matters had been
addressed in a separate document.

MEASURES FOR STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
The provisions for strengthening the programs’ environmental and social systems
were largely reasonable. The most frequent gaps related to limited or vaguely
specified inclusions in the PAPs of capacity-strengthening measures recommended
in the assessments and, in some cases, inadequate support for the PAP in the
technical assistance provisions of the programs. For example, the ESSA of the
Uruguay Road Program identified a need for strengthened environmental
management and supervision and recommended seven actions to address this gap,
but only two of these were included in the PAP. Similarly, the PAP for the Mexico
Oaxaca Rural Water and Sanitation Program did not mention any provision for
several of the actions that the ESSA identified as required to address the substantial
social risks of the program. It is possible in these and other cases that such actions
have been covered through other means, but the lack of any explicit mention offers
little assurance that they will be adequately addressed and implemented.

MEASURES FOR STRENGTHENING MONITORING AND EVALUATION
PforRs have a greater focus than other Bank operations on reviewing progress on
achievement of results through M&E. This follows from the requirement to base
PforR disbursements on the achievement of monitorable indicators, rather than
inputs, confirmed through specific and transparent verification protocols. Strong
M&E is also important in enabling the PforRs to adhere over time to the theory of
change underpinning this instrument, as set out in chapter 2.

Over 40 percent of the PforR portfolio includes program support for what the PADs
describe as impact evaluations. (IEG did not set out to review the quality of the
proposed evaluation designs.) For example, the India Teacher Effectiveness PforR
includes capacity-building and systems-strengthening activities. It also provides
support for monitoring, reporting, and impact evaluation studies on teacher
performance, which will track gains emerging from program interventions. Nigeria
Health includes two relevant DLIs: lagging states will strengthen their maternal,
neonatal, and child health as part of an impact evaluation. This evaluation will test
the effectiveness of results-based disbursements to states and provide some
evidence on whether improvements in performance can be attributed to the PforR.
Another DLI is testing new approaches to improving the delivery of services by


                                                                                     49
CHAPTER 5
STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS
nonstate actors. All these innovations would be subjected to rigorous evaluations
(including impact evaluations where practical). For Tanzania Education, evaluations
will be carried out for selected activities of the program. For selected innovative
interventions, the government, with the support of the World Bank and the
government of Norway, plans to carry out a rigorous impact evaluation of the
results-based financing, using an experimental design.

M&E processes vary across the portfolio. Many PforRs use independent monitoring
agents contracted to verify performance of DLIs prior to disbursement. For example,
the Bangladesh VAT Improvement PforR allocates 4 percent of program expenditure
for verification activities, monitoring and reporting work, and capacity-building
efforts associated with strengthening government systems, including technical
capacity support for the Anti-Corruption Commission, to be coordinated by the
Economic Resources Division. The involvement of the Economic Resources Division,
which is a separate organization from the client, the National Revenue Board, is
thought to make the process more independent and objective than if the client were
responsible. In addition, the project office has developed a tracking system for
progress on each DLI and component.


Links with IPFs
Some PforRs have evolved from operations using other instruments. IEG found that
four programs (Brazil Ceará Strengthening Service Delivery for Growth, Poverty
Reduction, and Environmental Sustainability; Ethiopia Second Urban Local
Government Development Program; Rwanda Transformation of Agriculture Sector
Program Phase 3; and Vietnam Results-Based Rural Water and Sanitation under the
National Target Program) had evolved from previous IPF operations that
contributed to program design and institutional capacity. Hence, in Brazil, the PforR
had many similarities with the predecessor sectorwide approaches (SWAPs),
including the use of DLIs and country systems, with exceptions for procurement
above threshold amounts. However, the PforR has stronger verification processes
and greater focus on improving country systems through the use of the PAPs. The
client also found greater opportunities for cross-sectoral coordination in the PforR,
in part because the SWAPs had expenditure rules that led the sectors to focus on
their own programs. The PforR was generally perceived to be a more flexible
instrument.

Traditional IPF operations (Ethiopia) and Adaptable Program Loans (APLs)
(Rwanda and Vietnam) contributed to the development of the programs supported
by the PforRs. A common characteristic of these predecessor operations was the

                                                       STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS

introduction of new institutional arrangements, such as the establishment of RWSS
enterprises in Vietnam and the use of performance-based intergovernmental transfer
mechanisms in Ethiopia. Capacity building was also a major focus of the IPF
operations, especially where the institutions were weak, as in Rwanda, where the
first of three Rural Sector Support Project APLs focused on establishing basic
institutional and technical capacities. The IPF instrument provided hands-on
support in such cases, while APLs provided flexibility when introducing or testing
new institutional arrangements and approaches. As the programs became better
defined, institutional capacity was strengthened, and program/country systems
were more firmly in place, which made the risks of the use of the PforR instrument
manageable. It is unclear whether the PforR would have been an appropriate
instrument for the programs supported by predecessor operations, with the possible
exception of the later programs in the Rwanda APL series, which had a good record
of meeting targeted results.


Links with Development Partners and Technical Assistance
Technical assistance provided by development partners made an essential
contribution in several cases. For Morocco Human Development, the main external
partner is the European Union (EU). Both the Bank and the EU supported the first
phase of this program (which the Bank supported through an IPL-financed SWAP).
The EU now finances targeted technical assistance for the program as well as direct
support to the general budget against certain indicators (some are similar to or the
same as those used by the Bank, others are different) with a focus on rural areas.
There are no formal cofinancing agreements between the Bank and the EU, but there
is nevertheless effective coordination between the two entities, with joint missions
and partially identical monitoring and results indicators.

For the two PforR operations in Rwanda, technical assistance is provided by other
donors through a variety of support interventions in parallel with the PforRs. This
support would probably have gone ahead largely or fully, even without the PforRs,
but several donors said that the Bank’s operations help to provide an overall
envelope that may also strengthen the impact of their support. Some
complementarity was also found for the Bangladesh VAT PforR. In that case, a
number of partners had important roles at an early stage, including in the
preparation of the overall Tax Administration Modernization Plan. There was,
however, a lack of consultation between the Bank (regarding the VAT) and the ADB
(regarding income tax administration) that may have made it more difficult to
achieve use of a common taxpayer numbering system that is linked to a national
identification number across income tax, VAT, and customs.

STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS

Implementation Experience with Capacity-Building Measures
Overall, IEG country visits found the implementation of capacity-building measures
to be progressing reasonably well, although frequently subject to delays. For
example, under the Ethiopia Local Government Program, urban local governments
have achieved targeted fiduciary improvements in capital investment plans and
value-for-money audits as measured in annual performance assessments linked to
DLIs. The Kenya Safety Net PforR has implemented program information systems
using agreed standards for internal payroll controls, making payments electronically
using two-factor authentication, and disbursing to payment-service providers in a
timely manner. Eight of the 12 actions had satisfactory progress, but an important
action for targeting and enrollment of beneficiaries was substantially delayed.

IEG found very few cases where PforR capacity-building impacts extended beyond
the scope of the programs financed. This is not surprising, given the program focus
of these operations and the pervasive budget and staff constraints on both the Bank
and the borrower. An exception was the Morocco Human Development Program,
which included significant investments in strengthening the fiduciary systems at the
local level to address shortcomings identified during an earlier Bank project.
Following up on the initial results of these measures, the government is embarking
on a reform to introduce results-based budgeting in five additional ministries (box
5.3).


 Box 5.3. Morocco National Initiative for Human Development (INDH2)
 INDH2, with the support of the PforR, has made significant investments in strengthening
 the fiduciary system at the local level to address shortcomings identified during the first
 phase of INDH. Audit reports from the first phase of INDH (supported through an IPF)
 found considerable shortcomings in financial management and procurement in
 subprojects implemented by municipalities and by associations or nongovernmental
 organizations. This was ascribed to capacity constraints. As part of the INDH2 PforR,
 detailed fiduciary guidelines were developed and training in their use was conducted in
 all participating provinces and municipalities.
 By all accounts, including those of the auditors, there were more shortcomings during
 INDH1, when municipalities were asked to follow a modified local system to adhere to
 Bank rules, which created substantial confusion and required double bookkeeping.
 The same fiduciary system is applied to all INDH subprograms and subprojects, regardless
 of whether they receive PforR financing (PforR supports three out of five programs and its
 financial contribution of $300 million is small compared with overall program costs of $2.1
 billion). Thus, any improvements introduced to this point have a significantly greater reach
 than they would have had were Bank procedures only applied to its financing of $300
 million and limited project counterpart funds under a traditional IPF project. Under INDH,

                                                                                     CHAPTER 5
                                                                STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS

 efforts also have been made to strengthen and expand the grievance system. It was not
 possible for the mission to ascertain how well this system is functioning.
 Morocco is embarking on a reform to introduce results-based budgeting over the next
 several years, with a pilot starting in five ministries in 2016. While the PforR operation is a
 special initiative and has somewhat simplified procedures, officials in the Ministry of
 Finance and Ministry of General Affairs (the Bank’s main counterpart) indicated that the
 work with the Bank under the INDH PforR was a useful prelude to the introduction of
 results-based budgeting in line agencies.


The strengthening of monitoring and verification has yielded improved verification.
In the Uganda Urban PforR, DLI verification for previous non-PforR operations in
the sector was done by the Inspection Office in Ministry. However, this verification
was reportedly not rigorous. Under the PforR, DLI verification is done by an
independent firm, and the procurement of the firm is carefully monitored by the
Bank; in one case the bidding was redone because of questions raised. The
verification report builds on findings of the auditor-general, and there are spot
checks by the Bank team before the report is finalized. The result is rigorous
verification of DLIs.

But there can also be side effects to strengthening monitoring and verification. The
Mozambique PFM PforR uses the government’s supreme audit authority, the
Tribunal Administrativo, for the verification of most DLIs. Although the work of
this unit is highly regarded, it is severely understaffed in relation to its many tasks.
To address this, the unit has been awarded two capacity-building grants from the
PforR. However, the use of a public institution in this case adds to the work burdens
of an already stretched entity.


Emerging Findings
The identification and assessment of measures to strengthen the capacity and
performance of program systems has been mostly satisfactory. In many cases, the
PforR approach offered greater scope and flexibility compared with earlier Bank
operations, stimulating the design of innovative features. In other cases, the
measures to strengthen program systems drew from earlier projects and the support
of donor partners. In some cases, the capacity and other system gaps were avoided
or mitigated through the purposive focusing of PforRs within the government
programs. In a few cases, the system capacity gaps were identified in the
assessments, but the measures to address them were not clearly defined or were left
undefined.

CHAPTER 5
STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SYSTEMS
Based on IEG’s country visits, it can be concluded that the implementation of
capacity-building measures is progressing reasonably well, although it is subject to
frequent delays. In most cases, the capacity-building measures were focused on the
program systems, as appropriate. In a few cases, the strengthening of program
systems is being expanded to the whole country. Substantial and sustained capacity
improvements will take time, however, often exceeding the duration of a single
PforR program.




54
6. Findings and Recommendations
Main Findings
Since its launch in 2012, the Bank has rolled out the PforR instrument gradually,
seeking a balance between responding to potentially strong client demand (and
interest among Bank staff) and learning from implementation experience. As of
March 31, 2016, the Board had approved 39 PforR operations, providing $9.5 billion
of Bank financing to support a total of $49.9 billion in government programs, with a
pipeline of 21 operations under preparation. There are ongoing PforR operations in
all Bank Regions, and they cover most of the sectors in which the Bank has
traditionally been active.

The PforR instrument is an increasingly important lending vehicle for the Bank.
Overall, the structure of the Bank’s assessments of PforRs—technical, fiduciary, and
environmental and social—has proven to be appropriate, and the assessments have
generally been credible and comprehensive. The results frameworks, DLIs, and
PAPs are often reasonably coherent, and risks related to PforR operations have
generally been well identified and assessed. Nevertheless, there are areas in need of
improvement when it comes to designing the programs to achieve results and to the
monitoring and reporting systems.

The PforR instrument was envisioned to help focus more on results than other
instruments, as well as to help strengthen country systems and induce further
alignment/harmonization among donors. Because none of the PforR programs has
yet closed, it is too early to draw any definite conclusions about whether the
instrument is doing a better job of achieving these objectives than alternative
approaches. Nevertheless, some insights can be derived from the early design and
implementation experience.

While the programs do focus on results more explicitly than other instruments
through the introduction of DLIs, these indicators are often—but not always—well
integrated with the results frameworks. And while the results frameworks are often
reasonably coherent, the PDOs are rarely at the outcome level, and explanations of
how the PforR objectives relate to the longer-term objectives of the supported
government programs are largely absent from the PADs. To ensure a greater
likelihood of ultimately achieving the desired development results, more consistent
linking of the DLIs to the results frameworks and the longer-term objectives of the
program will be required. Box 6.1 sets out some key aspects that should be
considered in PforR ex-post completion reports.


                                                                                   55
CHAPTER 6
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

 Box 6.1. Key Aspects for PforR Ex-Post Completion Reports
 No PforR program has reached its closing date, but at such time it would be important for
 staff to have access to a format for the Implementation Completion Reports. Presumably,
 this format would follow the existing formats for IPF completion reports, but with
 emphasis on the special features of PforRs, as discussed in this evaluation report. Areas of
 special emphasis should include the following:
    The assessment of results against the stated objectives and all the specific indicators in
     the results frameworks
    Longer-term prospects for the supported programs, including the prospects for
     eventual outcomes and the sustainability of the results achieved during the PforR
     period
    Assessment of the DLIs and the progress of disbursements
    Applicability and progress of the PAP as a whole and of all of the individual PAP
     items
    The role of the PforR in donor cooperation and resource mobilization
    Aspects of the PforR operation that may have encouraged or discouraged the
     achievement of sustainable results
    Quality and usefulness of the Bank’s work, including for the up-front assessments and
     during implementation
    Lessons going forward.


The DLIs are designed with the two main objectives: to be triggers for
disbursements, with an inherent need for predictability, and to provide incentives
for performance—stretch targets. In many cases the DLIs are linked to very small
shares of total program disbursements, or to routine and repetitive actions, rather
than key activities to achieve PDOs. This points to an inherent tendency to shift the
balance toward the disbursement objective.

IEG finds that both ownership and partnership are addressed well in the Bank’s
program documents, and the field visits found a considerable degree of government
ownership of the programs under implementation. It also found that the focus of
PforRs on programs rather than investments has been helpful in promoting
coordination among government agencies that may have had little incentive to work
together. However, there is no evidence yet that the instrument has encouraged
much additional financing by other donors, let alone any broader use of the
strengthened country systems.

Capacity building is an important part of the programs, but specific goals could
have been defined more clearly in some cases, and there have been frequent delays
in the implementation of capacity-building programs.

                                                                            CHAPTER 6
                                                          FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Bank’s average costs for the preparation of the new programs have been similar
to those of other IPF operations, with significant variations between programs, while
average Bank implementation costs have been significantly higher than for IPF
operations. There may be increased positive externalities/public good aspects from
strengthened country systems. Overall, however, there is not yet sufficient evidence
to derive any conclusions about the overall efficiency of PforRs.

Most of the participating borrowers appreciate the PforRs. For the early operations,
Bank teams often were the driving force for the new instrument, but governments
came to appreciate the PforR approach quite quickly. They particularly value the
instrument’s reliance on country systems. Among the advantages to governments,
the ability to avoid the use of normal Bank procurement processes stands out.
Counterparts also emphasized the importance of the focus on programmatic results
that are aligned with the government’s own strategy and longer-term programs.
They spoke positively about the potential impact over time on programs supported
by PforRs, including the impact of the almost constant interactions with the Bank
teams. For some decentralized programs, as in Vietnam, participants also noted the
motivational impact of the focus on results, including the DLIs. Finally, some
governments (in particular, countries such as Ethiopia and Rwanda) are also
positively disposed toward the PforR instrument, because they welcome what they
see as the predictability and general nature of disbursements under PforRs, without
policy conditionalities as prior actions.

One exception to the use of country systems is the requirement to use the Bank’s
ACG, which was viewed by borrowers in Brazil, India, Morocco, and Uruguay as
limiting the scope of PforR operations. The guidelines have been modified in
accordance with the findings of the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e) to be
clearer about their application to PforR operations and to address these concerns,
but it is too early to determine the result. These modifications do not change the
Bank’s substantive rights under the current ACG. Although referred to as
“guidance,” the ACG must be followed in accordance with the provisions in the
legal documents.

The high-value procurement exclusion and adherence to the ACG are supported by
IEG findings given the weaknesses in country systems documented in PforR
fiduciary assessments. Corruption can be an issue in the PforR countries assessed,
and the special provisions of the Bank’s ACG are needed to provide assurance to
key shareholders, while also acknowledging that combating corruption is primarily
the sovereign responsibility of the borrower.

CHAPTER 6
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Approved PforR operations are largely on track in relation to the PAD expectations.
As of March 31, 2016, 32 of the 39 approved operations had become effective. Bank
disbursements were on track relative to expectations, with annual disbursements
increasing from $108 million in fiscal 2013 to $479 million in fiscal 2015, and $1,056
million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. Overall, implementation is also
broadly on track, with ISR performance ratings of satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory and stable risk ratings.

The Bank’s PforR directive, procedures, and processes have been working
reasonably well. This was the conclusion of IEG’s review of the 27 PforRs approved
through the end of fiscal 2015. IEG has also found that, for the most part, program
systems have provided reasonable assurance that the funds will be used for their
intended purpose. While the initial PforR operation in a country has generally taken
time, and has been quite expensive to prepare, follow-up operations in the same
country tend to have lower costs as the Bank and counterparts move up the learning
curve.

While fiduciary assessments are largely well prepared, a shortcoming is the lack of
details on the costing methodologies used by the government for the programs
being supported. Most PforR operations seem to base their costing on that of the
underlying government program, but with little or no detail on the methodology
used.

At the same time, while IEG found during its country visits that the programs’
fiduciary policies and environmental and social systems were being implemented
largely as expected, there were few indications that they had yet been effective in
addressing systemic weaknesses affecting national systems, such as budget and staff
constraints. Such changes can take longer than these programs have been in place,
which could explain why there are only a few examples of institutional improvements
under PforRs that are having broader impacts within a government. It is also clear
that this instrument’s focus on programs may lessen the potential for addressing
cross-cutting policy issues.

IEG found that the PAPs have tended to increase in scope. The PforR guidelines state
that a PAP should be selective. It should focus on four or five areas, with a few actions
in each, as needed, to improve the technical, organizational, and management
dimensions of the program; enhance the capacity and performance of the
implementing agencies; and mitigate risk. As discussed in chapter 2, IEG found that
most of the PAPs were adequately designed, but some have too many actions—49 in
one case. It is likely that such a proliferation of actions will dilute the possible impact
of the individual PAP items. There are also PADs that do not provide a clear basis for

                                                                                CHAPTER 6
                                                             FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
inclusion of actions in the PAPs, and no articulation of the inevitable trade-offs
necessary to identify the most critical or key actions from the long lists emerging from
the technical, fiduciary, and environmental and social assessments.

The implementation of PAP actions has been substantially delayed in many cases,
which sometimes has had important implications for the timely achievement of the
programs’ results. Also, in both the country monitoring processes and some aide-
memoires, there is a tendency to focus on the DLIs, with less systematic attention to the
various PAP items and the indicators in the results frameworks. There is also very little
information on the environmental and social effects of the operations in the Bank’s
portfolio monitoring system—this material is mainly found in the ISRs. This is
surprising, since environmental and social risks have been rated as moderate or
substantial in most PforRs, and given the essential role of monitoring for the
environmental and social management framework and the important place of
environmental and social risks within the PforRs’ integrated risk management
framework.

Another issue relates to the exclusion of high environmental and social risk
activities. While IEG has concluded that the high-value procurement exclusion has
not been a major obstacle for the achievement of the PDOs, the allowable exclusion
of high environmental and social risk activities has at times been interpreted in an
overly cautious manner that has led to the PforRs’ avoidance of substantial and
moderate risk investments (akin to Category B investments in the IPF safeguards)
that would normally be integral to the supported programs. As discussed in chapter
4, and noted in the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), this exclusion has
significantly reduced the scope of several PforRs in relation to that of the supported
government programs, and this raises a concern of how such investments will be
handled if they are not subject to the oversight associated with Bank involvement.

Political economy constraints are behind many of the issues addressed by DLIs and
PAPs, but are rarely discussed directly. Any critical analysis tends to address only
low-level issues. However, it should be emphasized that interviews with team
members during IEG missions confirm their awareness of such issues. The lack of
published analysis is reportedly because of the sensitivity of this area for borrower
governments. The Systematic Operations Risk-rating Tool, introduced for PforR
operations in January 2016, measures political and governance risk as one of nine
risk categories. Another category measures the related aspect of institutional-
capacity risk. The use of this new tool is likely to address the political economy
challenges raised in this report.




                                                                                       59
CHAPTER 6
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Investing resources up front to ensure that task teams fully understand the
mechanisms of PforR can help overcome the initially steep learning curve. In Ethiopia,
the first operation was the most difficult and costly to prepare. Both sides are now
very comfortable with the instrument, and the cost of subsequent PforRs seems to be
coming down, but the instrument is unlikely become advantageous for the Bank on
cost grounds. Task team leaders of operations that are to be financed through a PforR
need to clearly understand the instrument and be able to explain it to their
counterparts (line agencies) and to partners early on, so that they can make an
informed decision about whether they want to pursue a PforR operation or use
another instrument. The Bank needs to invest sufficient resources up front to ensure
that task teams preparing and supervising PforRs master the instrument.

A long-term program with an existing record is well suited to a PforR, especially if
the Bank already has experience with the program. It is often an advantage if the
programs to be supported have been operational for some time and are expected to
be in operation for the long term. It is also an advantage for the Bank to have
developed familiarity with the programs and their managements through other
vehicles, such as prior operations.

 Effective engagement of fiduciary and safeguards staff throughout the process can
help with identifying and addressing bottlenecks and shortfalls in country systems.
The nature of the PforRs requires intensive Bank staff support during the
implementation stage, as the nature of their engagement changes from ensuring or
checking that implementing agencies adhere to Bank fiduciary and safeguards
requirements to working with the client on how to strengthen capacity to best
employ the country’s own system, to identify bottlenecks and potential shortfalls in
the national system, and to work with counterparts to address these issues during
implementation.


Recommendations
Strengthen the design of the results framework and the DLIs to ensure that the
PAD presents a clear line of sight to developmental results. It is essential to ensure
that all programs produce a well-structured results framework that responds to
borrower priorities through a set of logical, achievable steps, reflecting the PDOs
and the critical role of DLIs. The DLIs serve partially offsetting objectives, including
as triggers for disbursements (requiring predictability) and as incentives for
performance (requiring stretch targets). The trade-offs between these considerations
should be revisited. This could include steps, such as guidance to staff, to ensure
that:

                                                                             CHAPTER 6
                                                           FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
      The results frameworks reflect the development expectations and logic
       (theory of change) of the PforR within the context of the supported
       government programs.
      The PDOs reflect measurable, monitorable development results (that is, at the
       outcome level, which could include institutional strengthening).
      There is a clear explanation of the rationale for the DLI selection and how the
       DLIs help achieve the PDOs.
      The financing associated with each DLI should reflect, among other things,
       the possible incentive effect of the size of such financing.
      The individual DLI targets need to strike the right balance between
       predictability of disbursement and achievement of results.

Strengthen the design and monitoring of the Program Action Plans. The following
is recommended to improve the effectiveness of the PAPs, including to mitigate a
tendency for the proliferation of PAP actions, which is likely to dilute their impact,
and to ensure their adequate consideration during program implementation, when
much attention has tended to focus on the DLIs:

      Focus the PAP on a few key areas where actions are important to enhance the
       capacity and performance of the implementing agencies and to mitigate risks.
      Devote greater attention to the monitoring of PAP implementation, including
       more systematic coverage in the ISRs.
      Provide clearer guidance to task teams on how to address poor
       implementation of PAPs.

Minimize the overly cautious interpretation of the high environmental and social
risks exclusion. To address the overly cautious interpretation of the high
environmental and social risk exclusion:

      Strengthen awareness of the guidance that this exclusion is only intended for
       high-risk activities, and is not intended to exclude substantial- and moderate-
       risk activities, such as small- and medium-scale investments that are integral
       to the supported programs and are likely to cause mostly local and short-term
       negative environmental and social impacts for which effective mitigation
       measures are readily available.

Strengthen the monitoring and reporting of results to cover systematically the
entire results framework, as well as the environmental and social effects of the
projects. To address the tendency in the country monitoring processes and in some
aide-memoires to focus mainly on the DLIs, with less systematic attention to other

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
indicators, PAP items, and environmental and social impacts, all of which should be
important for the achievement of the PDOs, it will be important for the Bank to:

        Ensure that the ISRs and supervision reports systematically cover the entire
         results framework and its supporting elements.
        Ensure that the program systems adequately report on the environmental and
         social effects associated with the implementation of the PforRs, and that the
         Bank has timely access to these reports.

Appendix A. Methodology Note for Review of
the Bank’s PforR Portfolio
Guidance Questionnaire
1.     The design of the guidance questionnaire (template) is based on the 2011
PforR Board paper (World Bank 2011a), Bank Procedure/Operational Policy
(BP/OP) 9.0 Program-for-Results Financing, and the guidance to staff (World Bank
2012c). It also takes into account the findings and issues raised in the 2015 PforR
Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e). The questionnaire will enable panelists to
systematically assess PforR programs using the following measures:

        Likelihood of achieving development objectives (highly likely, likely,
         moderately likely, moderately unlikely, unlikely, highly unlikely)
        Integrated risk rating (high, substantial, medium, low).

2.    In addition, the following key risk categories will be rated (low, medium,
substantial, high):

        Operating environment risks
        Country risk (the report will identify which were the main factors
         contributing to country risk—for example, governance, macroeconomic,
         security, and the like)
        Stakeholder risk (such as vested interests).

3.       Program risks:

        Technical risk (program design and governance, institutional capacity,
         sustainability, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements and
         capacity)
        Fiduciary risk (program fiduciary system and performance monitoring,
         including audit arrangements and capacity)
        Environmental and social risk (potential environmental and social impacts
         and ability of program systems to manage these)
        Disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) risk (results framework, selection of
         DLIs, and verification protocols)
        Other risks (to be identified by reviewers).

4.    The above ratings for likelihood of achieving development objectives and
various risks will be based on information available at the time of the review and


                                                                                     63

will be informed by the a more detailed assessment of various program components
across the following dimensions, with governance as a cross-cutting theme:

        Strategic relevance
        Technical aspects
        Fiduciary and fraud and corruption aspects
        Environment and social aspects
        Risk assessment
        Program implementation (for programs that are in the implementation stage).

5.     An important part of the program review is an assessment of the interplay
between the program and its operating environment—for example, the program’s
environment and social systems versus the national systems. The main dimensions
or sections of the Guidance Questionnaire are discussed below. The questionnaire is
attached.

6.     Strategic relevance. This dimension assesses the strategic relevance of the
program from the perspectives of the government, as well as Bank corporate and
relevant Global Practice priorities. The case for government action or intervention is
also examined in this dimension. The program contribution to partnership
coordination is assessed as well. Borrower ownership is also reviewed. For
programs under implementation, there is more evidence of the degree of borrower
ownership and commitment (see also box 1.3 of the PforR Guidance Notes [World
Bank 2012c] for illustrative indicators for assessing borrower commitment), based on
implementation experience. Finally, the value added by the Bank will be reviewed.

7.     Technical aspects. This dimension assesses the technical soundness of the
program—its structure, implementation arrangements, results framework, M&E
framework, and capacity to implement and monitor the program. This dimension
also includes an assessment of the economic evaluation of the program; the quality
of the DLIs and the associated verification protocols; the quality of the Program
Action Plan (PAP); and the appropriateness of the program conditionalities and the
technical risk rating. The main sources of information will be the technical
assessment, as well as implementation experience and Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISRs) for programs under implementation.

8.     Fiduciary and fraud and corruption aspects. This dimension assesses the
fiduciary system, including procurement, financial management, compliance with
the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACG), and capacity for implementation and
monitoring. With respect to the ACG, reviewers will use the Bank Guidelines on
Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Program-for-Results Financing

                                                                               APPENDIX A
                                METHODOLOGY NOTE FOR REVIEW OF THE BANK’S PFORR PORTFOLIO
(World Bank 2012a), as well as attachment 1 of the PforR Interim Guidance Notes
(World Bank 2012c). The reviewers will also use actual implementation experience,
where applicable, in assessing this dimension.

9.      Environmental and social aspects. This dimension assesses the program
arrangements for managing environmental and social effects consistent with OP/BP
9.0. Unlike in an investment lending operation, where the client bears full
responsibility for managing all environmental and social consultations with
stakeholders, for PforR, the Bank is responsible for managing the consultation
process for the program-specific environmental and social systems (see attachment
4.4 of the PforR Interim Guidance Notes). The reviewers will also use implementation
experience, where applicable, in assessing this dimension.

10.    Risk assessment. This dimension assesses the appropriateness of the
integrated risk rating and the ratings for various operating environment and
program risks. In addition, the impact on risk to development outcome of various
fiduciary, environment, and social exclusions is assessed.

11.    Program implementation. This dimension assesses the quality of program
implementation for PforR operations that are in the implementation stage.
Reviewers will use supervision documents, including ISRs, as main sources of
information. In assessing program implementation, the reviewers will identify the
various factors contributing to implementation issues, both program-related and
those outside the scope of the program.

12.     Ratings. The reviewers will use a six-point rating scale (highly satisfactory,
satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and
highly unsatisfactory) for the above dimensions. Risk ratings will follow the IEG
scale (low, medium, substantial, high).

Panel of Reviewers
13.    Each PforR operation will be reviewed by a panel consisting of
representatives of the following areas of expertise: (i) the lead reviewer, with
expertise in the relevant Global Practice area; (ii) one specialist to cover fiduciary
aspects, including anti-corruption; and (iii) one specialist to cover environmental
and social aspects. Governance will be a cross-cutting area that will be assessed by
the reviewers.

14.    The lead reviewer will be responsible for the assessment of the operation,
with the specialists providing inputs in their specific areas. The choice of the lead
reviewer for each operation will be dependent on the content of the operation.


                                                                                         65
APPENDIX A
METHODOLOGY NOTE FOR REVIEW OF THE BANK’S PFORR PORTFOLIO
However, the specialist reviewers will cover several operations to ensure
consistency in the assessments.

15.     An IEG staff member or consultant will oversee the portfolio review,
including quality control of the individual assessments and consistency of the basis
for ratings. The IEG staff member or consultant will consolidate the individual PforR
program assessments into a report of findings that will include lessons learned and
recommendations for improving various aspects of the PforR instrument.

16.     The reviewers will have to be familiar with the PforR instrument, guidelines,
and issues, in addition to having extensive operational experience. Reviewers will be
provided with all relevant materials on the PforR instrument, including the PforR
Board reports, BP/OP 9.0 Program-for-Results Financing, Interim Guidance Notes to
Staff on Assessments (World Bank 2012c), and the Bank Guidelines on Preventing and
Combating Fraud and Corruption in Program-for-Results Financing (World Bank 2012a).

Documentation
17.    An IEG staff assistant will provide the relevant documents for the portfolio
review. While most of these are in the Bank system, it may be necessary to get in
touch with the task team for some documents, especially correspondence that may
not have been included in the document system. The main documents are the
following:

        Background documents:
         ◦   Country Assistance Strategy (or similar instrument)
         ◦   Sector Strategy (or similar Global Practice document if available)
         ◦   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (for International Development
             Association [IDA] countries)
         ◦   Relevant economic and sector work (the staff assistant will generate the
             list of economic and sector work done during the past five years, and the
             reviewers will determine which outputs are relevant—for example, Public
             Expenditure Reviews)
         ◦   Operational documents for operations with links to the PforR operations
             (the staff assistant will generate the list of Bank lending operations during
             the past five years, and the reviewers will determine which operational
             documents are relevant)
         ◦   Other documents (such as evaluations) that the reviewers may find
             relevant.

        PforR operational documents

      ◦   Project Information Document
      ◦   Management Decision Meeting minutes
      ◦   Program Appraisal Document
      ◦   Legal agreements
      ◦   Negotiation minutes
      ◦   Technical Assessment
      ◦   Fiduciary Systems Assessment
      ◦   Environmental and Social Systems Assessment
      ◦   Program Action Plan
      ◦   Implementation Support Plan
      ◦   ISRs
      ◦   Audit reports
      ◦   Relevant communications within the Bank and between the Bank and
          borrowers.

Interviews with Management, Staff, Borrower, Stakeholders, and Partners
18.     After a desk review and an initial assessment of the PforR program, the
reviewers will identify the information gaps and determine whether interviewing
specific persons is necessary, specifying the proposed agenda and questions. The
interview can take the form of e-mails, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, or short
questionnaires. A limited number of operational reviews will benefit from a country
visit by a PforR team.

Quality Assurance of PforR Program Assessments
19.    The IEG staff/consultant overseeing the portfolio review will be responsible
for the quality of the assessments. There will be a peer review of the individual
assessments; peer reviewers will be from the set of panelists used for the portfolio
review.

Appendix B. Results-Based Programs before
PforR
1.     The Program-for-Results (PforR) is a new lending instrument introduced in
2012 to complement the development policy financing (DPF) and investment policy
financing (IPF) instruments. The PforR instrument supports government programs
and disburses against results, while the DPF supports policy and institutional reforms
and provides general budget support, and the IPF supports specific projects and
disburses against specific expenditures and transactions. More specifically, the PforR:

      Finances expenditures of specific borrower development programs
      Disburses on the basis of the achievement of key results under such programs
      Uses and strengthens the program systems to provide assurance that
       program funds are used appropriately and that environmental and social
       impacts are adequately addressed by such programs
      Strengthens the institutional capacity necessary for such programs to achieve
       their intended results
      Strengthens partnerships by providing a major opportunity to improve
       coordination among development partners in supporting government
       programs and provides a vehicle for pooling resources of the government,
       development partners, and the Bank.

2.      Certain high-risk activities are excluded from PforR operations: activities that
may have potentially significant and irreversible adverse impacts on the
environment or affected people (activities classified as Category A under IPF) and
activities that involve procurement contracts exceeding specified monetary amounts.

3.     This appendix describes Bank experience with various (non-PforR) IPF
operations that include one or more of the characteristics of the PforR instrument.
The note also covers major initiatives in results-based financing (RBF), specifically
output-based aid (OBA) and government use of RBF approaches in financing public
health expenditures. Finally, the experiences of other development institutions (U.K.
Department for International Development [DFID], the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank [ADB}) are described.

Focus on Results and Development Effectiveness
4.     The Bank has been embarking on various initiatives and reforms to improve
the results focus of Bank strategies and operations. All projects now include results



                                                                                     71
APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks. Sector and country assistance
strategies are now results-based, with monitorable indicators. Bank projects—in
particular, IPF—traditionally have financed inputs, with results (outputs and
outcomes) achieved after the bulk of the financing had been disbursed or at project
completion. But over the past few years, several Bank (non-PforR) IPF operations
have included features that enable or support disbursements against results—a key
feature of RBF. Other development institutions and donor organizations have begun
to use some form of RBF to establish a stronger link between development finance
and results.

5.      One of the key challenges of the RBF approach is how to address the
principal-agent problem to ensure that the agent (the party that undertakes the
activities to be financed) delivers the intended results sought by the principal (the
party that provides the financing). The RBF design would have to include a
mechanism that would align the incentives faced by the two parties. In addition, the
types of risks faced by the parties would be different in an RBF approach—for
example, the agent takes on more of the performance risk (such as financing
program implementation with an expectation of disbursements upon completion),
and the principal would have less control over the agent’s performance.

Output-Based Aid
6.      OBA is a “results-based financing mechanism where service provision is
contracted to a third party, usually a private sector operator, and subsidies (either
one-off, transitional, or continuing) are paid off to the provider after the delivery of
specific outputs” (World Bank 2009, p. i). OBA helps finance the gap between the
cost of the service delivery and the beneficiaries’ ability and willingness to pay user
fees for the service. The 2002 Private Sector Development Strategy (World Bank
2002) introduced and recommended the use of OBA as a means of tapping private
initiative for delivery of basic services to the poor. In 2003, the Global Partnership on
Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) was launched as a Bank-administered donor fund with
a view to mainstreaming OBA in the International Development Association (IDA).1

7.      Under an OBA scheme, the contract or other legal arrangement is the
mechanism through which the output-based disbursement criteria are established (see
figure B.1). Hence, the output has to be well defined and generally under the control
of the service provider. To ensure development effectiveness, the causal chain from
output (such as number of water connections) to the desired outcomes (for example,
reduction in water-borne diseases) and impact (such as improved long-term health)
will have to be robust. An underlying rationale for the OBA scheme (that is, the focus
on outputs instead of outcomes) is that service providers are not willing to be

their control.

                                   OBA reimburses the service provider
                                      after the delivery of outputs


8.      Output verification is a critical part of the OBA scheme. A review found that
the most common way of verifying outputs in OBA projects is to hire independent,
specialized consultants with technical expertise to conduct field visits (Mumssen,
Johannes, and Kumar 2010). The independent verification agent ensures that only
verified outputs are reimbursed by: (a) certifying that the outputs have been
physically delivered and the pre-agreed standards of service have been achieved and
(b) validating the service provider’s reimbursement request (for example, cost
reconciliation). The verification protocol and methodology have to be well designed
and data sources made available in a timely manner.

9.     A Guidance Note for procurement staff for OBA projects was issued in 2008
(World Bank 2008). The note identified different scenarios and actions to facilitate
compliance with the procurement guidelines in the design of two types of OBA
schemes: (a) projects for which there is no existing service provider and (b) projects
for which there is already a service provider. Essentially, for projects where there is
no existing service provider, a selection will be made through a competitive process.



                                                                                                      73
APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
Downstream procurement carried out by the service provider is not subject to
standard procurement post review. For service providers in place but not initially
selected through a competitive process, the incumbent will undertake procurement
based on Bank guidelines.

10.    A key feature of OBA projects is the transfer of risk to service providers.
Under an OBA scheme, the service provider, which prefinances the production of
the output, bears the performance risk; that is, OBA disburses against verified
output, with no financing for implementation (see box B.1). This creates an incentive
for the service provider to minimize cost and complete the output in a timely
manner. In addition, demand risk can be substantial—there may be less demand
than expected for the service. This is a disincentive to the creation of excess capacity,
and an incentive to increase access through demand management.


 Box B.1. Vietnam Rural Water Supply Development Project
 The project objective is to provide access to clean water services through the construction
 of about 75 new water systems in low-income rural communities in 5 provinces. The
 project would provide a $100 subsidy for each household connected, representing about
 80 percent of total connection cost. The East Meets West Foundation (EMWF), an
 international nongovernmental organization operating in Vietnam, is the project
 implementation entity. The Bank, acting as administrator for GPOBA, entered into a grant
 agreement with EMWF.
 Under the project, EMWF would prefinance the construction of about 75 water systems
 over the 3 years by borrowing from commercial banks and foundations. The project would
 disburse 80 percent of the subsidy to EMWF after household connections to water services
 have been realized and independently verified. The remaining 20 percent would be
 disbursed after evidence of satisfactory service delivery for at least six months. The water
 systems would be managed by competitively selected water managers or private operators.
 The project includes a financial management action plan with eight actions, four of which
 were to be completed by project approval. The Bank performed a procurement
 assessment, which recommended that certain procurement be subject to prior review, and
 the remainder subject to post reviews. An Environmental Assessment Framework has
 been prepared in accordance with Bank policy, and an Environmental Management Plan
 was incorporated in the framework.

11.     A review compared the performance of OBA projects with traditional (input-
based) projects with similar objectives (Mumssen, Johannes, and Kumar 2010). Two
findings are worth noting. First, OBA provides a stronger platform from which to
target infrastructure and social services subsidies than do traditional interventions

in these sectors. Eligibility criteria for beneficiary households are usually clearly
defined in OBA, and the output verification process helps provide early evidence
that the OBA schemes are reaching the poor. Second, 85 percent of OBA projects
reviewed achieved or surpassed desired results within or below budget, compared
with 49 percent of traditional projects. Nearly 70 percent of OBA projects were
completed below budget, compared with slightly more than half of the traditional
projects. The disbursement of funds after service delivery created incentives to
deliver outputs in a timely manner. Nonetheless, OBA projects faced several
challenges:

      Access to finance can present a hurdle, resulting in difficulty in shifting
       sufficient performance risk to service providers if the cost of prefinancing the
       outputs would place an undue burden on the provider.
      Capacity to implement and monitor OBA schemes can be limited, notably in
       transaction design and implementation, output monitoring and verification,
       and demand management.
      Some basic institutions and processes that support the development,
       monitoring, and adjustment of contracts should be in place, including
       sufficiently transparent legal and regulatory arrangements (for example, tariff
       setting and adjustment).
      Sustainability of the funding source needs to be addressed, especially in cases
       where ongoing subsidy schemes are required.

Results-Based Financing for Health
12.    RBF2 for health is a “cash payment or non-monetary transfer made to national
or subnational government, manager, provider, payer, or consumer of health
services after predefined results have been attained and verified. Payment is
conditional on measurable actions being undertaken” (Musgrove 2011, p. 1). RBF
encompasses several types of payment for results (see box B.2). By linking financing
to results, RBF shifts emphasis from inputs to outputs and outcomes of health
systems, places more of the performance risk on service providers, and gives them
incentives to organize and deliver the services more efficiently and effectively. On
the demand side, RBF provides payments or transfers to individuals, households, or
communities once a precondition in terms of service use has been met. Conditional
cash transfers (CCTs) and voucher schemes are examples of demand-side RBF
mechanisms.

13.    Through the RBF mechanism, donor agencies, ministries of finance, ministries
of health, and other government or nongovernmental agencies are able to pay
directly for results rather than purchase of inputs. DFID makes a distinction between


                                                                                     75
APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
RBF and results-based aid (RBA).3 In the DFID formulation, RBF uses government
resources in a contractual arrangement between the government and an
implementing agent that specifies results to be achieved in return for payment. RBA
delivers donor or development partner resources to the government through a
contractual arrangement that specifies results to be achieved in return for
disbursements. The first part of this section focuses on the experience with RBF, and
the second part on RBA.


 Box B.2. Glossary of RBF Terms
 Performance-based financing is a form of RBF characterized by three conditions: (a)
 incentives are directed only to providers, not beneficiaries; (b) awards are purely
 financial, with payment by fee for specified services; and (c) payment depends explicitly
 on the degree to which services are of approved quality, as specified by protocols for
 process outcomes.
 Performance-based contracting is a form of RBF that departs from simpler types of
 contracts in setting a fixed price for a desired output by adding a variable component that
 reduces payment for bad performance and increases payment for good performance,
 compared with the standard defined in the basic contract.
 Cash on delivery is a subset of RBF and is a contract where funders and recipients agree
 on mutually desired outcomes—rather than inputs or outputs—and a fixed payment for
 each unit of confirmed progress. The funder uses a hands-off approach. The recipient has
 complete discretion and responsibility for strategies and programs. Progress toward
 outcomes is verified by an independent party.
 Conditional cash transfer describes demand-side programs where the incentives apply
 directly to program beneficiaries rather than to agents delivering services. Results are
 defined by the enrollment of beneficiaries in the program and their compliance with
 required behaviors, such as consuming specific services.

RESULTS-BASED FINANCING

14.    A 2009 review of Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) projects approved
during fiscal 1995–2008 found that 40 projects supported government health
programs involving one or more RBF mechanisms (Brenzel 2009). The range of RBF
mechanisms identified in the review included performance agreements between
central and subnational government administrative entities; performance-based
contracting of public facilities, private providers, and communities; performance-
based health worker incentives; vouchers and conditional cash payments; and CCTs.
The review identified 24 out of the 40 HNP projects as providing “substantial
support” to RBF activities, either because RBF was the focus of the project or the

                                                                            APPENDIX B
                                                  RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
project had several components related to RBF. The main lessons from the review
were the following:

      Political commitment and country ownership are essential. The shift to a
       results focus requires substantial changes in how ministries and health care
       providers relate to their work.
      Involvement of all relevant stakeholders in the design of RBF schemes helps
       to mitigate resistance and facilitate understanding and communication
       regarding the mechanism.
      Projects designed to increase utilization of health services are more effective
       when they are complemented by support to improve the quality and quantity
       of services.
      Several projects were facilitated by complementary reforms, such as
       decentralization and financial autonomy of health facilities for subnational
       health authorities.
      Adequate and appropriate M&E frameworks are critical for demonstrating
       results to stakeholders and for fostering sustainability.
      Independent validation of achievement of indicators linked to performance-
       based contracts is necessary to mitigate gaming and perverse incentives to
       overreport.

15.    IEG’s evaluation of Bank support to health finance noted that a growing share
of Bank health operations are supporting reforms of payments to incentivize
providers to improve quality and efficiency by increasing the focus on activity or
results-based payments (IEG 2014). The report found that Bank support to payment
reforms was more effective when integrated with other health-financing functions
(risk pooling and revenue collection) and linked to broader institutional reforms.
Performance-based payment systems were found to have high overhead costs for
verification and were unlikely to improve equity and financial protection.

RESULTS-BASED AID

16.    Bank instruments designed to support government health reforms have also
been evolving toward RBA (sometimes called results-based lending, or RBL), which
links disbursements to performance. In the RBF health projects discussed here,
examples of performance criteria linked to disbursements included the number of
monitoring systems installed (Argentina Essential Health Functions and Programs
Project), number of facilities established (Bolivia Expanding Access to Reduce Health
Inequities APL-3), certified enrollment in the program (Panama Health Equity and
Performance Improvement Project), number of registrations in a primary health care
program (Albania Health System Modernization Project), and percentage of births

attended by skilled personnel (Bangladesh HNP Sector Program). The Argentina
Provincial Maternal-Child Health Investment Projects (Phases 1 and 2) linked
disbursements to enrollment and output targets (see box B.3). Two projects (Lesotho
Health Project and Uganda Reproductive Health Vouchers Project) used the OBA
mechanism with funding from GPOBA. All the examples cited are (non-PforR) IPF
projects.


 Box B.3. Argentina Provincial Maternal-Child Health Investment Projects (Phases 1 and 2)
 The Argentina Provincial Maternal-Child Health Investment Projects (PMCHIPs) were
 approved in May 2004 (Phase 1) and October 2006 (Phase 2). The projects were a follow-
 on to the Provincial Maternal-Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan, which supported the
 government’s Health Sector Reform Program. The PMCHIP was designed as a three-
 phase Adaptable Program Loan, with the first phase supporting the nine poorest
 provinces, and the next expanding to the rest of the country. The main objective is the
 reduction in the national rate of infant mortality by at least 20 percent (30 percent in the
 participating provinces) over a 10-year period.
 The main component of the PMCHIPs was the capitation payment (about 80 percent of
 the loan), with disbursements based on submission of audited enrollment lists (60 percent
 of the capitation payment) and achievement of 10 tracer or output goals (40 percent of the
 capitation payment). These tracers (for example, proportion of eligible women receiving
 early prenatal care and the proportion of eligible newborns scoring high in the post-
 delivery neonatal evaluation) were statistically verifiable from provincial health records.
 Verification was performed by an independent auditor. The remainder of the loan (20
 percent of total) financed goods (such as medical equipment), consultant services,
 training, and operating costs, which were subject to Bank procurement rules.
 An IEG Performance Assessment Report (PAR) that included Phase 1 of the PMCHIP
 rated the project satisfactory for overall project development outcome, high for design
 relevance, substantial for efficiency, and moderate for risk to development outcome. The
 PAR included the following lessons: (i) substantial up-front investments are needed to
 introduce financial incentives to different levels of government and providers; (ii)
 financial transfers tied to results require a strong institutional foundation; and (iii) results-
 linked payments can contribute to better data collection and analysis.

Results-Based Lending in Social Protection
17.     Social protection was using RBL even before the launch of PforR in 2012. A
Social Protection and Labor Policy Note (Honorati, Rawlings, and Van Domelen 2011)
identified 18 active projects in 2011 that used some form of RBL where
disbursements were linked to results. Of the 18 projects listed in the note, 7 were
CCT programs—operations supporting CCT programs that disbursed against
certain milestones to finance CCT expenditures. Of the non-CCT projects, six had
disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) and five used output-based disbursement
(OBD) (World Bank 2007). The use of DLIs was a recent innovation in linking
disbursements with agreed results indicators. OBD mechanisms enable investment
lending to disburse against delivered outputs or services where procurement
methods are satisfactory to the Bank. Social protection used RBL in several areas.

18.    Social safety nets. RBL in CCT programs typically combines traditional
investment lending that finances inputs with RBL mechanisms that finance
government transfers when certain milestones are met. In the Brazil Bolsa Familia
Project, disbursements and cost-sharing percentages reimburse the Brazilian
Treasury for CCTs made under the Bolsa Familia Program and are linked to key
milestones of technical improvements. The project design includes an incentive
where the cost-sharing percentage increases depending on the actions taken. In
addition, the project finances three technical components based on traditional
lending arrangements for technical assistance. In Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net
Program, the project funds basic operations of the safety net based on the number of
people receiving services, and it includes an institutional support component using
traditional investment lending mechanisms.

19.    Labor market programs. Several operations supporting labor-market training
programs have begun to finance outputs instead of inputs such as curriculum
development and training centers. Examples of outputs include the number of
course completions and enrollment of special targeted groups. The Argentina
Lifelong Learning and Training Project uses an OBD mechanism to finance
payments from the Ministry of Labor to participating organizations based on the
number of beneficiaries completing the learning activities. Some projects directly
fund the trainee instead of the service provider, as in the case of the Kenya Youth
Employment Project.

20.    Decentralized service delivery. These operations seek to improve service
delivery in targeted areas by supporting decentralized service delivery. Ethiopia’s
Protection of Basic Service Project supports delivery of basic services by subnational
governments in five sectors (education, health, agriculture, water supply and


                                                                                    79

sanitation, and rural roads) by financing block grants for recurrent expenditures.
The program uses results-based benchmarks and disbursement triggers to structure
the funding. In the Malawi Social Fund, the project finances transfers to local
governments based on fully costed community services packages and agreed
benchmarks, mainly in terms of local capacity to deliver the service package.

21.    Social protection systems. There have been RBLs supporting reforms in
social protection systems. The Romania Social Assistance System Modernization
Project supported reforms based on the government’s Social Assistance Reform
Strategy. Within the government program, specific programs4 would qualify for
Bank reimbursement if they met certain criteria for inclusion in the pooled eligible
expenditure program (EEP). Disbursements would be triggered by achievement of
verified DLIs (see box B.4). The same approach—defining an EEP, disbursing
against DLIs—was used in the design of the Albania Social Assistance Reform
Project (17 output and 5 action DLIs) and the Moldova Strengthening the
Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net Project (13 output and 4 intermediate outcome
DLIs). The Albania and Moldova projects included a technical assistance component
subject to Bank procurement rules.


 Box B.4. Romania Social Assistance Modernization Project
 The Romania Social Assistance Modernization Project, approved in March 2012, is a
 Sector Investment Loan (SIL) that uses a results-based financing approach. The project
 disbursements are (i) linked to defined eligible line items within the government’s
 program and (ii) triggered by verified achievement of agreed specific results. The project
 finances a slice (about 10 percent) of the government’s program.
 The project has 20 DLIs, consisting of 18 outputs (such as adopted action plan for social
 assistance strategy disseminated) and 2 intermediate outcomes (for example, increase in
 share of social assistance funds going to the poorest quintile). A specified amount is to be
 disbursed based on the achievement and verification of the DLIs. The DLIs were chosen
 from the project results chain. The project drew on lessons from the design of results-
 based SILs: (i) the importance of a thorough technical diagnostic, including for the
 expenditure framework; (ii) the importance of clearly defined results chains, with
 measurable DLIs and clear protocols for verification; and (iii) the provision of ongoing
 implementation support.

Sectorwide Approach
22.   A sectorwide approach (SWAP) supports a nationally defined program
within a sector involving high levels of donor and country coordination toward the

                                                                           APPENDIX B
                                                 RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
achievement of the program goals. Donor funding could be in the form of parallel or
pooled financing, general budget support, or a combination of approaches
(Vaillancourt 2009). The SWAP evolved from the Bank’s Sector Investment Program
instrument, introduced in 1995 (Harrold and Associates 1995). In 1997, a donor
meeting focusing on the health sector coined the term SWAP, commissioned a guide
(World Health Organization 1995) for its use in the sector, and created an Inter-
Agency Group chaired by World Health Organization to foster learning and
promotion of health SWAPs. SWAPs were viewed as a vehicle for incorporating the
principles of the Bank’s Comprehensive Development Framework, introduced in
1999, and for responding to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
various international meetings on aid effectiveness.5

23.    In 2009, IEG reviewed the efficacy of the approach in the health sector by
looking at 18 health SWAPs in 6 countries (Vaillancourt 2009).6 These projects had
several common characteristics: (a) pooling and joint management of donor funding;
(b) mechanisms for coordination between the government and donors, and among
donors; and (c) a common M&E framework for measuring program performance
used by governments and donors alike, including a mechanism for joint reviews of
program performance. The review set out to address three questions:

      Were the anticipated benefits of the approach realized?
      To what extent did the approach facilitate the achievement of national health
       objectives?
      In what ways did channeling support through a SWAP affect Bank efficiency?

24.     The anticipated effects of the approach were: (a) improved sector
management and coordination; (b) greater harmonization and alignment of
development assistance; and (c) enhanced sector stewardship. The IEG review found
that SWAPs generally enabled the development of mechanisms for improved sector
management and coordination, with the exception of national M&E systems and
capacity, which were a critical weakness. Harmonization and alignment of
assistance were achieved through country-led partnership and use of national
systems for implementation. However, there were issues with respect to the
participation of civil society and transaction costs. With respect to enhanced sector
stewardship, while SWAPs contributed to mobilization of resources, there was little
evidence of the efficient use of these resources because of gaps in the M&E of
efficiency aspects. SWAPs covered by the review had not been effective in
establishing mechanisms and incentives to strengthen accountability.

25.  The IEG review also found the results focus of the health SWAPs to be
modest at best. The strong emphasis on process tasks (such as developing country


                                                                                   81
APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
systems and coordination mechanisms) distracted attention from health sector
performance. The content of the programs was largely input-oriented, with a weak
articulation of a results chain that clearly defined and linked inputs, outputs,
outcomes, and impact. For example, it was difficult to establish a strong link
between improvements in infant and child mortality and the plan supported by the
SWAPs. Indicators measuring progress were not coherent with the strategic
framework or program of work, and baseline data was poor or missing. Incentives
to manage for results and to use results information for decision making were
missing. Despite the use of joint program reviews to determine disbursements, the
link between sector spending and performance was weak, if it could be detected at
all.

26.    The IEG review concluded that the ability of the SWAPs to help achieve
health sector objectives was mixed. The quality and coherence of many of the
programs—a critical factor in achieving health sector objectives—supported by the
SWAPs varied considerably across countries. Some programs, while relevant, were
complex and overambitious, exceeding the capacities of countries, as in the case of
the Malawi health SWAPs. Many of the SWAPs had inadequate assessment of risks
and political economy of reforms and provided little guidance on phasing and
prioritization of interventions. However, there were improvements in sectoral
planning and budgeting capacity.

27.    The IEG review included several lessons toward improving design of results-
focused SWAPs. First, the program being supported should have a well-articulated
results chain, a relevant set of results indicators, and an effective M&E system.
Second, management for enhanced development effectiveness requires linking of
resources to results. Third, incentives and accountability enforcement—including
use of civil society for monitoring—would strengthen the program’s results focus.
Finally, assessment of risks and political economy issues would strengthen design
and implementation arrangements.

28.     In the education sector, the Education for All Global Monitoring Report for
2015 (UNESCO 2015) took the position that sectorwide approaches have had mixed
success. SWAPs implemented in 25 low-income countries that focused on primary
and basic education showed some evidence of success, including efficiency and cost
savings brought about by better coordination and flexibility. However, the
effectiveness of education SWAPs has been limited by the exclusion of stakeholders
other than governments and donors. Nongovernmental organizations have not been
involved in SWAPs. In addition, some donors continue to provide parallel aid
outside the SWAPs—in 2012, only 7 percent of total aid for education was delivered

in the form of sectorwide support (OECD-DAC 2014). (See box B.5 for the recent
introduction of the use of results-based aid by the Global Partnership for Education.)

29.    Another paper (McNee 2012) noted that empirical evidence generated by
various evaluations of health SWAPs showed that SWAP performance has been
mixed. While the underlying theory of change of a SWAP is consistent with
principles of aid effectiveness, there was a divergence between the strategic intent of
the SWAPs and their implementation. One explanation for the divergence was the
focus of SWAPs on technical aspects (national plans, expenditure frameworks,
coordination mechanisms, and the like), rather than institutions, incentives, and
accountability mechanisms that would enable governments to lead the development
process. An Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
report (OECD 2012), while not focusing on SWAPs, found that donors focused more
on aid effectiveness processes rather than impact, and recommended increased
support for country ownership and capacity development.


 Box B.5. Global Partnership for Education and Results-Based Financing
 The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) provides funds through its Education Sector
 Program Implementation Grants (ESPIG) to support the implementation of national
 Education Sector Plans (ESP). GPE also provides technical assistance for the development
 of new or updated ESPs, but the bulk of its financial support is through the ESPIG.
 The GPE introduced a new funding model for the 2015–18 period, whereby the maximum
 country allocation (MCA) for the ESPIG is divided into two parts—a fixed portion
 accounting for 70 percent, and a variable portion accounting for 30 percent. Eligible
 countries could apply for the fixed portion only, or both the fixed and variable portions.
 To access the fixed portion, countries must meet three requirements: (i) a credible,
 endorsed ESP; (ii) evidence of availability of financing for the implementation of the ESP
 from the government and development partners to complement GPE funds; and (iii)
 availability of critical data for analyses, monitoring, and evaluation. Countries meeting
 these requirements could use 70 percent of the MCA to finance inputs and other eligible
 expenditures toward implementation of the ESPIG.
 To access the variable portion, countries must meet additional incentive-based
 requirements by providing evidence of actions and corresponding indicators that confirm
 transformative strategies to improve equity, efficiency, and learning outcomes in basic
 education. Once GPE has verified that the actions have been completed and target
 indicators reached, GPE would disburse 30 percent of the MCA. This is the results-based
 financing feature of the MCA.

APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
30.    To strengthen the links between disbursement and results, many SWAP
operations have begun to use DLIs in recent years.7 A review8 for this appendix of 10
SWAP operations with a total of 118 DLIs found that 56 percent of the DLIs were
action or process indicators, 24 percent were output indicators, and 20 percent were
intermediate outcome indicators. The large share of action or process indicators
points toward linking disbursements to efforts in improving systems and
institutions that support the programs.

Disbursement-Linked Indicators in (Non-PforR) IPF Projects
31.    In recent years, the use of DLIs has been growing in (non-PforR) IPF projects.
There is no comprehensive list of such projects, but a 2013 paper (O’Brien and
Kanbur 2013) compiled a list of 29 projects (PforRs and IPFs) using DLIs that had
been approved since 2006. The 20 (non-PforR) IPF projects9 on the list had a total of
237 DLIs. Most of the DLIs for (non-PforR) IPF projects were actions or outputs, with
fewer than 30 percent in the intermediate outcome category (see table B.1),
compared with 40 percent for PforRs (IEG 2016). About 95 percent of the (non-PforR)
IPF project amounts were to be disbursed using DLIs, with all except one project
having one or more components supporting institutional-strengthening measures.

32.      A common feature of (non-PforR) IPF projects with DLIs is the definition of
eligible expenditures to be financed—these expenditures are either not subject to Bank
procurement rules (salaries, for example) or are below the threshold for Bank
procurement prior review. In addition, these projects include technical, fiduciary, and
environmental and social assessments. Verification is typically done by government
agencies, although in one case an independent auditor was used as an additional
check. The non-DLI project components were subject to Bank procurement rules (that

Experience of Multilateral and Aid Organizations
33.     U.K. Department for International Development. DFID has been increasing
its use of payment by results, which is characterized by: (a) disbursements tied to
clearly specified results; (b) recipient discretion in how the results are to be achieved;
and (c) robust verification of results as triggers for disbursement. DFID differentiates
payment by results according to organizations receiving payment: (a) payments
from funders to partner governments are classified as RBA; (b) payments from
funders or governments to service providers are classified as RBF; and (c) returns to
investors in development impact bonds based on results of a program being funded
by the instrument. In the 12-month period ending September 2013, 71 percent of
contracts for services issued by DFID had a performance-based element. About a
third of financial support to governments is linked to performance. DFID is
increasing use of outcomes as the basis for payment—as of June 2014, DFID had 21
outcomes-based programs (such as completion rates in education, safe deliveries for
women, access to water points), with 17 more in the planning stage (DIFD 2014a).

34.     A DFID paper emphasized that payment by results will not always be the best
instrument for delivering aid (DFID 2014a). Based on early experience with the
approach, two considerations in determining whether to use payment by results were
identified. First, targeting specific actions to improve overall performance may be
more appropriate than paying for results, especially where the approach is based on
recipient capacity to determine how the results are to be achieved. Second, the
potential benefits of using the approach may not outweigh the costs relative to other
mechanisms and the risk that the recipient will not be able to take on the performance
risk. Nonetheless, the paper provided early indications of benefits of the approach: (a)
improvement in results data; (b) strengthening of empowerment and accountability;
and (c) greater focus on performance and efficiency. To systematically determine what
works, DFID is strengthening its evaluations of payment-by-results programs and
projects—including providing a framework for the evaluations (DIFD 2014b).

35.    Inter-American Development Bank. In 2003, the IDB approved a six-year
pilot program of performance-driven loans (PDL), which would improve
development effectiveness by emphasizing verified development outcomes instead
of focusing on project inputs (IDB 2003). The PDLs disburse against achievement of
outcome targets verified by independent consultants and verification that the
expenditures subject to the disbursement were used to achieve the outcomes. PDLs
require well-functioning performance measurement and monitoring systems, and
they allow use of fiduciary country systems acceptable to the IDB. Borrowers are
required to present documentation that procurement was done based on acceptable
IDB procedures. The PDL program suffered from low demand because it had


                                                                                       85
APPENDIX B
RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMS BEFORE PFORR
greater disbursement requirements than other investment lending instruments. The
last PDL was approved in 2009, and the pilot program was allowed to lapse pending
further review and evaluation.

36.      There were reviews of the experience from the 17 PDLs approved during the
life of the pilot program (IDB 2014a). In Guatemala, there was a mismatch between
the PDL and program scope—the borrower did not have the resources to achieve the
outcomes. In Honduras, there was a mismatch between the PDL and country
capacity—an investment loan was subsequently approved to strengthen capacity.
More generally, there were issues with the verification of outcomes and
expenditures: (a) difficulty in linking outcomes and expenditures; (b) lack of clarity
in the roles of financial auditors and results auditors; and (c) difficulty in finding
capable firms to verify outcomes. Partial achievement of agreed outcomes caused
delays in disbursements—partial disbursements were not allowed. Most borrowers
did not meet IDB requirements for fiduciary systems, and instead used IDB
procurement systems. Finally, PDLs were designed around outcomes; outputs were
not included the in results against which the PDL would disburse (IDB 2014b).

37.     Asian Development Bank. The ADB approved the piloting of results-based
lending for programs in 2013, with the pilot to last six years (ADB 2013). The RBL
would support government-owned sector programs, link disbursement with program
results, and use program systems after they have been assessed by the ADB as
conforming to accepted good principles. To date, five RBLs have been approved, four
in the education sector and one in the health sector. There were some early lessons
from the experience (ADB 2015). First, the quality of the DLIs is critical, since these are
important tools for system improvement. Second, fiduciary systems and safeguards
assessments are important inputs toward strengthening the institutional systems
required for implementing RBLs, but the ADB should not use a cookie-cutter
approach to these assessments. Third, information-sharing about experience and best
practices in RBL would help provide feedback to strengthen the effectiveness of the
instrument—the ADB has established RBL champions. Finally, the ADB will work
with partners during program implementation, focusing on issues relating to how to
achieve program results and improve systems, rather than on project inputs.

Findings
38.   There has been an evolution in the use of results as a basis for disbursement
in Bank IPF projects. Various types of results have been used—outputs, performance
measures, milestones, completed actions, and intermediate outcomes.

                                                                             APPENDIX B

39.    RBF disburses against outputs and intermediate outcomes, based on the
Bank’s assessment that the borrower has the capacity to implement an agreed
project or program consistent with Bank standards. In theory, the borrower takes on
the performance risk. In practice, the Bank mitigates that risk through various
mechanisms of involvement in the implementation of the project or program,
including implementation support by Bank staff and accompanying technical
assistance and institution-strengthening loan components.

40.    A common characteristic of (non-PforR) IPF projects with DLIs is the
definition of expenditures eligible for reimbursement, which would not be subject to
Bank procurement prior review. One of lessons from the IDB experience with its
results-based instrument is the need for borrowers to meet fiduciary standards.

41.     Fiduciary and environmental and social assessments in (non-PforR) IPF
projects are not performed systematically, unlike the practice for PforRs, where there
are clear guidelines. In addition, strengthening fiduciary and environmental and
social institutions is not an area of focus of (non-PforR) IPF projects.

42.    There are lessons from the use of results-based instruments that were known
prior to the introduction of PforR, including the importance of: (i) thorough
technical diagnostics, including for the expenditure framework; (ii) clearly defined
results chains with measurable DLIs and clear protocols for verification; and (iii) the
provision of ongoing implementation support.

43.    Compared with PforRs, the IPF projects with DLIs have greater flexibility in
project design, in particular the ability to combine different approaches (input and
results-based) in one instrument, depending on client needs. There has not yet been
any formal guidance for staff using results-based approaches or DLIs for IPFs, but
IEG understands that such guidance is now in preparation.

44.    There has not been a systematic review of the effectiveness and efficiency of
various results-based approaches, including whether Bank guidelines have kept up
with evolving practices. Performing this review would generate important lessons
(including on the design of DLIs, fiduciary arrangements, implementation support,
and conditions under which a results-based approach would be effective).

45.    The preceding analysis emphasizes that the PforRs represent an evolution
rather than a sharp departure from previous Bank instruments, with many
overlapping features. While the SWAPs have many of the features of a PforR
instrument, the latter provides greater flexibility in strengthening programs,
promotes interdepartmental cooperation, and minimizes the cost of dealing with
compliance requirements. However, these advantages may also have to do with the

design of SWAP programs, such as the imposition of additional disbursement
conditions beyond the achievement of DLIs. As an instrument, the PforR has certain
advantages over the SWAP: stronger verification systems for disbursement, more
rigorous assessments of country systems, and greater emphasis on improving
program and country systems and capacity through the Program Action Plans
(PAPs).

IDA and 17 projects financed by GPOBA during IDA 14.
2Pay for performance and performance-based payment and performance are considered
synonyms for RBF.
3The Asian Development Bank uses the term results-based lending for its new instrument
that links disbursements with results.

Guaranteed Minimum Income Program.
5For example, the 2005 Paris Declaration, to which the Bank is a signatory, emphasized the
following principles that were consistent with SWAPs: country ownership, alignment of
donor support with the country situation, harmonization of their support with country
systems, managing for results, and mutual (that is, country and donors) accountability.
6The six countries were Bangladesh, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, Malawi, and
Tanzania. In five countries, IEG had field studies as part of the preparation of Project
Performance Assessment Reports or case studies for the preparation of an IEG health sector
evaluation (IEG 2009). In one country, the review used the findings of an evaluation of
Tanzania’s health SWAP commissioned by the government and financed by development
partners.
7None of the SWAP operations reviewed in the IEG paper on Health, Nutrition, and
Population SWAPs used DLIs.
8   The review used the list of SWAP operations with DLIs in O’Brien and Kanbur (2013).
9The sectoral composition of the projects was: Social Protection – 6; Health, Nutrition, and
Population – 4; Education – 3; Infrastructure -1; Public Sector Management – 1; and
Multisector – 5. Half of the projects were SWAPs.

Appendix D. Disbursement-Linked Indicators
1.      The PforR instrument was introduced through the 2011 Board paper (World
Bank 2011a). This instrument disburses the Bank’s loan or grant funds upon
achievement of program results through the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).
This appendix uses the following definition for DLIs—taken from the Guidance Notes
to Staff (World Bank 2012c, p. 16):1 “Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs) are a
limited set of key indicators that are considered critical toward achievement of the
program development objectives (PDOs) and would be the basis for disbursement of
World Bank funding. They may also include key performance actions deemed
necessary to strengthen the performance of the government’s financial management
and procurement processes, environmental and social aspects, oversight and
controls (including integrity systems), monitoring and evaluation of the program.”

2.       The Board paper (World Bank 2011a) explains (as do the Guidance Notes):

        DLIs can be outcomes; intermediate outcomes, outputs, or process indicators;
         or financing indicators.
        They can also be key actions aiming to address specific risks or constraints to
         achieving the results.
        Their selection would be driven by the desired outputs and outcomes of the
         programs, while considering the practical aspects of measuring, monitoring,
         and verifying the achievement of the results.
        DLIs will be tangible and verifiable, and a given DLI can have one or more
         value to be achieved over the lifetime of a PforR operation.

3.      Each DLI is required to have a credible verification protocol that will define
the DLI and set out how it will be measured, whether it is discrete (all or nothing) or
scalable, how the verification will be done, and who will be responsible for verifying
its achievement. Verification can be carried out in a variety of ways and by various
parties, including government agencies and third-party entities, with the primary
objective of ensuring that a credible mechanism is in place for monitoring,
measuring, and verifying the achievement of the DLIs.

4.     In June 2012 Bank management issued the Guidance Notes referenced above,
which supplemented the Board paper (World Bank 2011a) discussion of the
following key points—considerations that clearly may require the task teams to
compromise in their DLI designs in consideration of the following:




                                                                                      91
APPENDIX D
DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
        While DLIs will vary in nature, they should be driven by desired outcomes or
         outputs.
        The selection of DLIs should focus on the indicators that provide evidence of
         continued progress toward the PDO, and the choice of a DLI should be clear
         with respect to its signaling purpose. As the notes emphasize: “Does the DLI
         serve the role of signaling and monitoring a critical milestone along the
         results chain without which the PDO could not be achieved? Or does the DLI
         serve the role of signaling incentives for rewarding performance (outputs,
         outcomes) to encourage the practice of managing for results?” (World Bank
         2012c, p. 34).
        The DLIs should also be clearly defined and measurable, with clear protocols
         for monitoring. They should take into account the country’s context and
         borrower capacity and the feasibility of the results within the PforR period.
        The design should take into consideration the borrowers’ need for budget
         predictability and flow of funds.
        Maintaining a simple design for the operation is also critical.
        Finally, some DLIs may have a final achievement date, and others will be
         achievable during the program period, and some DLIs may be scalable, and
         others (such as a specific action) are either achieved or not.

The Relationship of the DLIs to the Results Frameworks
DLIS ARE NOT THE RESULTS OF A PFORR

5.     During program preparation, and especially during implementation, the DLIs
may get the most attention, since their progress will determine the pace of
disbursements. However, a comprehensive assessment of the results of a PforR must
cover several dimensions, with the PforR results framework at the core. The 2011
Board paper (World Bank 2011a) on PforRs makes clear that—in keeping with the
instrument name—these are programs aimed at achieving results, but the paper
otherwise does not provide much discussion of what should be understood by
results, beyond the brief discussion of the wide range of possible DLIs. For instance,
there is virtually no discussion of any possible sustainability requirements. The
Guidance Notes stipulate that results are “the output, outcome, or impact of a
development intervention. In general, the Bank seeks to encourage results that
support sustainable improvements in country outcomes—that is, evident changes in
peoples’ lives, and/or the behaviors of targeted organizations, households, or firms”
(World Bank 2012c, p. 16). There is thus an expectation that the DLIs will be
important to the achievement of results, but with several considerations that may
serve to limit the strength of the linkages between the results matrix and the DLIs.

                                                           DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
DLIS AND THE RESULTS FRAMEWORKS

6.     The PforR instrument finances the implementation of a program, and the
support for program implementation should, in turn, determine the choice and
design of the DLIs. Unlike output-based aid (OBA), where financing is directly
linked to outputs or outcomes (that is, program/project implementation is financed
elsewhere), the PforR instrument has to find a way of designing disbursements
through DLIs to ensure that there is sufficient flow of funds during program
implementation—this is probably one of the factors that explains the number of
action/process DLIs (also the significant use of advances). An additional issue is
that the absence of a clear theory of change in most project appraisal documents
(PADs) makes it difficult to discern with precision the likely linkages between the
individual DLIs and the eventual expected results, according to the PAD PDOs and
supporting PDO indicators (with the various intermediate indicators in the results
frameworks).

7.      There are, however, some PforRs with quite close and clear integration
between the results framework and the DLIs (and also with the Program Action Plan
[PAP]).2 One example is the Croatia Health Sector Reform PforR, where the DLIs are
fully integrated into the results framework matrix, and with key PAP actions
directly linked to the achievement of some DLIs. In that program, six DLIs are
linked to the reorganization and management improvement components of the
program, three are linked to the quality and preventive care components, and one to
the financial stability of the hospital system.

8.      DLI sets may be more or less representative of the results frameworks, and
the linkages between the two may be more or less clear. In two cases, the DLI set
consists of all the indicators in the results framework for their PforRs, and these DLI
sets are thus fully representative of the results frameworks. In all other cases the DLI
sets include some indicators not in the results framework. For some PforRs, such as
the Ethiopia Health MDG Support Operation and the Bangladesh Value Added Tax
Improvement Program, the DLI sets are well structured to represent both the results
chains and the set of indicators in the results framework. However, there are other
cases where a heavy focus of the DLIs on intermediate steps is less representative of
the expected results in the results matrix, and may also be less directly linked to
program objectives. Box D.1 shows one example.




                                                                                      93
APPENDIX D
DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS

 Box D.1. Example of a DLI Set Different from the Results Framework
 In the Tanzania Big Results in Education Now Program, there is a clear difference
 between the results framework (PAD annex 2) and the set of DLIs (PAD annex 3):
        The PDO is to improve education quality in Tanzanian primary and secondary
         schools, and the results framework supports this through appropriate PDO indicators
         that include reading levels, subtraction levels, teachers found in classrooms, and
         teachers’ knowledge levels.
        But the six DLIs are overwhelmingly (five DLIs, 80 percent by amounts)
         institutional—completion of foundational activities, resource flows, annual reporting,
         deployment of teachers across districts, and schools receiving incentive grants. Only
         one DLI addresses education results—for reading improvements.
        It is thus hypothetically possible for all DLIs to be met in full, and on time, with 100
         percent disbursements, but with only one of the four PDO indicators (reading levels)
         being met. (However, management believes in this case that the DLIs will support the
         achievement of the PDO indicators.)

9.     Some DLIs may, in effect, give preference to less challenging areas. The focus
in the DLIs on achieving results may sometimes encourage concentration on areas or
target groups where results toward specified criteria may be easier (or less difficult)
to achieve. Thus, based on IEG’s discussions during its visit to the ongoing Vietnam
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) PforR, the DLIs for reaching commune-
wide sanitation targets appear to have led to the selection of the more capable
communes by the participating provinces in the first years. These communes were
already close to the agreed aggregate targets, while communes that were left for the
later years of the program had farther to go to reach the targets. This could point to a
possible conflict between aiming for “low-hanging fruit” or for trying to reach the
more disadvantaged communes or population groups.

Aspects of the DLIs
DISBURSEMENTS CAN BE FRONT-LOADED

10.   The Board paper (World Bank 2011a) offers two timing options that would
encourage early disbursements:

          Disbursements against prior results: In some circumstances, certain results may
           need to be realized before the legal agreement is signed for the desired
           program results to be achieved (for example, establishing monitoring
           mechanisms or setting baselines). In such cases the Bank will be able to
           disburse against DLIs achieved between the date of program concept review


94
                                                                             APPENDIX D
                                                          DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
       and the date of the legal agreement, up to an aggregate amount of 25 percent
       of Bank financing. The Concept Notes amplify the need for the task teams to
       ensure that such results are within the scope of the program and that the
       systems used to achieve such results are assessed by the Bank in adherence
       with Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP) 9.00.
      Rolling advances: Advances can also be considered to achieve not only the
       initial set of DLIs, but also subsequent DLIs during the implementation
       period, in cases where advances may be helpful or necessary for the borrower
       to finance the activities needed to achieve the results of one or more of the
       DLIs. Such advances should normally not exceed 25 percent of total PforR
       financing. The amount is deducted from the total to be disbursed under a
       subsequently met DLI, and further advances can then be made once an
       advance has been recovered, or partially recovered, as long as the overall
       limit is not exceeded. The Concept Notes add that the need for and
       justification of advances should be described in the PAD, and the specific
       amount and allocation should be specified in the Financing Agreement.
      Maximum advances: The combined amount of financing under the two bullets
       above may not exceed 50 percent of PforR financing.

11.     Disbursements have been very fast in several instances as a result of the
above two options, plus the general structure of the DLIs, including the potential to
scale up. As one example, the two ongoing programs in Rwanda, both made
effective in December 2014, had, by November 2015, disbursed well over 60 percent
of their Bank commitment amounts. But generally the pace of early disbursements
has varied considerably. Thus, for the 20 programs that became effective before
January 1, 2015, as of mid-November 2015, cumulative disbursements, including
advances, varied between more than 60 percent (four programs) and no or very low
disbursements (three percent or less—also four programs).

DO DLIS REPRESENT “STRETCH” TARGETS?

12.    The Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e) did not discuss the degree of
difficulty or stretch in the DLIs, but noted (in paragraph 37) that the formulation of
the DLIs (and the associated disbursement mechanisms) had been one of the most
challenging aspects of the preparation of PforR operations. This evaluation has not
been able to make a general determination of the degree of stretch in the DLIs, but
field missions noted several cases where a number of the DLIs seemed relatively
easy. Box D.2 shows one example of an apparently quite unambitious set of DLIs.




                                                                                     95

 Box D.2. Vietnam—DLIs in the Results-Based National Urban Development Program in the
 Northern Mountains Region
 The program has eight DLI indicators, divided among four DLIs:
    DLI 1.1: Enhanced annual city plans approved and disclosed to the public. These
     plans to be produced annually. Presumably, once a plan has been produced, it will be
     easy for the cities to modify it as appropriate in the following years.
    DLI 1.2: Professionally staffed management units in place within each participating
     city People’s Committee. Presumably, once a unit is in place, it will be
     straightforward to maintain it.
    DLI 2: Local urban infrastructure investments delivered as per each participating
     city’s approved enhanced annual city plan. One of two DLI indicators concerning
     outputs on the ground.
    DLI 3.1: Asset management plan adopted and local urban infrastructure subprojects
     in full service after completion. This indicator also concerns outputs on the ground.
     For the first two years, the indicator concerns asset condition assessment and asset
     management plans. From the third year, condition that at least 80 percent of
     completed local infrastructure subprojects are free of physical damage and
     operational.
    DLI 3.2: Increased annual own-sources revenue in participating cities. The
     requirement (12 percent increase in nominal terms) may not appear difficult
     considering an inflation rate of 6-7 percent and a GDP growth rate of 7 percent in 2014,
     but at least one participating city is concerned because of limitations on their revenue-
     generation possibilities by central government policies.
    DLI 4.1: Implementation strategy for National Urban Development Program
     adopted with annual milestones. A set of gradual milestones, with approval of a
     Policy Note in year one and management capacity in place in year four.
    DLI 4.2: Professionally staffed unit in place in the Ministry of Construction,
     preparation of annual capacity development plans, and capacity-building support
     provided to cities in accordance with such plans. So the degree of progression under
     this DLI will depend on the degree of progression of the annual capacity building. No
     apparent progression in requirements after year one, but annual disbursements based
     on continuation of the requirement.
    DLI 4.3: Completed program report. An annual report.
 Of the eight indicators, six are thus institutional (and therefore under the control of the
 central or city authorities), and two concern the investments on the ground, with a modest
 degree of apparent progression over the years.

HOW STRONGLY DO DLIS INCENTIVIZE PERFORMANCE?

13.    The role of DLIs to incentivize performance is mentioned regularly in PforR
PADs, in particular in the risk assessments. There can be two aspects to incentives. A
well-structured set of DLIs responding to borrower priorities will clearly help to


96
                                                                              APPENDIX D
                                                           DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
encourage performance through a set of logical, achievable steps, and this has been
observed in some cases by IEG field missions. But it is a separate question whether
the prospects of an amount of financing will encourage prompt and timely actions—
and the field missions saw examples where such prospects did not appear to do so.
And if such incentivizing should be present, then large early disbursements may
possibly have an adverse effect on motivation later in some programs. A related
question is whether small DLIs (in dollar terms) will have much of an incentive
effect. As one example, for the relatively recent Vietnam National Urban
Development Program, one DLI accounts for 1 percent of total financing, one for 3
percent, and two others for 4 percent each. At the other end of the scale, one DLI is
expected to account for 62 percent of overall disbursements. It is too early to assess
whether the “small” DLIs will have much of an incentivizing effect—but there is
reason to be somewhat skeptical.

DLI Risks and Risk Management
14.     The integrated risk assessments in the PADs show that the DLI risks are not
seen as particularly high, and generally as a bit lower than for the overall program
risks. In 1 case the DLI risk was rated high (against 4 programs for the overall
program risks), in 8 cases substantial (16 for overall program risks), and in 18 cases
moderate (7 for overall program risks). The DLIs are thus normally not seen as risk
drivers.

15.    There are no dominant reasons for a DLI risk rating of substantial or high, but
such reasons include that a program or institutions are new, possible concerns that
the DLI targets may be too ambitious, linkages to technical risks, or possibilities that
delays in disbursements may affect participants’ motivations.

16.     At the same time, mitigating measures to deal with DLI risks tend to focus on
the same aspects across the PforR operational spectrum: the care taken to define the
DLIs, role of the verification mechanisms, the incentives for participating entities
from targeted DLI disbursements, use of scalable DLIs, and that the DLI targets have
been set carefully to help ensure achievement, and thus disbursements. From these
discussions it could be inferred that the DLIs generally do not use stretch targets—
that attention to timely disbursements may have been more important than possible
ambitious performance incentives. See one illustration in box D.3.




                                                                                      97

 Box D.3. An Example of DLI Risk Mitigation
 The Morocco National Initiative for Human Development PforR, in PAD annex 7, lists as
 DLI risk-mitigation measures factors that ought to be part of a program under any
 circumstances (italics used here for emphasis):
 “DLIs have been firmed up during appraisal. Key risk management measures included: (a)
 using straightforward and scalable DLIs as much as possible; (b) exert realism in setting DLI;
 (c) computing DLI targets in a conservative fashion; (d) building prudent scenarios in terms of
 the program budget ceiling; (e) ensuring budget predictability; and (f) seeking synergies and
 alignment with other donors … results indicators/DLI in order to alleviate reporting burden
 on client. Risk management during implementation will include (a) continuous
 monitoring of DLI progress; (b) strengthening capacities in weak areas potentially
 affecting DLI achievement” (World Bank 2012b, p. 86).
 Source: World Bank 2012b.



17.    DLIs are sometimes used to mitigate other risks. The role of DLIs to
incentivize performance is mentioned for a number of programs. It remains to be
seen whether these incentives will work as intended in all instances. DLIs are
sometimes also used as tools for mitigating other or overall risks, but less frequently
and less importantly than overall program structure and preparations, or the PAPs.
Examples of the use of DLIs for risk mitigations include:

        Bangladesh VAT: Mitigating technical risk of complex procurement by
         having the DLI specify the process to be followed.
        Ethiopia Health: Fiduciary risk addressed by DLI to improve transparency
         and increase use of competitive bidding.
        Ethiopia Urban Local Government: Technical risk of lack of motivation
         among regional governments addressed through DLI amounts to incentivize
         for the delivery of results. Environmental and social risk of quality of
         implementation addressed by DLI providing resources to support
         performance and for backstopping.
        Mexico Oaxaca Water Supply and Sanitation: Technical risk addressed by
         DLI designed to generate financial incentives.
        Nepal Bridges: Technical risk addressed through DLIs that will only disburse
         for investments that follow priorities.

DLIs as Discussed in the IEG Templates
18.    Evaluation team members have reviewed all 27 PforR operations approved
by June 30, 2015, in accordance with a standard template. This has primarily been a
desk review, except for nine PforRs where the templates were revised following

field missions. Table D.1 shows the distribution of the ratings concerning results
frameworks and DLIs. Important findings:

         The ratings have the same distributions for the quality of results frameworks
          and quality of DLIs (with verification protocols). This is not surprising, given
          the strong overlaps between the two.
         Overall, reviewers found these two sets to be largely satisfactory—with 78
          percent of the PforRs rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory for these
          core dimensions.
         The results frameworks and DLIs are supported by the PAPs, which were
          rated moderately unsatisfactory in only 2 of 26 cases (8 percent).
         The DLI risk ratings were also found generally satisfactory—with only 4 of 25
          (16 percent) PforRs rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Note: The totals differ since reviewers did not fill out the ratings in all cases (or qualified as NA) —in particular for rating 6.4,
due to lack of information about implementation of the PAPs (such as that this implementation had not yet started).


19.    Results frameworks and/or DLIs rated either moderately unsatisfactory or
unsatisfactory were typically found to have some of the following weaknesses:

         PDO not fully representative for program objectives.
         PDO-level indicators do not cover expected real results well (results on the
          ground).
         Lack of baseline data and monitoring indicators.
         Weaknesses in verification protocols.
         Weak attention to important gender or to social or environmental dimensions
          of results.
         Lack of economic indicators of results, especially noted as a weakness for
          operations with strong economic evaluation models.
         DLIs not covering (or covering late) important parts of results frameworks, so
          that disbursements may largely take place even with little or no progress for
          these aspects.

DLI Classifications
20.      DLIs can be classified along several dimensions, as described in this section.

21.    The average size of DLIs varies. The average PforR operation has 8.1 DLIs, and
ranges from a high of 12 (4 programs) to a low of 3 (1 program). The average size of
planned aggregate disbursements for each DLI also varies considerably (influenced, in
part, by the size of the programs). The highest average size ($66.7 million) is for the
$200 million Vietnam RWSS Program, with only three DLIs, while the lowest ($3.1
million) is for a small program ($30.8 million total) in Moldova. There is no particular
relationship between commitment amounts and number of DLIs.3

22.    Table D.2 shows that the DLIs are divided almost equally between capacity
building and institutional development (CBID) and others (that include results on
the ground and fiduciary DLIs), but with some modest differences by amounts
versus by number, since, on average, the CBID DLIs have somewhat smaller
financing attached. Thus, for the sample, CBID DLIs account for 48 percent by
amount and 52 percent by number. The distribution varies considerably among
operations, from a low of zero CBID in one program (Pakistan Punjab Government)
to 100 percent at the other extreme (Ethiopia Local Government), and with 17 of the
27 operations below the average of 48 percent, with the 5 largest percentages for
programs in Africa.

23.    In some cases, high percentages for institutional-type indicators are to be
expected. Thus, in the Rwanda PforR for Public Sector Governance, the PDO is itself
institutional—to enhance the country’s public financial management and statistics
systems to improve transparency and accountability in the use of public funds,
revenue mobilization, and the quality and accessibility of development data for
decision making. In this case, the one non-CBID DLI is measuring the extent to
which sectors are using a specific accounting and financial reporting system. In
other cases—such as the example from Tanzania in box D.1—a relatively high

percentage of CBID DLIs may mean that the DLI sets in question are more focused
on intermediate institutional steps, and thus are less representative of the overall
program objectives. It may also mean that the achievement of the DLIs in such cases
may or may not mean that program objectives are being met.

24.     Table D.3 shows the distribution among the four categories of intermediate
outcomes, outputs, actions, and process. There is thus not even a separate
classification for full outcomes. This absence is understandable, given the limited
period for the PforR operations, but indicates that the name of this instrument
should not be understood to mean program for outcomes.

25.   Most DLIs extend over several disbursement periods, typically with
somewhat changing conditionalities over the period—for example, establishing
minimum standards in the first year, completing upgrades of some facilities in the
second year, completing upgrades of more facilities in the third year, and so on. The
periods are normally one year each, but there are also cases with periods of six
months, such as the Brazil PforR.

26.    In some cases, including the India Enhancing Teacher Effectiveness in Bihar
PforR, the nature of some DLIs can change significantly during implementation. For
this program, an example is DLI4—Accountability and Monitoring System. For
periods 1–4, the indicators are for the development of such a system, while in the last
period (period 5), the DLI shifts to average teacher performance score.

27.    By financing amount, 60 percent of DLIs are linked to intermediate results in
the results framework, 29 percent to PDOs, and 11 percent to other reasons, such as
fiduciary. This is shown in figure D.1. By numbers, the linkages to intermediate
results are even stronger—64 percent, with 20 percent linked to PDOs and 16
percent for other reasons. This reinforces the impression that, overall, the DLIs are to
support processes and institutional improvements toward the PDOs more than to

IDA countries, for a
somewhat smaller average
of $172 million. The largest
program in each category is for $500 million—for Egypt and Nigeria, respectively.

29.     A final consideration is the degree of scalable DLIs. Table D.4 shows a total of
153 such indicators—70 percent of all DLIs in the IEG sample. However, in at least
one case—Rwanda Agriculture—there were a few institutional indicators that were
erroneously (in IEG’s view) treated as scalable.4 There also seems to be an uneven
practice when it comes to the “bottom line” for scalability—in the same Rwanda
case, any improvement in the performance of the indicators will cause at least some
disbursements to take place, but in other cases, there will be a floor for eligible
performance. (And in this Rwanda case, achievement of 75 percent of stated targets
is sufficient for full disbursement.)

Note: The Tanzania Primary Health Operation DLI#4 is linked to both PDOs and intermediate results, based on the
components of the LGA (Local Government Agency) Balance Score Card, as shown in the appendix. However, for
statistical simplification, this DLI was treated as “linked to PDOs” when calculated for this table. Scalability: several DLIs
were coded differently for different years in the DLI verification protocol tables. For statistical simplification, changes are
made as follows: (i) Egypt Housing Project DLI#4: Scalability = yes (verification protocol table lists no for year 1 but yes for
years 2–5); (ii) India Teacher Effectiveness Project: DLI#1: Scalability = yes (verification protocol table lists no for year 0,
but yes for years 1–5), DLI#3: Scalability = no (verification protocol table lists no for years 0–3, part (ii) in years 4 and 5, yes
for part (i) in years 4 and 5); and DLI#5: Scalability = no (verification protocol table lists no for years 2 and 3, yes for year 5).

DLIs Outside PforRs
30.     As discussed elsewhere, DLIs are also being used increasingly outside
PforRs—having performance-linked disbursements without the use of country
systems. Thus, many sectorwide approach (SWAP) operations have begun using
DLIs in recent years. A review of 82 DLIs for 7 SWAP operations showed that 30
percent of the DLIs were action or process indicators, 32 percent were output
indicators, and 29 percent were intermediate outcome indicators. That review noted
that the large share of action or process indicators points toward linking
disbursements in efforts to improve systems and institutions that support programs.
IEG observations indicated that not using country systems can have the advantage
of putting less pressure on government entities that may already have heavy
workloads in relation to their human and financial resources, and also to help to
insulate the operations better—for example, from problems of government
budgeting. But it was also indicated that the verifications may be addressed less
rigorously when outside PforRs. There has not yet been any formal guidance for
staff using results-based indicators or DLIs for investment project financing (IPF),
but IEG understands that such guidance is now under preparation.

Verification Protocols
31.    All PforRs are required to have a credible verification protocol for the DLIs
that will define them and set out how they will be measured, whether they are

discrete (all or nothing) or scalable, how the verification will be done, and who will
be responsible for verifying their achievement. All programs in the IEG sample have
detailed verification protocols, and the programs examined through field visits have
shown that the verifications (where applicable from program progress) are taken
seriously by all parties, although the sample of such programs is necessarily small,
so it is premature to try and pass judgment on how the process works in practice
and over time (see figure D.2).

APPENDIX D
DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
32.       Verification can be carried out in a variety of ways and by various parties:

         Figure D.2 shows that 63 percent of all DLIs by number are to be verified by
          independent parties, and 37 percent by government agencies.
         For the independent verifications, 63 percent of DLIs are to be verified by
          private third parties and 37 percent by independent auditors (including
          auditor-generals).
         For the government agencies, there are a variety of entities. Thus, for the two
          Rwanda PforRs, verification is done in one instance by the Auditor-General’s
          Office and in the other by the Prime Minister’s Office. The common thread is
          that while formal independence may vary, the key aspect—which should
          always be verified during program implementation—is that these entities will
          have sufficient competence and behavioral independence in relation to the
          executing agencies.

33.     In a few cases, the verification protocols also list the Bank as the verification
entity. Thus, in the case of the Tanzania Urban Local Government Strengthening
Program, the Prime Minister’s Office, Regional Administration and Local
Government, is the “normal” verification entity for information coming in from
other sources. However, for three DLIs, this office will itself be the data source, and
the PAD verification protocol then lists the Bank as the verification entity. Given the
Bank’s general oversight role (quite extensive in some cases), it is not to be
recommended that it also to be responsible for the verification of specific DLIs.

34.    Verification processes are often—and rightly—demanding (complex and
lengthy) and time-consuming, which is warranted on program grounds. Thus, as
one example, the verifications for the Vietnam RWSS Program have so far taken nine
months each year—between the end of the results period and the disbursement of
funds to the implementing provinces —although the mid-term report expresses
hopes that this can be reduced to six months. Such long processes can create issues
of liquidity for participating entities. More generally, it is conceivable (but
premature to assess) that such lengthy processes may have a limited exemplary
effect—that they may not be maintained by the governments or expanded into other
areas without Bank engagement.

DLIs During Implementation
35.   So far, very few DLIs have been modified, indicating care in their initial
formulation. The Board paper (World Bank 2011a) stated that “if DLIs were not well
defined during the preparation of a Program-for-Results operation, or cannot be met
because of unexpected events, the definition of these DLIs may be modified during

                                                         DISBURSEMENT-LINKED INDICATORS
the operation’s implementation, following normal Bank project restructuring
processes” (p. 28).

36.    One case of proposed mid-term modifications: The aide-memoire from the
recent mid-term review of the Vietnam Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program
included proposals for modifying the DLIs. These included de-linking water supply
and sanitation sub-DLIs (this would provide more flexibility but could also lead to a
return of the traditional pattern of increased attention to water supply rather than
sanitation), extending program implementation by one year, reducing the target for
DLI1.1 (water supply connections), and introducing a new DLI on the sustainability
of sanitation in schools and clinics.

Lessons
      The PforR objectives are in the results frameworks, not in the DLIs. A
       comprehensive assessment of PforR results must cover several dimensions,
       with the results framework as the foundation. The DLIs, which naturally will
       get much attention during implementation, should not be considered the
       most important aspects of program results.
      The DLIs must address a number of considerations. In their DLI designs, task
       teams may need to weigh various considerations, including the balance
       between relative ease of timely disbursements and the degree of ambition
       (stretch) in the DLI targets. IEG has seen several cases of DLIs perhaps being
       unduly easy, either individually or in the aggregate.
       DLI sets should be clearly linked to, and preferably reasonably
       representative of, the results frameworks, so that achievement of DLIs would
       provide strong assurance that the PDO/PDO indicators will also be achieved.
       Task teams should be cautious of DLI sets that concentrate heavily on
       institutional matters if this means that there will be only modest attention to
       the planned results on the ground.
      It should be recognized explicitly that many intermediate indicators and DLIs
       are likely to be for supporting processes and institutional improvements
       toward the PDOs more than in direct support of the PDOs themselves. This
       also means that few outcome indicators are likely to be for final outcomes.
      Preferably, the Bank should not be the responsible verification entity for
       specific DLIs, given the Bank’s general oversight role.
      The Bank could consider, where possible, steps to simplify and shorten the
       verification processes where this could be done without reducing the quality
       of the processes. This could help reduce participants’ liquidity issues and
       could also work to strengthen the general attractiveness of these processes in
       the countries.

1Two interim guidance notes were issued on June 18, 2012, one on technical assessment, the
other on DLIs and disbursement arrangements. In this paper, the two notes are referred to
collectively as the Guidance Notes.
2In this background note, all references to PforR programs refer to the programs approved
through June 30, 2015, unless otherwise stated.
3In a few cases, the commitment amounts presented include not only the planned Bank
commitments, but also some other amounts, in one case from a Bank-managed trust fund,
and in another case an amount from the borrower itself. There thus does not seem to be
fully consistent practice among PforRs about how to record the DLI amounts.
4 For that program, the PAD annex table 3.3 treats all DLIs as scalable under the formulation
“Payments will be made in proportion to the achievements (an agreed minimum value of at
least 75 percent of the agreed target value to obtain the 100 percent disbursement target,”
even for institutional DLIs such as DLI 6 (Updated Gender Sensitive MIS Framework and
Action Plan) and DLI 7 (approval of various policies and begin implementation of action
plans), for which scalability is meaningless.

Appendix E. Fiduciary Assessments
1.     The Bank has been committed to increased use of country systems for some
time (World Bank 2003). Country systems include, for instance, designation of the
project as on-budget, aligning with the fiscal calendar, and relying on the range of
national budget preparation and execution procedures, as well as intergovernmental
transfers, audit, and national competitive bidding procedures for procurement.
Country systems for safeguards, results frameworks, and monitoring may also be
used.

2.       PforRs are part of this long-term attempt to design operations that are a better
fit for country contexts. The PforR approach to country systems is different from the
Bank’s earlier country systems pilots. First, it uses the systems that are responsible for
the program being supported, which may be at a higher standard than those for other
programs. Second, it does not insist that these program systems be at the same
standard as the Bank’s policies and procedures for investment lending operations.

Integrated Fiduciary Systems Assessments
3.     Each PforR produced an Integrated Fiduciary Systems Assessment (IFSA),
typically summarized in an appendix of the program document, and covering the
following issues:

      Adequacy of program procurement system
      Adequacy of program financial management system
      Adequacy of program-specific system to handle issues relating to fraud and
       corruption, based on the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACG)
      Adequacy of stakeholder involvement in program implementation and
       oversight, including verification of disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) and
       establishment of a complaint and grievance mechanism
      Level of transparency in program decision-making processes and
       performance reporting
      Appropriateness of exclusions.

4.    Overall, these assessments have been comprehensive, and cover most of the
key aspects that one would expect to find. Each area of discussion typically begins
with an overview of the laws and processes applied in each area of the government’s
program, the shortcomings in practice, and how the shortcomings will be addressed
and monitored. Most PforRs have also drawn from extensive previous analytical
work on fiduciary systems, including Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessments, Country Procurement Assessment Reports


                                                                                       109

FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENTS
(CPARs), and a range of other fiduciary assessments done by development partners
in connection with budget-support operations. The IFSAs are generally thorough in
identifying relevant transparency measures, such as timely provision of information
to stakeholders, disclosure of tender notices and award decisions, and parliamentary
oversight. But some contextual or political economy issues may not be addressed, as
discussed in this appendix.

Costings
5.     A shortcoming is the lack of details on the costing methodologies used for the
government programs being supported. Most PforRs seem to base their costing on
the costing of the underlying government program, but with few or no details on the
costing methodology used. An exception and example of good practice is the
Ethiopia Health Millennium Development Goals PforR, where costing was done
using Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks (see box E.1).

 Box E.1. Good Practice in Costing: Ethiopia Health Millennium Development Goals PforR
 Costing was done using Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks, a tool created by
 development partners and the national ministries of health from several countries. The
 tool helps to remove health system bottlenecks by helping to prepare strategic plans and
 expenditure programs to increase the quality of high-impact health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS,
 tuberculosis, and malaria interventions. The approach focuses on three service-delivery
 modes: family-oriented, community-based services; population-oriented schedulable
 services; and individual-oriented clinical services. It helps to assess current performance
 of health services and to identify bottlenecks in both supply and demand, and enables a
 tailored approach to each country’s specific situation. This helps to facilitate selection of
 the types, quantities, and costs of salaries, drugs, training, and other inputs that are
 needed to overcome bottlenecks to achieve optimal results.

Procurement
6.     Most program procurement systems are assessed as consistent with good
public procurement principles, although implementation is often uneven due to lack
of political commitment, rigorous follow-up, trained staff, and effective demand-
side processes. Challenges are sometimes pointed out without corresponding
proposed actions, such as possible entry barriers for contractors created by their
mandatory registration.

7.     The fiduciary systems used for PforRs are broadly the same as those for other
areas of the government programs. One exception is the PforR for Brazil: Strengthen

                                                                 FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENTS
Service Delivery for Growth, Poverty Reduction and Environmental Sustainability
in the State of Ceará, where technical assistance procurement (10 percent of Bank-
funded project costs) uses Bank rules because local rules were not thought to give
enough attention to quality. However, IEG’s field mission found that the technical
assistance component had become unduly complex and had turned into a source of
delays for the implementation of the PforR. In hindsight, it is reasonable to assume
that it might have been more efficient for the Bank to have provided some initial
capacity building and training for the government’s own procurement staff in
participating agencies to implement its own “technical quality + price”
methodology, which, although rarely used, had been legally available from the start.

8.     Another exception is the high-value procurement exclusion, which has
reportedly excluded financing in certain areas supported by the PforR in some
countries. PforR financing cannot normally be used for procurement packages of
high-value contracts above certain thresholds, based on the type of procurement and
the level of fiduciary risk. If such procurements are required in programs supported
by a PforR, they may be financed from another source. Following the Two-Year
Review (World Bank 2015e), a provision was added that such contracts may be
financed if they are important to the integrity of the program and their cost is less
than 25 percent of the cost of the overall program. Such an exception needs to be
approved by the Bank’s managing director and chief operations officer.

9.     The Bangladesh Revenue Mobilization Program-for-Results: Value Added
Tax (VAT) Improvement Program included the financing for a large information
technology system. The hardware and software components were initially bid as
separate procurements, but the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase
decided not to accept the successful bidders from the initial procurement as
recommended by the Technical Committee, to cancel the initial tender, and to
retender, merging the two components. The resulting successful tender was for $29
million, above the $20 million threshold allowed under the program. As a result,
and following lengthy discussions, the full component (hardware and software) will
now be financed by the government, while the PforR will support the
implementation of the system in other ways. In this case, the IPF instrument might
have been a better choice, at least for this component, given the challenges in
Bangladesh with large, complex procurements.

10.     In a sense, any PforR that requires additional measures to mitigate fiduciary
risk is creating potential differences between the PforR system and the relevant
overall program and country systems. In some cases, these measures may be applied
not only to the PforR, but to the larger program as well, although this often is not
clear from the documentation. Thus, under Uruguay’s PforR, the Program Action



                                                                                  111
APPENDIX E
FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENTS
Plan (PAP) calls for identifying bidding bottlenecks and reducing bid duration by
improving agency efficiency of award decision making. In addition, the PforR will
establish a database in the implementing agency to register, track, and follow up on
complaints linked to program-related activities, including procurement complaints.
Generally, if high-value procurements take place outside the PforR, the PforR
fiduciary risk is transformed into a funding risk for the portion of the program not
funded by the Bank, which could, in turn, become a risk to the development
objective supported under the program. In addition, the high-value procurement
exclusion diminishes the ability of the Bank to strengthen some of the more difficult
components of the country fiduciary systems.

Anti-Corruption
11.     Under PforR financing, the borrower is responsible for taking actions in this
area. The Bank also can investigate allegations, and sanction parties if appropriate.
Concerns about the Bank’s ACG have reportedly been responsible for reducing the
size of some PforR loans. In Brazil, to avoid inconsistency at the local-government
level, some activities were taken out of the scope of the PforR operation. In Morocco,
government counterparts interviewed by the IEG mission repeatedly raised the
Bank’s ACG as an issue. They questioned why the Bank agreed to the use of all other
aspects of national systems, but insisted on the application of its ACG without even
assessing the quality of the country’s own anti-corruption system. The Integrity Vice
Presidency to date has received only five complaints alleging corruption in 3 of the 27
PforR operations assessed by IEG. The complaints were judged to not warrant
investigation, and no investigations were carried out.

12.    Following the Two-Year Review (World Bank 2015e), these rights and
responsibilities did not change. However, there is an added provision that the Bank
and borrower will formulate a program-specific protocol on how to take actions. The
protocol may be a legal agreement, a memorandum of understanding, or part of the
negotiation minutes. In addition, new language is added emphasizing that the
country has the sovereign right to take actions in this area, and that Bank actions are
solely for the purpose of determining compliance with Bank policies. If any action
taken by the borrower conflicts with the laws and regulations of the country, the
Bank and borrower will consult to agree on alternative actions that will avoid such a
conflict.

Political Economy Aspects
13.    Political economy issues are behind many of the constraints raised in
fiduciary assessments, but they are rarely discussed directly. Any critical analysis
tends to address only low-level issues, such as in one case: “The membership of


112
                                                                             APPENDIX E
                                                                  FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENTS
district council internal audit committee cannot be easily controlled since they are
elected politicians. This can be addressed by co-opting competent members based on
an agreed sitting fee.” The IEG evaluation found several examples through simple
literature searches where outside parties, such as researchers, had raised critical
views about the actual state of procurement and other fiduciary practices that did
not seem to be reflected in the IFSAs, where the focus is instead typically on
institutional reforms to address corruption, including program-specific measures.
There are seldom any convincing arguments why such measures will work in the
case of the new programs. Several interviews with team members confirm their
awareness of such information and issues; the lack of published analysis is
reportedly because of the sensitivity of this area for borrower governments.

14.    An example of good practice is the Mozambique PFM PforR. The project
appraisal document (PAD) includes a good summary of the political economy
challenges, the identification of winners and losers, and design features that address
these challenges: strong, senior-level ownership across key ministries, a shift in
incentives that creates greater benefits to cooperation, flexibility to account for
unexpected impacts, the use of change agents at the deconcentrated levels to drive
change, and sharing of risk between the Bank and the client. The design also
addresses the complex political economy of medicine supply chain reform,
including interdepartmental coordination and competing policy aims.

15.     The Systematic Operations Risk-Rating Tool, introduced for PforR operations
in January 2016, includes political and governance risk as one of the nine risk
categories. Another category measures the related aspect of institutional capacity
risk. IEG supports the use of this new tool to address the political economy
challenges raised in this report.

Risk and Mitigation Measures
16.   Nearly all PforRs mention fiduciary capacity constraints, often with
mitigating measures enforced by DLIs, PAPs/legal covenants, and/or during
supervision missions. In most cases, these actions are not conditions precedent to
disbursements or PforR effectiveness, though some may be linked to a portion of the
disbursements through the DLIs as a performance incentive. The timing of
PAPs/legal covenants for the PforRs assessed seems reasonable.

17.    One example is Rwanda, where a key noted constraint is the high turnover of
procurement officers. The Bank’s earlier Public Sector Capacity Building Project had
worked to address this issue, which is pervasive across professional positions in the
public sector. But despite extensive support provided by that operation, and related
capacity-building operations funded by other donors, the problem has persisted.


                                                                                   113
APPENDIX E
FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENTS
The PAD correctly points out that better incentives for attracting, promoting, and
retaining staff are needed to reduce high (by regional standards) vacancy and
turnover rates. This issue was apparently awkward to address through the PforR,
but the PFM basket-fund donors are addressing it through other support.

Findings and Conclusions
18.    PforRs are part of a long-term attempt by the Bank to move toward
operations that are a better fit for country contexts. The instrument is designed to
support the implementation of government programs, using the government’s own
fiduciary, environmental, and social safeguard systems. The intention is that PforRs,
working in tandem with other Bank instruments, will help to deliver the Bank
priorities around results, scale up in poorer countries, and strengthen country
systems.

19.    Overall, the fiduciary assessments in PforRs, along with the mitigating
measures carried out, generally provide reasonable assurance that program funds
will be used as intended, including funds from sources other than the PforR. A
shortcoming is the lack of details on the costing methodologies used for the
government programs being supported. Most PforRs seem to base their costing on
the costing of the underlying government program, with few or no details on the
costing methodology used.

20.     The fiduciary systems used for PforRs are broadly the same as for other areas
of the government programs, with two main exceptions. The first is the high-value
procurement exclusion, which normally prevents the use of PforR financing for
contracts above certain thresholds, based on the type of procurement and the level
of fiduciary risk. This exclusion has prevented the use of PforR financing for areas
important to program integrity. This exclusion has not been a major obstacle in the
PforRs reviewed, because these areas can be financed from other sources. In any
case, the Bank introduced a policy change in 2015 allowing for exceptions to the
procurement threshold in some situations.

21.   The second exception is the perceived scope of the Bank’s ACG, which were
viewed by some borrowers as limiting the scope of PforRs. The Bank made some
changes in 2015 to the PforR ACG to address these concerns, but it is too early to
determine the result.

22.    Political economy issues are behind many of the constraints raised in
fiduciary assessments, but are rarely discussed directly. However, interviews with
team members confirm their awareness of such issues; the lack of published analysis
is reportedly because of the sensitivity of this area for borrower governments.

23.    Finally, IEG finds some evidence that capacities strengthened by PforRs will
be sustained—for example, through support from a new results-based project in
Mozambique’s education sector, and through reforms supporting the medium-term
expenditure framework in Kenya.




                                                                                 115
Appendix F. Environmental and Social Systems
Background and Context
1.      The Bank’s environmental and social safeguards for investment project
financing (IPF) have been undergoing a multiyear review and reform process. In
anticipation of that process, IEG prepared an evaluation report (IEG 2010), which
found that the Bank’s safeguards policies had helped to avoid or mitigate large-scale
social and environmental risks associated with the Bank’s IPFs. However, the
implementation of these policies had meant enforcing compliance with mandatory
policies and procedures, without engendering strong client ownership. The report
pointed to the need for a systems approach—linking policy regulations to project
design, supervision, monitoring, evaluation, and disclosure—and partnership with
clients, third parties, and local communities to enhance ownership of results,
integrating elements of the Bank’s safeguards with some of the practices under the
International Finance Corporation/Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
Performance Standards. On this basis, IEG recommended the revision of the policy
frameworks to harmonize thematic coverage and guidance across the Bank Group
and enhance the relevance of those frameworks to client needs.

2.      A 2015 report (IEG 2015c) found that the application of the elements of the
Bank’s Operational Policy on Development Policy Financing (OP 8.60) related to
environmental and social risks had been inconsistent. In addition, the Bank’s
assessments of the clients’ capacity to manage these risks had often been
perfunctory. Finally, there was no formal system in place in the Bank to monitor and
evaluate environmental and social risks and their mitigation in development policy
financing (DPF), and the Bank’s monitoring documents seldom contained
information on actual environmental or social effects or the efficacy of mitigation
measures. In light of these findings, the report suggested that Bank Procedure (BP)
8.60 be revised to specify procedures to ensure that the provisions of OP 8.60 with
respect to environmental and social risks associated with DPF are adequately
applied. These provisions relate to the screening and identification of environmental
and social risks; guidance to task teams; incentives and training for Bank staff; and
the strengthening of monitoring, reporting, and evaluation of environmental and
social effects in DPF documents. The Bank has accepted these suggestions and
recommended their implementation (World Bank 2015c).

                                                        ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS

Environmental and Social Provisions for Program-for-Results Financing
3.      As stated in the fiscal 2012 Board document (World Bank 2011a), PforRs will
seek to make sure that the environmental and social effects of the program are
adequately addressed. During the preparation of a PforR operation, the Bank will
assess, against the requirements of Operational Policy/Bank Procedure (OP/BP)
9.00, the degree to which a program’s systems manage and mitigate the
environmental and social impacts of the overall program. The assessment will also
identify and exclude high-risk activities—that is, those that pose a risk of potentially
significant adverse impact on the environment or affected people (activities
classified as Category A under the IPF safeguards).

4.     In line with the above, OP 9.00—Program-for-Results Financing, spells out
the requirements for the Bank teams’ assessments of each program’s environmental
and social systems (World Bank 2015b, p. 69ff). Specifically, an assessment is
expected to consider to what degree the program’s systems:

      Promote environmental and social sustainability by avoiding, minimizing, or
       mitigating adverse impacts and promoting informed decision making.
      Avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts on natural habitats and
       physical cultural resources.
      Protect public and worker safety against potential risks associated with
       construction activities, exposure to hazardous materials, and natural hazards.
      Manage land acquisition and loss of access to natural resources in a way that
       avoids or minimizes displacement, and assist the affected people in
       improving, or at the minimum restoring, their livelihoods and living
       standards.
      Give due consideration to the cultural appropriateness of, and equitable
       access to, program benefits, giving special attention to the rights and interests
       of the indigenous peoples and to the needs or concerns of vulnerable groups.
      Avoid exacerbating social conflict, especially in fragile states, post-conflict
       areas, or areas subject to territorial disputes.

5.     Unlike the practice for IPFs, the Bank itself is expected to undertake the
environmental and social systems assessment (ESSA) for a PforR, and the ESSA is
required for every operation. The ESSA is expected to identify actions, as needed, to
enhance the systems during program preparation and implementation (the latter to be
included in the Program Action Plan [PAP]). The Bank is also expected to consult with
program stakeholders and disclose the results and recommendations of its ESSA
before the appraisal of the PforR.




                                                                                     117
APPENDIX F
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
6.    In addition, the environmental and social risks and proposed mitigation
measures are expected to be inputs to the integrated risk assessment of the PforR.
During implementation, the Bank is expected to pay particular attention to
reviewing the borrower’s compliance with its contractual undertakings in the
environmental and social management areas, including those related to the PAP;
monitor the evolution of risks; and make adjustments as appropriate.

Findings from the Two-Year Review
7.      Management’s Two-Year Review of the PforR instrument found that the
implementation of environmental and social dimensions was “working as intended”
(World Bank 2015e). The review found that PforR activities had generally presented
low-to-moderate environmental or social risk. In the two cases where risks were
rated as substantial, adequate risk management and mitigation measures had been
put in place. For all projects, environmental and social risk management measures
had been reflected in 10 percent of the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) and 16
percent of all PAP actions, and the screening process had effectively excluded high-
risk activities. However, the review also found that the exclusion of potentially
significant environmental and social impacts was one of the most important factors
accounting for differences between the scope of PforR programs in relation to the
government programs supported by the PforRs (World Bank 2015e, p. 15). Finally,
the review identified two areas where improvements were warranted. First, the
ESSAs were uneven in their depth of assessment, focus, and clarity. They could do
more to prioritize potential issues according to their relevance, devise appropriate
actions to address priority issues, and emphasize measures to strengthen the
borrower’s overall environmental and social risk management systems. Second,
more integration at the team level could help ensure that the ESSA is part of the
overall focus on capacity building and an integral part of the broader dialogue. As
will be discussed below, IEG broadly agrees with these findings, and identifies
additional issues that deserve greater attention for the future design and
implementation of PforRs.

Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation of Environmental and Social Risks
8.     Quality of environmental and social assessments. The desk review of the
PforRs found that the Bank teams had prepared an ESSA for every operation, and that
their quality had been satisfactory or moderately satisfactory in every case. The most
frequent shortcomings related to the extent to which the capacity-building measures
recommended in the ESSA were followed up in the PAPs and technical assistance
provisions, the coverage of social issues, the adequacy of outreach and consultation
with poor and vulnerable beneficiary groups, and the absence of monitoring

                                                                             APPENDIX F
                                                       ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
indicators and reporting on safeguards implementation in the results frameworks of
the operation. Each of these areas will be discussed in greater detail below.

9.     Appropriateness of environmental and social risk rating. Given the
exclusion of high-risk components, as mandated by OP 9.00, the actual
environmental and social risks faced by the sample PforRs ranged from low to
substantial and have been satisfactorily rated in the project documents in most cases.
In two cases, however, the ratings tended to be overcautious. For the Kenya
National Safety Net Program, which has no direct environmental effects and only a
very limited range of potentially adverse social effects, the environmental and social
risk should have been appropriately rated as low rather than moderate. Similarly, in
light of the fact that the Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban Development Project
has excluded investments in environmentally sensitive areas, avoided investments
in ethnic minority areas, and is addressing identified social risks through
appropriate PAP actions, a risk rating of moderate would seem more appropriate
than one of substantial.

10.      Appropriateness of measures for improving program systems for managing
environmental and social effects. The provisions for improving the programs’
environmental and social systems were satisfactory in most of the review sample,
and moderately satisfactory in two cases. Here again, the most frequent gaps related
to limited or vaguely specified inclusions of ESSA-recommended capacity
strengthening measures in the PAP and, in some cases, inadequate support for the
PAP in the technical assistance provisions of the programs. For example, the ESSA
of the Uruguay Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program identified a need for
strengthened environmental management and supervision, and recommended
seven actions to address this gap, but only two of these were included in the PAP.
Similarly, the PAP of the Mexico Oaxaca Rural Water and Sanitation Program did
not mention any of the actions the ESSA identified as required to address the
substantial social risks of the program. It is possible in these and other cases that
such actions have been covered through other means, such as an environmental and
social management manual. However, the absence of their explicit mention offers
little assurance that they will be adequately addressed and implemented.

11.    Quality of implementation of environmental and social systems. Very little
information on the quality of implementation of environmental and social systems
can be gleaned from the projects’ Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs).1
In two of the sampled projects, the implementation of environmental and social
systems is also directly tied to the achievement of DLIs, and their progress can be
followed in the ISRs. Thus, for the Brazil Ceará Strengthening of Service Delivery
Project, the ISR regularly reports on the progress of DLI#9—linked to 9.9 percent of


                                                                                   119
APPENDIX F
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
total project financing—which is an index of environmental enforcement quality that
combines indicators of (i) the enforcement of water pollution control regulations, (ii)
the use of appropriate water-quality monitoring technology, and (iii) citizen
participation in environmental monitoring.

12.     The ISRs also appear to have very little information on the quality of
environmental and social systems implementation. Thus, while all the ISRs that
were reviewed include a section on the management of environmental and social
risks, this section simply includes a description of the risk—synthesized from the
risk assessment in the project appraisal document (PAD)—and an update on the
environmental and social risk rating. A review of these environmental and social
risk ratings in the latest ISRs indicates that they were the same as those in the PAD,
except in five cases, where they have been raised. One of these cases was the
Mozambique Public Financial Management for Results Program. This was initially
rated as a low risk, but the rating was raised to moderate because of continued
delays in the implementation of regulations for the disposal of expired medicines.
Implementation delays were also the reason for the raising of the risk ratings in
other cases.

13.     In the course of its country visits, IEG found that the environmental and
social systems were being diligently supervised by the Bank teams and
implemented much as expected. No serious issues were foreseen, because the
programs had excluded investments in environmentally sensitive areas and
generally minimized land acquisition. In the few instances (Vietnam, Brazil) where
the programs involved indigenous peoples, adequate provisions for their culturally
sensitive participation had been addressed through the PAP and supported by
technical assistance. Even so, the mission learned about important challenges faced
in the adequate implementation of the Bank’s policy requirements:

         One recurrent challenge relates to the adequacy of the program systems,
          which most ESSAs have described as adequate from a legal and policy
          perspective, but as stretched and uneven in terms of implementation
          capacity. IEG found that this situation continued for the programs visited.
          While technical assistance has been provided in every case to prepare
          environmental and social guidelines and train program staff to implement
          them, the missions found no indications that the resource and staffing
          shortages diagnosed in the ESSA had been addressed. Thus, the enforcement
          of environmental requirements and monitoring of environmental
          performance continued to be sporadic and uneven.
         Another recurrent challenge relates to the adequacy of compensation for
          land acquisition. Overall, IEG missions found that the programs that


120
                                                                                 APPENDIX F
                                                           ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
        required land acquisition had supported the preparation of land acquisition
        and resettlement guidelines and trained staff to implement them in
        conformity with Bank requirements. Verifying the adequacy of land
        compensation, however, remains a difficult challenge, as illustrated by the
        case of the Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban Development Program (box
        F.1).


 Box F.1. Compensation for Land Acquisition—Vietnam Northern Mountains Urban
 Development Program

    In this program, the Program Action Plan supports “independent market-based
     assessments” of land prices.
    IEG was informed that such assessments had arrived at prices that were 2–5 percent
     higher than the established government guidelines, but that it was difficult to
     establish market prices because of the common practice of underreporting them in the
     official records in order to minimize land transfer taxes.
    A possible indication of the distortion created by this underreporting and under-
     assessment is that out of the 40+ households that needed to be relocated for the first
     investment project in a major city, all had accepted the “land compensation” option in
     an outlying resettlement area, and not a single household chose the “cash
     compensation” option that was based on the “independent market-based
     assessment.”

14.    Appropriateness of stakeholder engagement and program transparency
during implementation. The ISRs in the PforR portfolio contain virtually no
information on stakeholder engagement in the implementation of environmental
and social management aspects in any of the ISRs in the PforR portfolio, even
though in most cases, specific provisions and requirements for such engagements
were made, or should have been expected, at an early stage of implementation. The
apparent absence of any progress reports and monitoring information is a significant
gap in the results reporting systems of these programs.

15.    At the same time, IEG found that for the sample of visited projects, the
stakeholder engagement associated with the programs’ social systems was being
fully implemented and supervised by the Bank teams. Thus, for example, the Brazil
Ceará Strengthening Service Delivery Program had established a publicly accessible
website with all of the program documents, as well as the results framework,
targets, and status.2 In addition, the level and frequency of stakeholder engagement
seemed to be appropriate for the type and implementation status of the programs.
Thus, the skills development program involved consultations with private sector


                                                                                         121

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
organizations, and the family assistance program had involved consultations with
local community leaders for the development of an outreach strategy for indigenous
peoples and other vulnerable minorities.

Strengthening of National and Program Environmental and Social Systems

16.    Adequacy of national systems for managing environmental and social
effects of government programs. The ESSAs of the sample operations mostly discuss
the countries’ national systems for managing environmental and social effects only to
the extent that they are applicable to the programs at hand. In each case, the countries’
policies and legislation are described as comprehensive and in line with international
practice, and the identified gaps relate to their uneven implementation, associated
with local-level and program-specific capacity, resource, and incentive constraints.
IEG’s field visits found that the planned technical assistance and PAP actions had
supported a number of improvements in the environmental and social systems of the
supported programs. There were, however, few indications that such improvements
were being adopted for broader use in the national systems.

17.    Adequacy of the program systems for managing environmental and social
effects. IEG’s desk review found that the majority of the programs’ systems
appeared satisfactory. In the moderately satisfactory cases, systemic weaknesses
were related to the adequacy of capacity and resources; deficiencies in the social
management systems, such as with respect to transparency, accountability, and
grievance redress mechanisms; and the disposal of medical and pharmaceutical
waste. In these cases, specific measures to address the shortcomings identified were
included in the technical assistance and PAPs.

18.    IEG’s field visits found that the planned technical assistance and PAP actions—
primarily involving the preparation of specific guidelines and training for program
staff—were being implemented, but had been unable to address the preexisting
capacity and budgetary constraints that were limiting the effectiveness of the program
systems. For example, the PAD of the Vietnam Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Project appropriately mentions the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment—
and, by implication, the provincial Departments of Natural Resources and
Environment—as responsible for monitoring and evaluating the environmental
aspects of program implementation. In the course of IEG’s visit, the provincial
departments confirmed that they were responsible for monitoring and enforcing
environmental requirements, but had been unable to carry out these functions as
systematically as expected due to continuing staff and budgetary shortages. Thus,
while the PforR was appropriately using the program’s existing system, there was no
indication that it had helped address its capacity and resource limitations.

                                                                              APPENDIX F
                                                        ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
19.     Appropriateness of identification and exclusion of high-risk activities. All
of the sample PforRs have appropriately excluded high-risk environmental and
social activities in line with the requirements of OP 9.00. In one case, however, the
interpretation of this requirement appears to have been overly cautious, to the extent
of having an impact on the achievement of the PDO: For the India Maharashtra
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program, the exclusion of “schemes involving
highly polluted water sources” appears to be at variance with the operation’s PDO
“to improve access to quality and sustainable services in peri-urban villages and in
water-stressed and water-quality affected areas” (World Bank 2014a, pp. vii, 6). In a
few other cases, the exclusion of high-risk environmental and social activities has
significantly reduced the scope of the PforRs in relation to the supported
government programs, and the attendant challenges and opportunities associated
with strengthening the programs’ systems. Thus, programs that were intended to
strengthen local infrastructure development have excluded water treatment plants,
new landfills, or road construction outside existing rights-of-way, as well as any
investments with potential impacts on natural habitats or cultural areas. This raises
the concern of how such investments will be handled if they are not subject to the
oversight associated with Bank involvement.

Monitoring and Reporting of Environmental and Social Effects
20.    The extent of monitoring of environmental and social effects of a project is
difficult to establish, since reporting has been sparse. While most (78 percent) of the
reviewed PforRs have been rated as facing moderate or substantial environmental
and social risks, and two-thirds (63 percent) of the ESSAs point to the need for
monitoring and reporting, only 10 (37 percent) PADs discuss specific provisions for
the monitoring of environmental and social effects, and 5 (18 percent) of the ISRs
provide any information on their implementation.

21.     In three of the five ISRs that provide information on the implementation of
environmental and social systems, the reporting is directly tied to their inclusion in a
DLI. In other cases, information on the environmental and social effects is only
available in the ISRs of two additional projects. The ISRs also appear to have very
little monitoring information on the environmental and social effects of the
programs. Thus, while all reviewed ISRs include a section on the management of
environmental and social risks, this section simply includes a description of the
risk—synthesized from the risk assessment in the PAD—and an update on the
environmental and social risk rating, with no additional data.

22.   In the course of its country visits, IEG found that the environmental and social
systems were being implemented, but with virtually no reporting of environmental


                                                                                     123
APPENDIX F
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
and social effects, even at the program-management level. Thus, while the missions
were adequately up to speed on the status and extent of land acquisition, involuntary
resettlement, community consultations, extent of compliance with environmental
permitting regulations, and so on, little of this information was—with some
exceptions—reflected in the programs’ progress reports, and even less in the ISRs.

23.     Overall, the evidence from the review of program documents and field visits
indicates that environmental and social effects have not normally been seen as an
integral part of PforR reporting. This finding is surprising since environmental and
social risks have been rated as moderate or substantial in all but six (77 percent) of
the sample portfolio and, as already noted, these risk ratings were raised in the
course of supervision in five (18 percent) cases. Thus, while IEG found no evidence
that environmental and social risks are not being managed, the very limited
reporting about them that is available in the Bank’s systems is a major concern,
given the essential role of monitoring for the environmental and social management
framework and the important place of environmental and social risks within the
PforRs’ integrated risk management framework.

Summary Findings
         Overall, IEG’s desk review indicates that the majority of the program systems
          were deemed to be satisfactory from a legal and policy perspective, but with
          frequent gaps in implementation.
         The available information suggests that the ESSAs have been reasonably
          effective in identifying and assessing environmental and social risks and in
          the identification of remedial actions.
         The most frequent shortcomings relate to the coverage of such actions in the
          PAPs and in technical assistance.
         Where systemic weaknesses were identified, the PforR’s provisions for
          improving the programs’ environmental and social systems appear to be
          adequate.
         The initial evidence about their mitigation has been encouraging, but there is
          a shortage of environmental and social monitoring indicators in the results
          frameworks and the ISRs.
         However, in the visited programs, the implementation of environmental and
          social systems was found to be adequately supervised and monitored by the
          Bank teams.
         Since the programs had been purposely defined to exclude subprojects in
          environmentally sensitive areas, and also to minimize land acquisition and
          impacts on indigenous peoples, IEG found no indications of significant
          adverse impacts so far.

                                                        ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
      In a few instances involving indigenous peoples, adequate provisions for
       their culturally sensitive participation had been addressed through the PAPs
       and supported by technical assistance.
      Many of the ESSAs and PADs point to staff and budgetary constraints that
       have limited the effective implementation of the country program systems.
      In relation to the strengthening of national and program systems: While the
       remedial technical assistance and PAP actions are being implemented, there
       is no indication that the best practice models supported by these actions are
       being adopted for wider use beyond the scope of the PforRs.
      There is also no indication that the PforRs have had any effect on addressing
       the staff and resource constraints affecting the program and country systems.

Lessons
24.   Given the above findings on the assessment and implementation of
environmental and social systems in PforR operations, two lessons can be derived:

      PforR operations are unlikely to have an impact on national environmental
       and social systems. While IEG’s country visits found that programs’
       environmental and social systems were being implemented largely as
       expected, it found no indication that the PforRs had yet been effective in
       addressing systemic weaknesses affecting the national systems, such as
       budget and staff constraints, or that the supported guidance and capacity
       building were being applied beyond the scope of the programs. This is not
       surprising, given the program focus of these operations and the pervasive
       budget and staff constraints on both the Bank and borrower sides. While it is
       possible that the improvements supported by the PforRs could have some
       demonstration effects in the future, IEG could not find indications for such
       broader impacts at this early stage of the programs’ implementation.
      Environmental and social performance is more likely to be monitored and
       reported if it is tied to DLIs. As already noted, only five of the sample ISRs
       included information on the performance of the programs’ environmental
       and social systems, and in three of these cases, the reporting was directly tied
       to their inclusion in a DLI. Thus, environmental and social performance
       information was only reported in two (8 percent) of the 24 projects that did
       not associate environmental and social performance with the DLIs, which is
       notable, given the important role of environmental and social performance to
       the Bank’s overall performance, and the important role of ISRs for the Bank’s
       overall reporting of operational results.

1One exception is the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Program, for which the
ISRs have regularly reported on the average scores for the participating municipalities’
performance with respect to the implementation of environmental measures and
resettlement action plans.
