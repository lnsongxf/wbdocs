Romania: Toward Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy
 Better Use of Revenues from Auctioning EU ETS
Carbon Allowances for Climate Finance Programs
          in Romania’s Non-ETS Sectors
Romania in the EU ETS

Around 200 Romanian installations and operators currently participate in the EU ETS, out of a total
of some 10,000, and they emitted around 40% of Romanian greenhouse gases1 in 2013.

Romanian industrial and power installations entered the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme2 (EU
ETS) in 2007 when Romania joined the European Union. Emissions from aircraft operators were included in
2012. EU ETS-covered emissions in Romania amounted to 42 MtCO2e in 2014, 39% below 2007 levels. This
sharp decrease is due to the economic downturn and emissions reductions induced by climate, energy
efficiency and renewable energy policies.

Since 2013, more than half of carbon allowances are distributed through auctions. While free allocation of
allowances was considerably reduced, by 46%, since 2007, the surplus held by Romanian EU ETS operators
reached 113 million allowances in 2013.

The use of EU ETS auctioning revenues until now in Romania

By the end of 2014, Romania collected about 260 million Euros (M€) from the EU ETS auctioning
revenues, of which 71% (or 184 M€) was dedicated to climate finance projects.

Romania is entitled to auction 324 million carbon allowances over the 2013-20 period, once 71 million
allowances are deducted, which it is entitled to allocate freely on a transitional basis to 39 power plants.

The auctioning regulatory framework leaves only little room for maneuver for Member States in the
management of the allowances they are entitled to auction, to provide predictability to EU ETS operators
and market players. In particular, the EU ETS Directive stipulates that at least 50% of the revenues generated
from allowances auctioning — 100% for allowances auctioned for intra-European redistribution purposes

                                                                             — should be used for funding mitigation and
                                                                             adaptation actions through fiscal or financial
                                                                             support policies in the EU or in developing
                                                                             countries.

                                                                             Auctioning revenues can be a decisive instrument
                                                                             for financing climate-friendly actions in Europe,
                                                                             in coherence with EU long-term objectives and
                                                                             Member States national strategy and priorities.

 The EU ETS imposes a cap on GHG emissions in line with EU’s mitigation targets. The cap translates into
carbon allowances that have to be surrendered each year by incumbents to cover their emissions.
In 2013, off the 2,712 M€ of auctioning revenues declared to be used to finance climate and energy related
policies in Europe, more than80% was dedicated to domestic policies.

Proceeds received in 2013 and 2014 years from auctioning revenues in Romania have been approved for
specific climate finance projects, by directly amending the provisions of the Governmental Emergency
Ordinance (GEO) 115/2011, issued in 2011. By mid-2015, 139 M€ were allocated to various projects:
investments in the Bucharest subway (76 M€), purchase of buses and micro-buses for public transportation
(48 M€), reconversion of public transport buses from diesel to liquefied gas (5 M€), implementation of
bicycle infrastructure in Bucharest (10 M€). 2015 auctioning revenues in Romania are expected to reach
160 M€, of which 46 M€ would be transferred to the state budget and 114 M€ would remain for climate
finance projects.

Expected EU ETS auctioning revenues by 2020 and 2030

Potential EU ETS auctioning revenues for Romania could amount to around 4 bn€ per year by 2030.

Auctioning revenues estimates for Phase 3              Romania’s potential auctioning revenues (M€ per year)
(2013-2020) and Phase 4 (2021-2030) of EU ETS           6000
depend on the future market price. Because large
uncertainties remain related to the legislative         5000

framework as well as the evolution of the supply
                                                        4000

The introduction of a Market Stability Reserve          2000

Prioritizing climate finance programs in non-ETS sectors supported by EU ETS auctioning revenues

As the government strives for a climate resilient, low-carbon economy by 2030, the efficient use of
revenues from the auctioning of EU ETS allowances could be an effective tool for reaching this goal
in the sectors not covered by existing climate finance mechanisms and policy regulations.

                                                       There are currently no selection and prioritization
                                                       criteria for the use of EU ETS auctioning revenues
                                                       in Romania.

Based on these criteria and on international and Romanian experience of implementing similar programs,
the following climate finance programs are recommended for the years 2016-2020:

     Replacement of household least-efficient light bulbs, air conditioning units, individual heating
     systems, refrigerators, and washing machines. Possible budget: up to 88 M€;
     Individual houses insulation (multi-levels apartment buildings being already covered by the Regional
     Operational Program). Possible budget: up to 750 M€;
     Local, small- and household-scale renewable energy production. Possible budget: up to 330 M€;
     Forestry and biomass production, and land use improvements, such as ecological reconstruction
     of damaged forest in regions with low forest cover, fast growing woody crops for energy and non-
     energy purpose, and establishment of forest belts and green corridors in areas under natural risks.
     Possible budget: up to 110 M€.

Additionally, EU ETS revenues could support a number of cross-sectoral measures:

     Research and technical assistance, in particular to reinforce capacity of local and central authorities
     and assess the technical and economic potential of planned programs.
     Possible budget: up to 14.5 M€;
     Education and public awareness on climate issues. Possible budget: up to 14.5 M€;
     Management of the ETS scheme in Romania. Possible budget: up to 73 M€;
     Administration of the climate finance programs. Possible budget: up to 73 M€.
Recommendations regarding the institutional framework for managing auctioning revenues

In order to constitute a viable and longer-term climate finance programs supported by EU ETS
auctioning revenue, it is necessary to amend the current legislation and approve an updated
financial and organizational scheme for the use of EU ETS revenues.

There is currently no clear, effective procedure in
place for the administration of EU ETS revenues in
Romania.

In addition, selected climate finance projects are
not well coordinated with sectoral Operational
Programs or other mitigation instruments; and
there are few institutional links between the
Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests and
the beneficiary ministries.

To overcome these deficiencies it is recommended
to create a dedicated Climate Investment
Fund with the following legal and institutional
arrangements:

     The Ministry of Public Finance continues to collect the revenues from auctioning and after directing
     29% of the revenues to the State budget, it transfers the remaining 71% to the Ministry of Environment,
     Waters and Forests’ special “climate” account;
     Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests:
             Sets up a Coordination Unit of the Climate Investment Fund (CIF) inside the Ministry to
           establish and monitor activities of the CIF;
             Sets up an Advisory Committee (AC) to provide input and guidance concerning strategic
           objectives for implementation of the climate programs that will be financed by CIF. The AC
           would include representatives of the Ministry of Public Finance; Ministry of Economy, Trade
           and Tourism; Ministry of Energy, Small and Medium–Sized Enterprises, and the Business
           Environment; other interested Ministries; representatives from businesses, scientific and non-
           governmental organizations;
     Climate Investment Fund has overall responsibility for the implementation of climate finance
     programs and the selection of Implementing Agencies;
     Implementing Agencies have responsibility for implementing specific climate finance programs and
     working directly with beneficiaries of the programs.
     The Climate Investment Fund can be set up for 5 years, from 2016 to 2020, and could be extended
     taking into consideration the available auctioning revenues and the results of the ex-post evaluation
     of its operation.

These recommendations should be used by the Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forests, as a
responsible body for climate policy, for internal discussions with other Romanian ministries and agencies
to reach consensus on improvements for managing revenues from auctioning EU ETS allowances.
