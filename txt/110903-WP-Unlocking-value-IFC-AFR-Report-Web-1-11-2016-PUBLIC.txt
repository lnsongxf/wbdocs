AFR                     Throughout the document, the term AFR will be used as “Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials”
                        because some wastes can be used for simultaneous energy and material recovery. The recovery
                        of raw material is replacing the material needed to produce clinker and has nothing to do with
                        the blended cement.

Burnability             A parameter that is used to show whether the burner flame profile, when AFRs are burned, is
                        identical to that when only conventional fuels are used. In certain cases, the burnability has to
                        be studied in depth because it can have a negative effect on the clinker quality. Burnability can
                        improve the clinker quality if better conventional fuels are used.

Bypass dust             Discarded dust from the bypass system dedusting unit of suspension preheater, precalciner and
                        grate preheater kilns, normally consisting of kiln feed material which is fully calcined or at least
                        calcined to a high degree.

Clinker                 Intermediate product in cement manufacturing and the main substance in cement. Clinker is the
                        result of calcination of limestone in the kiln and subsequent reactions caused through burning.

Cement                  It is made by grinding clinker and adding gypsum (calcium sulphates) and possibly additional
                        cementitious (such as blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, natural pozzolanas, etc.) or inert materials
                        (limestone).

Co-processing           The use of waste as raw material, or as a source of energy, or both to replace natural mineral
                        resources (material recycling) and fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and gas (energy recovery)
                        in industrial processes, mainly in energy intensive industries.

Decarbonation           The chemical decomposition of limestone which liberates CO2.

Fuel CO2                CO2 emission from burning fuel and not from decarbonation.

Since its founding six decades ago, IFC has served as a bridge between private
investment and the global development agenda. With a portfolio of $52 billion in over
100 countries, IFC is now the world’s largest development finance institution focused
on the private sector. It is bringing to bear the transformative power of markets on
some of the developing world’s most pressing challenges – from energy access to food
security, infrastructure to health care, and education to financial inclusion. IFC’s role
in bringing together private investment and development remains urgent and essential. One of our key priorities is to increase climate-related
investment from 16 percent in fiscal year 2015 to 20 percent of our committed portfolio by 2020.

Without immediate intervention to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, an additional 100 million people could fall into extreme poverty by
2030 as a result of climate change. Following the Paris agreement of 2015, where nearly 200 nations and scores of CEOs pledged to reduce
their carbon footprint, IFC is in an unprecedented position to help clients capture the opportunities and mitigate the risks of climate change.
Our objective is to boost climate-related investments and support the use of energy efficient technologies. To do that, IFC will maximize
its impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its investments, building client resilience to climate change, and engaging in thought
leadership and standard-setting.

In the Middle East and North Africa, IFC will focus on addressing the root causes of the region’s instability and its biggest long-term
development challenge: a dearth of jobs and opportunity. IFC is looking to identify new clients in the fields of power, entrepreneurship, and
access to finance.

At the intersection of these priorities lie innovative opportunities such as those presented in this report. Egypt’s cement industry is a pillar
of growth and crucial to the country’s economic recovery. But growth has been hampered by a complicated energy picture. As such, our
regional Resource Efficiency Advisory team spearheaded this pioneering national study. The report identifies viable and low-carbon energy
sources that would help cement producers satisfy their growing energy demand. For the first time, we have mapped, quantified, and analyzed
co-processing in Egypt. We have also identified the current and future appetite for alternative fuels, highlighted impediments to market
growth, and recommended potential solutions throughout the supply chain.

We discussed our research with a range of industry players, many of whom were reluctant to previously come together. In these sessions,
participants spoke about the challenges in making the switch to alternative fuels. There is no doubt that embracing these new technologies
will take time and money, but the rewards far outstrip the hardships. We hope this study makes that point clear, and encourages producers,
officials, and other stakeholders to find greener ways to help Egypt’s cement industry grow.

Preface
Egypt’s cement sector is an important economic player, but it is also one that can play
a decisive role in helping the Arab world’s most populous nation meet climate change
targets. In Egypt’s Third National Communication to UNFCCC released in March 2016, it
was reported that the cement industry alone contributes 40 percent (16.7 million tCO2e) of
the country’s total industrial sector greenhouse gases emissions in 2005. At the 2015 Paris
Climate Summit, Egypt committed to several actions to reduce emissions, which included
development of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy systems such as incentivizing
renewable energy technologies and switching to alternative and cleaner fuels. Other commitments also covered developing a national monitoring,
reporting and verification system and adopting wider energy efficiency, especially in the production of cement, iron, steel, among other industries.

Executive Summary
The Egyptian cement industry is the world’s 12th largest and a vital economic
force supporting the construction and building sector that accounts for nearly
five percent of Egypt’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).1 Today the energy-hungry
industry is at a cross-roads: due to fuel shortages, the cement sector is being forced
to diversify its energy mix.

of potential negative impacts of the AFR on the kiln process and
equipment.

An economic viability analysis of the four waste streams
demonstrates that AFR is commercially competitive with coal. The
cost competitiveness of each fuel varies, depending on preparation
and processing costs, the price of other fuels and the cost of
transport. IFC’s initial analysis shows that for 2015, average AFR
pricing was between 5 and 40 percent less expensive per GCal than
coal at the burner point. That price difference also reflects pre-
processing, handling, transportation, and co-processing costs.

The necessary capital investment by a cement plant for co-processing
AFR in the kiln ranges from $1 million for agricultural wastes (fine
materials) to $4 million for MSW. However, most cement plants
needed to make capital investments to burn coal, investments which
ranged much higher than that for AFR. For each coal line, the figure
varied from $15 to $25 million (excluding land prices).3 The total
CAPEX requirements for co-processing varies for each cement plant,
depending upon its existing production processes and equipment.
Thus, sector-wide estimates are difficult to assess. However, the
payback periods for investments required for AFR co-processing are
expected to be less than five years.

As for pre-processing, which may be led by cement plants or by a
third party service provider, the estimated capital investment ranges
from $0.6 million for TDF to $5 million for RDF. Figures depend
on the waste type, but also the size and complexity of the pre-
processing platform. For most AFR types, significant economies of
scale exist, particularly for labor intensive preparation of MSW. DSS,                               Figure 3: The Main Stages of AFR Pre-Processing

	 .2	 The Cost of Energy Subsidies
2

Similar to other countries in the region, Egypt has long relied on generalized energy subsidies as a central instrument for social protection,
economic development, and the sharing of hydrocarbon wealth.4 Subsidies have often been seen as essential for attracting investment in the
manufacturing sector. This has, however, led to a policy of buying or producing fuels at international prices and selling at subsidized prices
in domestic markets. The low prices elicited a rising demand response from the economy, and the subsidy bill grew at a compound annual
rate of 26 percent between 2002 and 2013.

As Egypt’s energy demand soared, fuel subsidies produced several unintended consequences. Egypt’s exposure to global market prices at a
time when international oil prices were on the rise drove the government deeper into debt. By 2013-2014, fuel subsidies consumed around
a third of government revenues, constituting a fifth of government expenditures and over seven percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).5
Fuel imports also drained the government’s foreign currency reserves, leading to a backlog of payments to international energy producers.
Predictably, foreign oil and gas companies in Egypt reduced their gas production and investment levels, creating a vicious cycle of supply
shortages and foreign currency scarcity (SPTEC Advisories, 2014).

Box 1: Success Stories

Worldwide, the cement industry is driven to reduce thermal energy costs, in parallel with cutting its carbon
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Alternative Fuels offer a tested method to help achieve both objectives.
With energy normally accounting for 30-40 percent of the operating costs of cement manufacturing, any
cost-saving opportunity can provide a competitive edge over cement plants using only conventional fuels
(Mokrzycki and Uliasz-Bochenczyk, 2003). Substitution rates vary from one country to another, and from one
plant to another.

Some cement plants have replaced up to 100 percent of their main fuel stream (petcoke and fossil fuels) with
alternative fuels. Across the majority of cement conglomerates, an average rate of 10 to 30 percent substitution
can be found. The wide variation in alternative fuel usage rates often rests on the type of cement technologies
employed, the kiln system used, and the availability of alternative fuels with compatible chemical and physical
characteristics.

There are many success stories. Since 1990, the Holcim Group has increased its energy consumption by only
45 percent since 1990, while boosting its cement production by 120 percent. Since the group uses AFR, their
expansion rests on a mere 25 percent from traditional fuel sources.

The Cemex-operated Clinchfield Cement Plant in Georgia, U.S.A, has achieved a fuel substitution rate of 78
percent by burning nearly 90,000 tons of biomass, including peanut shells and wood sawdust, in addition to
tire fibres and whole tires. As of September 2013, the factory averaged a monthly substitution rate of a little
over 93 percent, with 100 percent reliance on alternative fuels for periods of 24 hours.

Although EU average AFR use is nearly 39 percent, some cement plants have reached much higher rates.
Examples are two cement plants in Germany owned by Holcim: Rüdersdorf and Beckum. Both use AFR, and
in 2011 had TSR rates of 73.8 and 77.5 percent respectively, which meant that around three-quarters of their
natural resources (coal and lignite) could be saved. For both plants, this represented 260,000 million tons of
coal or 194 railway trains.

Another cement plant ENCI, owned by Heidelberg in The Netherlands, reached a TSR of 85 percent in 2013.
Such success was an outcome of landfilling fees and strict enforcement of laws on uncontrolled landfilling
(Cemex Germany, 2013; Heidelberg SD report, 2014).

For the purposes of this analysis, RDF10 is calculated as the processed solid, high calorific value fraction remaining after the recovery of
recyclable elements of MSW. Therefore, RDF would typically constitute between 10 to 25 percent of the MSW. The processing of MSW
usually takes place in sorting and composting plants located near the source of generation or central collection stations or disposal/landfill

     ii)	 Total MSW Generated in Egypt

If the full technical potential is unlocked through 100 percent MSW collection rate and improved treatment efficiency, then the total potential
of RDF supply in Egypt would range from 2 to 5 million tons annually. This estimate is based on an assumption that 10 percent and 25
percent of total MSW would be convertible to RDF respectively.

Potential RDF yields, with optimized collection and processing efficiency, are summarized below:




Based on the distribution of waste collected from the various governorates throughout Egypt, the Delta, Greater Cairo and Alexandria present
the greatest opportunity for MSW recovery and conversion to RDF in an efficient and least logistically challenging manner. Combined, they
represent 83 percent of total generated MSW. The amounts generated in other regions are limited, and pose logistical challenges in collection.
Figure 11 and Table 14 below illustrate the distribution of waste generated in these three regions. The potential RDF from Greater Cairo,
Alexandria and the Delta, at 15 percent MSW to RDF conversion rate, is estimated at approximately 7,065 tons per day (Figure 12), which is
equivalent to 2.5 million tons annually. The average range for RDF production for the three regions is between 1.7 to 4.2 million tons annually.

4.1.2 Challenges in Using MSW for AFR

The greatest challenges to the potential RDF supply in Egypt are presented below. Recommendations for addressing most of these challenges
are discussed in Chapter 7.

•	 Illegal dumping: The ban on unauthorized landfills must be implemented and hefty fines imposed on the offenders, enforcing the “Polluter
     Pays” principal.

•	 Underdeveloped and inefficient waste management facilities: Existing facilities are currently treating about 10 percent of the generated
     MSW. A number of composting plants were shut down before ever beginning operations as a consequence of mismanagement,
     inappropriate technology selection, frequent mechanical breakdowns and poor maintenance (Elnaas et al., 2014). Most are in need of
     rehabilitation, and improved operation and maintenance systems.

•	 Lack of a national consensus on a MSW strategy: This includes overlapping and inefficient roles and responsibilities at the central
     government, governorate, and municipality levels. It is critical to address the lack of enforcement of the existing MSW framework.
     Primary waste sorting at the household level and promotion of MSW efficiency are also vital. The establishment of WMRA may help in
     changing this picture.




	 .2	Agricultural Waste
4

Approximately 30-35 million tons in 2012 of different types of agricultural residues were generated throughout Egypt (NSWMP, 2013).
Approximately seven to nine million tons, mainly residues from wheat, were used as animal feed. Another four to seven million tons were
used as organic fertilizers and around two to four million tons were used by farmers for other purposes (MWRI, 2005; El Essawy, 2014).
Approximately 12 to 15 million tons/year of agricultural waste is unused, disposed of, or burned (El Essawy, 2014). This presents enormous
untapped potential.


4.2.1 Agricultural Waste Supply in Egypt

Burning unused agricultural waste in open fields, especially rice straw, is a common practice among Egyptian farmers, contributing to the
seasonal “Black Cloud” phenomenon. Despite the efforts of the Ministry of Environment to discourage this practice, it remains the most
convenient way to dispose of waste, given the high cost of collection, storage and transportation. However, there have been some important
efforts to collect and process rice straw residues in order to reduce its negative impacts. The EEAA and the Ministry of Agriculture collected
and handled 365,274 tons in 2011 (EEAA, 2012).

In Egypt, wheat and barley residues as well as rice husk are fully used for animal feeding. For the most part, rice straw, cotton waste,
sugarcane residues, corn stalks, and tree pruning wastes are not currently of interest to any other consumers. Approximately 10-15 percent
of rice straw is used in the production of compost and in other agriculture-related applications, leading to the yearly open burning of 70-80
percent of the remaining waste. The high silica content of new rice varieties (12-15 percent) renders rice straw inedible.

This study selected the following types of crop residues to be considered for AFR: sugar cane, sugar beet, cotton waste, rice straw, corn husk,
and tree trimmings from orchards (refer to Annex D for details). According to the primary data collected from the Ministry of Agriculture
(Table 15), a total of 21.4 million tons of waste was generated from these crops in 2012. Only about half, or around 10.7 million tons/year,
would be available for AFR, because of inefficient collection on the one hand, and alternative uses such as animal fodder on the other. An
additional 1.3–4.5 million tons annually are potentially available from other agricultural waste streams (i.e. Casurina, medical and aromatic
plants), which were not included in this study.

There are three growing seasons in Egypt (Figure 13): winter from October/November to May/June, summer from April/May to October,
and Nili from July/August to October (FAO, 2016). The summer growing season, which yields maize stover, cotton stalk, sugarcane residues
and rice straw, contributes 65-75 percent of total agricultural residues.

The Nili (or autumn) growing season involves maize stover and tree pruning, and contributes 7-8 percent of total agricultural residues. The
winter growing season contributes only 18-20 percent of total agricultural waste residue, including wheat straw, vegetable straw and tree
trimmings. Trees trimmings contribute 6-10 percent of total agricultural residues and are available all year round.

Agricultural waste in Egypt is, as one would expect, highly concentrated around the Nile and Nile Delta areas, as seen in Figure 14. Table
16 summarizes the most prevalent sources of agricultural waste for use as AFR in Egypt. Further information on the geographic distribution
of agricultural activities and potential waste sources can be accessed at: http://arcg.is/1ToAspz

4.2.2 Challenges in Using Agricultural Waste as AFR

Despite its availability in significant quantities, the supply of agricultural waste as AFR is challenging due to the following constraints:

•	 Agricultural residues are usually burned in open fields.
     o	   Farmers tend to burn crop waste quickly to remove residues, prepare their limited land area for the next crop, prevent pests and
          reduce the risk of fire.
     o	   There are often no feasible alternatives to burning, as paved roads rarely exist for the heavy transportation of raw waste or for
          balling equipment to reach the fields. Industry demand already exists to process biomass commercially, except for local composting,
          which represents between 10-15 percent of the waste materials.
     o	   Regulations and enforcement procedures related to the burning of crop residue are often contradictory, due to the involvement of
          several government agencies.




•	 Collection, storage and transportation are expensive.
     o	   Agricultural land ownership is fragmented, and land tenure is primarily made up of small-hold farmers.
     o	   The seasonal changes in crop export policies, especially for rice, creates an uncertain situation on the total outputs and the total
          cultivated land devoted to rice every season, with a minimum of 462,000 - 500,000 hectares per year, in addition to an instability
          in the cropping areas of corn and sugarcane. Cotton areas are also decreasing.
     o	   Rice straw has low bulk densities; the bulk density of chopped straw is 50 - 120 kg/m3, which is very low compared with the bulk
          densities of coal, which is in the range of 560 - 600 kg/m3 for brown coal and between 800 and 900 kg/m3 for bituminous coal. The
          low densities of the rice straw complicate their processing, transportation, storage and firing. Special attention should be paid to
          shredding and balling equipment in order to produce high density balls to reduce storage area and transportation cost.



•	 Interventions by authorities are limited.
     o	   There is a signed protocol between the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture to combat the Black Cloud
          phenomenon and convert rice straw to fertilizers and animal fodder. This “Small Farms Project” aims to recycle 100,000 tons of
          rice straw produced by farmers who own properties of five feddans or less. Of the total, 90,000 tons is converted into fertilizer and
          10,000 into animal fodder. Two options are proposed to the farmers in order to stop their burning of rice straw: either pile up the
          excess straw to be converted into fertilizers or sell it to companies. The government provides a subsidy of EGP 90 for each ton of
          rice straw the companies collect and press.
     o	   With this intervention, it has been possible to bail up to one million tons per season for rice straw and transfer the baled straw to
          the side of the field to reduce the storage area. The companies contracted for the work use a maximum of 25 percent of baled straw
          for composting, but they do not have the capacity for further processing. Consequently, the leftover rice straw that should have
          been collected and recycled exceeded government capacities, and authorities announced at the end of August 2014 that they were
          unable to collect all of it.
     o	   Many farmers still choose to burn their rice straw, as they need to clear their land of agricultural waste after the rice harvest.
          Furthermore, fertilizer projects are not economically viable. Roughly two tons of rice straw are used to produce one ton of fertilizer,
          at a cost of EGP 300 per ton. Yet every ton of fertilizer is sold for only about EGP 150.

	 .3	 Sewage Sludge
4

There are 357 municipal wastewater treatment plants under the supervision of the Egyptian National Holding Company of Water and
Wastewater (HCWW) throughout Egypt’s 25 governorates. The waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) had a total installed capacity of
13,266,159 m3/day as of 2013. The estimated total annual national sewage sludge generation in Egypt was approximately 1 million tons in
2014. Table 17 describes in detail the quantities of sewage sludge per region.



4.3.1 Sewage Sludge Supply in Egypt

Cairo, Giza and Alexandria governorates produce the largest quantities of sludge, as compared to all other governorates. Together, they
generate over 50 percent of the total amount of sludge (Figure 15). Upper Egypt produces the least sludge, mainly due to lower availability
of wastewater services, and thus low treatment capacities.

Sludge generation is expected to continuously grow along with Egypt’s growing population and anticipated investments in new wastewater
treatment facilities. But there are shortcomings in the data available. While there are WWTPs located within new urban cities and huge
industrial factories, limited information about sludge generation is available.

4.4.2 Challenges in Using TDF as AFR

As noted above, EEAA regards used tires as hazardous waste, and as such the regulations are more restrictive than those of the Basel
Convention, which does categorize used tires as hazardous. As such, the intent to provide environmental protection through the regulated
treatment of waste tires has prevented potentially more economic uses of this waste stream, and at this time, waste tires may not legally be
burned in cement (or other) kilns.

The main challenges to increasing the use of TDF as an AFR for the cement sector include the following:

•	   Lack of legal and institutional arrangements for waste tire management, collection, transportation and disposal, as they are considered
     hazardous waste;

•	   Competitive uses in recycling and rubber manufacturing industries, which have contributed to a substantial increase in scrap tire prices;

•	   Illegal re-treading of scrap tires throughout the country;

•	   Fluctuations in used tire prices due to fluctuations in demand;

•	   Open burning of waste tires, because of a pervasive lack of law enforcement.




	 .5 Summary
4

All of the waste sources which have been reviewed here are available in sufficient volumes to meet the AFR requirements of cement
manufacturers, with the exception of TDF, as summarized in Table 19. This will be further discussed in the next chapter.

MSW and agricultural waste are available in the largest volumes, but each comes with unique challenges. The current low levels of collection,
sorting, recycling and disposal for MSW underscore the low level of organization, oversight and law enforcement in the MSW sector.
Attractive investment opportunities for waste operators exist at the 64 government collection sites, although many remain unused or are in
need of rehabilitation.

For agricultural waste, the residues are voluminous and require little preparation. But the challenge for a supplier would be to organize an
efficient collection method and convince farmers to save waste for collection, rather than burning it as they have always done.

DSS is available in large quantities with limited or no competing uses. The high calorific value DSS offers makes it an ideal fuel, but investors
face technological challenges to ensure the water content of the waste is low enough to be suitable for AFR.

Tires are an excellent source of fuel and the most organized of the four potential AFR. Thus, waste suppliers face stiffer demand from
competitive uses which puts pressure on pricing and availability.

This overview of the AFR supply picture makes it clear that the Egyptian market can meet the needs of the cement sector. However, the cost
of these potential fuel options, and the demand by the cement sector for AFR products, must be evaluated. For example, while these various
waste streams in Egypt may be plentiful, the costs of pre-processing the waste material to a suitable standard must be considered. Costs of
pre-processing vary significantly for each waste stream. Both the demand considerations and the pricing and economic considerations of the
AFR solution in Egypt will be explored in the next two chapters.

Cement Industry Demand

	5.1 Egypt’s Cement Industry

Egypt is the 12th largest cement producer worldwide (Figure 17). It has 25 operating cement plants, 13 of which are subsidiaries of international
conglomerates. Together the firms produce the equivalent of 64 percent of installed capacity. The remaining 12 firms are locally owned. For
the purposes of this study, three plants have been excluded, as their primary product is white cement, for which AFR is unsuitable. The
remaining 22 cement companies have a total annual clinker capacity of approximately 62 million tons and a total annual cement capacity
of 68 million tons.

	5.2          Cement Production Forecast by 2025

In order to assess the potential use of AFR, it is necessary to understand the current and future energy needs of the Egyptian cement industry
based on existing and forecast cement production (Figure 20). In 2014, total cement consumption was estimated to be 51.5 million tons
per year, representing a 2.7 percent increase over total consumption in 2013 (Carré, 2014). In 2013, the Egyptian cement industry showed
a negative growth of -1 percent. As previously noted, the main reasons were severe fuel supply shortages, rising costs (50 percent increases
in natural gas and HFO prices) and the volatile political situation, which resulted in a sharp economic downturn from which Egypt hadn’t
yet begun to recover (Naeem Holding, 2013). In 2014, the fuel shortage remained severe, strongly affecting clinker and cement production.
Capacity utilization rates dropped below 50 percent in some plants; others had to shut down temporarily. Consequently, many cement plants
had to import clinker as they could not produce their own, and this led to higher costs (Global Cement, 2015).

exceed five-year periods, and many do not disclose the methodology. Egypt’s Industrial Development Authority, the body charged
with licensing for new projects, has announced market demand of 80 million tons by 2020, which would represent an average
growth rate of 7.5 percent for the next five years (IDA, 2015). Consumption growth stood at only 1.9 percent during the last five
year period. This scenario is considered far too optimistic, according to interviews with representatives of the cement industry.14

Assuming that the current 6.4 percent AFR substitution rates remain static, and that all remaining thermal needs for the production of clinker
are to be met using coal and petcoke (average calorific value for the purpose of the calculation being 7,000 kcal/kg),16 the theoretical volumes
of coal indicated in Table 20 would be needed.

    the burning of fossil fuels to heat the kiln and electricity consumption to operate machinery indirectly results in CO2 emissions. The calcination process accounts for ~50% of all CO2 emissions
    from cement production, while the combustion of fossil fuels to heat the kiln represents around 40% of cement emissions. Finally, the electricity used to power additional plant machinery,

others remained at 0 percent, resulting in an overall average TSR target of 30 percent by 2025. It should be noted that many of these targets

     Box 2: IN BRIEF: POLAND’S ALTERNATIVE FUEL SECTOR

     Cement sector commitment and quick responses to market opportunities have been the key to success in Poland. In
     1998, the country adopted its first waste regulation protocol, which included a Marshall Tax on landfilling. Alternative fuel
     substitution rates grew slowly with that first step. By 2011, the Polish Ministry of Environment launched a target to divert
     50 percent of all municipal solid waste from landfills. Their ambitious plan included reducing further landfilling to only
     35 percent by 2020 (a 65 percent diversion rate). Moreover, since 2013, Poland has enforced a landfill ban on combustible
     waste. Close to 25 percent of the MSW is now being converted into RDF. As such, Poland’s cement industry is the highest
     contributor to the country’s waste reduction targets (Theulen, 2013; Theulen, 2015).

     Another waste stream – used tires – also saw an important change. With the implementation of an Extended Producer
     Responsibility principle, tire manufacturers established a joint firm to manage used tires. Collection became more
     organized and was directly subsidized by the tire sector.

     In parallel, as competition for used tires and other alternative fuel sources grew, cement plants invested in their own
     handling facilities for RDF. This move created a spiral impact and boosted demand beyond the local market. The cost-
     effectiveness of RDF preparation was improved. As time passed, the capacities of RDF production lines reached equilibrium
     with cement plants’ alternative fuel capacities, allowing cement firms the ability to pressure RDF producers to further
     improve the quality of their product. RDF suppliers responded, and cement firms developed new tools to improve drying
     by, for instance, installing thermal dryers that use the waste heat of the cement kiln.

     Poland had a substitution rate of 45 percent in 2011. Today, the figure has exceeded 60 percent, with some plants boasting
     thermal substitution rates higher than 85 percent.

     The Polish example can provide key lessons. Business adaptation to changing market opportunities is essential. Long-
     term contractual agreements with the waste management sector has also proved to be of central relevance. Quality
     standards gradually improved under competitive pressure. Finally, the regulatory environment and a government
     commitment to enforce regulations provided the enabling infrastructure to allow the alternative fuel market the space to
     grow sustainably and commercially.




ŊŊ   Egyptian authorities should increase enforcement on the
     prohibition of uncontrolled landfilling and illegal dumping;       A 30 percent TSR in 2025 would require 20.4 million Gcal

made it clear that AFR sources are available in Egypt which would
allow a 13.6 percent TSR growth between now and 2025, a total
13.6 million GCal to reach a 20 percent TSR by 2025.


     Based on this scenario, by 2025 cement plants could be spending
     around $217 million annually on procuring AFR (based on an
     average of $16 per Gcal). This would also represent annual
     savings for the cement industry of $51 million, in comparison
     with estimated coal prices. These savings would also obviate
     spending hard currency needed for coal imports. Emissions
     could be reduced from the baseline by 3.9 million tCO2 in
     2025, meeting 74 percent of the GHGs compliance target set

Table 26 compares the various scenarios, as well as the costs and benefits to the cement sector for each of the scenarios. The table includes
an assessment of how much the industry could potentially spend per year in procuring pre-processed AFR, as well as the potential savings
in comparison to coal.

Should the BAU scenario be successful, about 1.9 million tons of coal could be reduced by 2025. In comparison to Scenario 3, where
stakeholders do not take the required measures to improve the use of AFR, about 1.2 million tons of coal could be reduced by 2025. Such
savings could even reach 2.9 million tons of coal in 2025, if Egyptian stakeholders decide to aggressively reform the current waste-to-energy
infrastructure in the country.


76
However, in order to reach this BAU scenario of 20 percent TSR, a combination of the various waste streams would be needed. No single
waste stream could meet the demand, as shown in Table 27. Together, the waste streams would offer approximately 13.6 million GCal. In
addition, a diversified AFR fuel base would reduce concerns over supply reliability.

Achieving the BAU 20 percent TSR target in 2025 will require an additional 13.6 percent in AFR substitution. This would be an equivalent of
a 10.7 million GCal increase from current levels. The total calorific thermal needs of the cement sector in Egypt in 2014 were approximately
46 million GCal per year (945 kcal/kg clinker produced). In 2025, it is expected that clinker production will have increased to 72 million
tons per year, requiring a total of 68 million GCal per year.

Based on the projected thermal demand by 2025, and after assessing the available volumes for each AFR waste stream, can the cement sector
realistically reach 20 percent TSR by 2025 in Egypt? Table 27 below indicates an initial answer of “yes.” This is technically achievable based
on available supply, but must be further evaluated according to the economics of AFR (see Chapter 6). The assumptions are based on various
factors, including a) volumes available, b) accessibility of the waste stream, c) current contribution to the total AFR market and d)
calorific values.




                            Table 27: Estimated Additional AFR Volumes Required to Reach 20% TSR by 2025



In conclusion, this chapter has shown that the amounts needed to reach the 20 percent TSR target in Egypt are indeed achievable with the
current AFR supply. However, investments and related market building efforts will be necessary in order to tap into each waste stream.
Reaching a 30 percent TSR may prove challenging, given the competing uses and (mis)uses of the various AFR waste streams, particularly
in the absence of regulatory support.

The next chapters will turn to determining if the 20 percent TSR targets are economically viable, and to examining supply chain developments
that may be required in order for alternative fuels to become a sustainable industry and fuel source for the cement sector.

6.1 Introduction

The entry of coal into the Egyptian energy landscape can be expected
to create fierce competition for other fuel sources, but there is still
a market for waste-based alternative fuels in Egypt and a potential
appetite for investing in co-processing solutions, if the commercial
and business opportunities are captured quickly. AFR could
theoretically compete with coal on a large scale as a secondary fuel,
provided AFR prices are competitive. But for the two to compete,
the price difference between traditional fuels, coal and petcoke, and
alternative fuels must take into account the additional costs to be
borne by the cement sector.

While it is true that coal will have similar cost elements, it will have
greater economies of scale. AFR may in the end see greater specific
costs and externalities per unit, due to lower quantities used – unless
AFR use can be facilitated at a large scale. AFR prices on a like-for-
like basis must be less than the main fossil fuel used by cement plants
in order to compete. Capital costs (CAPEX) and operational costs
                                                                            Figure 24: Natural Gas Price Increases Pre- and Post- July 2014

6.2 Fossil Fuels

6.2.1 Fossil Fuel Prices and Externalities
As previously mentioned, natural gas prices were raised significantly
on a complex usage-dependent scale after the Egyptian Government
announcement in July 2014 on energy price increase for petroleum
products and electricity. Figure 24 shows increases in natural gas fuel
prices in Egypt before and after the price increase announcement.
Although Figure 24 indicates that the cement sector experienced
only modest increases in natural gas pricing in the pre- vs. post-
2014 energy crisis, the overall net impact on the sector is significant
because the sector alone consumed 46 percent of all natural gas
allotted to energy-intensive industrial sectors in Egypt. In addition,
this was the second significant price increase for the cement sector,
since as late as 2011/2012 cement companies were paying about                  Figure 25: Natural Gas Consumption in Energy Intensive

Similarly, prices of HFO in Egypt pre- and post-2014 have risen significantly (Figure 26), depending on the industry. Cement companies, the
hardest hit of all energy-intensive sectors, suffered a 50 percent increase.

Coarse waste can only be fed to the calciner, or, in a limited way, to the kiln inlet. Coarse solid feeding lines usually consist of:

•	    a storage area – for best practice, it requires enclosed storage, typically a hall operated with a loader, and several pits operated with a bridge
      crane. Considering the variety and limited size of waste streams in Egypt, pre-blending is generally done manually in the storage space;

•	    a dosing system – generally a belt weigh-feeder;

•	    a mechanical transport to the calciner – generally a tube-belt conveyer or its equivalent. For best practice, it requires a closed system, not
      a simple belt conveyer to avoid dispersion caused by windy conditions;

•	    an injection system – typically a double or triple flap valve. For best practice, it requires an additional safety (emergency) sliding valve.

The typical cost for the coarse solid feeding line22 for one kiln is between $2 million and $5 million,23 depending on the storage capacity, the
maximum throughput, and the conveyor length. Significant economies of scale can be realized when such lines feed several kilns, as storage
areas could be shared. This system accepts a variety of coarse solid AFR, and a range of consistencies. The use of AFR may make equipment
modification necessary to prevent inefficiencies in the feeding line. The other alternative would be to use only specific RDF of a high density
and calorific value.

One of the cement plants where interviews were conducted is equipped with a HOTDISC that is integrated to the calciner. This system allows
for the co-processing of coarser waste, including bigger 3D materials such as full tires, RDF 300-500mm. However, investment in this case
was significantly higher: approximately $10 to $15 million.

Typical operational expenses for co-processing waste vary between $2 to $5 per Gcal, depending on the volume throughput and labor cost,
to be compared with $2.5 per Gcal for coal on average, which includes grinding, drying and storing.

22	 Such a system allows for feeding at the calciner with various coarse solid AFR, typically 50-90 mm for 3D material and 100-200 mm for 2D material. The feeding of tire chips, agricultural
    waste or coarse RDF can be done using the same feeding line. Nevertheless, since the system is designed for a specific volumetric throughput, a very low density of RDF and certain agricultur-
    al waste (sometimes as low as 0.08 t/m3) can limit the maximum thermal substitution rate which can be achieved, if the system was not originally designed for very light material. Moreover,
    the blending of waste of different size and density is not very efficient. This explains the existence of bottlenecks in certain plants. The design volumetric throughput of the RDF feeding line
    can restrict increased AFR use. Without modifying the equipment of this line, the only way out is to use alternative fuels with a higher density or calorific value, such as TDF. Pelletizing RDF
    could be an option, but is rarely economically feasible. Designing a fully polyvalent feeding line using the full range of AFR in high volumes is technically impossible. Each technology has its
    own limits in terms of AFR physical characteristics (granulometry, density, elasticity, abrasiveness) and throughput (design capacity).

It is worth noting that co-processing electro-mechanical equipment already present in the plants, which were visited as part of this study, can
generally be considered of “high quality.” They are supplied by well-known and experienced suppliers.

Only two of the plants interviewed are using basic equipment. One is equipped for DSS, with a very basic injection system: hopper and
injection screw feeding the coarse waste conveyer. This is adequate for limited volumes, but is not yet in use. The second plant is equipped
with a basic pneumatic injection system for fine agricultural waste (ground rice straw). These two examples can be considered “pilot
projects” rather than a true initiation of co-processing, due to the limited throughput and the insignificant impact on the plants’ fuel costs.
No real cost savings can be realized at these limited levels.

Most Egyptian plants are quite modern, and thus could theoretically accept TSR up to 30 percent without significant kiln modifications
and related investments, such as calciner and cyclones upgrades. Only the investment related to the feeding of the AFR would be required.
Furthermore, in specific regions, chlorine content in raw materials is high, but all plants are already equipped with a chloride (Cl) by-pass
system. This could be an opportunity for profitable RDF use of this available by-pass capacity and related chlorine input capacity. Detailed
chloride balances would be required for each plant in order to establish Cl acceptance criteria for AFR use.

Though achieving limited five to fifteen percent TSR is relatively easy, reaching high TSR (> 20 to 30 percent) requires technical knowledge
that needs to be encouraged and developed in Egypt. TSR development will follow the learning curve, depending mainly on the efforts of the
cement producers to acquire this knowledge and train their employees. International producers (which represent the majority of installed
capacity) have this technical knowledge at the corporate level,24 and are thus likely to lead the market to higher TSR levels.


      6.3.2 Economics of Alternative Fuels
Evaluating the economic viability of AFR is a complex task, given the variety of sources and the requirements of pre-processing. However,
the following sections will provide an overview of the economics for this waste stream as an alternative to coal and petcoke.

6.3.2.1 Purchasing the Source Material

The purchase price of raw and semi-processed AFR materials varies across regions within Egypt, as well as from one supplier to another. The
variation is also dependent on the type of AFR. In addition to the purchase price of the raw materials, transportation costs and the calorific
value of the AFR are also important cost and value determinates. The prices described in the table below are indicative, representing the
average values collected through field interviews conducted in 2015.

          may be prohibitive for co-processing in a cement plant; pelletized fuel is mainly for domestic use and for co-processing in power
          plants or industrial boilers.

•	    Dried Sewage Sludge from Wastewater Treatment Plants
      Typically, sludge from wastewater treatment plants has a moisture content of between 50-80 percent. Before sludge can be co-processed,
      it should preferably be dried to below 20 percent water content, and homogenized. The different options for sludge preparation for co-
      processing are as follows:

      Sludge at 80 to 60 percent moisture content

     ŊŊ   If no significant fee is paid, no cement plant will consider co-processing sludge with a moisture content of 80 percent or above
          because of the difficulties in handling and injection, and the negative impact on kiln process (almost no heating value, loss of
          production capacity, risk regarding the flame temperature). Sewage sludge with very high moisture can be eliminated through the
          cement kiln, but since it has almost no calorific value, it cannot be considered as a viable option for energy recovery and thus the
          cement plant should be fully paid for the service.
     ŊŊ   Sludge can be directly injected into the riser duct using a concrete pump.

     Sludge at approximately 50 percent of moisture content

     ŊŊ   Pre-processing can occur by co-grinding the sludge together with coal or petcoke in the coal mill. It requires on one hand spare
          capacity in the coal mill (thermal power) and on the other a limit to the sludge volume so as not to exceed the volatile organic
          compounds (VOCs) emission limit at the stack of the coal mill. The dried sludge is then mixed with the ground coal, and they are
          fired together.
     ŊŊ   Pre-processing in a sludge dryer can reduce moisture content to below 30 percent. Various technologies are available, generally with
          significant investment or significant operational cost. Waste heat from the clinker cooler or from the flue gas of the kiln can be used,
          as well as biological degradation or solar energy. In Egypt, solar drying is an option. After drying, the sludge is screened, and then
          co-processed in a standard feeding line (generally using pneumatic transport).

     Sludge at between 15 and 30 percent moisture content

     ŊŊ   Direct feeding can take place, together with other solid alternative fuels, via a mechanical transport feeding the calciner. This
          solution would be not be appropriate for dusty dried sludge in typical calciner feeding lines.
     ŊŊ   Direct feeding to the calciner or the main burner can take place using a dedicated line with pneumatic transport.

     Since sewage sludge can sometimes contain large amounts of pollutants, such as heavy metals or phosphate, a strict quality control
     system must be in place.

•	    Tire Derived Fuel from Scrap Tires
      If no specific co-processing line for whole tires is installed, scrap tires must be shredded into chips of between 50mm and 90mm.

      These waste streams are clearly feasible as potential AFR for the cement industry. The costs of the necessary pre-processing, CAPEX and
      OPEX, are summarized in Table 32 and Table 33 based on interviews with cement companies and consultant experience.

Taking into consideration the level of CAPEX required to pre-process each waste stream, and the conclusions to be drawn from Table 32, a
high level estimate of the total additional investment required by 2025 for BAU Scenario is provided in Table 34. This estimate is calculated by
dividing the pre-processing capacity of each waste stream,25 then the result is multiplied by the CAPEX of this specific capacity. For example, for
50,000 tons of tree trimmings pre-processing capacity (refer to Table 32) is divided by 1.5 million tons in volume required in 2025 under BAU
Scenario, then multiplied by $1.62 million CAPEX to result in a total investment figure of $49 million (refer to Table 34).

88
Consequently, the total investment required to pre-process the required AFR amounts to reach a 20 percent TSR by 2025 will range between
$100 - 121 million. This investment scale is directly correlated with the increase of the AFR thermal substitution rate. For example, it could
reach up to $320 million if AFR pre-processing equipment is newly installed/re-habilitated in the 64 sorting and composting plants currently
existing in Egypt (calculated on the assumption that on average $5 million investment would be allocated per plant).

While total CAPEX needs for co-processing across Egypt’s entire cement sector have not been estimated,26 this investment picture represents
significant opportunity to attract investors and financial institutions to promote the AFR market. In general, the economic feasibility of AFR
pre-processing projects, with the exception of TDF, results in an internal rate of return (IRR) of above 15 percent and a payback period of
three to five years. However, this estimate should be confirmed through detailed feasibility studies on a project-by-project basis.



6.3.3 Comparison: Economics of Fossil Fuels versus AFR

Various fuel types have different calorific values, and so the cost of each combustible is expressed in $per Gcal to be comparable.
For example, the average calorific value of heavy fuel oil (HFO) is 9,600 kcal/kg, whereas it is approximately 3,300 kcal/kg27 for
agricultural waste.

Since the start of the energy crisis, cement plants in Egypt have rarely used only a single fuel type, but rather have been co-processing with
multiple fuels. Information gathered during interviews with the cement companies has allowed the 2014/2015 fuel mix cost to be estimated
at an average of $30 per ton of clinker, based on a fuel mix including natural gas, other fuels such as HFO and including an overall average
of six percent AFR. The price per Gcal of each fuel has been collected from the surveyed cement plants. In Figure 29, the bars represent
individual value per plant and the encircled number is the average.

6.4 Summary

As long as coal is available, it will likely be the primary combustible used by Egypt’s cement industry. This is not simply a product of price
competitiveness, but also due to coal’s physical and chemical properties when used in the clinker process.

However, it must also be noted that AFR could compete with coal prices and contribute to economic savings for the sector, if produced at
scalable levels. To achieve this, the price difference between traditional fuels, such as coal, and AFR must cover the following additional costs
borne by the cement plant in procuring and utilizing AFR:

•	    the amortization of the additional equipment that must be installed by the cement plant to co-process the AFR, such as the storage and
      handling equipment, and the dosing system.

•	    the additional operational cost related to co-processing, including the cost of the utilities (mainly electricity and compressed air), the
      wear part cost and the labor cost for operation and maintenance. This would also include any negative impact of the AFR on the kiln
      process and equipment, resulting in increased maintenance of the kiln system.

•	    the cost related to the sourcing of the waste, such as the labor cost of the AFR commercial team, and costs related to the AFR quality
      assurance lab.

•	    the cost related to the potential reduction of clinker production capacity because of the use of AFR.

To summarize, HFO is not widely available and will be unable to compete with coal in terms of price.28 AFR, however, offers a potentially
abundant, locally available and price competitive alternative to coal if produced at scale, and at required quality specifications.



28	 Future HFO and diesel in fuel mix is not expected to exceed five percent, according to interviews with the Egyptian Cement Producers Association.

•	   Waste management service providers perceive waste as any
     standard combustible and want to align its price per energy
     content (in Gcal) to coal and petcoke.

•	   Waste management providers would be willing to invest if the

The economic feasibility of each scenario is assessed based on comparing the final RDF cost to the cost of coal at the burner tip. In Table 38,
the RDF cost breakdown is detailed for each scenario along the entire operation chain at the pre-processing facility: from receipt of MSW,
to drying, baling, and transport to the cement plant. After this, the costs of RDF storage, co-processing CAPEX, and production losses from
water content in RDF are accounted for. In Table 39, the final RDF cost by energy content is compared to the average cost of coal of $19.8
per Gcal. It can be concluded that RDF pre-processing projects, under the five scenarios are in fact economically feasible. Scenario 3 and
Scenario 4 are the most economically feasible, while Scenario 2 is the least feasible, at price ranges 51 percent and 76 percent lower to coal
respectively.

Therefore, there are significant opportunities for RDF in the short-term which can be pursued by private sector investors, as well as public
stakeholders through establishing and securing commercial arrangements. These arrangements include improved investor access to disposal
sites, such as landfills and composting sites, and prevailing MSW to investors at zero cost.

Scenarios 3 and 4 are the most economically attractive in comparison with coal, since they include additional revenue streams from gate
fees and proceeds from recyclables. Even when there is no separation at source under scenario 3, the gate fee and the selling of the small
recyclables portion should cover the cost to the investor of sorting at the RDF pre-processing facility. This RDF price under these two
scenarios should be the medium- to long-term objective, given the institutional changes required. Two government interventions will be
necessary to 1) establish source separation, 2) sustain it through transport to an RDF pre-processing facility, and finally to 3) enforce the
payment of the gate fee or tipping fee. The economics could be further improved if a portion of the taxes levied on coal imports could be
credited to the cement companies per ton of RDF.

The above factors will be further elaborated upon as recommendations for RDF upscale in Egypt.

Investor Access to Disposal Sites

As described in Chapter 4, a portion of the 60 percent of MSW collected annually in Egypt (equivalent to 12.6 million tons per year) is
delivered to the 64 compost plants. The pre-processing of MSW to produce RDF consists of two main steps, excluding the composting
processes, as shown in Figure 32:

•	   (i) Sorting of the MSW (sorting plant).

•	   (ii) Shredding of the light combustible fraction of the MSW (shredding plant).

    Aggregation Scenarios
    The supply chain of used tires for cement plants is often based on direct agreements with manufacturers. In cases where
    there are multiple buyers and suppliers, aggregation emerges as a key route to support material recovery efforts.

    One case study involved South Africa’s Recycling and Economic Development Initiative (REDISA). Established in 2012 to
    reduce the environmental and health impacts of poor tire-management practices, the initiative put together a collection
    network to discourage the opening burning of discarded tires. This aggregation effort helped increase collected volumes
    from 4 to 70 percent of end-of-life volumes from 2013 to 2015 (Engel et al., 2016).

    REDISA is working on developing commercial and environmentally sustainable infrastructure for tire treatment. At larger
    streams, it becomes easier to distribute to processors across South Africa.

It is thus clear that both waste suppliers and cement plants need clear acceptance criteria when sourcing AFR. Precise acceptance criteria will
prevent conflicts between the cement plant and the waste provider by defining the conditions under which the cement plant can refuse the
waste. Pollutant content, moisture, minimum thermal energy content, particle size and shape will need to be defined. The cement plant will
have to be cautious when accepting waste and/or AFR because of the possible impact on emissions, on its kiln and on its final product. Trust
will have to be developed during years of collaboration, on a basis of clear and transparent contractual arrangements among all stakeholders.
Clear boundaries of responsibility must also be established in order to avoid misunderstandings.




8.3 Recommendations

Each of the four waste streams has different characteristics. RDF, DSS, and agricultural waste seem financially attractive, even when compared
with coal. Current prices of scrap tires appear to be higher. In order to organize the features of these four streams for more efficient decision-
making, they are prioritized below in Table 42.




                         Table 42: Prioritization of the Four Waste Streams as AFR for the Cement Sector in Egypt




The first priority should be agricultural waste, as it requires mainly logistical interventions, but limited CAPEX and OPEX. The second
priority should be dried sewage sludge, as it doesn’t depend on policy action and also requires limited CAPEX and OPEX. RDF is in third
place, as it requires high CAPEX and OPEX. Further, municipal waste availability depends heavily on the improvement of collection rates
and the overall management of waste across the country. The lowest priority is scrap tires, as the numerous alternative options to their co-
processing in cement kilns make their price unattractive.

DSS has the highest potential in the long term. If the largest part of the MSW and agricultural waste could be recycled or used as combustibles
in power plants, cement plants would be the most efficient way to eliminate DSS and avoid landfilling. Co-processing of this waste can begin
immediately if the WWTP agree to arranging to dry the sludge, according to cement plant specifications or other commercial arrangements,
as discussed earlier in Chapter 7.

RDF from MSW is usually the most complicated and costly non-industrial waste stream to co-process, because of the heterogeneity of its
content. This waste is widely available in Egypt, but will require a combination of financial incentives to become economically feasible. At
present, globally AFR from RDF is largely dependent on tipping fees. Therefore, in developing economies where tipping fees are limited, it is
recommended to start with waste streams requiring less investment and lower operating costs. The technical complexity of RDF preparation

Four basic oxides form cement clinker: calcium oxide (65 percent),
silicon oxide (20 percent), alumina oxide (10 percent) and iron            In most of the country, the raw materials (limestone and clay) are
oxide (5 percent)31. In the manufacturing of clinker, raw material is      extremely rich in chlorine. During the kiln process, the chlorine
fed into a rotary kiln heated to 2000°C. Two processes take place          forms salts which coat the cyclone stage walls and hinder or even
in the kiln:                                                               prevent clinker production. Inside the kiln, the chlorine is volatilized

guidelines by stating that cement quality must remain unchanged
with co-processing and the end product must not have any negative
impact on the environment. They suggest certain tests which are
regulated by the European Committee for Standardization;42 for
example, a leaching test to determine the release of dangerous
substances from construction products into soil, surface water and
groundwater.

Co-Processing Benefits

Co-processing is based on the principles of industrial ecology, which
considers the best features of the flow of information, materials,
and energy of biological ecosystems, with the aim of improving the
exchange of these essential resources in the industrial world.
