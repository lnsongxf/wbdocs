               FOREWORD

               The ground beneath Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies has shifted dramatically in recent years
               with the fall in global energy prices and competition from shale producers in North America. In addition,
               global climate change efforts have created uncertainty over the longer term prospects of all energy ex-
               porters, including the GCC. These developments have forced policy makers to look afresh at longer term
               structural reforms aimed at putting public finances on a sustainable footing, and for laying the founda-
               tions for diversified economies.

               To highlight the key challenges facing the region and to stimulate debate among policy makers and oth-
               er readers on how best to confront the challenges, the World Bank Group has decided to produce the
               Gulf Economic Monitor, a series of half-yearly reports on the GCC. This first edition, which covers the
               period until June 1, 2017, takes a close look at recent economic developments and short -term prospects
               for Gulf countries (“The Pulse of the Region”). It also includes forecasts for the individual Gulf nations
               and an analytical (“In Focus”) section that explores structural reform priorities in the region.

               The Monitor describes a region where green shoots of recovery are emerging, helped by a partial recov-
               ery in global energy prices over the past year. The salutary effect on public finances, along with past
               fiscal consolidation efforts are providing the space for governments to slow fiscal austerity and also
               buoying investor sentiment. Accordingly, aggregate growth in GCC countries is expected to rise from 1.3
               percent in 2017—the weakest pace since 2009—to 2.6 percent in 2019 supported by a gradual strength-
               ening of activity in the non-oil sector and as oil prices stabilize at close to current levels. Fiscal and cur-
               rent account deficits are also on the mend, but are unlikely to return to the double -digit surpluses of the
               commodity boom years.

               Still, there remain significant downside risks on the horizon. These include renewed weakness or volatili-
               ty in global oil prices and/or spillovers to commodity and financial markets from geo -political tensions.
               Any abrupt tightening in global financial liquidity or turbulence in financial markets could affect funding
               costs to the GCC region, where financing needs remain large.

               Perhaps the biggest challenge on the domestic front will be to implement and sustain structural re-
               forms. As fiscal pressures have lessened, policy attention is shifting away from fiscal retrenchment to-
               wards deeper reforms. As discussed in the “In Focus” section, key fiscal and public sector reforms in-
               clude improving the management of hydrocarbon wealth to insulate the budget from volatility in energy
               prices and to enhance fiscal sustainability, building more effective and inclusive public sector institu-
               tions, reconfiguring the way that oil wealth is shared with citizens to strengthen incentives for diversifi-
               cation, and building safety nets to alleviate the impact of reforms on citizens. Credible reform agendas
               will also go a long way towards boosting investor and market confidence, and potentially setting in mo-
               tion a virtuous cycle of stronger investment, including FDI, and output growth in the near term.

America. The tightening of US monetary policy and rising
global geo-political risks could lead to bouts of turbulence in
global financial markets and volatility in capital flows. GCC
sovereign wealth funds have investments abroad, governments
have large deficits to finance, and banks have direct and indi-
rect exposures to real estate. Any sharp drop in asset values
(for instance in a period of global financial volatility or tight-
ening of global liquidity) will affect public and private sector
balance sheets and costs of funding. Over the medium - to long-
term, global climate mitigation efforts make for an increasingly
uncertain outlook.

On the domestic front, implementing broad based reforms is
the key challenge. As fiscal pressures have lessened, policy
attention will need to shift away from fiscal retrenchment to-
wards deeper structural reforms. The “In Focus” section dis-
cusses the need for fiscal and public sector reforms to be at the
core of these efforts, to help secure long -term fiscal sustaina-
bility and incentivize more productive, efficiency seeking be-
havior by firms and citizens that is needed to support long -term
economic diversification objectives. Strengthening public in-
vestment management systems would help enhance the quality
of investment and infrastructure spending in GCC countries,
and in turn stimulate the long-term supply potential of econo-
mies. Finally, by boosting investor and market confidence,
credible reforms agendas can potentially set in motion a virtu-
ous cycle of stronger investments, including FDI, and output
growth in the near term.

Conclusion
The agreement to manage oil supply by OPEC and some non -
OPEC producers in 2017 is expected to weigh on headline
growth, which is anticipated at 1.3 percent for the GCC coun-
tries in aggregate –the weakest since 2009. However indica-
tions are that activity and sentiment in the non -oil sector are
beginning to recover, supported by the increase in oil prices
over the past year. Fiscal pressures have also lessened, but fis-
cal deficits remain large in several GCC nations, and reform
priorities appear to be shifting toward deeper structural re-
forms. Efforts to strengthen fiscal and public financial manage-
ment will remain a core part of these policy reforms, as dis-
cussed in the “In Focus” section.

crease in staff and training, so that the country is ready to im-
plement it in 2018. These measures would free up resources for
more productive spending and reduce dependence on volatile
hydrocarbon revenues.

GCC countries are preparing for the implementation of a
VAT in 2018. It should be stressed that the VAT, unlike any
other tax, exposes the state to the possibility of collecting
negative revenue if Ministries of Finance have weak adminis-
trative capacity (this can arise with large -scale fraud on VAT
refunds). All countries implementing a VAT system suffer
from this risk, and GCC countries too should remain focused
in ensuring that administrative systems are being strength-
ened accordingly.

Conclusion

GCC countries received a substantial windfall from the surge
in global commodity prices during the commodity boom
years. However these years were also a period characterized
by high levels of government spending. High and rising fiscal
breakeven prices meant that there was limited fiscal room for
maneuver when global energy prices eventually fell in 2014.
Moreover, non-oil sectors remained small, held by real appre-
ciation of exchange rates and also by relatively poor business
environments.

With oil prices unlikely to return to the plus -$100/bbl level
anytime soon, GCC countries continue to face a period of sus-
tained fiscal adjustment, with countries with lower buffers and
higher debt needing to remain focused on frontloading fiscal
consolidation to ensure fiscal sustainability. The partial recov-
ery in oil prices over the past year and fiscal austerity already
undertaken has reduced fiscal pressures somewhat in the larger
GCC countries. However the need for fiscal reforms remains,
including strengthening the fiscal management of natural re-
source revenues through the adoption of rules based fiscal poli-
cies, building strong fiscal institutions and strengthening public
financial and investment management, and diversifying
sources of revenues. Among the GCC countries, the UAE has
shown leadership in adopting subsidy reforms, while the Saudi
Arabia has also begun to move ahead in terms of adopting
comprehensive structural reforms, including in public sector
finances and management.
