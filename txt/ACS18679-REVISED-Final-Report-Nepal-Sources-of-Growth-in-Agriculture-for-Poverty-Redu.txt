Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity	   xi
Executive Summary




Not many countries have experienced mass poverty reduction without first
increasing agriculture productivity (Johnston and Mellor, 1961; Timmer 1988,
2002). Agriculture contributes about 35 percent to the GDP of Nepal. But
growth in the sector has been quite volatile in the last decade, to the extent that
the lowest and highest growth rates were recorded in consecutive years. Agri-
culture in Nepal is characterized by relatively low yields compared to neigh-
boring countries. Moreover, land is disproportionately allocated to grain staples
(rice, maize, wheat, millet, barley, and buckwheat), despite fruits and vegetables
showing relatively higher yields and higher growth in consumption. While the
contribution of grain staples to agricultural GDP is only about 3 times higher
than fruits and vegetables, land allocation to grain staples is disproportionately
10 times higher. There are signs that farmers are diversifying away from grain
staples to fruits and vegetables, but the trend is unlikely to occur at a larger scale
unless: (i) there is broad-based productivity gains in main food grains to release
land to other crops and (ii) farmers with comparative advantage in fruits and
vegetables develop stable expectations that the market could be relied upon to
consistently deliver staples food at low cost.

Agriculture is an important sector for poverty reduction and shared prosper-
ity. Most of the poverty reduction between 2003–04 and 2010–11 occurred in
rural areas and was driven by rising agriculture incomes (World Bank, 2013).
A decomposition of the total income change shows that farm income and agri-
culture wage changed by 24.4 percent, followed by remittances (23 percent),
non-agriculture wages (22.8 percent) and enterprises income (18.3 percent).
The impact of agriculture on poverty reduction was highest among the bot-
tom 40 percent where agriculture incomes contributed about 39 percent of
their income gains, which is much higher than the 20 percent contribution of
remittances. However, investments in agriculture have remained low despite
increased agriculture incomes and substantial inflows of remittances. Remit-
tances have grown tremendously in recent years, reaching about 32 percent
of GDP in 2015–16 (GoN, 2016). Rural areas receive more remittances than
urban areas, although the average size is higher in urban areas. However, most of
the remittances are primarily used to finance consumption as opposed to invest-
ment in productive activities in agriculture and rural non-farm. It is estimated

      that only about 1.2 percent of remittances is invested in rural areas. This sug-
      gests there are some structural constraints to investments in agriculture and
      rural non-farm activities.

      A good understanding of the sources of agriculture growth would help identify
      what kind of agriculture offers most potential to further reduce poverty and
      boost shared prosperity. Growth in agricultural income can be generated by a
      number of factors, including higher yields, expansion in cropped area, change in
      real prices, or diversifying production from staples to high value fruits and veg-
      etables. On the demand side, the per-capita consumption of food is increasing
      fast in Nepal and at a rate that is much faster than India. Moreover, the propor-
      tion of consumption of home produced foods to total consumption reduced
      faster in Nepal than in India—by about 4 percentage points in Nepal com-
      pared to 2 percentage points in India. Food consumption has increased across
      all food categories and across the rural-urban divide. In addition, households
      are increasingly relying on food markets to meet their consumption needs. Yet
      much of the supply of this marketed food consists of imports as domestic value
      chains become less competitive and lose market share in Nepal’s domestic
      food market. Moreover, exports are declining. Nepal is increasingly becoming a
      net importer of food, both in high value foods such as fruits and vegetables as
      well as staples such as rice, potatoes, and maize. These trends lead to an impor-
      tant policy question of whether to consider an import substitution strategy to
      meet growing demand for food commodities and products. The answer largely
      depends on whether domestic value chains are able to compete with imports. A
      related policy issue is whether to embark on expanding exports of agricultural
      commodities, especially where there are comparative advantages. Expanding
      exports would require investments in infrastructure and a conducive regulatory
      environment to certify that products from Nepal achieve the various Sanitary
      and Phyto-sanitary standards of foreign markets.

      The main objective of this report is to identify policy and investment priorities
      to stimulate agricultural growth for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
      It ultimately seeks to inform strategic dialogue between Government of Nepal
      and the World Bank Group towards investments in agriculture and support-
      ing sectors, consistent with the Agriculture Development Strategy (2015). The
      report is organized to provide building blocks to identify policy and investments
      priorities. Following a brief Introduction, Chapter 2 examines the main driv-
      ers of agriculture for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The key issues
      addressed are drivers of agricultural income, drivers of total factor productivity
      growth, emerging patterns of diversification, degree of mechanization, and con-
      straints to investments in the sector. Chapter 3 examines the effects of public
      expenditures in fertilizer and seed distribution programs, paying specific atten-
      tion to effects on: supply of fertilizers, fertilizer application rates, retail prices,
      private sector participation, performance of the distribution chain, relative
      access between various categories of farmers, and consistency of the program

with inequalities in the distribution of poverty and food and nutritional security.
Chapter 4 generates lessons on policy and investments to expand exports. Chap-
ter 5 generates lessons on policy and investments to substitute imports. Chapter
6 provides overall recommendations for policy and investments priorities, while
distinguishing between actions needed to stimulate broad-based productivity
growth with actions needed for export promotion and import substitution.

Key Messages on Stimulating Broad-Based Productivity Growth
Going forward, any strategy for poverty reduction and shared prosperity
should include a national program for increasing broad-based agricul-
tural productivity through: developing new technologies and varieties
that are more productive, climate resilient, and more nutritious; dis-
semination of technologies and varieties; and high-impact innovative
extension approaches to ensure farmers are able to utilize technology
appropriately.1 While agriculture has proved to be important for poverty
reduction and shared prosperity, most of increase in agricultural income has been
due to higher producer prices. A decomposition of the change in crop income
indicates that on average about 78 percent was due to increased food prices,
while yields contributed about 22 percent, and land contraction decreased crop
income by about 9 percent. Productivity could be increased through technical
change, which occurs when farmers use newly released technologies that allows
them to shift to a new production frontier, or technical efficiency change which
occurs when farmers move closer to an existing production frontier. Already the
government is implementing the Agriculture and Food Security Project (AFSP)
in mid and far western hills and mountain districts with support from the World
Bank. The proposed program could involve expanding the AFSP nationally
while strengthening its technical components.

Efforts to stimulate broad-based agricultural growth should address the
main constraints to private investment in agriculture: which are lack
of technical knowledge on precision farming methods, weak irrigation
infrastructure, and weaknesses in the financial sector. The principal fac-
tors inhibiting growth in agricultural productivity in Nepal relate to the low lev-
els at which new practices and technologies are adopted by producers, and issues
in the financial sector that limit private investment in agricultural enterprises.
The two are closely related. If farmers have access to technical knowledge about
precision farming and the use of modern inputs and varieties, that would make
agriculture more attractive for investments. The lack of technical knowledge dis-
courages investments. Yet this is not the only constraint in Nepal. Another major
constrain is that bank lending policies require applicants for credit to own land
and to use it as collateral, which crowds-out a large section of farmers from credit
markets and undermines the flow of investible funds to farmers. The banking
lending policies impose a serious constraint on some of Nepal’s most innovative
and technically-skilled farmers—those who had gone abroad to work on farms in

      Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Gulf countries and returned with direct knowl-
      edge and experience of highly advanced, capital intensive production systems.
      Most of these farmers do not have their own lands, which partly explains why
      they had gone abroad, and so are unable to meet the collateral requirements of
      banks. Their investments in agriculture are therefore largely limited to the sav-
      ings they have accumulated abroad. Yet these returnees are potentially decisive
      agents of change, many of whom already disseminate the knowledge they have
      to neighboring farmers and even offer internships to college students. Many of
      them are also organized. About 80 percent of the 400 member Nepal Com-
      mercial Farmers Association are returnees. Therefore, enabling them and their
      neighbors to expand their operations through access to formal sources of credit
      has considerable potential to resolve one of the most basic constraints affecting
      agriculture in Nepal, and in so doing to transform agricultural production in the
      country. Such a transformation can take place through both improved technical
      efficiency that allows producers to move closer to an existing production fron-
      tier, and through technical change that enables them to shift to a new produc-
      tion frontier by using more modern practices and technologies.

      tion policies; introduce efficient and profitable use of fertilizers; and
      re-orient input distribution policies towards smart subsidies. Such a pro-
      gram would include Technical Assistance to redesign the input distribu-
      tion programs in a way that includes the private sector in the distribution
      channels and to deliver smart subsidies efficiently through successful
      models such as vouchers. Currently, the government subsidy program is sup-
      plying about 50 percent of the estimated demand for fertilizers. It’s unlikely the
      program could be expanded to cover all the demand without imposing major
      pressures on the national treasury, which is exactly what led to the disbanding
      of the previous subsidy program in 1996/97. Furthermore, the current program
      is supplying only Urea, DAP, and potash ­  fertilizers—with Urea occupying more
      than 60 percent of the subsidized quantities. Urea (46:0:0) constitutes of only
      Nitrogen (N) and no Phosphorous (P) or Potassium (K). It means there has
      been imbalanced use of fertilizers for the past several years which needs to
      be corrected through a national soil fertility management program. Addressing
      these imbalances would increase efficiency in the use of fertilizer and improve
      long-term farm profitability. This is important because sustaining long-term soil
      fertility and crop yields requires balanced use of all fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and
      K)—rather than predominantly N as has been the case in Nepal. Farmers that
      could use fertilizers profitably without subsidy should not be subsidized. The
      proposed soil fertility management program would help identify such farmers.
      The program would be integrated with smart subsidies that operate under the
      following principles: (a) target farmers that need to learn about proper use of
      fertilizers; (b) target farmers that could use fertilizers profitably but are not
      able to do so due to working capital constraints; and (c) deliver the subsidy

Executive Summary	


through the private sector by using modern voucher systems that have worked
in other countries—which is not necessarily what is being piloted in Nepal. A
good example of successful voucher programs is in Senegal where the World
Bank funded West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program is delivering smart
subsidies through e-vouchers. Other examples of voucher schemes are in Nige-
ria, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, and Liberia.

Smart subsidies can also be used for social welfare purposes, with inputs
targeted to address food insecurity and nutrition status as well. Often
time’s governments have implemented welfare programs aimed at addressing
poverty and contributing to national development—for example employment
guarantee programs, conditional cash transfers, and pension schemes. Input sub-
sidies could also be designed as welfare schemes to address inequality in poverty,
food insecurity, and nutrition status. In the context of Nepal, this is important
because under the current program most of the subsidies are going to the Cen-
tral region. This region has consistently received most of the chemical fertilizer
every year since the program was introduced in 2008 and it’s share has ranged
from 45 percent in 2009/10 to 53 percent in 2010/11 and 2012/13. However,
both the proportion of poor people and the absolute number of poor people
are lower in Central region and highest in Western region. Furthermore, data
from the National Demographic and Health Survey 2011 show that Food and
Nutrition Security (FNS) indicators are worse in the Western region of Nepal.
For example, the rate of stunting among children under five years old is about
55 percent in Western region compared to the national average of 41 percent.
The main implication of the current regional distribution of fertilizer subsi-
dies is that the program is not consistent with addressing regional disparities in
poverty and food security, does not promote shared prosperity, and is likely to
exacerbate regional disparities in income distribution. However, targeted pro-
grams can be very sensitive in the social context of Nepal. Therefore, efforts to
design a program that targets poverty or FNS should be informed by a proper
understanding of the political economy and the social structures in the country.
Furthermore, poor people or food insecure households may not necessarily be
efficient users of fertilizers. It means that targeting based on poverty or FNS
indicators alone may not necessarily be aligned to the principles of smart sub-
sidies outlined above. Therefore, targeting based on poverty or FNS indicators
should be considered within the context of a smart subsidy program.

Key Messages on Export Promotion and Import Substitution
The Government of Nepal is keen to expand exports and substitute imports.
Recently the government conducted a National Integrated Trade Survey (NTIS)
in 2010 and again in 2015 which recommended several value chains for export
development. The recommended value chains includes ginger, cardamom, honey
lentils, tea, noodles, and medicinal herbs or essential oils. But Nepal is unlikely to
expand agriculture exports, especially high value fruits and vegetables, without

        investments in infrastructure to certify that its goods achieve the various sanitary
        and phyto-sanitary (SPS) standards of foreign markets. There are gaps between
        the infrastructure available in Nepal and capacity required for accreditation.
        For example, there are no accredited laboratory facilities to conduct Pesticide
        Residue Analysis—a major issue in export markets. Without such capacity any
        consignment of goods from Nepal would need to be tested for pesticide resi-
        dues in destination countries. The risks are substantial for exporters as the pro-
        duce could be rejected without recourse. A study of ginger and cut-flower value
        chains were used to draw lessons that apply more generally for export promo-
        tion and import substitution of agricultural commodities.

        The key recommendation is to develop a national horticulture develop-
        ment program to promote exports and substitute imports. The suggested
        program would have the following features:

        Seed development. One of the first priorities will be to transition growers out of
        the current practice of using locally available seed materials retained from pre-
        vious growing seasons. As a result, only two major types of ginger are grown in
        Nepal. Addressing this challenge will entail developing a national seed develop-
        ment program that replenishes farmers’ supply with improved varieties.

        Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). This would be instrumental in enabling farm-
        ers to comply with trade standards and government regulations to ensure food
        safety and quality. This moves farmers closer to meeting the specific require-
        ments of high value niche markets in other countries at the same time that it
        improves food safety for domestic consumers.

        Operational plan for monitoring contamination in value chains of major commodi-
        ties. This may involve both broadly defined as well as commodity specific opera-
        tional plans for avoiding, detecting and monitoring the contamination levels
        of pests and pesticides in major commodities. To implement such a plan there
        would be need to: (i) develop specific training modules and build capacity of
        government staff, and (ii) partnership program with the private sectors (grow-
        ers and traders) to share information and jointly develop programs to improve
        traceability.

        Building the capacity of laboratories to test presence of important contaminants.
        There is no laboratory capacity for testing and monitoring pesticide residues,
        mycotoxins, and microbial contamination as per Codex standards/EU require-
        ments. The existing laboratories lack both high precision and basic instruments
        and equipment’s to test for diseases, pesticide levels, microbial contaminations,
        heavy metals, etc. For example, the Central Food Research Laboratory is lim-
        ited to 27 parameters and does not include microbial contaminants and heavy
        metals. The ability to test for these contaminants is crucial to complying with
        various standards in export markets and is therefore necessary for promoting
        Nepal’s products and ultimately accessing export markets.

Executive Summary	


Building human capacity for conducting testing, coordinating SPS issues, and enforc-
ing inspections. There is a lack of advance level trainings to personnel involved in
laboratory testing and inspections, especially as it relates to Good Agricultural
Practices (GAP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Global Health Partner-
ships (GHP), and production and processing systems.

Establishing a local laboratory accreditation board to facilitate Mutual Recogni-
tion Agreements (MRA). There is no local accreditation board to engage with
international accreditation institutions such as the International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and other relevant bodies such as Interna-
tional Accreditation Forum (IAF). Nepal relies on India’s National Accredita-
tion Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for accreditation
of its facilities. A local accreditation body would be able to promote Mutual
Recognition Agreements (MRA) with potential export markets. An MRA is
important to facilitate trade as it provides a forum to define what is acceptable
among trading partners.

Compliance with international standards for pest management—International Plant
Protection Convention (IPPC)/International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures
(ISPM).2 The key actions for compliance include conducting pest risk analysis
and identifying pest free areas or areas with low pesticides. There is no proper
national survey and surveillance of diseases and pests in Nepal nor is there a
regular practice of pest reporting, although certain piecemeal efforts have been
carried out in certain projects several years ago. An investment is needed to
conduct systematic study to investigate and document various diseases and pests
and their incidences in different value chains, including ginger growing areas.
The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs 06, 08, 17 and
22) of IPPC needs to be adopted with local adaptation as national standards to
undertake this activity.

Strengthened SPS enquiry point at DFTQC. The SPS Enquiry Point needs to be
strengthened to take up all matters related to SPS with importing countries and
to facilitate negotiating trade based on scientific principles. At present there are
very few dedicated staff in the SPS Enquiry point, which is insufficient not only
for responding to queries from importing countries and domestic industry, but
also far from the capacity required to create and update an effective knowledge
base of all the SPS related information.

SPS diplomacy for export promotion. The main element of SPS diplomacy is
engaging with regional and international organizations, particularly those set-
ting international standards and the WTO SPS Committee. Developing coun-
tries are often weak in this area and act as receivers of standards set by others.
SPS diplomacy is also essential in bilateral market negotiations between trade
partners, and in resolving problems or disagreements which arise during trade.
SPS diplomacy relies on scientific capacity. There is need to develop capacity for
SPS diplomacy by training a batch of key experts on: (i) policy and regulatory

     affairs with special reference to compliances to SPS/WTO, (ii) technical skills
     on pest reporting and risk analysis, (iii) mitigation measures identified by IPPC
     and other reference standards, (iv) risk communications as per IPPC and Codex,
     (v) marketing and trade promotion, and (vi) communication and negotiation
     skills.

     A national strategy for SPS information management, SPS risks communication, and
     traceability system. The information management system would bring together,
     in one platform, all information (legal, technical, institutional, export promo-
     tion, global markets) related to SPS matters of different Ministries and Depart-
     ments—along with national standards and extent of compliances to various IPPC/
     Codex Standards. Such a platform would also cover risk assessment protocols and
     updates on SPS issues at different parts of the chains. There are very good lessons
     on establishing traceability systems from countries such as Kenya.

     A national strategy to access high value niche organic markets, including branding
     of organic products from Nepal. With the growing demand in organic products
     in the international markets, organic ginger from Nepal could be branded and
     marketed to serve the growing demand. Farmers are already practicing some
     important principles of organic farming, including low chemical pesticides and
     farm yard manure, which indicates potential to further adopt organic principles.

     Eradication of poor quality imports of planting materials and agrochemicals from
     the market. For example, in cut-flowers the planting materials sourced from
     plant propagation sites from India are not of the same quality as those imported
     directly through Europe based companies. Often times, products delivered do
     not match the quality of products ordered. Producers also complain of fake
     chemicals in the market and that they do not have the knowledge or means to
     differentiate the fake chemicals from real ones. Therefore, they end up using
     whatever is available. Fake chemicals damage the soil and reduce both produc-
     tivity and quality of cut-flowers.

     Enforcement of land rental contracts to encourage large scale investments in flori-
     culture. Currently, most producers involved in cut-flowers are smallholders and
     they lease land for production—with the exception of 2 or 3 integrated firms.
     Although legal contracts are signed for land lease, there is almost always a pro-
     vision to end the contract prematurely by either party with prior notice. This
     clause is required to safeguard the producer in case of a loss, but it also allows
     the landlord to switch renters whenever a better rental offer emerges. Further-
     more, this clause has been used by landlords to sell land during land tenure
     without compensating the renter for their investment. The land rental market
     has many inherent risks that has kept investors away, especially in enterprises
     that are already risky such as floriculture.

     Improved mechanisms for delivery of incentives for procurement of inputs to ensure
     they actually reach farmers. The government provides support to producers by


xx                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Executive Summary	


exempting tax and VAT on the import of planting materials and insecticides.
For example, VAT is exempted and only 1 percent duty is applied on the import
of greenhouses. Most producers are small and require these materials in small
quantities. The administrative procedures for imports are time consuming and
costly, and the transaction costs for each small producer are high. Therefore, the
producers buy these inputs from traders or input supply companies. But the
government does not provide the same tax and VAT exemptions to traders who
supply the producers. It means producers cannot take advantage of these incen-
tives. For small producers, the cost of greenhouses is beyond their investment
capacity. Instead of importing greenhouses, they would prefer importing some
of the raw materials used in greenhouses and then fabricating locally. But raw
materials for greenhouses are subject to 13 percent VAT and a total of 25 per-
cent import duty.

Introduce agribusiness incubation programs to incentivize investments in cold storage
for both planting materials and produce as well as climate controlled transportation
services. For example, planting materials for Gladiolus or its bulbs need to be
preserved in controlled temperature and properly ventilated space during off
season. But due to absence of chilled rooms these planting materials are pre-
served under normal conditions. Consequently, many bulbs are destroyed or
do not produce expected yields. And when flowers are harvested they do not
undergo any post-harvest treatment. It is important to store freshly harvested
flowers in chilled room and treat the produce with chemicals in order to kill
undesired micro-organisms, reduce damage and prolong vase life.

Introduction




Agriculture is the key sector for poverty reduction and shared prosper-
ity in Nepal. The poverty rate decreased to 25.2 percent between 2003–04
and 2010–11. Most of that poverty reduction occurred in rural areas and was
driven by rising agriculture incomes (World Bank, 2013). A decomposition of
the total income growth shows that farm income and agriculture wage contrib-
uted the highest share of 24.4 percent, followed by remittances (23 percent),
non-­agriculture wages (22.8 percent) and enterprises income (18.3 percent)—
see Table 1.1 below. The impact of agriculture was highest among the bottom
40 percent (the lowest and second lowest income quintile) where agriculture
contributed about 39 percent of the income gains, much higher than the 20 per-
cent contribution of remittances. Clearly agriculture has proved to be a pro-
poor sector and continues to offer enormous potential to drive further poverty
reduction in years to come. This is consistent with the conclusions of the 2008
World Development Report that GDP growth which originates from agriculture
is markedly more effective in reducing poverty than growth which originates in
other sectors (World Bank 2008). It is also consistent with a broad body of devel-
opment literature that suggests that very few countries have achieved massive
poverty reduction without increase in agricultural productivity (Johnston and

                                                           Mellor, 1961; Timmer 1988, 2002). While Nepal has reduced poverty through
                                                           increased agriculture incomes, the sources of that income growth remain
                                                           unclear—whether it is increased yields, or change in real prices, or diversifica-
                                                           tion from staples to high value fruits and vegetables, or expansion of cropped
                                                           area. The analysis in this report will identify what kind of agriculture offers most
                                                           potential to further reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity.

                                                           Agriculture contributes about 35 percent to the GDP, but growth in the
                                                           sector has been volatile in recent years. The three most important sub-sec-
                                                           tors are food grains, livestock, and fruits and vegetables—in that order. The share
                                                           of food grains in GDP is about 12.8 percent, livestock (9 percent), fruits and

 has also been relatively volatile, but it does not always follow the same pattern as
 agriculture growth. On the other hand, the services sector has been quite stable.
 GDP growth seems to track growth in services more than in any other sector. This
 is mainly because services are the largest sector contributing about 50 percent
 to GDP while industry contributes about 15 percent. The observed volatility in
 agricultural growth is often attributed to weather fluctuations and civil instability.

 Agricultural production occurs in disparate agro-ecological zones in
 the country—Terai (low elevation), hills (mid-elevation), and moun-
 tains (high elevation)—all running from East to West. The Terai has the
 most fertile land and accounts for most of agricultural production. The region
 is endowed with favorable climate for many crops, better road connection, and
 a long border with India. The hills and mountains are suitable for maize, millet,
 barley and buckwheat. Fruits are mostly grown in the hill and mountain region,
 while vegetables can be grown across all three agro-ecological zones. There are
 stark differences between the three zones in terms of agro-climatic potential, soil
 type, rainfall levels, irrigation potential, access to roads and infrastructure, access
 to improved seed varieties, access to markets for inputs and outputs, and access
 to energy. Generally speaking, the Terai region has better access to markets and
 infrastructure compared to hills and mountains zones, which are characterized
 by rough terrain, poor road networks, and distant markets for inputs and outputs.

 Nepal’s crop agriculture is characterized by relatively low land produc-
 tivity, especially in food grains such as rice and wheat, which occupy
 most cultivable land. Compared to its neighbors in South Asia, Nepal yields
 in rice are lower than India and Bangladesh, while wheat yields have been con-
 sistently lower than India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan over the past decade. How-
 ever, Nepal can boast highest yields in fruits relative to its neighbors and second
 highest yields in vegetables (see Figure 1.3). According to the Agriculture

Introduction	


Development Strategy (ADS) 2015, the underlying causes of low yields in cereal
crops are low rates of adoption of improved technology due to subsistence farm-
ing, poor access to suitable technology (both on-farm and post-harvest), limited
availability of inputs (planting materials, livestock germplasm, fertilizer, animal
feed, plant and animal health protection, irrigation, electricity, finance), and lim-
ited investment in the sector.

Labor is moving out of agriculture and the outmigration is putting pres-
sure on agricultural wages such that the wage differential between agri-
culture and non-agriculture sectors has narrowed considerably. However,
employment in the non-agricultural sectors is still more rewarding across all
education levels, which suggests that occupational shifts to agriculture are not
likely under the current environment (World Bank, 2013). Furthermore, recent
trends indicate that the share of agriculture sector in wage employment has
been declining for the past fifteen years, from 53 percent in 1995/96 to 35 per-
cent in 2010/11 (GoN 2011a). More and more workers are employed outside
of agriculture in patterns that mimic structural transformation. However, labor
is moving out of agriculture due to the massive wave of migration from rural
areas to overseas. Because most of those migrating are males, it has caused femi-
nization of agricultural labor. Employment in agriculture is now predominantly
female with about 55 percent of women providing agricultural labor compared
to 24 percent of males. The wage rate for males was higher than females by
about 50 percent in 2010—daily wages are about Rs 145 for males and Rs 97
for females (GoN 2011a). The premium for male labor is most likely due to
differences in labor productivity. It suggests that continued migration of males
may constrain agricultural productivity unless the productivity of female labor
improves to offset the loss. Without such gains it would become important for
Nepal to consider measures such as farm mechanization with equipment suit-
able for the production environment.

Nepal is located between India and China, where demand for food mar-
kets is rapidly growing due to rising incomes and urbanization, but there
is no evidence Nepal has been able to tap into these markets. Furthermore,
household incomes have also increased in Nepal and this has fueled demand for
food products. Per-capita consumption of food products increased faster in Nepal
than in India across all food categories, and across the rural-urban divide between
2003/04 and 2010/11. Furthermore, the proportion of consumption of home
produced foods to total consumption declined faster in Nepal (by 4 percentage
points) compared to India (by 2 percentage points)—see Figure 1.4. This means
households are increasingly relying on the market for their food needs.

Nepal agriculture is becoming less competitive in both domestic and
export markets. Nepal’s net importer position has consistently grown since
2009, both in high value foods such as fruits and vegetables as well as staples
such as rice, potatoes, and maize (see Figure 1.5). Nepal continues to be in
autarky in wheat with an occasional fleeting gain in exports. The trade position

in pulses has been shifting between net exporter to autarky in the period cover-
ing 2000 and 2011. The deteriorating trade position goes far beyond agriculture.
On aggregate exports have been declining relative to GDP, while on the other
hand imports have been growing (see Figure 1.6). This implies the country is
losing competitiveness not just in agriculture but also in other sectors of the
economy.

The overall policy framework for agriculture is articulated in the Agri-
culture Development Strategy (ADS) 2015. In addition to the ADS 2015,
the major agriculture sector policy documents include: National Fertilizer
Policy (2001), Chemical Fertilizer Guidelines (2000), Guidelines for Chemi-
cal Fertilizer and Seed Transportation Grant Subsidy (2004), Seed Act (1988),
Organic Fertilizer Subsidy Guidelines (2011), Organic Fertilizer Subsidy Direc-
tives (2011), Organic and Bio-Fertilizer Regulating Working Procedure (2011).
Annex 3.1 provides a summary of the functions, objectives, and strategies
adopted in these policies.

What Are the Main Drivers of
Agricultural Growth for Poverty
Reduction and Shared Prosperity?




2.1  What Is Driving Change in Agricultural Income?
On average about 78 percent of the increase in crop income was due to
increased food prices, while yields contributed about 22 percent, and
land contraction decreased crop income by about 9 percent. The data
used to calculate these changes is from National Living Standards Surveys in
2003/04 and 2010/11. Food prices were still recovering from the effects of the
global food price inflation in 2010/11, therefore it is not surprising that changes
in food prices contributed the most to crop incomes. The contribution of yields
is about 22 percent and this captures the change in crop output per unit land.
The contribution of land is negative, which indicates that there was contraction
of area under cultivation despite the increased food prices. Increased food prices
would normally give farmers incentives to employ more factors of production,
including putting more land under cultivation. However, food prices were not
only high but also volatile and the volatility became a major source of risk to the
food sector. For farmers engaged in primary food production, unstable commod-
ity prices in output markets is a primary concern, and the uncertainty this gener-
ates affects investment decisions regarding use of productive factors (Sandmo,
1971; Moschini and Hennessy, 2001). The finding that area under cultivation
contracted in 2010/11 relative to 2003/04 mirrors global evidence that farm-
ers reduced land allocation to major cereal crops during the recent1 global food
crisis when prices were high and volatile (Haile, Kalkuhl, and von Braun, 2014).
The reduction in acreage ultimately led to reduced global production of major
cereal crops, and this explains why the supply response to higher prices was
not large (Subervie, 2008; Haile, Kalkuhl, and von Braun, 2015). The results
are summarized in Table 2.1. The methodology of decomposing change in crop
income is given in Box 2.1.

     Box 2.1  Decomposition of Crop Income into Contribution of Food Prices, Yields,
     and Land
     The total value of agricultural production for each household is calculated, including both
     the output marketed for sale and the output consumed at home. The value for 2003 is con-
     verted into real terms by 63.0 percent inflation rate between 2003 and 2010. To decompose
     changes in crop income, consider the following components of the crop income R;

                                                     R=A⋅y⋅p

     where A is the area in Ropani used for agricultural production, y is the yield of the aggregate
     crop production per Ropani, and p is the price index (i.e., revenue share-weighted average of
     individual crop prices, calculated at the household level). The crop income R can be decom-
     posed into the aggregate crop production A ⋅ y and the price p. The total differentiation of R
     gives

                                       dR = dA ⋅ y ⋅ p + A ⋅ dy ⋅ p + A ⋅ y ⋅ dp.

     Replacing the derivatives with the difference operators between the two survey years yields

                                       DR = DA ⋅ y ⋅ p + A ⋅ Dy ⋅ p + A ⋅ y ⋅ Dp

     where the difference operators are multiplied by the 2003 values of area, yield, and price
     variables. The decomposition shows the relative contributions of the changes in land, yield,
     and prices to the change in crop income. For the ease of interpretation, the decomposition is
     also presented in logarithmic terms;

                                          D ln R = D ln A + D ln y + D ln p

     where each component represents a percentage change of the variable.




     Both food prices and yields contributed to increased crop income in
     Mountains and Terai, but in the Hills crop incomes were driven only
     by increased prices—the yields actually declined and their effect was to
     take away about 47 percent of the increased crop income due to prices.
     The only region where the contribution of yields to crop income was higher than
     that of prices is in the Mountains. Land contraction decreased crop incomes in

all regions except the Terai. It is important to note that the Terai region shares
a long and open border with India through which food trade occurs between
the two countries. India was virtually unscathed by the global food price infla-
tion because of policies that prevented international prices from being transmit-
ted to the domestic market. The stabilizing effects of India’s policies on food
prices were likely transmitted across the border into the Terai region, such that
any residual price volatility did not cause adjustments in land allocation. On the
other hand, the part of the country that would have least benefitted from India
stabilizing policies would be the Mountains region. The results shows that the
negative contribution of land reduction to crop income was highest in the Moun-
tain region. In addition, it’s likely that a number of local factors might also have
contributed to the decrease in area under cultivation. Among the most important
factors would be: (a) migration of male labor from rural areas to overseas, which
has not only led to fewer people working on the farms but also to an increasingly
female agricultural labor force; and (b) land tenure laws that discourage renting
land. In contrast to the Terai region, land contraction decreased crop income by
about 7 percent in the Hills and about 26 percent in the mountains region.

2.2  What Is Driving Change in Productivity?
Overall, agricultural productivity is increasing. A useful measure of the
productivity of any sector is Total Factor Productivity (TFP), which measures
differences in productivity that are not due to differences in use of inputs, but
rather attributable to factors such as technological progress and efficiency in
conversion of inputs to outputs. Most discussions of TFP have relied on Fugile
(2012) who use data from FAO2 and apply growth accounting methods to esti-
mate TFP in various countries, including Nepal (see Figure 2.1). The data sug-
gests that TFP in Nepal agriculture has grown steadily since 1998. From 1992
to 2011 TFP in Nepal grew faster than in Pakistan, Bhutan, and Afghanistan and
was at par with Sri Lanka—a middle income country in the region. However,
its growth was substantially lower than in India and Bangladesh. The growth
accounting methodology used in Fugile (2012) does not allow decomposing
TFP to examine its sources, in particular whether productivity is coming from
progress towards reaching an existing production frontier (efficiency) or shift
towards another production frontier (technical change).

Technical change is the main driver of productivity increase in all agro-
ecological zones, more so in the Mountains and Hills compared to the
Terai. The decomposition of productivity change is presented in Table 2.2. Pro-
ductivity is measured through the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) and the
change in the index is decomposed into technical change and technical efficiency
change using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods (see Annex 2.1). Tech-
nical change is associated with release and application of new technology, while
technical efficiency change is about how well existing technologies are utilized
by farmers. The results indicate that technical change is the main driver of pro-
ductivity increase in all regions of the country—and it increased by 26 percent

                                    in the Mountains, 18 percent in the Hills, and 8 percent in the Terai. It means
                                    that farmers are adopting new technologies and these new technologies are hav-
                                    ing a relatively large impact in the Mountains, followed by Hills, and then the
                                    Terai. The larger effects in Mountains and Hills relative to the Terai are perhaps
                                    because traditionally there has been more technologies developed for the Terai
                                    such that other regions are starting from a low base and any new technologies
                                    are likely to increase productivity relatively faster. Furthermore, the increase in
                                    technical change in the Terai was offset by decline in technical efficiency change
                                    such that the region suffered productivity loss between 2003/04 and 2010/11.

                                    The poor performance in technical efficiency change suggests that farm-
                                    ers are not efficiently using existing technologies. This points to the need to

                                    opment. Technical efficiency change declined by about 15 percent in the Terai

change is in the Hills where it increased by about 6 percent. These findings
underscore the need to strengthen extension efforts and optimize use of exist-
ing technologies across the country, but this should not come at the expense of
research and technology development, especially in terms of developing new
technologies for the Mountains and Hills where they are having the largest
impacts. Overall productivity increased by about 22 percent in the Mountains
and 26 percent in the Hills, but declined by 6 percent in the Terai. In the Moun-
tains all of the productivity gains were driven by technical change, indicating
that more productive farmers are adopting new technologies or innovative prac-
tices. But while leading farmers have adopted new technologies and increased
productivity through technical change, there are many inefficient farmers who
have not caught up with the leading farmers hence the decline in the mean
efficiency level. In the Hills the productivity gain is driven by both technical
progress and efficiency gains. The combination of leading farmers adopting new
technologies and shifting to a higher production frontier—and other farmers
closing the efficiency gap with leading farmers—results in the largest productiv-
ity growth among the three agro-ecological zones.

There are important differences across districts in terms of productivity,
technical change, and technical efficiency change. The district level aver-
ages suggest important differences in agricultural productivity, as well as the
relative contribution of new technologies (technical change) and efficiency of
using existing technologies (technical efficiency change). For example, among
the sampled districts in the Mountains, the most productivity gains occurred in
Manang district where productivity more than doubled with technical change
increasing by 87 percent and technical efficiency change increasing by 23 per-
cent (see Annex Table A2.2.1). The least performing districts in the Mountains
were Bajura and Bajhang where productivity decreased by 18 percent and
10 percent respectively. The decline in Bajura was driven by declining efficiency
(by 25 percent) which offset the 10 percent gains in technical change. But in
Bajhang district both technical change and technical efficiency change decreased
by 4 percent and 6 percent respectively. The best performing districts in the
Hills are Tanahun and Baglung where productivity more than doubled—and
the least performing districts are Pyuthan, Salyan, Gulmi, and Jarjakot where
productivity decreased by at least 16 percent (see Annex Table A2.2.2). The
best performing districts in the Terai are Sarlahi and Bara where productivity
increased by 34 percent and 25 percent respectively, driven by technical change
of 25 percent and 15 percent respectively (see Annex Table A2.2.3). The least
performing districts in Terai were Kapilbastu, Morang, and Rupandehi where
productivity declined by at least 16 percent with both technical change and
technical efficiency change declining.

Small farms are the only category with consistent productivity growth
across the agro-ecological zones and also the only category where
growth is consistently driven by both technical change and technical
efficiency change. Land is an important factor of production. Access to land

     is affected by many factors, chief among them is the functioning of land rental
     markets. The land rental markets in Nepal are thin mainly because there are
     tenure laws which impose a risk that rented land may be lost by the landowner
     if the renter stays there long enough. One implication of weak land markets is
     that rural households that are land-constrained may not be able to rent addi-
     tional land and would therefore be trapped in small-scale agriculture. If the
     relationship between land sizes and productivity is positive, small-scale agricul-
     ture could become a low income trap. However, the results suggest that small
     pieces of land are the only category with consistent productivity growth across
     agro-ecological zones and also the only category where growth is consistently
     driven by both technical change and technical efficiency change (see Table 2.3).
     In the smallest land size category: (a) productivity increased by 77 percent in
     the mountains, 50 percent in the hills, and 14 percent in the Terai; (b) techni-
     cal change increased by 38 percent in the mountains, 20 percent in the hills,
     and 14 percent in the Terai; and (c) technical efficiency change increased by
     31 percent in the mountains, 16 percent in the hills, and 11 percent in the Terai.
     There is no other land category where there are gains in all agricultural zones in
     productivity, technical, change, and technical efficiency change.

     2.3  Are Farmers Diversifying Crops?
     Overall, farmers are diversifying production, but the progress has been
     slow, such that although the contribution of grain staples to agricultural
     GDP is about 3 times higher than fruits and vegetables, land allocation
     to grain staples is 10 times higher. The yields of main staples in Nepal are
     persistently lower than in neighboring countries (China, India, Bangladesh, Paki-
     stan, and Sri Lanka). The yields of fruits and vegetables fare relatively better and

What Are the Main Drivers of Agricultural Growth for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity?	


Nepal lags behind only China and India. Despite fruits and vegetables showing
relatively higher yields and higher growth in consumption, land is dispropor-
tionately allocated to grain staples (rice, maize, wheat, millet, barley, and buck-
wheat). The contribution of grain staples to agricultural GDP is about 3 times
higher than fruits and vegetables, but land allocation to grain staples is 10 times
higher. However, land holdings cultivating paddy decreased from about 76 per-
cent in 2003/04 to 72 percent in 2010/11 while cultivation of summer veg-
etables increased from 61 percent to 69 percent (GoN 2011b). This suggests
that farmers may be transitioning from main staple food crops such as paddy
to vegetables, but diversification is unlikely to be sustained unless; (i) there
is broad-based productivity gains in main food grains to release land to other
crops, and (ii) farmers develop stable expectations that the market can be relied
upon to consistently deliver low-cost food they would no longer produce. This
would require efficient rural infrastructure services—road networks, capacity
for competitive storage, and energy.

Farmers in the Mountains and Hills have diversified production rela-
tively more than in Terai, and although diversification is increasing
across all agro-ecological zones, it is happening faster in the Hills and
Mountains. The degree of crop diversification is measured using the Herfind-
ahl index (HHI) which is calculated as the sum of squared output-value shares
of different crops. The analysis of the zone-specific cumulative distributions of
the HHI show that: (i) there was more diversification in the Mountains and
Hills compared to the Terai and (ii) that change in diversification happened
faster in the Hills—although this region is still behind the Mountains. The dis-
tributions are presented in Figure 2.2. In all regions, the distribution of HHI in
2010/11 stochastically dominates the distribution of HHI in 2003/04 in the first
degree. This means that for any given HHI value (x) there is a larger proportion
of farmers in 2010/11 who have values of HHI smaller than (x) than there were
in 2003/04. Since smaller values of HHI indicate more diversification, the dis-
tributions indicate that there was more diversification in 2010/11. A compari-
son of the zone-specific cumulative distribution functions indicates that for any
given HHI value (x) there was a larger proportion of farmers with smaller values
of HHI than (x) in Mountains than there were in Hills and Terai. Addition-
ally, there is a larger proportion of farmers with HHI values smaller than (x) in
Hills than Terai. This means that most diversification was in the Mountains fol-
lowed by Hills and then Terai. Furthermore, the region-specific distributions
indicate that diversification was happening faster in the Hills. Crop diversifica-
tion allows farmers to spread both production risks (e.g. weather and pests) as
well as market risks related to prices. The finding that farmers in Mountains and
Hills have diversified production relatively more than in Terai suggests they are
better equipped to deal with production and market risks. This is important in a
developing country like Nepal where market-based mechanisms for risk sharing
such as insurance are not well developed, especially in hard to reach areas in the
Mountains and Hills.

     2.4  Are Farmers Adopting Mechanization?
     Mechanization of agriculture occurs only in the Terai region and there
     is no evidence it is increasing. The stark difference in the pattern of mech-
     anization across agro-ecological zones is presented in Table 2.4. Adoption of
     mechanized tools is almost non-existent in the mountain area. In contrast, the
     vast majority of the tools (both high and low productivity) are used in the Terai

region. This is mainly because the flat terrain in the Terai makes it more ame-
nable to the use of machinery, while the terrain becomes increasingly more dif-
ficult and less cost-effective in the hilly and mountainous regions. The regional
distribution suggests most mechanization is in the Central region and the least
incidence of mechanization is observed in the Mid-Western development region,
especially with regard to the adoption of high productivity tools such as tractor,
thresher, and combined harvester.

Land fragmentation and small and declining farm sizes constrain mech-
anization. Table 2.5 shows that households with larger parcel sizes, on average,
were more likely to use both higher technology tools such as tractor, thresher
and combined harvester, as well as low technology tools like animal cart and
iron plough. And using the Simpson’s Index of Fragmentation (Table 2.6), it
becomes evident that the least fragmented quartile had a higher incidence of
using tractor, thresher, and iron plough compared to the most fragmented quar-
tile. The use of animal cart use was higher among households living in the most
fragmented quartile.

Substituting labor with capital-intensive means of production and access
to irrigation is relatively more important in the Terai, while access to
skilled agricultural labor is more important in the Mountains and Hills
regions. These findings suggests that the technology of production is quite dif-
ferent across agro-ecological zones. The output elasticity of irrigation is rela-
tively higher in Terai (0.31) compared to 0.08 in both the Mountains and Hills
(see Annex Table 2.3.2). The output elasticity of capital is twice in Terai (0.14)
compared to Hills (0.07) and much lower in the Mountains (0.04). However,
agricultural output responds better to increased use of labor in the Hills and
Mountains relative to the Terai—the elasticities are 0.33 in Mountain, 0.20 in
Hills and 0.06 in Terai. Furthermore, quantile regressions suggest important

differences in drivers of productivity within the same agro-ecological zones. In
the Mountains, highly productive farmers exhibit more intensive use of labor
and less intensive use of irrigated land and capital, compared to their less-effi-
cient peers in the same zone. And in the Hills, the most productive farmers use
relatively more pesticides and labor, while less intensively using land and capital
asset. In the Terai, the most productive farmers operate with higher intensifies
of capital asset and lower intensities of household labor. The main implication
of this findings is that substituting labor with capital-intensive means of produc-
tion and access to irrigation is relatively more important in the Terai.

2.5  What Is Constraining Investments in Agriculture?
Investments in agriculture continue to be low despite significant inflow
of remittances and increased agricultural income. Of all sources of income,
remittances appear to be relatively more evenly distributed across income groups.
Furthermore, remittance income is liquid and perhaps highly investible. Remit-
tances accounted for between 20 percent and 23 percent of income gains across
all income quintiles between 2003 and 2010. The average size of remittances is
higher in urban areas, but rural areas receive more on aggregate because the bulk
of the population lives there. Remittances have grown tremendously as a share
of GDP to more than 29 percent by 2014 (see Figure 2.3). This suggests there
is money in rural areas from not only remittances but also crop income which
could be invested in rural sectors such as agriculture and rural non-farm. How-
ever, about 87 percent of remittances in rural areas goes to finance consumption
and only about 1.2 percent is invested in capital formation (see Table 2.7).

                     Several factors contribute to low investments in the agriculture sector.
                     These include relatively low productive technologies that translate to low
                     returns on investments; land fragmentation and declining farm size discouraging
                     investments in mechanization; weak technical capacity of farmers, etc. In addi-
                     tion, the analysis of household surveys indicates that access to infrastructure,
                     markets, and agricultural services may have improved over the years (Table 2.8),
                     but access to agricultural credit from formal sources may have declined substan-
                     tially (Table 2.9). It indicates that investments in the sector are also constrained
                     by factors such as lack of financial sector deepening. Although access to various
                     infrastructure has improved, there is still need for further development of criti-
                     cal infrastructure—including energy, irrigation, roads, etc. Land tenure systems
                     tend to discourage strong forms of sharecropping arrangements, which deprives
                     entrepreneurs who do not own land from investing in agriculture.

                     Returning immigrants are investing in commercialized agriculture
                     and their investments are driven by technical knowledge, which they
                     acquired abroad, and investible funds from their own savings. A case
                     study of returnee farmers was conducted to identify what constraining factors
                     they have been able to overcome—whether it is capital accumulation, techni-
                     cal skills acquired abroad, market knowledge acquired abroad, etc. The returnee

farmers are organized and have recently formed the Nepal Commercial Farm-
ers Association. The membership is currently about 400 farmers, out of which
80–90 percent are returnees. The majority of farmers returning were from Israel,
South Korea, Korea, Japan, and Gulf countries—including Qatar and Saudi Ara-
bia. About 15 returnees were interviewed and a common thread among them
is that (a) they were employed in farms abroad where they learned modern
farming methods that are capital intensive but highly productive, (b) their initial
investments in farming was self-financed through savings accumulated abroad,
(c) most of them do not have their own land and are farming on rented farms that
have access to irrigation, (d) most of them have become active disseminators of
technology and modern farming methods to neighbors and college students, and
(e) they would like to expand operations but cannot access credit from formal
sources in Nepal. The reason they are facing constraints in access to additional
capital is that Banks don’t provide loans unless it is collateralized with land. The
largest investments among interviewed returnees is Nepali Rupees 8,500,000 on
21 hectares of land out of which 19 was rented and 2 was own land. The crops
cultivated in these farms include tomatoes, grapes, ginger, bananas, okra, cucum-
ber, mustard, cauliflower, cabbage, radish, coriander, sponge gourd, pumpkins,
dairy, poultry, etc.

2.6  Conclusions and Recommendations
While agriculture has proved to be important for poverty reduction
and shared prosperity, most of the agricultural income has been from
increased prices. Most of the poverty reduction between 2003/04 and 2010/11
occurred in the rural areas and was driven by rising agriculture incomes, which

	          What Are the Main Drivers of Agricultural Growth for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity?


     registered about 24.4 percent increase on average. The impact of agriculture was
     highest among the bottom 40 percent (the lowest and second lowest income
     quintile) where agriculture contributed more than 40 percent of their income
     gains. Overall, crop income alone increased by about 23 percent. A decomposi-
     tion of this change in crop income indicates that on average about 78 percent
     was due to increased food prices, while yields contributed about 22 percent, and
     land contraction decreased crop income by about 9 percent. The data used to
     calculate these changes is from National Living Standards Surveys in 2003/04
     and 2010/11—therefore it is not surprising that changes in food prices contrib-
     uted the most to crop incomes because the food prices in 2010/11 were still
     recovering from the effects of the global food price inflation.

     Therefore, going forward any strategy for poverty reduction and shared
     prosperity for Nepal should be anchored by a national program4 for
     increasing broad-based agricultural productivity through developing
     new technologies, dissemination of technologies, and effective extension
     to ensure farmers are able to utilize technology appropriately. Produc-
     tivity could be increased through technical change, which is associated with
     release and application of new technology, or technical efficiency change which
     is about how well existing technologies are utilized by farmers. The findings
     indicate that technical change has been the main driver of productivity increase
     in all agro-ecological zones. The contribution of technical change is relatively
     higher in the Mountains and Hills compared to the Terai. It means that farmers
     are adopting new technologies and these new technologies are having a rel-
     atively large impact in the Mountains, followed by Hills, and then the Terai.
     These patterns are likely because traditionally there has been relatively more
     technologies developed for the Terai such that other regions are starting from a
     low base and any new technologies are likely to increase productivity relatively
     faster. These findings call for a national program for increasing broad-based agri-
     cultural productivity through developing new technologies, dissemination of
     technologies, and extension efforts to ensure farmers are able to utilize tech-
     nology appropriately. Already the government is implementing the Agriculture
     and Food Security Project, but the project only covers mid and far western hills
     and mountain districts, and therefore should be expanded nationally. And since
     there are important differences across districts in terms of productivity, techni-
     cal change, and technical efficiency change—even within similar agro-ecological
     zones—the proposed national program should be informed by a better under-
     standing of the causes of these differences.

     Efforts should also focus on expanding irrigation programs and devel-
     oping skills for producing high value crops, especially in the Hills and
     Mountains. The output elasticity of irrigation is relatively higher in Terai (0.31)
     compared to 0.08 in both the Mountains and Hills agro-ecological zones. On the
     other hand, agricultural output responds better to labor in the Hills and moun-
     tains relative to the Terai—with elasticity of 0.33 in Mountain, 0.20 in Hills and

0.06 in Terai. In the mountains, highly productive farmers exhibit more inten-
sive use of labor compared to their less-efficient peers. And in the Hills, the most
productive farmers use relatively more pesticides and labor relative to their less-
efficient peers. In the Terai, the most productive farmers operate with higher
intensities of capital asset compared to their peers. The main implication of the
findings is that while all factors of production are important across the board, a
national program for broad-based productivity growth should be informed by
these differences on factor productivities.

3.1  Policy Milestones in Inputs Delivery
3.1.1  Historical Fertilizer Policies before the Current Distribution Program
In 1966 the government formed the Agriculture Inputs Company (AIC)
to import and distribute fertilizers at commercial terms and without sub-
sidy. Chemical fertilizers were introduced in Nepal in the early 1950s when a
group of traders from India started exporting fertilizers to Nepal (Shrestha, 2010).
From 1952 to 1965, the National Trading Limited (a government owned com-
pany) imported fertilizers from Russia and China. A major policy shift happened
in 1966 when the government formed the Agriculture Inputs Company (AIC)
to import and distribute fertilizers at commercial terms and without subsidy. The
main source of fertilizer imports by the AIC was India and the international mar-
ket (Shrestha, 2010; Thapa, 2006). One of the lessons from this era is that fertil-
izer use was quite low, especially in the Hills and Mountain areas due to high costs.

The government introduced fertilizer subsidy in 1973/74 through
1996/97. The aim of the subsidy was to increase food production and to encour-
age farmers to use chemical fertilizers. The policy included not only a price sub-
sidy on the fertilizer but also a transport subsidy (APP, 1995). While the price
subsidy was for all farmers throughout the country, the transport subsidy only
applied to farmers residing in hill and mid-hill areas. However, there were con-
cerns that the farmers who benefited from the subsidy were those with personal
networks such that more than 80 percent of the subsidized fertilizer was sold only
in the Kathmandu valley (Ghimire, 2009). Furthermore, the subsidy burden sky-
rocketed and it is estimated that AIC deficits rose to 850 million rupees (Shrestha,
2010). Yet supplies were considered insufficient to meet demand (Pandey, 2014).

In 1995 the government articulated a policy on fertilizers in the Agri-
culture Perspectives Plan (1995), in which fertilizers were recognized

     as a prime input to enhance agriculture productivity. A target was set
     to increase fertilizer use to 131 kg nutrients/hectare by 2015. The Agriculture
     Perspectives Plan (APP) has been the foundation of successive policies on fertil-
     izers and seeds. A summary of the major policies regulating the inputs sector
     is provided in Annex 3.1. Following the APP (1995), the fertilizer market was
     liberalized in 1997/98. The AIC was dissolved and in its place two companies
     were formed; (a) the Agriculture Input Company Limited (AICL) was formed
     in 2002 and charged with the responsibility to import and distribute fertilizers;
     and (b) the National Seed Company Limited (NSCL) was created in 2002 and
     charged with seed distribution. The liberalization led to entry of many private
     sector companies in the business of importing and distributing fertilizers. How-
     ever, the liberalization era was marked by: (a) informal imports of fertilizers of
     unknown and unverified quality; (b) increased private sector participation in
     fertilizer importation and distribution; (c) marked decline of formal imports of
     fertilizers compared to the period prior to liberalization; and (d) rising fertilizer
     prices, which further encouraged trading in cheap fertilizers of unknown quality.

     3.1.2  The Current Fertilizer Distribution Program
     The liberalization era was ended in 2008/09 and the government initi-
     ated a fertilizer distribution program to increase use of chemical fertil-
     izers. Under the program fertilizer is supplied by Agriculture Inputs Company
     Limited (AICL) and Salt Trading Company (STC) and sold to farmers at subsi-
     dized prices through cooperatives. Both AICL and STC are government owned.
     Initially the target group was marginal farmers—defined as farmers with land-
     holding less than 4 hectares in the Terai and less than 0.75 ha (15 Ropani) in
     the Hills. However, these rules were relaxed around 2011/12 and all types of
     farmers are now eligible to benefit from the program. The program was initially
     targeted to paddy, wheat, maize, and millet—but that is also no longer the case

and farmers are now free to apply subsidized fertilizers to any crop. In brief, the
program is implemented as follows. First the cooperatives reach out to farmers
and collect information on fertilizer demand by farmers. The cooperatives com-
pile the information and submit to local offices of AICL. On that basis fertilizer
is released by AICL to cooperatives. Farmers would then purchase the fertilizer
at subsidized prices from cooperatives. While there is at least one cooperative in
each Village Development Council (VDC), it is believed that not all farmers are
members of a cooperative or utilize cooperative services. It is not clear whether
using cooperatives crowds out farmers who are not members.

Government policy on fertilizers was updated in 2011 to promote use
of organic fertilizers. The objective is to incrementally substitute for chemi-
cal fertilizers. The main policy documents on organic fertilizers are the Organic
Fertilizer Subsidy Directives (2011) and the Organic and Bio-Fertilizer Work-
ing Procedure (2011). These policies provide a subsidy to purchase domesti-
cally produced organic fertilizers that meet certain criteria. The subsidy rate and
quantity restrictions are decided by a high-level Subsidy Distribution Manage-
ment Committee. The responsibility for actual distribution lies with district-
level committees. The main organic fertilizer distributed under the program
is vermi-compost manure and the subsidy rate was 58 percent in 2011/12,
58 percent in 2012/13, and 65 percent in 2013/14.

3.1.3  Historical Seed Policies before the Current Program
Seed policy in Nepal was first articulated in the Seed Act (1988). The Act
provides guidelines to promote production and processing of high quality seed
for various agro-climatic zones. The Seed Act is the foundation for successive
policies that have culminated to the seed distribution program. The National
Seed System in Nepal involves four agencies: (a) public institutions, (b) the
private sector, (c) international collaborators, and (d) farmer communities. The
National Seed Board (NSB) under MOAD is the coordinating agency for vari-
etal release and registration. National Agricultural Research Council undertakes
breeder and foundation seed production. These source seeds are supplied to
the National Seed Company (NSCL) and registered private seed companies
for production of certified or improved seeds, which are then sold to farm-
ers. Multiple agents are involved in seed production, including (a) government
farms and stations, (b) contract seed production by the National Seed Company
Limited (NSCL), (c) NGOs, (d) private seed companies, and (d) the District
Self Sufficiency Seed Programme (DISSPRO). Some farmers use seed retained
from previous crops and also sell it to other farmers. In addition, farmers obtain
seed from India and neighboring countries through informal cross border trade.

3.1.4  The Current Improved Seed Distribution Program
The seed distribution program was started in 2011/12 with the objective
to improve seed replacement rate from 11 percent to about 25 percent

	                 What Is the Impact of Public Expenditures in Fertilizer and Seed Distribution Programs?



     within 15 years. The implementation arrangements are similar to the fertilizer
     distribution program. But while fertilizers are supplied by the Agriculture Inputs
     Company Limited (AICL), certified seeds are sourced from the National Seed
     Company Limited (NSCL)—which is also government owned. The NSCL was
     created in 2002 under MOAD, with the mandate to produce, procure (domesti-
     cally as well as through imports), process, and sell subsidized seeds. The NSCL
     contracts seed growers around the country and has a wide range of infrastructure—
     including storage capacity, processing plants and seed labs to process, grade, and
     treat the seeds. The following crops are covered: paddy, wheat, maize, millet, lentil,
     gram, pigeon pea, and green grams. The subsidy rate has varied between 25–40
     percent over three years of implementation.

     3.2  Public Expenditure Tracking for Fertilizers
     and Seed Subsidy Programs
     The report presents the findings of a public expenditure tracking survey
     (PETS) to assess various aspects of the inputs distribution programs.
     The objectives of the PETS is to address the following issues: (a) access of farm-
     ers to subsidized inputs and whether it varies depending on farm size and region,
     (b) whether prices paid by farmers in purchasing subsidized inputs are lower
     than before the program was introduced, (c) effectiveness of the existing local
     governance and oversight arrangements and how they may be strengthened, and
     (e) how to improve the input delivery system. The public expenditure review
     is conducted using two complementary tools: Public Expenditure Tracking Sur-
     vey (PETS) and Quantitative Service Delivery Survey (QSDS). The choice of
     the tools was influenced by the objectives of the analysis. Annex 3.2 provides a
     detailed presentation of the methodology for applying the PETS and QSDS to
     the inputs program in Nepal.

     3.2.1  Budget Allocation
     Both programs are funded by the government through the national bud-
     get. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) disburses the funds to the Ministry of
     Agricultural Development (MoAD) which then disburses the funds to public
     companies to procure inputs. The Agricultural Inputs Company Limited (AICL)
     and Salt Trading Company (STC) import and distribute fertilizers to coopera-
     tives; and National Seed Company Limited (NSCL) is involved in procuring
     seeds. The cooperatives would then sell the inputs to farmers after deducting
     the costs of transport and handling. AICL and STC receive advance of the sub-
     sidy amount from MoF through MoAD in three installments during a fiscal
     year. The AICL has received about 70 percent of the fertilizer subsidy budget
     in recent years and most of the remaining 30 percent goes to STC. In addition,
     some of the subsidy budget is spent on supporting private initiatives in the pro-
     duction and distribution of organic fertilizers. The AICL chain includes about
     40 depots located throughout the country. All fertilizer imports are delivered
     to the depots before distribution to the cooperatives. The business of importing

and distributing fertilizers to cooperatives is a commercial activity for these
companies, which means they add cost of handling and transport to the subsi-
dized border price to arrive at the total cost charged to cooperatives. The subsi-
dized border price is determined by AICL depending on the cost of importing
the fertilizers up to the border, the subsidy released by MoAD, and the effective
retail price in India.

The budget allocation to the inputs subsidy programs continues to grow.
The budget has increased from 6 percent of the MoAD budget in 2008/09 to
42 percent in 2012/13 and 28 percent in 2013/14 (see Figure 3.2 above). The
decline in budget share between 2012/13 and 2013/14 is due to rapid expan-
sion of the overall ministry budget relative to the subsidy programs. In abso-
lute terms the budget allocation to these programs actually increased by about
14 percent between the two years. That budget allocation to the fertilizer and
seed subsidy programs continues to grow indicates the growing importance of
these programs in the priorities of the MoAD and Government of Nepal (GoN).

3.2.2  Responding to Subsidy Policies in India
Nepal faces several challenges in implementing any agricultural policy
because the long open border with India allows spillover effects from
the vast spectrum of agriculture related policies in India. In the context of
input distribution programs, the main concern is that inputs subsidized by Nepal
could be re-sold across the border if the price incentives are right. To mitigate this
problem the subsidized price of fertilizers is fixed at between 20 and 25 percent
above border prices in India. Although this appears counter to the goal of subsi-
dizing input costs, the prices of fertilizers in India are depressed by their domestic
subsidies. If the subsidies in India are significant, the difference between border
prices and market prices in Nepal could make it possible to ex-ante structure a
subsidy scheme in which subsidized prices in Nepal are 20 to 25 percent higher
than India prices and significantly lower than domestic market prices.

                                         3.3  Main Findings
                                         3.3.1  Supply of Fertilizers
                                         The fertilizer subsidy program has tremendously increased fertilizer
                                         supply in Nepal. Furthermore, historical data reveals a clear relation-
                                         ship between policy regime and levels of fertilizer supplies: a liberalized
                                         market is associated with low and decreasing supply while subsidy poli-
                                         cies are associated with increased supply. The fertilizer program was intro-
                                         duced in 2008/09 when fertilizer supply had been declining for the past decade,
                                         reaching an all-time low of less than 5,000 tons in 2007/08. After the program
                                         was introduced, fertilizer supply dramatically increased by about 1,054 percent
                                         in 2009/10 and has continued to increase since. In 2010/11 fertilizer supplies
                                         reached about 110,000 Mt, which was the highest they had ever been, but then
                                         continued to increase and doubled in 2013/14 when supply reached around
                                         245,000 Mt (see Figure 3.3). Overall, there is a clear relationship between pol-
                                         icy regime and the levels of fertilizer supplies in Nepal (see Figure 3.3). The data
                                         available starts around 1973/74 when the government first introduced fertilizer
                                         subsidy to increase food production and to encourage farmers to use chemical
                                         fertilizers. One of the results of the subsidy policy was that fertilizer supplies
                                         increased steadily from about 15,000 tons to nearly 90,000 tons in 1994/95. But
                                         the policy was fraught with challenges, including a burgeoning subsidy burden
                                         to the Treasury and implementation inefficiencies that made subsidized fertil-
                                         izers hard to get for ordinary farmers. These issues contributed to the liberaliza-
                                         tion of the fertilizer market in 1996/1997.

                                         The fertilizer application rates in Nepal have increased tremendously
                                         since the subsidy program was introduced, but they are still remark-
                                         ably lower than in neighboring countries. Since the subsidy program was

introduced, the fertilizer application rates has increased from 1.4 kilograms
per ha of arable land in 2008 to 57.7 kilograms per ha of arable land in 2013.
Most of this increase is due to the subsidy program. However, Nepal still lags
far behind neighboring countries in fertilizer consumption. For example, fertil-
izer consumption in 2013 stood at 157.5 kg per hectare in India, 208.7 kg per
hectare in Bangladesh, 160 kg per hectare in Sri Lanka, 135.2 kg per hectare
in Pakistan, and 364.3 kg per hectare in China. The only country in Figure 3.4
which Nepal has leapfrogged is Afghanistan, and this is mainly because it is a
war-torn country with an extremely weak input delivery system. With regard to
improved seeds, the proportion of farmers using improved seeds increased by
more than 8 percentage points for potato, wheat, and paddy between 2002/3
and 2009/10 (see Table 3.1). But that was before the program was introduced. It
is difficult to estimate the impact of NSCL on seed replacement rate because it

     is not the only distributor of subsidized seeds in Nepal. Other channels include
     many donor supported projects that work through District Agriculture Devel-
     opment Offices and multiply seeds through various registered seed multipliers,
     including farmer groups and cooperatives.

     3.3.3  Demand and Supply Gap
     Although supply of fertilizers and improved seeds have increased
     remarkably since the subsidy program was introduced, the demand still
     far exceeds supply. Recent estimates of the actual demand for fertilizers in
     Nepal have produced varying figures, including the official estimate provided by
     MoAD that demand is more than 700,000 tons. This demand estimate would
     translate to a fertilizer application rate of about 164.8 kg per hectare—which
     is about 10 kg per ha more than the application rate in India. The seed replace-
     ment rate measures the proportion of area covered by improved seeds that are
     truthfully labeled. It is therefore a useful indicator for demand for improved
     seeds. The seed replacement rate for rice is estimated to be about 4 percent, for
     wheat between 4 and 8 percent, for maize 3.8 percent, and about 1.6 percent
     for pulses. According to Basnyat (2010) the generally accepted norm for seed
     replacement rate is about 25 percent, which means the current seed replace-
     ment rates for major crops (4 percent for rice, between 4 and 8 percent for
     wheat, 3.8 percent for maize, and about 1.6 percent for pulses) still remain far
     below what the farmers are expected to demand (25 percent).

     3.3.4  Private Sector Participation
     The fertilizer subsidy program has eliminated the private sector from
     the business of importing fertilizers. In addition, private traders have
     been eliminated from distributing fertilizers as the distribution chan-
     nel is through the quasi-private cooperatives. The government subsidizes
     imports through two public companies. Private importers cannot compete with
     these public companies unless they are also subsidized. And although the gov-
     ernment subsidizes only Urea, Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), and Muriate of
     Potash, it is not plausible that private importers could compete on other types
     of fertilizers. This is because the government is essentially subsidizing impor-
     tation of the nutrients in fertilizers (N, P, and K) and all fertilizers carry the
     same nutrients, albeit in varying amounts. On the distribution side, the program
     mandates that subsidized fertilizers should be distributed through coopera-
     tives, which effectively crowds-out private traders from the distribution busi-
     ness. Cooperatives may be regarded as quasi-private because they are owned by
     private individuals (farmers) but greatly influenced by the government. They
     don’t operate under the rules for the private sector. However, there is a small
     alternative chain where farmers are buying fertilizers. Based on the survey data,
     the quantity of fertilizers purchased from the alternatives sources were zero for
     organic fertilizers, 3 percent of the quantity of potash fertilizers, 3 percent for
     DAP, and 2 percent for Urea (see Figure 3.5). Distribution of improved seeds

follows multiple channels. However, the cooperatives appears to be the most
dominant channel for staple grains as the proportion of seeds bought from coop-
eratives were 77 percent for maize, 73 percent for rice, 69 percent for wheat.
Seeds development for these crops is with the public sector, beginning with
production of breeder and foundation seeds by the Nepal Agricultural Research
Council (NARC). On the other hand, the private sector is significant in seed
development for vegetables. This explains why only 43 percent of vegetable
seeds and 17 percent of lentils seeds was bought from cooperatives.

3.3.5  Retail Fertilizer Prices
Overall, it seems that the government is able to keep fertilizer prices
above Indian retail prices, especially for Urea which takes the largest
share of imports and is the most commonly used fertilizer in Nepal.
While the government is keen to provide farmers with subsidized fertilizers,
there is risk that if the prices are too low subsidized fertilizers might be resold
across the border to India. This risk is mitigated by setting the subsidized border
prices at least 20 percent higher than retail prices prevailing across the border
in India. In April 2014 the border prices for subsidized fertilizers in Nepal were:
18 Nepali Rupees (NRs) per kg for Urea, 45 NRs per kg for Diammonium
phosphate (DAP), and 31 NRs per kg for Muriate of Potash (Economic Survey,
2014/15)—which was more than 100 percent higher than Indian retail prices
for Urea, 22 percent higher than Indian retail prices for DAP, and 9 percent
higher than Indian retail prices for Muriate of Potash (MoP).

The program is providing substantial subsidy relative to international
markets. Figure 3.6 provides a comparison of Urea prices between Nepal, India,
and international prices from 2005 to 2015. The data from 2005 and 2008
reflect the prevailing prices before the subsidy program was introduced, while
prices after 2008 capture the period after the program was introduced. The
data suggests that Nepal retail prices and international prices were at par when

     the program was introduced in 2008. That changed after the subsidy program
     was introduced and since 2009 the international prices have been higher than
     retail prices in Nepal. The largest wedge was in April 2012 when international
     prices were more than twice the retail price in Nepal. With the subsidy program
     the nominal retail prices for urea fertilizers have stabilized at lower levels than
     international prices, which indicates that the program has not only been provid-
     ing substantial subsidy but also shielding farmers from volatile prices in inter-
     national markets. This is consistent with official data which indicates that the
     program provides substantial subsidy to farmers (see Table 3.2). In particular
     the official data suggests that the subsidy rate for Urea was more than 60 per-
     cent in 2008/09, 59 percent in 2009/10, 46 percent in 2010/11, 57 percent in
     2011/12, and 61 percent in 2012/13.

     3.3.6  Cost of Distribution Services
     The cost of transport per-unit of fertilizer is high because of value chain
     inefficiencies and this reduces the actual subsidy received by farmers.
     A cost build-up conducted to study the prices of subsidized fertilizers at vari-
     ous points in the chain is summarized in Table 3.3. It shows that cooperatives
     charged farmers a mark-up of about 22 percent more than the price they had
     bought Urea fertilizers from AICL, while the mark-up for DAP and MoP was
     much less at 8 percent and 13 percent respectively.

     Discussions with AICL head office in Kathmandu and AICL branches
     suggested that there is enough fertilizers available in the AICL branches and

                  that the cooperatives can buy as much as they need and whenever they need.
                  However, visits with different cooperatives in the sampled districts suggested
                  otherwise—that cooperatives do not get enough fertilizers and on many occa-
                  sions are not able to fill the trucks with fertilizers. This increases the per-unit
                  cost of transportation from AICL depots/branches to cooperatives. The cost is
                  passed over to the farmer, which reduces the subsidy received by the farmer.

                  3.3.7  Consistency with the Distribution of Poverty and Food
                  and Nutrition Security
                  The distribution of subsidized fertilizers is not targeted to address pov-
                  erty, food insecurity, or nutrition status. The Central region has consistently
                  received most of the chemical fertilizer every year since the program was intro-
                  duced in 2008 and its share has ranged from 45 percent in 2009/10 to 53 per-
                  cent in 2010/11 and 2012/13 (see Figure 3.7). A similar pattern is observed
                  with organic fertilizers where the Central region received about 46 percent of
                  organic fertilizers distributed in 2013/14. This pattern appears inconsistent with
                  the distribution of indicators for poverty, food insecurity, and nutrition status.
                  For example, Figure 3.8 shows that both the proportion of poor people and the
                  absolute number of poor people is highest in Western region and significantly
                  lower in Central region. Furthermore, data from the National Demographic and
                  Health Surveys show that food and nutrition security indicators are worse in
                  the Western region of Nepal. For example, the rate of stunting among children

under five years old is about 55 percent in Western region compared to the
national average of 41 percent. The main implication of the regional distribution
of fertilizer subsidies is that the program does not seem to be consistent with
addressing regional disparities in poverty and food and nutrition security—and
therefore it does not promote shared prosperity. Instead the program is likely to
aggravate inequality among the rural population.

3.3.8  Relative Access between Large and Small Farmers
Large farmers are more likely to access the subsidized fertilizers and
seeds compared to small farmers. The initial rules were that these programs
would target small farmers, which were defined as those with land-holding less

      than 4 hectares in Terai and less than 0.75 ha (15 Robani) in Hills. But this
      rule was not tenable and it was later rescinded, in part because its implementa-
      tion meant that farmers who did not meet the criteria would have no sources
      of fertilizer. The program had eliminated the private sector from the business
      of importing and distributing fertilizers. The targeting of specific crops (paddy,
      wheat, maize, and millet) was also rescinded for similar reasons—because
      regardless of whether farmers were targeted or not, they could not find an alter-
      native supply of fertilizers to be used on other crops. The removal of the target-
      ing criteria that was based on land-holding appears to have improved access
      to larger farmers at the expense of small farmers. This conclusion is based on
      data collected from a sample of 240 farmers across Terai and hill districts (see
      Figure 3.9). The analysis mimicks the original targeting criteria and categorizes
      farmers with land-holding less than 4 hectares in Terai as small farmers and
      those more than the threshold were classified as large farmers, and in the Hills
      farmers with less than 0.75 ha were categorized as small and the rest large. In
      Terai the data shows that 100 percent of large farmers purchased subsidized
      fertilizers while the proportion of small farmers accessing the subsidy was about
      95 percent. And in the hills, about 89 percent of large farmers accessed the
      subsidy compared to 87 percent of small farmers. Similar patterns are observed
      on distribution of subsidized improved seeds in the Hills region where about
      63 percent of large farmers received subsidized seeds compared to 38 percent
      of small farmers. However, in the Terai a larger proportion of small farmers
      (66 percent) received subsidized seeds compared to 60 percent of small farmers.
      The reasons for this break from the pattern is likely due to larger farmers in Terai
      having alternative sources of improved seeds, including their own retained seeds

as more of them could also be seed multipliers as well as other various programs
for seed distribution.


3.3.9  Relative Access between Members and Non-Members
of Cooperatives
All farmers, large or small, who were members of cooperatives had managed to
access the subsidized fertilizers. But this was not the case for non-members (see
Figure 3.10). About 14 percent of non-member small farmers were not able to
access subsidized fertilizers and about 17 percent of non-member large farm-
ers could not access the inputs. The patterns for access to subsidized improved
seeds are somewhat different. Among members, only about 59 percent of small
farmers were able to access the seeds, which is substantially lower than the
82 percent of large farmers who accessed the inputs. Among non-members, a
larger proportion of small farmers (56 percent) accessed subsidized seeds com-
pared to 33 percent of large farmers.

3.3.10  Effectiveness of Information Dissemination, Governance
Systems, and Accountability

for those that are aware, many do not know much about the related

     governance systems. This was particularly so among farmers who are not mem-
     bers of cooperatives. For those who were aware of the program, most learned
     about it through word of mouth as opposed to more reliable and formal mecha-
     nisms. There are more effective ways of sharing information such as community
     radio, because it could cost-effectively reach community members who cannot
     read or write. There is a District Fertilizer Management Committee under the
     chairmanship of Chief District Officer (CDO) where the District Agriculture
     Development Officer (DADO) is the member secretary of the Committee. This
     Committee did not appear to be working very effectively. It was also observed
     that some cooperatives do not have the capacity to provide farmers with advisory
     services on appropriate and safe use and handling of fertilizers.

     3.4 Recommendations
     Develop a soil fertility management program to redress imbalanced use
     of fertilizers, introduce efficient and profitable use of fertilizers, and
     reorient the current subsidy program towards smart subsidies. The
     government subsidy program is supplying about 50 percent of the estimated
     demand for fertilizers. It’s unlikely that the subsidy could be expanded to cover
     all demand without imposing major pressures on the national treasury, which is
     exactly what led to the disbanding of the previous subsidy program in 1996/97.
     Furthermore, the current program is supplying only Urea, DAP, and potash fer-
     tilizers with Urea occupying more than 60 percent of the subsidized quanti-
     ties. Urea (46:0:0) constitutes of only nitrogen (N) and no phosphorous (P) or
     potassium (K). It means there has been imbalanced use of fertilizers for the past
     several years that requires to be corrected through a national soil fertility man-
     agement program. Addressing the imbalances would increase efficiency in the
     use of fertilizers and improve farm profitability. Table 3.4 shows that long-term
     soil fertility and sustaining yields requires balanced use of fertilizer nutrients (N,
     P, and K) rather than predominantly N as has been the case in Nepal. Farmers
     that could use fertilizers profitably without subsidy should not be subsidized
     and the proposed soil fertility management program could help identify such
     farmers. The ongoing subsidies could be transformed into smart subsidies with
     the following principles: (a) target farmers that need to learn about proper use
     of fertilizers; (b) target farmers could use fertilizers profitably but are not able
     to do so due to working capital constraints; and (c) deliver the subsidy through
     the private sector by adopting voucher systems that have worked in other coun-
     tries. A good example of successful voucher programs is in Senegal where the
     World Bank funded West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program is delivering
     smart subsidies through e-vouchers (see Box 3.1). Other examples of voucher
     schemes are in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, and Liberia.

     Consider using the smart subsidy program with the features described
     above to also redress the regional disparities in poverty and food and
     nutrition security. Governments often use instruments such as employment

Box 3.1  Example of Smart Subsidy e-Voucher Scheme in Senegal

The West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) has developed a new e-voucher
platform which exploits cell phone technology. It started with a pilot where 20,000 farmers
were enrolled in 2012. In 2013 the program was scaled up to 200,000 farmers. By 2015 the
program had expanded country-wide with approximately 800,000 farmers enrolled. A huge
database has been built through the program including farmer’s cell phone number, gender,
crop variety, area, location and organizational status (head of village or producer organi-
zation or cooperative or simple member). The fertilizer is delivered through private sector
agro-dealers or suppliers (including seed cooperatives). They have contact persons in the
community. Each supplier is registered and mandated to distribute a pre-agreed volume of
inputs. Distribution is usually through producers’ organizations (PO) or local committees that
include representatives from local authorities. The electronic platform uses SMS and Interac-
tive Voice Response (IVR) to: (i) notify various persons (the contact person of the PO or the
local committee) about availability of the input at a locally mapped agro-dealer; (ii) send
e-vouchers to farmers; (iii) validate vouchers and (iv) distribute the subsidy. The web-based
e-voucher platform instantaneously tracks the subsidy from the time throughout the chain.

     guarantee programs, conditional cash transfers, and pension schemes to reduce
     poverty. Input subsidies may also be designed for this purpose, as well as to
     address food security and nutrition related objectives. Smart subsidies can also
     be used to channel more supply to the Western region, where both the pro-
     portion and absolute number of poor people are highest, and where food and
     nutrition security indicators are the lowest. For example, the rate of stunting
     among children under five years old is about 55 percent in Western region com-
     pared to the national average of 41 percent. Furthermore, both the proportion
     of poor people and the absolute number of poor people are highest in Western
     region and lower in Central region. But it is the Central region which has consis-
     tently received most of the fertilizer subsidy since the program was introduced
     in 2008, with its share ranging from 45 percent in 2009/10 to 53 percent in
     2012/13. This leads to the conclusion that the current regional distribution of
     the fertilizer program is not consistent with addressing national goals of poverty
     reduction and equality.

4.1  Why Study Ginger Value Chain
The Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (2015) identified ginger as one
of the priority products with export potential. Ginger is one of the most
cultivated spice crops in Nepal, with around 19,376 ha under cultivation and
235,033 MT of production in 2012/13 (NSCDP, 2014). It is one of the major
spice crops traditionally grown in the middle mountain areas of Nepal to gener-
ate cash incomes to rural communities. It plays an important role in supporting
rural livelihoods, including for the poor, marginal and disadvantaged communi-
ties. It is estimated that over 66,000 families in Nepal have been cultivating
ginger, out of which many are smallholder farmers (NEAT, 2011). Ginger has
proven to be more lucrative than cereal crops.

The global ginger industry is rapidly expanding, driven by growing
demand and increased productivity. On the supply side, the global gin-
ger production is increasing each year with an average annual growth rate of
6.25 percent per annum from 2003 to 2013 (FAOSTAT, 2014). The production
was around 1.24 million MT in 2003 and reached up to 2.14 million MT in
2013. However, the annual growth rate of area harvested is negative (–1.50 per-
cent) from 2003 to 2013 (Figure 4.1). The area harvested, which was around
334,935 hectare in 2003 reached 415,512 hectares in 2006 and then declined
to 336,440 hectares in 2013. Production trends also reveals a steady increase in
the global average productivity with an annual yield growth rate of 7.86 percent
from 2003 to 2013. Global yield was 3.72 MT per ha in 2003 and increased to
6.36 MT per ha in 2013. On the demand side, the global consumption of ginger
is increasing due to its human health benefits, increasing population and chang-
ing food habits. Many value added products have been developed from ginger—
such as ginger tea, ginger candy, ginger beer, and ginger cough syrup—and these
products have contributed to increased consumption (FAO, 2002).

                      India, China, and Nepal are the leading countries in ginger produc-
                      tion. India and China alone accounted for 54 percent (India 34 percent, China
                      20 percent) of the world’s total production in 2012. Nepal is in the third posi-
                      tion with a share of 12 percent of the total world production. Other leading
                      countries in terms of production are Nigeria, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
                      Japan, Cameroon and Taiwan. The production of ginger in India has increased
                      significantly by about 80 percent in quantity between 2008 and 2011. China
                      has increased production by 43 percent during the same period and likewise
                      production in Nepal has increased steadily during this time frame by 58 per-
                      cent. Japan, Cameroon and Taiwan are also increasing ginger production but the
                      other leading producers namely Nigeria, Thailand, Indonesia and Bangladesh
                      are experiencing declining trends. In 2008 to 2012 India accounted for 47 per-
                      cent (150,000 ha) of the world’s total cultivation area (322,157 ha), whereas
                      Nigeria, China, Indonesia accounted for 15 percent, 12 percent and 8 percent
                      respectively. Nepal is fifth in the world in terms of area harvested for ginger with
                      6 percent of the world’s cultivation area.

                      Nepal ranks third in the world in ginger production, but it is placed
                      eighth in terms of export quantity and is far lower in the rank in terms
                      of export value. Nepal mostly trades in fresh ginger but some quantity of dried
                      ginger is also traded, mostly from the western part of the country. In 2013,
                      Nepal exported 35,506 MT of fresh ginger, 397 MT of dried ginger and 7 MT
                      of powdered ginger—see Trade and Export Promotion Center (TEPC) 2014.
                      China has remained the major ginger exporter for more than a decade and
                      accounts for 61.7 percent of world exports—see Figure 4.2. The Netherlands
                      is second, however, it mostly re-exports the ginger to other countries. Thailand
                      and India are the third and the fourth largest exporters.

                      Ginger exports from Nepal fetch the lowest prices due to poor quality
                      and lack of Sanitary and Phyto Sanitary Standards (SPS). Nepal fetches

low prices since it has not been able to access high-value export markets. This is
mainly due to lack of proper regulatory provisions, infrastructure and expertise
for compliances to SPS matters related to IPPC and Codex. For example, Nepal
cannot identify pest free areas as per International Standards of IPPC. The only
external market Nepal has traditionally been able to access is India.

If Nepal wants to enter remunerative markets, and perhaps earn at least as much
as India, it has to invest in SPS. The potential gains are huge—from US$205 per
unit to US$1,355 per unit—which is more than 500 percent increase in export
prices.

     4.2  Benchmarking with EU Quality and Safety Standards
     4.2.1  Categories of Ginger Imports
     Ginger products exported from Nepal to the EU would be subject to
     no tariff, and this applies for both fresh and dried ginger. The EU uses
     the Combined Nomenclature (CN) for the customs classification of goods. The
     CN 8-digit code numbers are based on the Harmonized System (HS) nomen-
     clature: the first six digits refer to the HS headings and then two digits follow
     to represent the CN subheadings. In the EU, ginger is imported under two cat-
     egories: (a) HS 0910-11, which refers to ginger, neither crushed nor ground; and
     HS 0910‑12, which refers to ginger, crushed or ground. The fresh ginger con-
     signment directly goes to Plant Quarantine section while dried ginger is sent for
     Customs Inspection. Based on the inspection and testing status the consignment
     is either cleared for domestic distribution, disposed, or reshipped to the country
     of origin. Documents required from the exporter in Nepal include Certificate
     of Origin of the product and Phytosanitary certificate. In terms of sampling the
     cargo, the EU inspection requires volume equal to the “square root” of the bags
     to be checked randomly. This means that if there are 400 bags, 20 bags must be
     taken randomly and sent to external labs for analysis. However, in the case of
     new supplying countries such as Nepal, it is very likely that the first few con-
     signments will be more thoroughly checked.

     The EU regulations focus on safety and traceability. The EU legislation
     sets the basis for legal requirements in its member countries, but some member
     states may have their own additional regulations or there may be some dif-
     ferences in the way EU regulations are implemented across its member states
     within the context of national legislation. For example, the Netherlands, which
     is an EU member that recently imported a small quantity of ginger from Nepal,
     follows EU legislation and does not have any additional requirements regarding
     ginger. Food imported into the EU must comply with the import requirements
     that apply to the type of food concerned. These can be requirements regarding:

     •	 Health control (e.g. food law, hygiene, microbiological criteria, contaminants,
        pesticides and veterinary medicinal products);
     •	 Plant health (phytosanitary) control against harmful organisms;
     •	 Other requirements (e.g. food additives, vitamins/minerals, food contact
        materials, food irradiation, nutrition claims, novel foods, radioactivity, GMOs,
        packaging, labelling and organic products).

     In addition, the EU can decide, on the basis of risk assessments, to increase
     the level of control for food products of plant origin (e.g. fruits and vegetables,
     spices and herbs, rice and pulses) that have a high risk for non-compliance when
     originating in a particular country. Such controls would focus on the presence
     of a certain contaminant, pesticide residue, and unauthorized food additive or
     labeling problems. They always include a full check, covering documentary,

Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


identity and physical controls. Annex I of Regulation (EC) 669/2009 lists the
food products subject to the increased control regime. Ginger imported from
India is subject to such checks and 50 percent of all ginger consignments from
India entering the EU have been checked. In the EU, there is a warning system
through which EU member states communicate with each other on unsafe food
products detected on their national markets. The system is called Rapid Alert
System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

4.2.2  Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) of Pesticides
The EU has strict criteria for approval of pesticides and controls the maxi-
mum residue levels (MRLs) in imported foodstuffs. The EU has set maxi-
mum residue levels (MRLs) of pesticide in and on food products. Products that
exceed the maximum residue level of a pesticide are not allowed to enter the EU
market. The details of various MRLs for ginger set by EU are given in Annex 4.1.
The Regulation summarizes all products covered in the document in 10 groups.
Fresh ginger and dried ginger are included in these products. The EU list of MRL is
an exhaustive one and the exporters must have precise data on pesticides sprayed
on ginger and their relevance and requirements in EU import conditions.

To meet the EU requirements Nepalese ginger growers and exporters
would need to answer the following questions:

•	 Which are the pesticides that they used (if any) in their ginger production?
•	 Are there MRLs in the EU for the pesticide varieties that they used?
•	 If there are MRLs in the relevant EU legislation, have Nepalese growers used
   them within the EU MRLs limits?

The problem in addressing the above questions is that there are a lot of pesti-
cides in the market that have been banned by the government or are fake rep-
licas. Examples of banned pesticides include: Chloride, DDT, dieldrin, andrin,
aldrin, hectochlore, mirex, texaphene, BHC, linden, organomercury fungicides,
methyl parathion, and monocrotophus. Although these products are banned,
many of them are available in the Nepali market, and this is according to the
Pesticides Registration Division. The problem is mainly that of enforcement
because the Pesticide Act 1991 and its first amendment in 2008 have a provi-
sion of a nominal fine only, which is clearly not commensurate with the damage
caused by using banned or fake pesticides. To address this issue, there has to be:
(a) better information management on pesticides used in ginger fields to verify
that those are in the approved list (green list) of EU and (b) capacity in terms
of both expertise and infrastructure to detect MRLs as per EU/Codex standards.

4.2.3  Aflatoxins and Other Contaminants
Aflatoxin, which is a type of mycotoxin, is the most critical contaminant
in ginger. Aflatoxins are genotoxic carcinogenic substances which develop at

Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity   49
	                                Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness


     high temperatures and humidity levels. Other mycotoxins are ochratoxin A,
     Patulin and Fusarium mycotoxins. The Netherlands requirements are fully
     based on the existing EU legislation. However, Germany and the UK have
     set additional requirements which are often stricter than the EU levels. These
     must be checked in advance. For Ginger, aflatoxin levels in parts per billion are:
     (a) Aflatoxin B1 (< 5 ppb), and (b) Aflatoxin B1 + B2 + G1 + G2 (< 10 ppb).
     More generally, the EU food safety policy has set maximum levels for many
     other contaminants in specified products or product groups. Contaminants are
     those substances that are not intentionally added to food but may be present in
     food as a result of improper handling during production, manufacture, process-
     ing, preparation, treatment, packing, transport or holding of the food as a result
     of environmental contamination. The regulations are set in Regulation (EC)
     1881/2006 and should not be confused with the MRLs of pesticides in food.
     These substances include:

     •	 Nitrates: Commission Regulation 1882/2006
     •	 Mycotoxins: Commission Regulation 401/2006
        http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32010R0165
     •	 Dioxins: Commission Regulation 252/2012
     •	 Heavy metals, Tin, 3-MCPD and benzo(a)pyrene: Commission Regulation
        333/2007 as amended by Commission Regulation 836/2011

     The EU Regulation 2011/1130/EU regulates the usage of additives in food. In
     the case of ginger, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is the most common reported additive.
     The levels of usage of SO2 for bleaching dried ginger are set at: ML = 150 mg/
     kg, only dried ginger. A list of authorized food additives and their conditions of
     use approved for use in food can be consulted via the food additives database.

     4.3  International Standards for Ginger Quality
     4.3.1  International Standards
     Most export market use the Codex Alimentarius, American Spice Trade
     Association (ASTA) and European Spice Association (ESA). These stan-
     dards are influenced by the standards set by the major importing countries.
     Various types of tests make up the range of international standards and these
     tests include cleanliness, ash level, acid insoluble ash (AIA), volatile oil (V/O)
     determination, moisture content, microbial measures, pesticides level, myco-
     toxin level and particle size.

     The Codex Alimentarius international food standards, guidelines and codes of
     practice contribute to the safety, quality and fairness of international food trade
     (http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/en/). Consumers can trust the
     safety and quality of the food products they buy and importers can trust that
     the food they ordered will be in accordance with their specifications. The Codex

Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


Standard for Ginger (CODEX STAN 218-1999)—includes provisions on qual-
ity, size, tolerance and presentation. It also provides standards for marking or
labelling, and determining contaminants and hygiene. This Standard applies to
the rhizome of commercial varieties of ginger grown from Zingiber officinale
roscoe, of the Zingiberaceae family, to be supplied fresh to the consumer, after
preparation and packaging. Ginger for industrial processing is excluded. Among
others, the produce covered by this Standard shall comply with the maximum
levels of the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food
and Feed (CODEX STAN 193-1995). The produce covered by this Standard
shall comply with the maximum residue limits for pesticides established by the
Codex Alimentarius Commission.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international
non-governmental organization developing International Standards according
to principles stipulated by the World Trade Organization’s Technical Barriers
to Trade Committee (WTO/TBT), especially: transparency, openness, impar-
tiality and consensus. ISO also addresses the concerns of developing countries
(http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm). The following ISO applies: (a) ISO
16928:2014 Essential oil of Ginger [Zingiber officinale Roscoe]—specifies cer-
tain characteristics of the essential oil of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) cul-
tivated in China, India and West Africa, in order to facilitate assessment of its
quality; (b) ISO 1003:2008 specifies requirements for ginger (Zingiber officinale
­Roscoe)—the method for the determination of calcium are identified, as well as
 recommendations for storage and transport conditions; (c) ISO 13685:1997 gin-
 ger and its oleoresins—Determination of the main pungent components (Gin-
 gerols and shogaols) Method using high-performance liquid chromatography.

The South Asian Regional Standards Organization (SARSO, 2008) is a SAARC
Specialized Body that became operational on April 3, 2014. All standards final-
ized by SARSO will have a distinct identity and will be known as SAARC
Regional Standards (SARS) with a specific number like SARS 0001. Nepal is a
member of SARSO. However, no standards are developed for ginger so far.

4.3.2  Requirements for Export and Quality Assurance in USA (FAO, 2002)
Cleanliness Specifications for Spices. In 1969, the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) came to an agreement with spice importers in the
United States that the industry would control spice sampling and analysis prior
to entering the food consumer market. Since then, the American Spice Trade
Association (ASTA) has established standards for cleanliness specifications
and assured through its approved laboratories that no spices would enter the
food market without meeting the criteria. Contaminated or adulterated spices
would need proper sanitation and reconditioning, or would be returned to the
exporting country. The standards were changed over the years to also reach FDA
requirements for foods. The ASTA Cleanliness Specifications (Table 4.2) have
become a standard for most exporting countries, who have built their facilities

     to meet those requirements. Importing countries that do not have specified
     standards may use ASTA’s specifications. For ginger oil, the US has also adopted
     Food Chemical Codex standards—which have also been adopted by EU (see
     Table 4.3). And in addition, the U.S. Essential Oil Association has defined the
     following oleoresins standards—see Table 4.4.

     Ginger oil and oleoresins may be standardized to meet specific product require-
     ments. However, when this procedure is done, the product must be labeled
     WONF (With Other Natural Flavors), with the added natural flavor identified.

     4.3.3  Requirements for Organic Spices and Products
     A product must be certified by an accredited certification body before
     it is labelled and sold as “organic.” There are slight differences in standards
     between countries. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Move-
     ment (IFOAM) has established organic production, processing and trading stan-
     dards, and tried to harmonize certification systems worldwide. National and
     regional governments are also trying to work under a compatible minimum set
     of standards. The European Union (EU) has established basic regulations for
     organic products in 1991 (Council Regulation 2092/91), which apply to all
     products marketed as “organic,” “biologic,” “ecologic,” “biodynamic,” or similar
     terms. Imports may be accepted through procedures conforming to the export-
     ing country’s regulations, or by review of the certification documents, which

52                          Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


accompany each shipment. The EU regulation sets a minimum standard, and
member states or private certification bodies may certify standards that meet or
exceed EU regulation 2092/91. In the United States, the Organic Food Produc-
tion Act (OFPA) was passed into law in 1990, and since October 2002 has made
organic production and processing uniformly regulated across all of the United
States. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) branch of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture is administering the National Organic Program.

A common thread in different standards is that for a product to be labeled
“organic” it must be grown following organic agricultural practices, and its
post-harvest handling and processing must be done in certified facilities,
whether on the farm or in food packing or processing facilities. Only mechan-
ical, thermal or biological methods can be used in organic processing. The use of
genetically modified organisms (GMO) (plants, animals or bacteria) and products of
GMO are prohibited in organic production. Likewise, ionizing radiation and sewage
sludge are prohibited from organic agricultural practices. Labels of organic prod-
ucts must identify the certification body. In general, the Japanese organic standards
(Japan Agricultural Standards, JAS) follow the U.S. NOP standards. However, JAS
does not allow organic labeling on products that contain less than 95 percent organic
ingredients (the EU and NOP allow labeling “made with organic ingredients” for
products that contain between 70 percent and 95 percent organic ingredients).

To access external organic markets, Nepal needs to identify countries
(markets) that mutually recognize the organic standards adopted in
Nepal. Information on the standards of different countries need to be dissemi-
nated through workshops involving all value chain actors and all the relevant
stakeholders to encourage Nepalese farmers and traders to comply with the stan-
dards. The organic certification bodies in Nepal include: (a) Organic Certifica-
tion Nepal (OCN) Pvt. Ltd—a Third Party Certification Body is the first private
initiative to certify organic agricultural production, wild production, processing
and inputs for production in Nepal (www.certificationalliance.org/ver1/partners
.html); (b) The Himalayan Bio-organic Agriculture Center Nepal (HIMBOAC-
NEPAL)—Third Party Certification Body (www.himalayabio-organic.com);
(c) Coffee Co-operative Union Ltd—Third Party Certification Body, see Organic
Coffee Certification (www.coffeecullnepal.org).

4.4  Capacities and Constraints in the Institutional Framework
for Food Safety
4.4.1  Roles and Responsibilities of Government Departments
Food safety and quality management is under the jurisdiction of Min-
istry of Agricultural Development (MoAD) and Ministry of Livestock
Development (MoLD), and the Department of Food Technology and
Quality Control (DFTQC) under MoAD is the major government insti-
tution responsible for food safety and quality management. Enforcement

     of Food Act 1966 is the major regulatory activity of the DFTQC. It has the fol-
     lowing major activities regarding food safety and quality management:

     •	 Food inspection and checking compliance of food industry and retailers.
     •	 Licensing and record keeping of food industries.
     •	 Work as SPS inquiry point and communicate about SPS related rules, regula-
        tions and standards.
     •	 Standardization and harmonization of food safety norms.
     •	 Certification for export and import of food items.
     •	 Execution of consumer awareness activities about food safety and quality.
     •	 Development of appropriate food technology and training.

     Although food safety related matters are mostly handled by the DFTQC, the
     Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Department of Livestock Services (DLS)
     share some responsibilities to regulate food safety. DoA is generally responsible
     to enforce food safety related rules and regulation in pre-harvest agriculture
     production system. Enforcement of Plant Protection Act 1972 comes under the
     jurisdiction of DoA. Extension of GAPs to the farmers, pest surveillance, pest
     risk analysis and management of plant quarantine check posts are some of the
     major activities of the DoA to ensure safety of plant origin food.

     The Nepal Council for Standards (NCS) and Nepal Bureau of Standards
     and Metrology (NBSM) are the governing body for food related stan-
     dards and their mandate include developing standards for food safety.
     In addition, consumer groups are involved in creating awareness to the general
     public and influencing the government in the formulation and implementation
     of the rules and regulation. The NCS is the government body responsible to
     approve and endorse Nepalese Standards. The NBSM under the Ministries of
     Industry and of Commerce and Supplies acts as the secretariat for the NCS
     which prepares the country standards of food products and methods of food
     processing. There are more than 100 standards in Nepal for food, food process-
     ing, transport and storage of which two are for ginger: NS 12:2037 Dry Ginger
     (Nepali Name: Sutho) and NS 448:2061 Ginger (http://www.nbsm.gov.np).

     4.4.2  Coordination Mechanisms Are Lacking
     The Residue Monitoring Plan is one area where there is a need for active
     coordination as all departments (DFTQC, DoA, and DLS) are involved.
     Residue monitoring at production and post-harvest levels is key to meeting
     safety standards. The DFTQC is mandated for post-harvest activities and DoA/
     DLS are concerned with pre-harvest activities, but there are important over-
     laps in these roles and responsibilities. An active coordination among different
     departments is needed for export certification. The information generated by
     all the involved departments have a technical link and need to be shared at one
     platform which then becomes the basis for export promotion.

Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	



The SPS Enquiry Point, which is housed at DFTQC, is the single gov-
ernment body which interfaces with both DoA and DLS, and therefore
its relevance depends on coordinated actions. The SPS Enquiry point is
responsible to provide answers to all reasonable questions from interested coun-
tries as well as providing relevant documents. The SPS Enquiry Point also orga-
nizes stakeholders meetings, notifies rules and regulations and guidelines related
to SPS for plant, animal and human health. The SPS Enquiry point has recently
prepared guidelines for agro-products to be addressed by different Food Quar-
antine Laboratories and also prepared the Performance Based Incentive System
for Food Quarantine laboratory as well as Plant and Animal Quarantine staff.
There is need for better coordination, especially in the following areas: (a) epi-
demiologic surveys and link to food—better coordination between Ministry of
Health and Population and DFTQC; (b) import controls where single window
would need coordination between different Departments of MoAD and cus-
toms; (c) codex related activities on detection of MRLs, microbial contaminants,
etc.; (d) testing and networking of laboratories; and (e) recognition of voluntary
certifications given by NBSM and private certification bodies.

4.4.3  Laboratory Capacity for Testing and Human Capacity
Are Not Sufficient
The laboratories do not have sufficient capacity for testing presence of
important contaminants. There is no laboratory capacity for testing and moni-
toring pesticide residues, mycotoxins, and microbial contamination as per Codex
standards/EU requirements. The existing laboratories lack both high precision and
basic instruments and equipment’s to test for diseases, pesticide levels, microbial
contaminations, heavy metals, etc. For example, the Central Food Research Labora-
tory was granted accreditation as per ISO 17025 by National Accreditation Board
for Testing and Calibration laboratories in 2012, but the scope of accreditation is
limited to 27 parameters and does not include microbial contaminants and heavy
metals. The ability to test for these contaminants is crucial to complying with
various standards in export markets—for example the EU standards discussed in
previous section—and is therefore necessary for promoting Nepal’s products and
ultimately accessing export markets. Both DoA and DFTQC have mandates on
pesticides testing. There is a need for better coordination in implementing the pes-
ticide monitoring plan (PMP), especially because of the overlapping roles—PMP
implementation before the produce comes to the domestic market is handled by
DoA and the testing for MRL prior to export is responsibility of DFTQC.

The human capacity for conducting testing, coordinating SPS issues, and
enforcing inspections is weak. There is a lack of advance level trainings to per-
sonnel involved in laboratory testing and inspections, especially as it relates to
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Global
Health Partnerships (GHP), and production and processing systems. To address
these gaps sufficient training modules should be developed. Furthermore, there is

     Box 4.1  Organization and Capacity of DFTQC

     At the central level, the DFTQC has two divisions: (a) Food Quality Control Division—which
     undertakes market inspection and legal actions, industry inspection, food industry licensing,
     food expert import inspection and certification, food standardization, inspection of hotels,
     restaurants and sweet shops, joint monitoring with other local agencies, consumer awareness
     and laboratory analysis of food/feed; and (b) Food Technology Development and Training
     Division—which undertakes product development and trial studies, food processing training,
     and consultancy services. Between 2012 and 2014 the department conducted trials for ginger
     candy preparation, evaluation of ginger pate quality, and evaluation of quality of ginger wine.
         The DFTQC has the following laboratories programs and laboratory facilities at the cen-
     tral level: (a) Central Food Research Laboratory—which was granted accreditation as per ISO
     17025 by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration laboratories in 2012. How-
     ever, the scope of the accreditation is limited to 27 parameters and does not include micro-
     bial contaminates and heavy metals. The lab undertakes major activities with respect to
     accreditation requirements such as internal audit, surveillance audit, etc. (b) National Nutri-
     tion Programme—which conducts nutritional analysis of non-conventional and traditional
     agro and forest based food, food and nutrition education and communication, weaning food
     promotion programme and training on food and nutrition. (c) SPS Enquiry Point—which
     is the single government body responsible to provide answers to all reasonable questions
     from interested countries, as well as for the provision of relevant documents. In addition,
     there are several regional offices which undertakes activities of the main two divisions of
     DFTQC. These include: (a) Biratnagar—five Food Inspection Units, (b) Hetauda—seven Food
     Inspection Units; (c) Nepalgunj—three Food Inspection Units; (d) Bhairwaha—four Food
     Inspection Units; (e) Dhangadi—one Food Inspection Unit; (f ) Four Food Quarantine Labo-
     ratories (Kakarvitta, Tatopanai, Birgunj and Mahindranagar); (g) Tribhuawan International
     Airport Customs Inspection Unit; (h) Food Inspection Units in twenty districts; and Apple
     Processing Centre at Jumla.




     limited size of manpower, especially at regional and district levels. In addition, there
     is a lack of attention towards Standard Operation Procedures (SoPs) for inspection
     and sampling of consignments and certification system. Capacity of the staff is
     weak on proper sampling procedures and methods for laboratory and field testing
     of samples, in particular MRLs, microbial contamination, toxin, heavy metals, etc.
     For example, the DFTQC has recently brought out a Sampling Manual for NTIS
     Agro-food Commodities. The document describes sampling methods for both
     fresh and dried ginger to be used in determining the quality of particular charac-
     teristics of fresh ginger and dried/powdered ginger as per ISO (1003:2008-Spices)
     norms (DFTQC, 2013 a). However, the capacity to adopt these norms is weak and
     this is partly the reason these norms have not been applied.

4.4.4  National Ginger Standards Are Inconsistent with Standards
in Lucrative Export Markets
Nepal does not follow the Codex Standard on Ginger rhizomes, which
describes quality specifications for the rhizome—in terms of size, tol-
erance, marking or labelling, contaminants and hygiene. The standards
also are required to comply with the maximum levels of the Codex General
Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed (CODEX STAN 193-
1995)—including the need to comply with the maximum residue limits (MRLs)
for pesticides established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. (Annex 4.2
describes these standards). Nepal cannot access lucrative export markets with-
out meeting these standards as meeting these standards is necessary for facili-
tating accreditation by exporters. In addition, it would improve domestic food
safety standards. Instead of the Codex standards, Nepal has defined Mandatory
National Standards for dried ginger and Dried ginger powder (DFTQC, 2013).
Dried Ginger (Sutho) means the clean and dried rhizomes of Zingiber officinale
which may not be uniform in shape and which may be peeled or unpeeled. It
should have the following properties (a) it should contain extraneous matter
not more than 2.0 percent (w/w); (b) it should contain volatile oil not less than
1.0 percent v/w on dry weight basis; (c) it should contain calcium oxide not
more than 4.0 percent (on dry basis) of calcium used; and (d) it should be free
from added color. On the other hand, Dried Ginger means the powder obtained
by grinding the dried ginger. It should have the following properties: (a) it should
contain moisture not more than 13.0 percent (w/w); (b) it should contain total
ash not more than 8.0 percent (w/w); (c) it should contain acid insoluble ash
not more than 1.0 percent; (d) it should contain cold water soluble extract not
less than 10.0 percent (w/w); (e) it should contain alcohol (90 percent v/w)
soluble extract not less than 4.5 percent (w/w); (f) it should contain volatile oil
not less than 1.0 percent (v/w); (g) it should contain calcium (as calcium oxide)
not more than 4.0 (w/w); and (h) it should be free from added colour.

4.5  Capacities and Constraints in Policy and Regulatory
Environment
4.5.1  Nepal Continues to Follow a Traditional Food Safety
and Regulatory Framework
Despite some recent progress in regulations, Nepal continues to follow a
traditional food safety and regulatory framework based on inspecting and
analyzing end products for food safety, instead of the modern food safety
approach of total quality management from farm to fork. The regulations for
food safety in Nepal began in 1966 with the Food Act (1966). These regulations
became even more important during the 1990s due to increased economic liber-
alization and international trade. The food safety related rules and regulations are
based on inspecting and analysing end products to ensure safety of the food. This
is in contrast to modern food safety approaches of total quality management from

Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity    57
	                                Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness


     ‘farm to fork’—which focus on all level of production, processing, transportation
     and trading. Modern food safety related regulations and policies have been gener-
     ally formulated following codex principles and guidelines focussing on preventive
     measures to produce safe food. There is some progress in that existing regulations
     and standards have been reviewed towards complying with codex standards, wher-
     ever feasible, but this effort has been slowed down by traditional national regula-
     tions and weak infrastructure (e.g. laboratories that lack necessary accreditation).
     The main regulatory framework consists of Food Act 1966 and Food Rules 1970,
     Plant Protection Act 2007 and Plant Protection Rules 2010, Pesticides Act 1991
     and Pesticides Rules 1993, and Animal Health and Livestock Services Act 1998.

     The Food Act and inspections are not following a preventive risk based
     approach. A preventive risk based approach calls for a shift in preventing food
     safety problems rather than reacting to them after they occur. For example,
     food legislation in the European Union and elsewhere includes both hazard and
     risk-based approaches for ensuring safety. In hazard-based approaches, simply
     the presence of a potentially harmful agent at a detectable level in food is used
     as a basis for legislation and/or risk management action. Risk-based approaches
     allow consideration of exposure in assessing whether there may be unaccept-
     able risks to health. Both types of approach have their place, depending on the
     context (Barlow et al., 2015). A risk-based, preventive food-safety system can
     be developed by leveraging HACCP, which is the primary risk-management
     system used by the food industry. HACCP provides a systematic preventive
     approach to food safety from various types of hazards in production processes
     that can cause the finished product to be unsafe. It also helps to design mea-
     surements to reduce these risks to a safer level. A recent example of preventive
     risk approach is The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) of US, which
     applies to certain unintentional hazards, such as microbiological, chemical,
     physical, or radiological hazards that may occur at a food facility that manufac-
     tures, processes, packs, or holds human food. Therefore, Nepal needs to draft
     food safety policy which should include establishing of a Food Safety Authority
     to develop safety norms from production to consumption level encompassing
     complete control of food chain.

     4.5.2  The Regulatory Framework Have No Provision to Enforce
     Traceability
     The regulatory framework have no provision to enforce traceability of
     the food items, which is one of the mandatory requirements for export
     of products to developed country markets like EU. Traceability means
     the ability to track any food, feed, food-producing animal or substance that
     will be used for consumption, through all stages of production, processing and
     distribution. Traceability is a way of responding to potential risks that can arise
     in food and feed in order to ensure that all food products are safe for citizens
     to eat. The EU’s General Food Law makes traceability compulsory for all food
     and feed businesses. It requires that all food and feed operators implement
58                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


special traceability systems. They must be able to identify where their prod-
ucts have come from and where they are going to and to rapidly provide this
information to the competent authorities. The EU has published guidelines
(available on the European Commission website) which require business oper-
ators to document the names and addresses of the supplier and customer in
each case, as well as the nature of the product and date of delivery. Opera-
tors are also encouraged to keep information on the volume or quantity of
a product, the batch number if there is one, and a more detailed description
of the product, such as whether it is raw or processed. For a summary of the
requirements see the following link—http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/docs/
gfl_req_factsheet_traceability_2007_en.pdf).

Much of the capacity for quality testing in Nepal is not relevant for
international food safety requirements. Existing legislation and the policy
framework for food safety do not have provisions for testing for MRLs and
microbial contaminations which are important criteria to be met for exporting
to lucrative markets. The EU has rejected consignments from many countries
during 2014 due to microbial contaminations alone. Although Nepal has man-
datory standards on 27 quality parameters (ash, insoluble ash, moisture, volatile
oil, extraneous material, etc.), the standards on essential food safety parame-
ters (MRLs, aflatoxins, microbial contaminants, and heavy metals) are yet to
be developed. There is no mention for compliances to Codex (CAC) as the
Food Act was made before WTO came to existence. In the modern globalized
world, the bilateral and multilateral agreements of international trade should
affects the policy, rules and regulations of a country. Nepal is already a member
of several important international organizations, and therefore it has a platform
to upgrade its food safety related policy, rules and regulations. The organiza-
tions for which Nepal is a member include WTO, IPPC, Codex Alimentarius
Commission (CAC), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), FAO, South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bay of Bengal Initiative
for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).

Kenya is one good example with a traceability mechanism in place for
ensuring food safety that Nepal could learn from. Food-borne diseases
are still a major problem in Kenya because of the enormous informal sector
in the food industry. The responsibility for coordinating the multiple institu-
tions (agencies) involved in food safety management rests on the Department of
Public Health (DPH) under the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation. Most
Kenyan standards are adopted from international ones, such as ISO and Codex.
In the food supply chain, farmers have to apply GAPs, sellers of commodities/
raw materials at local or international level have to apply Good Distribution
Practices, and manufacturers have to apply Good Manufacturing Practices. Food
supply chain operators have to apply either national (mandatory) standards or
private (voluntary) standards. Chain supporters provide the necessary impetus
while chain enablers provide the control and/or regulation. Kenya Bureau of
Standards is the major chain enabler. It is the National Codex Contact Point,

     serves as the secretariat of the National Codex Committee, and is the National
     Enquiry Point of the WTO (Oloo, 2010). Kenya provides a good example for
     Nepal to consider while developing its traceability mechanism.

     4.6  Recommendations for Policy and Investments
     4.6.1  Addressing Constraints in the Technology of Production
     A national program for quality ginger seed production should be devel-
     oped, perhaps as part of a national horticulture seed program because
     the issues in ginger seed cut across other horticulture crops. This would
     help alleviate the current practice of most farmers using locally available seed
     materials retained from previous crops. It is estimated that farmers keep between
     20 to 25 percent of their production to use as seeds for the next growing season.
     New growers purchase seeds from neighboring farmers or local markets. Ginger
     farmers in the mountains mostly preserved ginger seed from their last season
     crop, and it was learnt that many generally do not use pesticides on ginger. A
     consequence of the lack of a national seed development program is that only
     two major types of ginger are grown in Nepal. The two are known by the follow-
     ing local names: nashe (rich in fibre) and boshe (less fibre and thick rhizomes).
     The boshe varieties are mostly grown in and around Makwanpur and Salyan
     areas whereas nashe is most common in other parts. Due to less fibre content,
     the boshe varieties are priced higher than nashe. Fibre content of ginger is said to
     depend on soil type and climatic conditions. For example, boshe varieties from
     one location can produce highly fibrous rhizome when grown in other locations
     (HVAP, 2011). The difficulties in obtaining improved and certified seeds leaves
     farmers with seeds that are many times infected with seed borne diseases.

     Develop a national program for adoption of Good Agricultural Practices
     (GAP) for ginger and other commodities. The benefits of developing and
     then adopting GAPs include not only fulfilling trade and government regulatory
     requirements on food safety and quality, but more importantly meeting specific
     requirements of high value specialty or niche markets and improving food safety
     for domestic consumers. An expansion of GAP based ginger production would
     help to obtain better quality and healthier ginger products. GAP standards are
     crop and region specific. The recently concluded STDF project developed gin-
     ger growing manual and other training materials on GAPs, including for ginger
     cultivation, post-harvest handling of ginger, and SPS requirements suitable for
     target beneficiaries. Training programs are envisaged on value chain actors of
     GAPs, initially at Eastern region of Jhapa. These efforts need to be expanded
     to other ginger growing areas of the country. The adoption of GAPs may help
     reduce the risk of non-compliance with national and international regula-
     tions, standards and guidelines regarding permitted pesticides, maximum levels
     of contaminants (including pesticides and mycotoxins) in food and non-food
     agricultural products, as well as other chemical, microbiological and physical


60                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


contamination hazards. The lesson from the Ginger Competitiveness Project
in Eastern Region is that establishment of Farmer’s Field School has resulted
in an increase in ginger productivity and adoption of improved practices. These
efforts should be replicated throughout the country.

Develop an operational plan for monitoring contamination in value
chains of major commodities. This may involve both broadly defined as well
as commodity specific operational plans for avoiding, detecting and monitor-
ing the contamination levels of pests and pesticides in major commodities. To
implement such a plan there would be need to (i) develop specific training
modules and build capacity of government staff, and (ii) partnership program
with the private sectors (growers and traders) to share information and jointly
develop programs to improve traceability.

4.6.2  Addressing SPS Issues along Ginger Value Chain
Develop the capacity of laboratories to test presence of important con-
taminants. There is no laboratory capacity for testing and monitoring pesticide
residues, mycotoxins, and microbial contamination as per Codex standards/
EU requirements. The existing laboratories lack both high precision and basic
instruments and equipment’s to test for diseases, pesticide levels, microbial con-
taminations, heavy metals, etc. For example, the Central Food Research Labo-
ratory was granted accreditation as per ISO 17025 by National Accreditation
Board for Testing and Calibration laboratories in 2012, but the scope of accred-
itation is limited to 27 parameters and does not include microbial contami-
nants and heavy metals. The ability to test for these contaminants is crucial to
complying with various standards in export markets and is therefore necessary
for promoting Nepal’s products and ultimately accessing export markets. Both
DoA and DFTQC have mandates on pesticides testing. There is a need for bet-
ter coordination in implementing the pesticide monitoring plan. It’s important
for DFTQC to have sufficient capacity for testing all contaminants that are
important because the DFTQC is designated as the CODEX Contact point and
National SPS Enquiry Point for Nepal.

Build human capacity for conducting testing, coordinating SPS issues, and
enforcing inspections. There is a lack of advance level trainings to personnel
involved in laboratory testing and inspections, especially as it relates to Good Agri-
cultural Practices (GAP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Global Health
Partnerships (GHP), and production and processing systems. To address these gaps
sufficient training modules should be developed. Furthermore, there is limited size
of manpower, especially at regional and district levels. In addition, there is a lack
of attention towards Standard Operation Procedures (SoPs) for inspection and
sampling of consignments and certification system. Capacity of the staff is weak
on proper sampling procedures and methods for laboratory and field testing of
samples, in particular MRLs, microbial contamination, toxin, heavy metals, etc.

     Establish a local laboratory accreditation board to facilitate Mutual Rec-
     ognition Agreements (MRA). There is no local accreditation board to engage
     with international accreditation institutions such as the International Laboratory
     Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and other relevant bodies such as Interna-
     tional Accreditation Forum (IAF). Nepal relies on India’s National Accreditation
     Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for accreditation of its
     facilities. A local accreditation body would be able to promote Mutual Recogni-
     tion Agreements (MRA) with potential export markets. An MRA is important
     to facilitate trade as it provides a forum to define what is acceptable among trad-
     ing partners. On the other hand the lack of MRA may not prevent poor quality
     imports coming into the country as there are no accredited facilities to conduct
     tests with enforceable results.

     Operationalize Pesticide Residue Monitoring Plan. The recently devel-
     oped Residue Monitoring Plan needs to be formalized and operationalized as
     a national program and linked with monitoring at primary production level.
     Detection of contaminations at this level will contribute significantly to ensure
     that only clean material goes to the market.

     Build capacity for post-harvest storage and handling. This would involve
     the DoA developing training modules for all value chain participants, includ-
     ing farmers, extension workers of DADOs, traders, organized collection centers,
     etc. The modules will highlight the importance of washing, grading and drying
     of harvested Ginger rhizomes. In addition, there is scope for partnering with
     producer organizations—Nepal Ginger Producers and Traders Association—to
     establish such facilities at appropriate locations. For example, one such facility
     has been developed at Birtamond, Jhapa under STDF/FAO project.

     Comply with international standards for pest management—Interna-
     tional Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)/International Standards for
     Phytosanitary Measures1 (ISPM)—and the key actions for compliance
     include conducting pest risk analysis and identifying pest free areas or
     areas with low pesticides. There is no proper national survey and surveil-
     lance of ginger diseases and pests in Nepal nor is there a regular practice of pest
     reporting, although certain piecemeal efforts have been carried out in certain
     projects several years ago. A number of pests are reported but without much
     scientific data on their occurrence, epidemiology, management, etc. Only Rhi-
     zome rot with its visible symptoms and impact is considered as a major threat
     in production and export and all national efforts revolve around this disease.
     However, the ginger crop in the field was observed to suffer from yellow leaves
     and stems, brown discoloration of water conducting tissue within stem (indica-
     tive of rhizome rot), light yellow lower leaf tips, drooping, withered leaves and
     plants becoming stunted (indicative of bacterial rot or wilt), and also the appar-
     ent associations of insect pests such as white grubs, shoot borers and weevils in
     different intensities in various fields. There is lack of comprehensive documen-
     tation on occurrence and incidences of various diseases on ginger in Nepal. An

62                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Improve Export Competitiveness 	


investment is needed to conduct systematic study to investigate and document
various diseases and pests and their incidences in different ginger growing areas.
The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs 06, 08, 17 and
22) of IPPC needs to be adopted with local adaptation as National standards to
undertake this activity.

Strengthen the SPS enquiry point at DFTQC. The SPS Enquiry Point needs
to be strengthened to take up all matters related to SPS with importing coun-
tries and to facilitate trade negotiations based on scientific principles. The SPS
Enquiry point would also inform any SPS Agreement made with trade partners.
At present there is only one dedicated staff in the SPS Enquiry point, which is
insufficient not only for responding to queries from importing countries and
domestic industry, but also far from the capacity required to create and update
an effective knowledge base of all the SPS related information.

Align domestic standards for ginger with codex standards. Nepal does
not follow the Codex Standard on Ginger rhizomes, which describes quality
specifications for the rhizome—in terms of size, tolerance, marking or labelling,
contaminants and hygiene. The standards are required to comply with the maxi-
mum levels of the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in
Food and Feed (CODEX STAN 193-1995)—including the need to comply with
the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides established by the Codex
Alimentarius Commission. (Annex 4.2 describes these standards). Nepal cannot
access lucrative export markets without meeting these standards. In addition,
adopting these standards would improve domestic food safety standards.

Conduct SPS diplomacy for export promotion. The main element of SPS
diplomacy is engaging with regional and international organizations, particularly
those setting international standards, and the WTO SPS Committee. Developing
countries are often weak in this area and act as receivers of standards set by oth-
ers. SPS diplomacy is also essential in bilateral market access negotiations between
trade partners, and in resolving problems or disagreements which arise during
trade. SPS diplomacy relies on scientific capacity. There is need to develop capac-
ity for SPS diplomacy by training a batch of key experts on: (i) policy and regula-
tory affairs with special reference to compliances to SPS/WTO, (ii) technical skills
on pest reporting and risk analysis, (iii) mitigation measures identified by IPPC
and other reference standards, (iv) risk communications as per IPPC and Codex,
(v) marketing and trade promotion, and (vi) communication and negotiation skills.

Develop a national strategy for SPS information management, SPS risks
communication, and traceability system. The information management sys-
tem would bring together, in one platform, all information (legal, technical, insti-
tutional, export promotion, global markets) related to SPS matters of different
Ministries and Departments along with national standards and extent of compli-
ances to various IPPC/Codex Standards. Such a platform would also cover risk
assessment protocols and updates on SPS issues at different parts of the chains.

     In addition, once the SPS Risks are identified through risk assessment and results
     of field/laboratory tests during quality control or quarantine, there is need for
     a strategy to communicate risks to all value chain actors along with the related
     mitigation measures of risks. Furthermore, the Food Act under preparation could
     include a provision to manage traceability of the food items. There are very good
     lessons on establishing traceability systems from countries such as Kenya.

     Develop a national strategy to access high value niche organic mar-
     kets, including branding of organic ginger from Nepal. With the growing
     demand in organic products in the international markets, organic ginger from
     Nepal could be branded and marketed to serve the growing demand. Already
     farmers are practicing some important principles of organic farming, including
     low chemical pesticides and fertilizers, which indicates tremendous potential
     to further adopt organic principles. Efforts in this direction have been initiated
     in the recent past where certain private companies such as Annapurna Organic
     Agriculture Industry (Kapilvastu, Nepal) have exported Ginger to Netherlands,
     Japan and Dubai. It may be noted that in those cases the exporter has focused
     on quality control of the produce (that helped in eliminating the SPS risks).
     This seems to be an interesting example where the Codex Standards were not
     followed in strict sense but the importer and the importing countries were con-
     vinced that organic ginger did not pose safety and health risks. In the light of
     above, efforts in this direction should be made to develop GAP for organic
     ginger and then brand organic ginger as a separate product from other ginger.

     Note
     	 1.	The intention of ISPMs is to harmonize phytosanitary measures for the purpose
          of facilitating international trade. ISPMs can cover a wide range of issues includ-

          tion, phytosanitary certificates and pest reporting. The IPPC encourages adoption
          of these standards, but they only come into force once contracting (members) and
          non-contracting parties to establish requirements in national legislative instruments.
          IPPC standards generally fall into three categories: 1) Reference standards, such as
          the Glossary of phytosanitary terms; 2) Conceptual standards, such as the Guide-
          lines of pest risk analysis; 3) Specific standards, which typically directed at a specific
          pest or pathogen (e.g. surveillance for citrus canker).

Lessons on Policy and Investments
to Substitute Imports—Case Study
of the Cut-Flower Value Chain




5.1  Why Study Cut-Flower Value Chain?
The floriculture industry in Nepal grew by about 540 percent over
10 years between 2003/04 and 2013/14. The size of the industry—including
plants, seasonal flowers, and cut-flower—and estimated in terms of value of
transactions, is NRs. 1.28 billion (approximately USD 12.8 million1) in 2013/14.
This represents a tremendous 540 percent growth from about NRs. 0.2 billion
(approximately USD 2 million) in 2003/2004. Cut-flower forms the largest seg-
ment of the floriculture sector. Number of cut-flower showrooms in the country
has increased from 56 in 2003/2004 to 87 in 2014/2015.2 Total investment in
the Nepalese floriculture sector stands at US $9 million in 2015. There are a
total of 309 entrepreneurs involved in floriculture in Nepal, of which 132 are
in Kathmandu and 48 in Lalitpur. Total employment generation in the sector is
not very significant at the moment as it is still an emerging sector. Production is
largely in leased private land and in small pocket areas. The largest single pro-
duction unit is about 8.3 hectares of land. There are only a handful of producers
who have more than one hectare of cultivated area. About 50 percent of the
districts in Nepal are involved in floriculture and about 25 percent in cut-flower
production. The floriculture sector occupies 147 hectares.3 Due to favorable
topographic and climatic conditions of Kathmandu valley, commercial produc-
tion of floriculture products is mainly concentrated in and around the valley.

Domestic production for floriculture products has not been able to keep
up with the increasing market demand, and as a result imports have
increased by over 600 percent in ten years—from NRs. 1.3 million in
2003/2004 to NRs. 82 million in 2013/2014. Nepal imports floriculture
products from China, Israel, India, USA, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine, Italy, Fin-
land, Columbia, Australia, Japan and Turkey. The different categories of imports

                   include live trees and plants, bulbs, roots, cut-flowers and ornamental foliage,
                   etc. In some years there has been isolated imports of cut-flowers from Kenya,
                   Israel, the Netherlands, Columbia, and Australia. The main flowers imported
                   from India are Rose, Carnation, Crysanthemum, Lili, and Orchids while Orchid
                   is the only product imported from Thailand. Imports of floriculture products in
                   2014/2015 stood at NRs. 100 million (USD 1 million). However, the industry
                   players believe that the actual values exceed the official values by several times.

                   Floriculture exports are low and have been declining in the past five
                   years, except in 2010/11 when Nepal exported flowers worth about
                   $2 million. There are approximately 50 varieties of cut-flowers that are pro-
                   duced commercially. A Floriculture sector study conducted by ITC in 2007
                   identified Gladiolus, Rose, Carnation, Gerbera, Orchids, Chrysanthemum, Lily,
                   Cymbidium, Tuberose, etc., as having export potential. Past export records con-
                   firm Gladiolus, Rose, Carnation and Gerbera as leading the exports of cut-flow-
                   ers from Nepal. However, export of floriculture products over the last 10 years
                   has been on the decline with some unexplained surges in a few years—for exam-
                   ple in 2010/2011 (see figure 5.3 above).4 Overall, there has been an 88 percent
                   decline in export between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015. Exports in 2014/15 were
                   a mere $25,400 with the cut-flower segment even lower at $5,000. According

5.2 The Global Floriculture Industry
The global floriculture industry is growing and over the last decade the
leading flower exporting countries have been Netherlands, Colombia,
Kenya, Ecuador and Israel. Floriculture products comprising of cut-flow-
ers, cut foliage, living plants and flower bulbs are traded worldwide. Trading is
dominated by the cut-flower group followed by living plants. Global cut-flower
trade has achieved significant growth over the last decade. Developed coun-
tries in Europe, America and Asia comprise of 90 percent of markets for world
cut-flowers. The EU is the single largest importer of cut-flowers. According to

     Eurostat, a total of 415 thousand tons of cut-flowers worth € 1.59 billion was
     imported by the EU in 2014.5 Production continues to be dominated by the
     Netherlands, which produces about 83 percent of the world’s cut-flower fol-
     lowed by Colombia, Ecuador and Kenya. The African, Middle Eastern and Euro-
     pean countries dominate supply in the EU markets. According to EUROSTAT,
     Kenya is positioning itself as a supplier of quality products and Ethiopia is also
     continuing to increase its importance as an exporter to the EU.6 Columbia and
     Ecuador are the principal suppliers to the US market. Asia Pacific Countries
     including Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam are the major suppliers to Japan and
     Hong Kong.

     Investments in the global floriculture industry are shifting away from
     developed countries due to increasing production costs and shrink-
     ing margins, and towards developing countries where production costs
     are lower due to better climatic conditions and cheap labor. Tradition-
     ally strong producers like the Netherlands are losing market share to develop-
     ing countries such as Kenya, Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Malaysia. These
     countries have accelerated the technology of production and developed knowl-
     edge systems that have improved their competitiveness. Producers are able to
     achieve economies of scale through large production units for good quality flow-
     ers which has enabled them to offer competitive prices. However, the Nether-
     lands continues to hold strong as an auction hub for imports and exports of
     cut-flowers in Europe. Another major structural change in the global cut-flower
     market is the transport of cut-flowers by sea replacing air transport, which has
     traditionally been used to move cut-flowers. The major driver for this develop-
     ment is the price difference between air and sea transport—the latter is increas-
     ingly becoming cost effective and there is increasing progress in the technology
     of preservation that keeps flowers fresh during transportation by ship.

     5.3  Global Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary Standards
     Consumption patterns in European mass markets are characterized
     with increasing importance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) stan-
     dards as well as social and environmental concerns. Buyers in the world
     market are increasingly interested in conditions under which flowers are grown
     in developing countries. As a result a multitude of certification schemes, con-
     sumer labels and codes of conduct have been set up. Producer countries are
     increasingly required to adopt these standards and labels depending on their
     markets and distribution channels. The requirements in the EU mass markets
     can be divided into three categories: (a) mandatory requirements to enter the
     market; (b) common requirements that are needed to remain competitiveness
     in the market; and (c) niche market requirements.

     Phytosanitary Certifications issued by the exporting country. The mandatory
     requirements include the Phytosanitary Certifications issued by the exporting
     country. If the exporting flower falls under the endangered species according to

international CITES convention, such as in the case of certain orchids, an export
permit is required to be obtained from the exporting country as well as import
permit from the importing country.

Global Gap is another certificate related to good agricultural practices. Cut-flowers
that are sold through supermarkets increasingly require Global GAP certificate.
In addition, there are other standards that could apply depending on the mar-
kets such as the ETI (Ethical Trading Initiative) in the UK, and Business Social
Compliance Initiative in other European countries. Developing and imple-
menting cold chain protocols is increasingly becoming important to cut-flower
exporters as this has a direct effect on the quality and vase life of the flowers.
Another category of standards that is gaining importance in niche markets are
Fair Flowers Fair Plant, Fairtrade International, Florverde and Rainforest Alli-
ance and organic. Besides certification, buyers and consumers have very specific
demands on the product quality, delivery time and quantity.

5.4  Salient Features of the Cut-Flower Value Chain
Nearly all the planting materials and agro-chemicals are imported and
most greenhouses are of low technology using local materials because
of the high investment costs of importing high technology greenhouse.
The variable inputs in the production of cut-flowers include planting materi-
als (seeds, bulbs, saplings) and agrochemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
fungicides, etc.). Most of the planting materials for gerbera, gladiolus, carnation
and rose are imported. The main suppliers of inputs are SIAM Floritech, Crop
Pro-Tech, Flora Nepal and Floriculture Cooperative. The first three companies
mostly import planting materials from the Netherlands (Gerbera, Carnation,
Rose, Limonium), Germany (Rose), Poland (Gerbera), Israel (Carnation, Gyp-
sophila, Chrysanthemum and Asters) and India (Gerbera, Carnation). These
companies are sole authorized importers in Nepal for the breeding companies
they import from. In the past, mother plants for roses used to be imported
directly from the Netherlands, Spain, Israel and other destinations. But this
has changed as most of these global suppliers now have plant propagation cen-
ters in India, China, and Kenya. Input suppliers believe that planting materials
sourced directly from European breeders are consistent and superior in quality
than those sourced from propagation sites. However, the main advantages of
importing through India-based propagation sites are: (i) price advantage to the
importer due to transportation and currency conversion, and (ii) the input sup-
plier companies also provide technical support. Another key input supplier is
the Floriculture Cooperative, which mostly imports planting materials through
other importers and then supplies to producers. The Cooperative also imports
directly when planting materials are required in large quantities.

Small producers either buy the greenhouse system from importers such as Crop
Pro-Tech or buy greenhouse materials by parts. For example, importers bring in
ultraviolet (UV) plastic sheets and insect nets. However, small growers largely

	      Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain


     use silpaulin covering sheet that is easily available in local markets. Silpaulin is
     a cheaper option to the UV plastic film but does not have the same protective
     effect on plants. Most small growers locally build greenhouse structures using
     bamboo. Bamboo is an easily available alternative to GI or aluminum structures
     and it is attractive because of the low investment cost. However, in the long run
     bamboo could be more expensive due to the high maintenance costs. Although
     most producers currently use bamboo structures, they are eager to shift to the GI
     or aluminum structures. The greenhouses locally built by producers often work as
     mere shades and have little or no environment control mechanisms that are essen-
     tial to grow cut-flowers. There are also input supply companies such as SIAM Flo-
     ritech that design and fabricate manually operated greenhouses using aluminum
     or galvanized iron structures and offer option of silpaulin or UV plastic sheet cov-
     ering depending on demand. Locally designed and fabricated greenhouses are not
     temperature or humidity controlled, and therefore come with manually operated
     ventilation. Drip irrigation has gained popularity among commercial cut-flower
     producers in recent times and in some cases it has replaced canal irrigation. Sup-
     pliers for drip irrigation system import from India. The main suppliers are Nepal
     Thopa Sichai (translated as Drip Irrigation) and Crop Protect.

     Cut-flowers are not part of NARC special commodity research pro-
     grams: NARC is a government run research center dedicated to agricultural
     research under the umbrella of the Ministry of Agriculture Development. Its
     research priorities are decided upon by the Council—a decision making body
     within NARC and the research priorities are implemented by the five regional
     research stations. There are different disciplinary divisions within NARC that is
     relevant to the cut-flower sector such as plant pathology, soil science, soil sci-
     ence, commercial crops. NARC also has special commodity research programs.
     However, cut-flower is not one of them.

     Overall, production of cut-flowers in Nepal is a low technology affair.
     In total, there are about 544 entrepreneurs who are involved in floriculture,
     of which 63 producers are involved in commercial production of cut-flowers.
     Among the 63, about 43 producers use greenhouses or plastic covered shades
     while the remaining 20 produce in open areas. Even among the 43 using green-
     houses, only about 5 of them use high-tech or semi high-tech greenhouses. The
     main reason behind low technology is that the investment costs for imported
     high-tech greenhouses are high for an average producer. However, there are
     many benefits associated with such technologies, including (i) metal structure
     that is more durable than the locally made bamboo, (ii) temperature and humid-
     ity control features, (iii) pest control nets that offers benefits of reduced use of
     pesticides. Production of cut-flowers is dominated by small scale entrepreneurs.
     Some migrants who have returned home have also made investments in the
     cut-flower production. Producers also fulfill the role of transporters up to the
     wholesale point. There is no dedicated mode of transport for cut-flowers. Pro-
     ducers use any vehicle available such as local busses, vans, taxis and motorbikes.

Most transactions occur under some form of vertical coordination. There
are many ways to organize transactions in a value chain. One approach is through
spot markets where buyers and sellers have little or no coordination arrangement
and the terms of a transaction are negotiated on the spot and physical delivery
also takes place on the spot. This is one end of the spectrum. At the other end is
Vertical Integration where numerous stages of transforming inputs into products
are conducted by the same actor. In between spot markets and vertical integra-
tion, there are various forms of vertical coordination that could be employed.
An example of near vertical integration is Flora Nepal, which is involved in
everything from input supplies to wholesaling. The company imports planting
materials and greenhouses, operates its production, runs a wholesale unit, and
then supplies to retailers. Flora Nepal imports planting materials directly from
European companies when the quality of supplies from the propagation unit in
India is not good. An example of vertical coordination is the cooperative model
of United Flora and Global Flora where different actors in the value chain (pro-
ducers, retailers, etc.) have jointly invested. In this coordination arrangement, no
single player controls the price, and there is a deliberate pricing mechanism that
involves the producers, wholesalers, and retailers.

5.5  Why the Nepal Flower Industry Is Uncompetitive
5.5.1  Constraints in the Technology of Production
There are no local suppliers of planting materials and Nepal produc-
ers have to rely on imports. About 90 percent of the inputs required for
the cut-flower industry are imported. Planting materials for the leading four
cut-flowers—rose, gerbera, gladiolus and carnation—have to be imported from
the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Israel, Poland, Japan and India. Most often they
are imported through their plant propagation sites in India because that offers
transportation and currency exchange advantages. Nonetheless, having to import
planting materials increases cost of production incurred by Nepalese producers
and this makes it difficult for them to compete with those in neighboring India.
Furthermore, when planting materials are required in large quantities, the Flori-
culture Cooperative collects demand from producers and imports directly from
India to take advantage of the import duty free provision provided to producers.
However, the practical challenge with this arrangement is that in the absence
of cold storage facility for planting materials, all planting materials have to be
planted at the same time. Consequently, large amount of cut-flowers will be
ready for the market at the same time and a lot of the produce do not get sold.
The benefit producers derive from economies of scale in the import of planting
materials is canceled out by the loss they incur in sales of cut-flowers.

Weak enforcement leads to poor quality imports of planting materials
and the quality is further jeopardized by lack of cold storage. Planting
materials sourced from plant propagation sites from India are not of the same
quality as those imported directly through Europe based companies. Often

Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity                  73
	      Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain


     times, products delivered do not match the quality of products ordered. Almost
     all producers from Nepal are small and do not have the capacity, knowledge
     or the resources required to contest these issues legally with suppliers in India.
     There is no government agency where the producers can approach for help in
     such a situation. Therefore, they are forced to accept the inferior quality sup-
     plied. Planting materials for Gladiolus or its bulbs need to be preserved in con-
     trolled temperature and properly ventilated space during off season so that it
     may be planted in the succeeding season. Planting materials are currently stored
     under normal conditions due to lack of chilled rooms. Consequently, many
     bulbs are destroyed or produce poor yields.

     The government ban on importation of water soluble fertilizers and
     other micronutrients inhibits adoption of better technology of produc-
     tion. Cut-flowers require water soluble fertilizers such as potassium nitrate and
     calcium nitrate. Unfortunately, the same chemicals can be used to make explo-
     sives. The difference is that fertilizers come in a commercial grade and explosives
     do not. This is however not differentiated and the government has imposed a
     complete ban on importing these chemicals. As a result producers end up hav-
     ing to use either organic fertilizers such as compost, or pay a premium to buy
     illegally imported water soluble fertilizers, or regular chemical fertilizers avail-
     able in the market such as DAP and urea. The regular fertilizers are not ideal
     for commercial production of cut-flowers. Furthermore, even these fertilizers
     are not always available in the market. Availability is important because each
     production cycle of cut-flowers is short and any delay in application of fertilizers
     means low productivity. Producers also complain there are fake chemicals in the
     market and that they do not have the knowledge or means to differentiate the
     fake chemicals from real ones, so they end up using whatever is available. Fake
     chemicals do more damage to the soil and reduce both productivity and quality
     of the cut-flower produced.

     Lack of soil testing and soil treatment due to banned chemicals. Before
     any soil is used in production of cut-flowers it has to be tested for its alkalinity,
     pH value, and pathogens—especially some kinds of bacteria and fungus. Methyl
     Bromide is used for soil alkalinity treatment as well as soil fumigation. Soil
     fumigation is a treatment that is required every 3 years for the production of
     Gerbera, Gladiolus and Carnation and every 7 years for Rose to maintain good
     quality production. However, Methyl Bromide also falls on the list of chemi-
     cals banned by the government. An alternative to Methyl Bromide treatment
     that is widely used in other cut-flower producing countries is steam fumigation.
     However, the technology and equipment for steam fumigation are expensive for
     individual farmers to own and are not available in Nepal.

     Uncertainties in the enforcement of land rental contracts discourage
     large scale investments. Nepal has a wide variety of topographical and climatic
     conditions suitable for production of cut-flowers. The climatic conditions in and


74                    Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain 	


around Kathmandu especially creates opportunities for the production of cold
climate flowers such as carnation, Lilium, Limonium and Chrysanthemum. Given
the high and increasing levels of imports, there is immense potential for import
substitution if the production potential is leveraged. Currently, most producers
involved in cut-flowers are smallholders and they lease land for production—with
the exception of 2 or 3 integrated firms. Although legal contracts are signed for
land lease, there is almost always a provision to end the contract prematurely by
either party with prior notice. This clause is required to safeguard the producer in
case of a loss, but it also allows the landlord to switch renters whenever a better
rental offer emerges. Furthermore, this clause has been used by landlords to sell
land already rented without compensating the renter for their investment. The
land rental market has many inherent risks that has kept investors away, especially
in enterprises that are already risky such as floriculture.

Lack of climate controlled production technology. Climate controlled
greenhouses are crucial for export oriented commercial production. The govern-
ment provides for tax import of greenhouses, but the technology remains beyond
the reach of most growers. Instead, growers employ cheaper local substitutes
that compromise quality of production—for example use of silpaulin plastic
covering for greenhouses as opposed to UV plastics. If growers are to export to
markets overseas, the produce has to meet specific demand parameters such as
color shade, diameter of the flower, length of the stem, diameter of the stem, etc.
Consistent production of flowers with these attributes requires not only modern
greenhouses, but also meticulous application of inputs such as fertilizers, pesti-
cides, fungicides—and proper monitoring of the effect of inputs on the flower.
Currently, Nepal lacks a laboratory facility (whether public or private) to carry
out tests on nutrients, pesticide levels in plants, soil testing for pH levels, etc.

Dwindling supplies of unskilled labor. The youth have migrated to seek
employment abroad at unprecedented levels over the last decade. This has
resulted in loss of workforce in the agriculture sector, especially in such as
commercial cut-flower cultivation where labor is important. With dwindling
supplies of youthful labor, some commercial producers have employed local
women in the farms.

5.5.2  Constraints in Post-Harvest Management
Lack of cold storage and post-harvest treatment of cut-flowers. Producers
harvest their flowers, pack it and transport it to Kathmandu wholesale markets
on the same evening. The flowers do not undergo any post-harvest treatment,
which is contrary to standard international practice. Storing freshly harvested
flowers in chilled room and treating it with chemical before transporting is a
standard international practice to kill undesired micro-organisms, reduce damage
and prolong vase life. This practice is lacking among producers. As a result, pro-
ducers incur post-harvest losses of as much as 10 percent of total production and
it is not possible to tell whether or not the cut-flowers produced are free from

Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity                  75
	      Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain


     diseases and pests. Storing flowers in the cold rooms is a standard practice to
     increase shelf life of flowers from 3 to 10 days depending on the cut-flower type.

     Lack of climate controlled transportation services. Currently cut-flowers
     are transported from production sites to wholesalers and from wholesalers to
     retailers in local transport such as busses, vans, taxis, motorcycles and bicycles.
     None of the current modes of transport has any means of temperature or
     humidity control suitable for cut-flowers. As a result, the quality of cut-flowers
     deteriorates during transportation. Producers do not have the capacity to invest
     in temperature controlled vehicles. They have put in proposals for co-invest-
     ment for such vehicles from Project for Commercialization of Agriculture and
     Trade (PACT)—a World Bank funded project. Maintaining a cold chain requires
     having chilled rooms for storage at harvesting sites, temperature and humid-
     ity controlled vehicles for transport and cold cargo compartments in aircrafts.
     Due to unavailability of these infrastructures and lack of technical knowhow
     in Nepal, meeting quality requirements for overseas markets is a challenge for
     entrepreneurs.

     5.5.3  Constraints in Financial and Risk-Sharing Markets
     Access to credit is crippled by stringent regulations and access to insur-
     ance is weakened by a thin risk pool. Smallholders currently cultivate cut-
     flowers in small pockets and therefore cannot benefit from economies of scale.
     Smallholders struggle to access agriculture loans due to the requirement of fixed
     asset collaterals and other conditions. For example, banks require land with access
     to road infrastructure for it to qualify as collateral. This has crowded-out many
     producers from not only access to loans but also support schemes earmarked for
     agriculture sector. Furthermore, commercial banks can only extend credit to entre-
     preneurs based on business viability if the business is insured. There is a policy for
     farm and crop insurance in agricultural production where premium costs up to 75
     percent is paid by the government and up to 90 percent of costs can be recovered
     in case of crop loss. Through the program, insurers have covered major agricultural
     crops where the risk pool is wide. However, this is not the case with cut-flowers
     because there are relatively few producers scattered around the country.

     5.5.4  Constraints in the Policy and Regulatory Environment
     Although the government provides various incentives for procurement
     of inputs, the farmers cannot access the incentives because they don’t
     import directly. The Nepal government provides support to producers by
     exempting tax and VAT on imports of planting materials and insecticides. VAT
     is exempted and only 1 percent duty is applied on the import of greenhouses.
     However, most producers are small and require these materials in small quanti-
     ties. Furthermore, the administrative procedures for import are time consuming
     and costly. The transaction costs for each small producers to import the materials
     by themselves are high. Therefore, the producers buy these inputs from traders or

76                    Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain 	


input supply companies. But the government does not provide the same tax and
VAT exemptions on imports of same inputs by traders who supply the producers.
Therefore, producers cannot take advantage of the provision. For small producers,
the cost of greenhouses is beyond their investment capacity. Instead of import-
ing greenhouses, they would prefer importing some of the raw materials used in
greenhouses and then fabricating locally—either by themselves or through local
fabricating companies. But raw materials for greenhouses are subject to 13 per-
cent VAT and a total of 25 percent import duty. Therefore majority of producers,
especially small producers, are unable to take advantage of the duty free provision.

Furthermore, competing farmers in India receive enormous support
from state and central governments which increase the competitiveness
of imports in the domestic market. Cut-flower producers in neighboring
India receive between 60 percent and 80 percent subsidy for their investment
on production depending on the state they are in. They also receive strong tech-
nical support. In contrast, the Nepal government does not subsidize any part of
producer’s investment, except for the largely unutilized exemption on VAT in
importing production equipment. The unequal playing field enables cut-flowers
from India to compete in the Nepal market. It forces the wholesalers to bid
down prices of domestically produced cut-flowers. For example, if the wholesale
price for a stem of rose in Nepal is calculated to be NRs. 12 based on produc-
ers cost of production, the wholesaler will enquire the price of rose in Delhi
wholesale market “Mandi” on the same day. If the price in Delhi market is IRs. 3
(which is equivalent to NRs. 4.8), the wholesaler will add the freight and other
charges to it which comes to about NRs. 3–4. It means the price of Indian rose
would be around NRs. 9 if sold in Kathmandu market. In order to beat com-
petition from the Indian rose, the wholesaler will reduce the price of Nepalese
rose for that day and sells it for NRs. 9–10. The wholesaler will then deduct
10 percent of its marketing charge and pay about NRs. 8.1 to NRs. 9 to Nepalese
producers, which is below the price of NRs. 12 needed to cover production costs
and pay remunerative margins to the local producer.

Public expenditures in floriculture development are not targeted to flow-
ers with potential for import substitution. Under the implementation plan
of the Floriculture Policy 2069, resources are allocated for priorities identified
in the sector each year for the next 5 years. In the fiscal year 2015/2016, a total
of NRs. 30 million has been allocated for the development and promotion of
Gypsophila. It is not clear whether a full market research or a technical feasibility
study for production of Gypsophila were undertaken to justify the investment.
Furthermore, this allocation could have been targeted to flowers with import
substitution potential i.e., Rose, Carnation, Gerbera, Gladiolus and Lilium, etc.

Lack of accredited laboratories to test for various contaminants required
to be tested as per Sanitary and Phytosanitary standards of export mar-
kets. Local entrepreneurs make remarkable attempts to export cut-flowers in
different countries, including sending samples to export markets. But the current

Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity                  77
	      Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain


     quality from Nepal cannot compete in the international markets such as the Euro-
     pean countries, US, Japan, etc. This is because these countries have very strict phy-
     tosanitary requirements. The phytosanitary certificate issuing authority in Nepal
     is not equipped with labs with capacity to carry out stringent tests required in
     export markets. Instead, certificates are issued on the basis of ad-hoc observation.
     This is well known by potential importers. Therefore, the Phytosanitary certificate
     issued by the government of Nepal is not accepted in most countries and any
     exports of Nepalese cut-flowers would have to be subject to various tests in the
     importing country. And if the products fail the phytosanitary tests, the export-
     ers would have to pay for costs related to the destruction of the consignment.
     According to exporters, the cost of destruction of consignments is higher than the
     cost of exporting the consignment. The risk for exporters is prohibitively high.

     5.5.5  Constraints in Physical Access to Major Import Markets
     Major technological developments on global trade in floriculture, cou-
     pled with the country’s geophysical conditions, are severely hampering
     the export potential of Nepal’s flower industry. Landlocked and far away
     from most traditional (e.g. Netherlands, USA) and emerging (e.g. Russia) mar-
     kets for flowers, the geophysical conditions of Nepal are a major impediment to
     a rapid integration of its floriculture industry with global markets. The shift to
     transport of cut flowers from air to sea container has put Nepal at a competi-
     tive disadvantage relative to other flower exporting countries from Asia which
     have direct access to the sea (e.g. Vietnam and Malaysia, who export flowers by
     sea container to Japan). Transport by sea container is not new to floriculture,
     although it had long been restricted to products with a relatively long shelf life
     (e.g. cut foliage or flower bulbs). It is now the most common and cost efficient
     means of transporting cut flower over long distances. Most exporters to the
     large markets in the US and the EU have been able to considerably cut their
     total costs (production and export marketing) and further enhance their export
     competitiveness.

     The rapid expansion of sea container shipments in cut flowers is driven by var-
     ious factors including the price difference between sea and air freight (with
     the latter up to twice as costly), the ability to control temperature conditions
     and humidity levels within the container, and the growing availability of port
     facilities and reefers. Today, favorable agro-ecological conditions and a counter-
     cyclical production pattern is no longer enough to gain a strong foothold on
     the global floriculture market. New cut-flower market entrants like Nepal need
     to build a comparative advantage over established competitors either through
     product differentiation or competitive cost structure. With its largely temper-
     ate climate, Nepal’s flower products do not present enough exclusive features
     (e.g. like the tropical varieties from Kenya or Colombia) and the prohibitively
     high costs of air transportation to the far away markets of the EU and USA
     would continue to affect the export competitiveness of Nepal’s cut flowers.
     Even where Nepal may have a comparative advantage in the cost of production

78                    Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain 	


for some varieties due to relatively low labor costs, these lower production costs
would not offset the costs of air transportation to the end markets, and would
still result in un-competitively high CIF prices.

5.6  Conclusions and Recommendations
5.6.1  The Potential for Nepal Flower Production to Meet Local Demand
Domestic demand for floriculture products has increased considerably
over the last few years but growth in domestic production has not kept
pace with demand, leading to a rise in imports from India. Imports of
floriculture products have grown consistently over the last few years and the
reported import value is estimated to be as much as US$1 million per year.
Most of these imports originate from India, and to a lesser extent, from Thailand
(for orchids only). There is a widespread sense that the official data on imports
from India are actually under-reported and that the real volume of floriculture
products (particularly cut-flowers and ornamental flowers) crossing from India
into Nepal is in fact much higher than the official statistics. In any case, domestic
demand for flowers is growing rapidly, fueled by an increase in the purchasing
power of Nepal’s emerging middle class.

In order to meet the growing domestic demand for cut flowers and orna-
mental flowers, Nepal’s floriculture industry should capitalize on its
comparative advantage over imported flowers from India. Notwithstand-
ing the need to address the constraints faced by Nepal’s flower industry, a quick
comparison of some key data on the production and marketing of roses in Nepal
and India, provides some interesting pointers on the potential for increasing com-
petiveness over imports from India. Investment costs in India, per unit of produc-
tion area, are much higher than in Nepal, due to the higher level of sophistication
in the production system. Most commercial rose growers in India operate on a
much higher level of technology than their counterparts in Nepal, and more
capital investment is therefore required to cover the irrigation infrastructure,
on site grading and packaging unit, cold storage and chilled van. As depicted in
the table below, production costs of roses from India are more than three times
higher than production costs from local roses.

     5.6.2  The Potential for Nepal to Export Cut-Flowers
     According to the industry, flowers, especially rose and carnation, pro-
     duced in the hills of Nepal are of higher quality due to favorable agro
     climatic conditions prevailing in that area. As a result, favorable quality
     features for Nepal grown flowers include a bigger flower bud size, longer stem,
     and thicker and sturdier stem, compared to flowers imported from India. Indian
     traders also recognize Nepalese flowers to be of superior quality than their local
     products. However, quality parameters used in Nepalese and Indian markets
     are not sufficient to compete in international markets (such as Europe, USA
     or Japan) where customers, including wholesalers and retailers, have specific
     demands, e.g. on the color, length and diameter of stem and blossom. Producing
     flowers with consistent quality parameters over large quantities is a major chal-
     lenge for Nepal with the current limited production technology, know-how and
     organization in the value chain.

     Phytosanitary certification issued in Nepal is not recognized in most
     countries, and yet it is essential for many import markets. Phytosanitary
     certificates are issued by the Plant Quarantine Office under MoAD. There are
     5 regional plant quarantine offices, 9 check posts on the Nepal-China and Indo-
     Nepal borders and one at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu. An
     export permit needs to be obtained by the exporter before a phytosanitary cer-
     tificate can be issued. Export permits are issued by the Plant Quarantine office
     upon recommendation of the Flower Development Center (FDC) located in
     Godavari. Obtaining an export permit is a time consuming affair. For perishable
     products like cut-flowers time is a critical factor that affects the end quality of
     the product. Additionally, random inspections of a consignment are conducted
     by the Plant Quarantine Office and are carried out on visual basis, upon which
     phytosanitary certificates are issued. Farm visits during harvesting or prior con-
     duction of Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) for production zones is not practiced. The
     Plant Quarantine Office is equipped with laboratory to carry out testing for
     micro-organisms, growth of pathogens, and others, but cannot advise exporters
     on any treatment or unsuitability for export due to the presence of pest and/or
     disease. As a result, obtaining, a phytosanitary certificate issued by GoN is seen
     as a mere formality because the certificate would not be recognized in most
     importing countries. Moreover, the many standards and labels used in import
     markets are largely unknown to Nepal’s floriculture stakeholders, nor does
     Nepal have the infrastructure or the human resources required for certification
     and accreditation of the certifying bodies.

     In the short run, a strategy for growth in exports of Nepali cut-flowers
     could focus on nearby countries, such as India and Bangladesh. It is unlikely
     that in the short term, Nepal can become a major supplier of cut-flowers in the
     highly competitive traditional import markets (e.g. USA, EU) where other low-cost
     producing countries have increased their market shares over the last two decades
     (e.g. Kenya, Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia). Based on consultations with exporters,

Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain 	


FAN and sector experts, analysis of export import data and literature review—it
is clear that export of cut-flowers will be confined to only select countries. India
is one of those key potential markets. Consumption of cut-flowers in Delhi is one
of the highest in India and Delhi is only a 6-hour drive away from Nepal. In addi-
tion, Nepal can take advantage of the drop in flower availability in India during the
winter months. Bangladesh is another potential market for Nepalese cut-flowers,
specifically during the summer months. The demand for cut-flowers in Bangladesh
is estimated at about USD 8.0 million, of which USD 5.0 million is met with
local production while the rest is imported mainly from China and Indonesia. Ban-
gladesh is about a 12-hour drive from eastern Nepal. It is conceivable that with
an appropriate fleet of temperature and humidity controlled trucks, cut-flowers
appropriately packaged and protected could be exported to Bangladesh.

Exporting cut-flowers to Middle Eastern countries is another alternative worth
exploring. Beneficiaries from the PACT’s matching grant scheme have reported
to export parts of their cut flower production to those destinations and export-
ers have revealed that buyers from Qatar and the UAE have expressed inter-
est in sourcing cut-flowers (especially carnation) from Nepal. Nepal appears
to have a competitive advantage in supplying to that region as there is direct
connectivity to these countries and air freight could potentially be relatively
low because of the frequent travel of Nepali migrant workers to that region.
However, the conditions for scaling up export of cut flowers to the Middle East
should be carefully analyzed and a comprehensive assessment of those mar-
kets and of the import demand for flowers from Nepal should be undertaken.
A simple competitiveness analysis based on Export Parity Price (EPP) calcula-
tions reveals a high profitability when selling cut flowers to Doha, Qatar. In the
case of carnation, calculations indicate that average domestic price per stick is
NPR10, against a calculated EPP for Doha, of NPR18.

5.6.3  Recommendations for Policy and Investment Priorities
Strengthen enforcement to eradicate poor quality imports of planting
materials and agrochemicals from the market. Planting materials sourced
from plant propagation sites from India are not of the same quality as those
imported directly through Europe based companies. Often times, products
delivered do not match the quality of products ordered. Almost all producers
from Nepal are small and do not have the capacity, knowledge or the resources
required to contest these issues legally with suppliers in India. Since the gov-
ernment mechanisms for redress are weak, the producers are forced to accept
the inferior quality supplied, and this translates not only into low productivity
but also safety and health risks for farmers, actors along the chain handling the
flowers, and consumers. Producers also complain there are fake chemicals in the
market and that they do not have the knowledge or means to differentiate the
fake chemicals from real ones, so they end up using whatever is available. Fake
chemicals do more damage to the soil and reduce both productivity and quality
of the cut-flower produced.

     Reconsider the ban on importation of water soluble fertilizers and other
     micronutrients inhibits adopted of better technology of production.
     Cut-flowers require water soluble fertilizers such as potassium nitrate and cal-
     cium nitrate for superior quality production. The same chemicals are used in
     making explosives. The difference is that fertilizers come in a commercial grade
     and explosives do not. This is however not differentiated and the government
     has imposed a complete ban on importing these chemicals. As a result produc-
     ers end up having to use either organic fertilizers such as compost, or pay a
     premium to buy illegally imported water soluble fertilizers, or regular chemical
     fertilizers available in the market such as DAP and urea. The regular fertilizers
     are not ideal for commercial production of cut-flowers. There is also lack of
     soil testing and soil treatment due to banned chemicals. Before any soil is used
     in production of cut-flowers it has to be tested for its alkalinity, pH value, and
     pathogens—­   especially some kinds of bacteria and fungus. Methyl Bromide is
     used for soil alkalinity treatment as well as soil fumigation. Soil fumigation is a
     treatment that is required every 3 years for the production of Gerbera, Gladi-
     olus and Carnation and every 7 years for Rose to maintain good quality produc-
     tion. However, Methyl Bromide also falls on the list of chemicals banned by
     the government. An alternative to Methyl Bromide treatment that is widely
     used in other cut-flower producing countries is steam fumigation. However, the
     technology and equipment for steam fumigation are expensive for individual
     farmers to own and are not available in Nepal.

     Strengthen enforcement of land rental contracts to encourage large scale
     investments in floriculture. Nepal has a wide variety of topographical and cli-
     matic conditions suitable for production of cut-flowers. The climatic conditions
     in and around Kathmandu especially creates opportunities for the production
     of cold climate flowers such as carnation, Lilium, Limonium and Chrysanthe-
     mum. Given the high and increasing levels of imports, there is immense poten-
     tial for import substitution if the production potential is leveraged. Currently,
     most producers involved in cut-flowers are smallholders and they lease land for
     production—with the exception of 2–3 integrated firms. Although legal contracts
     are signed for land lease, there is almost always a provision to end the contract
     prematurely by either party with prior notice. This clause is required to safeguard
     the producer in case of a loss, but it also allows the landlord to switch renters
     whenever a better rental offer emerges. Furthermore, this clause has been used
     by landlords to sell land during land tenure without compensating the renter for
     their investment. The land rental market has many inherent risks that has kept
     investors away, especially in enterprises that are already risky such as floriculture.

     Rationalize various government incentives for procurement of inputs
     so that they become accessible to farmers. The Nepal government provides
     support to producers by exempting tax and VAT on the import of planting
     materials and insecticides. For example, VAT is exempted and only 1 percent
     duty is applied on the import of greenhouses. Most producers are small and

Lessons on Policy and Investments to Substitute Imports—Case Study of the Cut-Flower Value Chain 	


require these materials in small quantities, because the administrative proce-
dures for import are time consuming and costly, and the transaction costs for
each small producers to import the materials by themselves are high. There-
fore, the producers buy these inputs from traders or input supply companies.
But the government does not provide the same tax and VAT exemptions on
imports of same inputs by traders who supply the producers. Therefore, pro-
ducers cannot take advantage of the provision. For small producers, the cost of
greenhouses is beyond their investment capacity. Instead of importing green-
houses, they would prefer importing some of the raw materials used in green-
houses and then fabricating locally—either by themselves or through local
fabricating companies. But raw materials for greenhouses are subject to 13 per-
cent VAT and a total of 25 percent import duty. There is need to rationalize
various government incentives for procurement of inputs so that they become
accessible to farmers.

Develop agribusiness incubation programs to incentivize investments in
cold storage for planting materials and cut-flowers, post-harvest treat-
ment of cut-flowers, and climate controlled transportation services.
Planting materials for Gladiolus or its bulbs need to be preserved in controlled
temperature and properly ventilated space during off season. Currently, due to
absence of chilled rooms, the practice is to preserve it under normal conditions.
As a result many bulbs are destroyed. Producers harvest their flowers, pack and
transport to Kathmandu wholesale markets on the same evening. The flowers
do not undergo any post-harvest treatment. Storing freshly harvested flowers
in chilled room and treating it with chemical before transporting is a standard
international practice to kill undesired micro-organisms, reduce damage and
prolong vase life. This technology, knowhow and practice is lacking among pro-
ducers. As a result, producers incur post-harvest losses of as much as 10 percent
of total production and it is not possible to tell whether or not the cut-flowers
produced are free from diseases and pests. None of the current modes of trans-
port has any means of temperature or humidity control suitable for cut-flowers.
As a result, the quality of cut-flowers deteriorates during transportation.

Rationalize credit and insurance services to floriculture. Smallholders cur-
rently cultivate cut-flowers in small pockets and therefore cannot benefit from
economies of scale. Smallholders struggle to access agriculture loans due to the
requirement of fixed asset collaterals and other conditions. For example, banks
require land with access to road infrastructure for it to qualify as collateral. This
has resulted in the crowding out of many producers from not only access to
loans but also support schemes earmarked for agriculture sector. Furthermore,
commercial banks can only extend credit to entrepreneurs based on business
viability if the business is insured. There is a policy for farm and crop insurance
in agricultural production where premium costs up to 75 percent is paid by the
government and up to 90 percent of costs can be recovered in case of crop loss.
Through the program, insurers have covered major agricultural crops where the

     risk pool is wide. However, this is not the case with cut-flowers because there
     are relatively few producers scattered around the country.

     Rationalize targeting of public expenditures towards flowers with poten-
     tial for import substitution. For example, under the implementation plan of
     the Floriculture Policy 2069, resources are allocated for priorities identified in
     the sector each year for the next 5 years. In the fiscal year 2015/2016, a total of
     NRs. 30 million has been allocated for the development and promotion of Gyp-
     sophila. It is not clear whether a full market research or a technical feasibility
     study for production of Gypsophila were undertaken to justify the investment.
     Furthermore, this allocation could have been targeted to flowers with import
     substitution potential i.e., Rose, Carnation, Gerbera, Gladiolus and Lilium, etc.

Recommendations for Policy
and Investments




6.1  Recommendations for Broad-Based Productivity Growth
in Agriculture
While agriculture has proved to be important for poverty reduc-
tion and shared prosperity, most of the agricultural income has been
from increased prices. Most of the poverty reduction between 2003/04 and
2010/11 occurred in the rural areas and was driven by rising agriculture incomes,
which on average registered about 24.4 percent increase. The impact of agricul-
ture was highest among the bottom 40 percent (the lowest and second lowest
income quintile) where agriculture contributed more than 40 percent of their
income gains. On average, crop income alone increased by about 23 percent. A
decomposition of this change in crop income indicates that on average about
78 percent was due to increased food prices, while yields contributed about
22 percent, and land contraction decreased crop income by about 9 percent.
The data used to calculate these changes is from National Living Standards
Surveys in 2003/04 and 2010/11—therefore it is not surprising that changes
in food prices contributed the most to crop incomes because the food prices in
2010/11 were still recovering from the effects of the global food price inflation.

Going forward any strategy for poverty reduction and shared prosper-
ity for Nepal should be anchored by a national program for increasing
broad-based agricultural productivity through developing new technol-
ogies, dissemination of technologies, and effective extension to ensure
farmers are able to utilize technology appropriately. Productivity could
be increased through technical change, which is associated with release and
application of new technology, or technical efficiency change which is about
how well existing technologies are utilized by farmers. The findings indicate
that technical change has been the main driver of productivity increase in all
agro-ecological zones. The contribution of technical change is relatively higher
in the Mountains and Hills compared to the Terai. It means that farmers are

	                                                        Recommendations for Policy and Investments


     adopting new technologies and these new technologies are having a relatively
     large impact in the Mountains, followed by Hills, and then the Terai. These pat-
     terns are by the fact that traditionally there has been relatively more technolo-
     gies developed for the Terai such that other regions are starting from a low base
     and any new technologies are likely to increase productivity relatively faster.
     Already the government is implementing the Agriculture and Food Security
     Project, but the project only covers mid and far western hills and mountain dis-
     tricts, and therefore should be expanded nationally. And since there are impor-
     tant differences across districts in terms of productivity, technical change, and
     technical efficiency change—even within similar agro-ecological zones—the
     proposed national program should be informed by a better understanding of the
     causes of these differences.

     Address the main constraints to private investment in agriculture: which
     include lack of technical knowledge on precision farming methods and
     lack of capital due to weaknesses in the financial sector. This conclu-
     sion is informed by case study of returning immigrants who are investing in
     commercialized agriculture. The investments are driven by technical knowl-
     edge, which they acquired abroad, and investible funds from their own sav-
     ings. Many returnees are investing in agriculture and have formed the Nepal
     Commercial Farmers Association. Its membership is currently about 400 farm-
     ers, out of which 80–90 percent (over 80 percent) are returnees. Majority of
     returnees came back from Israel, but there are also many returnees from South
     Korea, Korea, Japan, and Gulf countries—including Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A
     common thread among the returnees is that: (a) they were employed in farms
     abroad where they learned modern farming methods that are capital intensive
     and highly productive, (b) their initial investments in farming was self-financed
     through savings accumulated abroad, (c) most of them do not have their own
     land and are farming on rented farms, (d) most of them have become centers
     of technology dissemination such that they are earning income from teaching
     neighbors and college students about modern farming methods, and (e) they
     would like to expand operations but cannot access credit from formal sources
     in Nepal. The reason they are facing constraints in access to additional capital is
     that Banks don’t provide loans unless it is collateralized with land. The returnee
     farms have become training centers and are actively involved in training other
     farmers in the country, hosting student interns, etc.

     A national soil fertility management program should be developed to
     address imbalanced use of fertilizers, introduce efficient and profitable
     use of fertilizers, and make subsidies smart. The government subsidy program
     is supplying about 50 percent of the estimated demand for fertilizers. It’s unlikely
     that the subsidy could be expanded to cover all demand without imposing major
     pressures on the national treasury, which is exactly what led to the disbanding
     of the previous subsidy program in 1996/97. Furthermore, the current program
     is supplying only Urea, DAP, and potash fertilizers—with Urea occupying more


86                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Recommendations for Policy and Investments	


than 60 percent of the subsidized quantities. Urea (46:0:0) constitutes of only
nitrogen (N) and no phosphorous (P) or potassium (K). It means there has been
imbalanced use of fertilizers for the past several years that needs to be corrected
through a national soil fertility management program. Addressing the imbalances
would increase efficiency in the use of fertilizer use and improve farm profitabil-
ity. This is important because long-term soil fertility requires balanced use of all
fertilizer nutrients (N, P, and K) rather than predominantly N as has been the case
in Nepal. The ongoing subsidies could be transformed into smart subsidies with
the following principles: (a) target farmers that need to learn about proper use of
fertilizers; (b) target farmers that could use fertilizers profitably but are not able
to do so due to working capital constraints; and (c) deliver the subsidy through
the private sector by expanding the voucher system being piloted.

Smart subsidies can also be used for social welfare purposes, with inputs
targeted to also address food insecurity and promote nutrition. Often
time’s governments have implemented welfare programs aimed at addressing pov-
erty and contributing to national development—for example employment guar-
antee programs, conditional cash transfers, and pension schemes. Input subsidies
could also be designed as welfare schemes to address inequality in poverty, food
insecurity, and nutrition status. In the context of Nepal, this would mean chang-
ing the geographical focus of the program. This is because the Central region has
consistently received most of the chemical fertilizer every year since the program
was introduced in 2008 and it’s share has ranged from 45 percent in 2009/10 to
53 percent in 2010/11 and 2012/13. However, both the proportion of poor people
and the absolute number of poor people are lower in Central region and highest
in Western region. Furthermore, data from the National Demographic and Health
Survey 2011 show that food and nutrition security indicators are worse in the
Western region of Nepal. For example, the rate of stunting among children under
five years old is about 55 percent in Western region compared to the national
average of 41 percent. The main implication of the current regional distribution
of fertilizer subsidies is that the program is not consistent with addressing regional
disparities in poverty and food security, does not promote shared prosperity, and
is likely to exacerbate regional disparities in income distribution.

6.2  Recommendations for Export Promotion
The key interventions for export promotion could be anchored by a
national horticulture development program with the following features:

National horticulture seed program. This would help alleviate the current
practice of most farmers using locally available seed materials retained from pre-
vious crops. It is estimated that farmers keep between 20 to 25 percent of their
production to use as seeds for the next growing season. New growers purchase
seeds from neighboring farmers or local markets. Ginger farmers in the moun-
tains mostly preserved Ginger seed from their last season crop. A consequence

	                                                        Recommendations for Policy and Investments


     of the lack of a national seed development program is that only two major types
     of ginger are grown in Nepal.

     National program for adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)
     for ginger and other commodities. The benefits of developing and then
     adopting GAPs include not only fulfilling trade and government regulatory
     requirements on food safety and quality, but more importantly meeting spe-
     cific requirements of high value specialty or niche markets and improving food
     safety for domestic consumers. An expansion of GAP based ginger production
     would help to obtain better quality and healthier ginger products. The adoption
     of GAPs may help reduce the risk of non-compliance with national and inter-
     national regulations, standards and guidelines regarding permitted pesticides,
     maximum levels of contaminants (including pesticides and mycotoxins) in food
     and non-food agricultural products, as well as other chemical, microbiological
     and physical contamination hazards.

     Operational plan for monitoring contamination along value chains of
     major commodities. This may involve both broadly defined as well as com-
     modity specific operational plans for avoiding, detecting and monitoring the
     contamination levels of pests and pesticides in major commodities. To imple-
     ment such a plan there would be need to (i) develop specific training modules
     and build capacity of government staff, and (ii) partnership program with the
     private sectors (growers and traders) to share information and jointly develop
     programs to improve traceability.

     Building the capacity of laboratories to test presence of important con-
     taminants. There is no laboratory capacity for testing and monitoring pesticide
     residues, mycotoxins, and microbial contamination as per Codex standards/EU
     requirements. The existing laboratories lack both high precision and basic instru-
     ments and equipment’s to test for diseases, pesticide levels, microbial contamina-
     tions, heavy metals, etc. For example, the Central Food Research Laboratory is
     limited to 27 parameters and does not include microbial contaminants and heavy
     metals. The ability to test for these contaminants is crucial to complying with
     various standards in export markets and is therefore necessary for promoting
     Nepal’s products and ultimately accessing export markets.

     Building human capacity for scientific testing, coordinating SPS issues,
     and enforcing inspections. There is a lack of advance level trainings to person-
     nel involved in laboratory testing and inspections, especially as it relates to Good
     Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Global
     Health Partnerships (GHP), and production and processing systems. To address
     these gaps sufficient training modules should be developed. Furthermore, there
     is limited size of manpower, especially at regional and district levels. In addition,
     there is a lack of attention towards Standard Operation Procedures (SoPs) for
     inspection and sampling of consignments and certification system. Capacity of
     the staff is weak on proper sampling procedures and methods for laboratory

and field testing of samples, in particular MRLs, microbial contamination, toxin,
heavy metals, etc.

Establishing a local laboratory accreditation board to facilitate Mutual
Recognition Agreements (MRA). There is no local accreditation board to
engage with international accreditation institutions such as the International
Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and other relevant bodies such
as International Accreditation Forum (IAF). Nepal relies on India’s National
Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for
accreditation of its facilities. A local accreditation body would be able to pro-
mote Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) with potential export markets.
An MRA is important to facilitate trade as it provides a forum to define what
is acceptable among trading partners. It is not clear if Nepal has MRA with any
country and this is not surprising because there is no adequate capacity to certify
technical quality parameters such as pesticides and veterinary drugs residues.

Complinace with international standards for pest management—Interna-
tional Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)/International Standards for
Phytosanitary Measures1 (ISPM). The key actions for compliance include
conducting pest risk analysis and identifying pest free areas or areas with low pes-
ticides. There is no proper national survey and surveillance of ginger diseases and
pests in Nepal nor is there a regular practice of pest reporting, although certain
piecemeal efforts have been carried out in certain projects several years ago. A
number of pests are reported but without much scientific data on their occur-
rence, epidemiology, management, etc. There is need to conduct systematic study
to investigate and document various diseases and pests and their incidences in
different Ginger growing areas. The International Standards for Phytosanitary
Measures (ISPMs 06, 08, 17 and 22) of IPPC needs to be adopted with local
adaptation as National standards to undertake this activity.

Strengthening the SPS enquiry point at DFTQC. The SPS Enquiry Point
needs to be strengthened to take up all matters related to SPS with importing
countries and to facilitate negotiating trade based on scientific principles. At
present there is only one dedicated staff in the SPS Enquiry point, which is
insufficient not only for responding to queries from importing countries and
domestic industry, but also far from the capacity required to create and update
an effective knowledge base of all the SPS related information.

SPS diplomacy for export promotion. The main element of SPS diplomacy is
engaging with regional and international organizations, particularly those setting
international standards, and the WTO SPS Committee. Developing countries are
often weak in this area and act as receivers of standards set by others. SPS diplo-
macy is also essential in bilateral market access negotiations between trade part-
ners, and in resolving problems or disagreements which arise during trade. SPS
diplomacy relies on scientific capacity. There is need to develop capacity for SPS
diplomacy by training a batch of key experts on: (i) policy and regulatory affairs

     with special reference to compliances to SPS/WTO, (ii) technical skills on pest
     reporting and risk analysis, (iii) mitigation measures identified by IPPC and other
     reference standards, (iv) risk communications as per IPPC and Codex, (v) mar-
     keting and trade promotion, and (vi) communication and negotiation skills.

     National strategy for SPS information management, SPS risks communi-
     cation, and traceability system. The information management system would
     bring together, in one platform, all information (legal, technical, institutional,
     export promotion, global markets) related to SPS matters of different Ministries
     and Departments along with national standards and extent of compliances to
     various IPPC/Codex Standards. Such a platform would also cover risk assess-
     ment protocols and updates on SPS issues at different parts of the chains. In
     addition, once the SPS Risks are identified through risk assessment and results
     of field/laboratory tests during quality control or quarantine, there is need for
     a strategy to communicate risks to all value chain actors along with the related
     mitigation measures of risks. Furthermore, the Food Act under preparation could
     include a provision to manage traceability of the food items. There are very good
     lessons on establishing traceability systems from countries such as Kenya.

     National strategy to access high value niche organic markets, includ-
     ing branding of organic ginger from Nepal. With the growing demand in
     organic products in the international markets, Organic Ginger from Nepal could
     be branded and marketed to serve the growing demand. Already farmers are
     practicing some important principles of organic farming, including low chemi-
     cal pesticides and fertilizers usage based farming, which indicates tremendous
     potential to adopt any further organic principles.

     6.3  Recommendations for Import Substitution
     Many of the above-mentioned elements of the proposed national program
     would also facilitate import substitution. In addition, the following measures
     could be taken to develop value chains that meet domestic demand and substi-
     tute imports:

     Eradication of poor quality imports of planting materials and agrochem-
     icals from the market. Planting materials sourced from plant propagation sites
     from India are not of the same quality as those imported directly through Europe
     based companies. Often times, products delivered do not match the quality of
     products ordered. Almost all producers from Nepal are small and do not have
     the capacity, knowledge or the resources required to contest these issues legally
     with suppliers in India. Producers also complain there are fake chemicals in the
     market and that they do not have the knowledge or means to differentiate the
     fake chemicals from real ones, so they end up using whatever is available. Fake
     chemicals do more damage to the soil and reduce both productivity and quality
     of the cut-flower produced.

Recommendations for Policy and Investments	



Enforcement of land rental contracts to encourage large scale invest-
ments in floriculture. Currently, most producers involved in cut-flowers are
smallholders and they lease land for production—with the exception of 2–3
integrated firms. Although legal contracts are signed for land lease, there is
almost always a provision to end the contract prematurely by either party with
prior notice. This clause is required to safeguard the producer in case of a loss,
but it also allows the landlord to switch renters whenever a better rental offer
emerges. Furthermore, this clause has been used by landlords to sell land dur-
ing land tenure without compensating the renter for their investment. The land
rental market has many inherent risks that has kept investors away, especially in
enterprises that are already risky such as floriculture.

Improving delivery mechanisms of various government incentives for
procurement of inputs so that they could actually be accessed by farmers.
The government provides support to producers by exempting tax and VAT on
the import of planting materials and insecticides. For example, VAT is exempted
and only 1 percent duty is applied on the import of greenhouses. Most pro-
ducers are small and require these materials in small quantities, because the
administrative procedures for import are time consuming and costly, and the
transaction costs for each small producers to import the materials by themselves
are high. Therefore, the producers buy these inputs from traders or input supply
companies. But the government does not provide the same tax and VAT exemp-
tions on imports of same inputs by traders who supply the producers. There-
fore, producers cannot take advantage of the provision. For small producers, the
cost of greenhouses is beyond their investment capacity. Instead of importing
greenhouses, they would prefer importing some of the raw materials used in
greenhouses and then fabricating locally—either by themselves or through local
fabricating companies. But raw materials for greenhouses are subject to 13 per-
cent VAT and a total of 25 percent import duty. There is need to rationalize
various government incentives for procurement of inputs so that they become
accessible to farmers.

Developing agribusiness incubation programs to incentivize invest-
ments in cold storage for planting materials and cut-flowers, post-harvest
treatment of cut-flowers, and climate controlled transportation services.
Planting materials for Gladiolus or its bulbs need to be preserved in controlled
temperature and properly ventilated space during off season for replantation in
the succeeding season. Currently, due to absence of chilled rooms, the practice
is to preserve it under normal conditions. As a result many bulbs are destroyed
or do not yield its maximum capacity in the succeeding cultivated season. Pro-
ducers harvest their flowers, pack it and transport it to Kathmandu wholesale
markets on the same evening. The flowers do not undergo any post-harvest
treatment. Storing freshly harvested flowers in chilled room and treating it with
chemical before transporting is a standard international practice to kill unde-
sired micro-organisms, reduce damage and prolong vase life. This technology,

     knowhow and practice is lacking among producers. As a result, producers incur
     post-harvest losses of as much as 10 percent of total production and it is not
     possible to tell whether or not the cut-flowers produced are free from diseases
     and pests. Storing flowers in the cold rooms is a standard practice. It reduces
     damage in handling and increases shelf-life of flowers from 3–10 days depend-
     ing on the cut-flower type.

     Alignining public expenditures towards flowers with potential for import
     substitution. For example, under the implementation plan of the Floriculture
     Policy 2069, resources are allocated for priorities identified in the sector each
     year for the next 5 years. In the fiscal year 2015/2016, a total of NRs. 30 million
     has been allocated for the development and promotion of Gypsophila. It is not
     clear whether a full market research or a technical feasibility study for produc-
     tion of Gypsophila were undertaken to justify the investment. Furthermore, this
     allocation could have been targeted to flowers with import substitution poten-
     tial i.e., Rose, Carnation, Gerbera, Gladiolus and Lilium, etc.


     Note
     	 1.	The intention of ISPMs is to harmonize phytosanitary measures for the purpose
          of facilitating international trade. ISPMs can cover a wide range of issues includ-
          ing; surveillance, pest risk analysis, establishment of pest free areas, export certifica-
          tion, phytosanitary certificates and pest reporting. The IPPC encourages adoption
          of these standards, but they only come into force once contracting (members) and
          non-contracting parties to establish requirements in national legislative instruments.
          IPPC standards generally fall into three categories: 1) Reference standards, such as
          the Glossary of phytosanitary terms; 2) Conceptual standards, such as the Guidelines
          of pest risk analysis; 3) Specific standards, which typically directed at a specific pest
          or pathogen (e.g. surveillance for citrus canker).

Annex 2.1: Methodology for Decomposing TFP
Total factor productivity (TFP) measures the part of output growth that is not
attributable to input growth—the difference between output growth and input
growth. It captures the change in output that may be attributable to techni-
cal change and efficiency in combining factors. Broadly speaking there are two
approaches to estimating TFP—parametric and non-parametric. The parametric
approaches assume a known production function, which is specified and esti-
mated to account for contribution of factors, and the residuals would be inter-
preted as estimates of TFP (see Arnade, 1998; Coelli et al., 2005; Ledena et al.,
2007; Fugile 2010, etc.). Non-parametric approaches make no assumptions on
the production function or the market structure or market imperfections, but
rather allow the data to speak for itself using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
methods. Recent applications include Mugera et al., (2012a) and Mugera et al.,
(2012b). The DEA methods allow decomposing TFP into technical change
(expansion or contraction of the production frontier) and efficiency gains (move-
ment towards or away from production frontier). It provides a better understand-
ing of the dynamics of productivity growth. In addition, factor productivity can
similarly be decomposed into technical change and efficiency (see recent appli-
cations in Mugera et al., 2012a and Mugera et al., 2012b). The proposed study
will use DEA methods to (a) estimate TFP and explain the relative importance of
technical change and efficiency; and (b) decompose factor productivity for labor
and fertilizers into technical change, efficiency, and factor intensity. The analy-
sis will be conducted for the entire crop sector by ago-ecological zones and for
specific crops by agro-ecological zones to prove a fuller understanding of what is
happening to agriculture across different production environments.

Data
The analysis utilizes data from Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) II col-
lected in 2003/2004 and NLSS III collected in 2010/2011 (referred to as 2003
data and 2010 data). NLSS is a stratified survey that oversamples households
living in rural municipalities. NLSS covers an extensive array of household

     characteristics, including household member composition, housing character-
     istics, access to facilities, migration history, food and non-food expenditures,
     inventory of durable goods, education, health, marriage and maternity history,
     jobs and time use, unemployment, wage income, agricultural production, non-­
     agricultural enterprises, credits and savings, transfers to and from absentee mem-
     bers, and anthropometrics of small children. In this study, our analysis primarily
     examines agricultural production data. The dataset provides geographical infor-
     mation on household locations at the district level. There are 75 districts in total
     in Nepal, and our sample covers 74 districts. In NLSS, each district is classified
     either a mountain, hill, or Terai (plain) agro-ecological zone.1 All of our analyses
     are conducted separately for each agro-ecological zone.

     NLSS II and III contain data on 3911 households and 5988 households respec-
     tively, of which 2851 and 5045 households produce agricultural outputs for
     self-consumption and/or marketing purposes. Removing outliers that report
     extreme values of inputs or outputs, 2832 and 4710 households remain for the
     2003 and 2010 data respectively. A subset of the NLSS II and III provides bal-
     anced panel data of 386 agricultural households for our analysis.

     In estimating DEA frontiers, we adjust for the difference in sample size to derive
     comparable estimates for 2003 and 2010 data. It is well-known that as a type
     of extreme-value estimator, the technically-feasible production set estimated
     by a DEA frontier becomes larger with the sample size. To obtain comparable
     DEA frontiers under a constant sample size, we use the sample size of 2003
     data (i.e. smaller of the two years) for each agro-ecological zone for the fron-
     tier estimation with 2010 data. For this purpose, we draw 30 sets of stratified
     random samples from the 2010 data conditionally on district2 and estimate 30
     sets DEA frontiers for 2010. Then, for each data point, we use the median of
     efficiency estimates against those frontiers,3 for which the calculation of the
     conventional MPI decomposition requires estimates of technical efficiency (TE)
     against the frontiers of the corresponding time periods and simulated technical
     efficiency (STE) against the frontiers of counterfactual years (i.e., 2003 data
     evaluated against 2010 frontier, and 2010 data evaluated against 2003 frontier).
     STE can be estimated only for the balanced panel subsample, or the households
     for whom we have observations in both 2003 and 2010 data.

     We consider two alternatives to those conventional MPI measures which are
     restricted to a small subset of the data. One is to calculate the district-level
     MPI decomposition by averaging (unbalanced numbers of) producer-level TE
     and STE estimates. Another is to estimate mean MPI decomposition using the
     regression-based approach as described above.

     Variable Construction
     We select farming households from NLSS and and analyze all farm-related
     activities as a single enterprise as opposed to a collection of crop-specific enter-
     prises. Our definition of farming household is a household with strictly positive
94                  Nepal: Sources of Growth in Agriculture for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
Annexes	


land use and household labor allocated to self-employment agriculture. NLSS
provides detailed accounts of agricultural land use of owned or rented land area
and the time use of each household member in economic activities. However,
the information on resource allocations is not broken down to specific crops,
making it infeasible to analyze distinct crop productions as separate enterprises.
Consequently, we analyze productivity of the whole farm and compare the
households with different crop mixes all at once.

The whole farm analysis in fact appears preferable to the crop-specific analysis,
given a high degree of crop diversification in Nepal agriculture. More than 75 per-
cent of farming households produced 6 or more varieties of crops in both 2003
and 2010. One important role of crop diversification is a buffer for various sources
of uncertainties that can affect various crops differently. In a remote countryside
where the household likely faces unstable supply of agricultural inputs and vola-
tile prices of agricultural outputs, specializing in a few varieties of crops would
be extremely risky. Without far-reaching and reliable networks of wholesalers and
traders, shocks to the rural economy can easily disrupt the markets, leading to a
shortage of crucial inputs or a temporary loss of marketing outlets. In addition,
rural farmers in Nepal are directly exposed to general risks associated with agri-
cultural markets and weather, which are increasingly managed through technolo-
gies, forward contracts, and financial instruments in developed economies. From
a home-consumption standpoint, crop diversification may improve nutritional
intakes of family members. A large portion of agricultural outputs in Nepal is con-
sumed at home. Such non-market benefits of crop diversification are not directly
measured in our analysis, but they are implicitly accounted for in the crop choice
of individual households, who are compared with one another on a basis of similar
crop mixes. On the other hand, the crop-specific analysis focusing on narrowly-
defined efficiency concept can be misleading. Even if highly specialized agriculture
is found to be the key to increase efficiency, some measures are likely needed to
mitigate the exposure to risks and provide safety nets for rural households.

Empirically, production analysis requires a succinct representation of input-out-
put variables. We construct 9 output variables by aggregating 62 out of 67 crop
varieties in the NLSS data. For inputs, we consider six specifications, each contain-
ing 7 to 12 input variables,4 that differ by the degree of aggregation of resources.

The output variables are constructed by aggregating the following components.

Outputs                                                 Components
Rice                early paddy, main paddy, upland paddy

     Outputs are constructed by summing up the revenue-equivalent values of their
     components and dividing the sums by the composite price index.5 For example,
     output variable Rice is defined as the sum of revenue-equivalents of early paddy,
     main paddy, and upland paddy, divided by the (observation-specific) revenue-
     share weighted prices of the three components. When there is only one compo-
     nent, which is the case for Wheat, the unit of this output is kilogram; otherwise,
     the output is in a quasi-quantity unit. To obtain revenue-equivalents, we first
     convert harvest quantities reported in NLSS into kilogram equivalents and then
     assign estimated crop prices per kilogram. The price estimates are primarily the
     medians of reported sales values per kilogram.

     The construction of input data is summarized as follows.

quantities of Rice, Wheat, and Cash Crops than their counterparts in the moun-
tains and the hills, who on the other hand produces larger quantities of Other
Cereals and Tubers and Bulbs. Notable changes from 2003 to 2010 include an
increase in Tubers and Bulbs in mountains and a decrease in Cash Crops in the
Terai. As for inputs, the average farming household in the Terai uses more inputs
of irrigated land, seed, capital, pesticide, fertilizer, and hired labor than their
counterparts in the mountains and the hills. In all agro-­    ecological zones, the
household labor allocated to self-employment agriculture has declined substan-
tially from 2003 to 2010, possibly due to increased mechanization or increased
use of capital-intensive inputs. In particular, female labor has declined dispro-
portionately more in all agro-ecological zones. The use of hired labor remains
very limited and is likely temporary like the assistance needed during the har-
vest season.

                   Annex 3.2: Application of the PETS and QSDS Methodology to

                   Description of PETS and QSDS
                   PETS examines flows of funds and materials through different administrative
                   level. It is used mainly to evaluate the proportion of public resources (financial,
                   human and in-kind) that reach each level, in particular frontline service pro-
                   viders. QSDS are multi-purpose surveys that examine the efficiency of front-
                   line service delivery and the dissipation of resources by collecting information
                   on service providers and various agents in the system. These two instruments
                   are often applied jointly to obtain a more complete picture of public service
                   delivery.

                   In the context of this survey, PETS was to track funds for each of the two
                   programs from MOF through MOAD to the two companies: AICL/STC and
                   NSCL; and seed and fertilizers from the two companies through the coopera-
                   tives to final users: the farmers. QSDS would be used to examine the internal
                   operations and effectiveness of the key institutions involved in the program. In
                   particular, cooperatives play the role of service provider, in purchasing the sub-
                   sidized seeds and fertilizers from the two companies for sale to farmers.

                   Target Groups for Subsidy
                   At the beginning of the current fertilizer subsidy policy in 2009, eligible farm-
                   ers for subsidized fertilizers were based on the size of landholding of less and
                   equal to 4 hectares of land in Terai; and less than 0.75 ha (15 Robani) in the
                   hills and mountains. The program covered four crops: paddy, wheat, maize, and
                   millet from which famers can choose. Eligibility requirement applied remained
                   the same when the seed subsidy program started in 2011. The seeds covered
                   were for paddy, wheat, maize, millet, lentil, gram, pigeon pea, and green grams.
                   During the consultation with MOAD, the survey team was informed that the
                   eligibility criteria had been relaxed; and farmers needed to provide proof of
                   landholding to buy subsidized fertilizers and seeds.

Survey Design
Several activities were planned to implement the survey. Survey team was consti-
tuted. Literature review and preparatory work was done. World Bank mission to
Nepal at end of June was organized to kick-start the survey and consult with key
stakeholders in Nepal. A World Bank Mission in Nepal was organized to bring the
survey team together. Meetings were organized with key stakeholders in Nepal
to introduce the survey, understand their expectations, motivate their participa-
tion and foster ownership of the survey process. The survey team held meetings
with key stakeholders in MOAD, the two companies and Project Coordinator of
USAID/IFPRI and other stakeholders. The survey team presented PETS/QSDS
methodology to key technical staff of MOAD involved in ESW to build a com-
mon understanding of the survey, and how it fitted into the ESW. In addition,
Work Plan for the survey was presented; and insightful responses were provided
to the survey team. In particular, MOAD requested incorporation of organic
fertilizer subsidy into the survey; highlight areas for capacity building; and how
MOAD and the two companies could effectively manage the two programs.

The sample used for the survey consisted of districts, cooperatives and farmers.
Sample districts were selected based on agro-ecological zones in Nepal: Terai,
hills/mountains. Three districts namely Morang and Nawalparasi representing
Terai and Surkhet representing hills were selected.

In each sampled district, two cooperatives were sampled. Average of quantity
of fertilizers sold to all cooperatives in a sampled district by AICL branch was
computed. Cooperatives were divided into two categories: cooperatives which
bought quantities of fertilizers above and below the district average. One coop-
erative was randomly selected from each category.

The selection of farmers was based on membership to a cooperative and land-
holding. Non-members were selected as next neighbour to sampled member.
The final sample size for the survey consisted of 3 districts, 6 cooperatives and
240 farmers.

The farmer questionnaire consisted of two sections: one part for Fertilizer; and
the other part on Seeds. Information sought included land available and used;
supply sources for fertilizers and seeds; purchases of fertilizers and seeds by
farmers during 2014/15; information dissemination and complaints redress
mechanism; and proposals by farmers to improve the two programs. The ques-
tionnaire for cooperatives consisted of two parts: one for fertilizer; the other for
seeds. Data sought was characteristics of the cooperatives; sources of fertilizers
and seeds bought by cooperatives; purchases and sales of seeds by cooperatives
in 2014/15; stock of seeds and fertilizers when cooperatives were visited; infor-
mation dissemination and complaints redress mechanism; and advisory services;
governance and oversight of cooperatives; and proposals by cooperatives to
improve the two programs. A datasheet was used to obtain data on fertilizers
received from AICL entry points to AICL branch; and fertilizers sold to sampled

      cooperatives by AICL branches. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) conducted at
      each sampled cooperatives supplemented questionnaires. Field supervisors facil-
      itated participants to reach a consensus on key changes needed to improve the
      two programs. Participants in FGD included cooperative officials, VDC officials,
      local knowledgeable persons and lead farmers. Findings of the FGD are pre-
      sented in Survey Implementation Report prepared by NEW ERA.

      The Limitations of this survey were:

      •	 The survey covers only three districts out of 75 districts of Nepal and within
         sample districts only two cooperatives are included.
      •	 The sample of 240 farmers includes only 10 large farmers (> 4ha.) from Terai
         (all from Morang and none from Nawalparasi) and 19 from hills district (in
         hill large farmer is defined as > 0.75ha.).
      •	 The fertilizer and seed use data is for only F.Y. 2014/15. There are annual
         variations in fertilizer supply situation and weather conditions which influ-
         ence crop coverage which in turn affects fertilizer and seed use.
      •	 Budget data and financial statements for the two companies could not be
         accessed due to limited time available and language barriers to review avail-
         able records.
      •	 Limited time to interface with AICL branches, entry points and NSCL out-
         lets to fully appreciate constraints in distribution chain at these levels.

    2.2	Classification
    	   Ginger is classified in three classes defined below:
        2.2.1  “Extra” Class
        	      Ginger in this class must be of superior quality. It must be char-
               acteristic of the variety and/or commercial type. The roots must
               be cleaned, well shaped and free of defects, with the exception
               of very slight superficial defects, provided these do not affect the
               general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality
               and presentation in the package.
        2.2.2	 Class I
        	      Ginger in this class must be of good quality. It must be charac-
               teristic of the variety and/or commercial type. The roots must be
               firm without evidence of shrivelling or dehydration and without
               evidence of sprouting. The following slight defects however may
               be allowed provided these do not affect the general appearance of
               the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in
               the package:
               •	 Slight skin defects due to rubbing provided they are healed and
                  dry and the total surface area affected not exceeding 10 percent
        2.2.3  Class II
        	      This class includes ginger that does not qualify for inclusion in the
               higher classes, but satisfies the minimum requirements specified
               in section 2.1. The roots should be reasonably firm. The following
               defects however, may be allowed provided the ginger retains its
               essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality
               and presentation:
               •	 Skin defects due to rubbing, provided they are healed and dry
                  and the total surface area affected not exceeding 15 percent
               •	 Early signs of sprouting (not more than 10 percent by weight
                  by unit of presentation)
               •	 Slight markings caused by pests
               •	 Healed suberized cracks, provided they are completely dry
               •	 Slight traces of soil
               •	 Bruises

Annex 5.1: Detailed Description of Cut-Flower Value Chain
Input Suppliers
Suppliers of variable inputs: The variable inputs in the production of cut-flowers
include planting materials (seeds, bulbs, saplings) and agrochemicals (fertilizers,
pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.). Most of the planting materials for ger-
bera, gladiolus, carnation and rose are imported. The main suppliers of inputs are
SIAM Floritech, Crop Pro-Tech, Flora Nepal and Floriculture Cooperative. The
first three companies mostly import planting materials from the Netherlands
(Gerbera, Carnation, Rose, Limonium), Germany (Rose), Poland (Gerbera),
Israel (Carnation, Gypsophila, Chrysanthemum and Asters) and India (Gerbera,

	                                                                                             Annexes


      Carnation). These companies are sole authorized importers in Nepal for the
      breeding companies they import from. In the past, mother plants for roses used
      to be imported directly from the Netherlands, Spain, Israel and other destina-
      tions. But this has changed as most of these global suppliers now have plant prop-
      agation centers in India, China, and Kenya. The orders for planting materials may
      be placed with companies based in European countries, but deliveries are made
      from their Asian plant prorogation sites. Input suppliers believe that planting
      materials sourced directly from European breeders are consistent and superior in
      quality than those sourced from propagation sites. However, the main advantages
      of importing through India-based propagation sites are: (i) price advantage to the
      importer due to transportation and currency conversion, and (ii) the input sup-
      plier companies also provide technical support. Another key input supplier is the
      Floriculture Cooperative, which mostly imports planting materials through other
      importers and then supplies to producers. The Cooperative also imports directly
      when planting materials are required in large quantities.

      Suppliers of fixed assets: Small producers either buy the greenhouse system
      from importers such as Crop Pro-Tech or buy greenhouse materials by parts.
      For example, importers bring in ultraviolet (UV) plastic sheets and insect nets.
      However, small growers largely use silpaulin covering sheet that is easily avail-
      able in local markets. Silpaulin is a cheaper option to the UV plastic film but
      does not have the same protective effect on plants. Most small growers locally
      build greenhouse structures using bamboo. Bamboo is an easily available alter-
      native to GI or aluminum structures and it is attractive because of the low
      investment cost. However, in the long run bamboo could be more expensive
      due to the high maintenance costs. Although most producers currently use bam-
      boo structures, they are eager to shift to the GI or aluminum structures. The
      greenhouses locally built by producers often work as mere shades and have little
      or no environment control mechanisms that are essential to grow cut-flowers.
      There are also input supply companies such as SIAM Floritech that design and
      fabricate manually operated greenhouses using aluminum or galvanized iron
      structures and offer option of silpaulin or UV plastic sheet covering depending
      on demand. Locally designed and fabricated greenhouses are not temperature
      or humidity controlled, and therefore come with manually operated ventilation.
      Drip irrigation has gained popularity among commercial cut-flower producers
      in recent times and in some cases it has replaced canal irrigation. Suppliers for
      drip irrigation system import from India. The main suppliers are Nepal Thopa
      Sichai (translated as Drip Irrigation) and Crop Protect.

      Producers
      In total, there are about 544 entrepreneurs who are involved in floriculture,
      of which 63 producers are involved in commercial production of cut-flowers.
      Among the 63, about 43 producers use greenhouses or plastic covered shades
      while the remaining 20 produce in open areas. Even among the 43 using

greenhouses, only about 5 of them use high-tech or semi high-tech green-
houses. The main reason behind low technology is that the investment costs
for imported high tech greenhouses are high for an average producer. However,
there are many benefits associated with such technologies, including (i) metal
structure that is more durable than the locally made bamboo, (ii) temperature
and humidity control features, (iii) pest control nets that offers benefits of
reduced use of pesticides. Cut-flower producers could be categorized into two
kinds—those who produce year-round of which there are less than 50, and those
who produce seasonal cut-flowers for specific seasons only. Production of cut-
flowers is dominated by small scale entrepreneurs. A handful of migrants who
have returned home have also made investments in the cut-flower production.
Producers also fulfill the role of transporters up to the wholesale point. There is
no dedicated mode of transport for cut-flowers. Producers use any vehicle avail-
able such as local busses, vans, taxis and motorbikes.

Wholesalers
Among, these is Flora Nepal, which is a subsidiary of Golchha Organization.
The firm produces cut-flowers and runs a wholesale unit which is also sup-
plied by a number of other small farmers. Other major wholesaler include
United Flora and Global Flora. These wholesale units are jointly owned by a
number of different value chain actors through a structure that resembles a
cooperative model. United Flora has 15 investors of which 7 are producers and
others are retailers. This model has proven successful in vertical coordination
as producers are guaranteed a secure market for their cut-flowers and retailers
can get their supplies on a regular basis. The wholesale point also serves as an
important platform for the flow of market information and minimization of
ex-ante and ex-post transaction costs. The success of the United Flora model
inspired other industry players (34 investors) to form Global Flora. Of the 34
investors, one is an input supplier, 20 are producers, 7 are retailers and the
rest are entrepreneurs. Both United Flora and Global Flora source all of their
producer from member that are producers and then sell to their retail mem-
bers and others in the market. Each wholesale units provide employment to
4–6 unskilled/semi-skilled persons all year round and another 4–5 unskilled
persons during peak seasons. The employees are largely male. In addition,
there are other two privately owned wholesale units—Sri Suppliers and Oasis
Continental.

Retailers
There are 35 cut-flowers retailers in the country that are listed with (FAN), of
which 3 are in Pokhara and the rest are in Kathmandu and Lalitpur. Another group
of retailers is found in Biratnagar, Bhirahava, Birgunj, Narayanghad—but they are
mostly not listed with FAN, and therefore their exact numbers is not known. It is
estimated that this group purchase about 5 percent of domestic production.

      Exporters
      The TEPC data shows that exports of floriculture products are decreasing
      steadily over the past decade. Furthermore, the share of cut-flowers in exports
      is very low. Everest Floriculture, a production farm established with the intent
      to export roses from Nepal to Japan, has successfully exported for a few years.
      However, due to various reasons, the company shut down a few years ago.
      According to the industry, what is regarded as exports of cut-flowers are really
      samples and not commercial volumes. This reflects occasional attempts by
      wholesalers to send samples for cut-flowers in small quantities to India. United
      Flora exports to India and Qatar periodically. Global Flora and Flora Nepal have
      also tried exporting to India a few times in the past but are not regularly.

      Importers
      Imports from India are growing due to increasing domestic demand, most of
      which is coming from Kathmandu. Sri Suppliers, a wholesale unit and many
      other retailers import cut-flowers from India and Thailand. The flowers imported
      from India are mainly Rose, Carnation, Gerbera, Tuberose, Lily and Marigold.
      Orchids are mainly imported from Thailand. The importers from India use local
      agents who buy products on their behalf from the wholesale markets or “man-
      dis” in key Indian cities such as Delhi, Calcutta and Silguri. The local agents
      are responsible for packaging the cut-flowers which are then transported by
      road for up to 36–48 hours. The means of transport includes buses headed to
      Kathmandu. Cut-flowers from India are brought in through the Raxaul, Birgunj,
      Bhirahava, Kakadbhitta border points. From there it takes from 12 to 48 hours
      to reach Kathmandu.

      Consumers
      Approximately 90 percent of end consumers for cut-flowers are in Kathmandu,
      5 percent in Pokhara and the remaining percent in cities such as Biratnagar,
      Bhirahava, Birgunj and Narayanghad. The consumption of cut-flowers in these
      cities has been increasing trend over the past decade, especially for weddings
      and other occasions. Retailers believe that 90 percent of consumers buy cut-
      flowers as gift for others. Consumers are quite satisfied with the current qual-
      ity of production, but demand more variety and color. They are not socially or
      environmentally conscious to demand standards or labels that are sought after
      internationally.

      Notes
      	 1.	The classification of agro-ecological zone is implied by the numbering system for
           stratum in sampling design.
      	 2.	District is used as a stratification to draw random samples from the 2010 data. For
           each district, we draw data points of 2003-sample-size within that district. Districts
           that do not have enough observations to do so are assigned substitutes: Jumla and

    Mugu are used for substituting Dolpa; Bejura and Bajhang for Humla; Lalitpur, Bhak-
    tapur, Nuwakot for an insufficient portion of Kathmandu; and Parsa for an insuffi-
    cient portion of Chitwan.
	 3.	 The process involves “out-of-sample” efficiency estimations, for which we impose the
      theoretical maximum value of one at the full efficiency level. Another way to put it
      is that we use the observation in question and a random sample of 2003-sample-size-
      minus-one data points from the 2010 data in estimating the DEA frontier for 2010.
	 4.	 By inspection, we excludes outliers, most of which have substantially higher revenues
      or expenses than the runner-ups in the distributions for the sample. This includes;
      Rice revenue exceeding 100,000 Rs: Wheat revenue exceeding 20,000 Rs: Other
      Cereal revenue exceeding 50,000 Rs: Pulse revenue exceeding 10,000 Rs: Tuber
      revenue exceeding 20,000 Rs: Oilseed revenue exceeding 50,000 Rs: Cash Crop
      revenue exceeding 100,000 Rs: Vegetable revenue exceeding 100,000 Rs: Fruits
      revenue exceeding 20,000 Rs: every output revenue-equivalent smaller than 1 Rs:
      Seed expense exceeding 80,000 Rs for 2003: Chemical Fertilizer expense exceeding
      10,000 Rs: and Permanent Labor exceeding 100,000 hours for 2010. Each of these
      items drop up to a few observations.
	 5.	This leads to a quantity index in the form of a weighted harmonic mean, where
     weights are the expenditures and variables are the pseudo-quantities repenting the
     total expenditure divided by component-specific prices.
