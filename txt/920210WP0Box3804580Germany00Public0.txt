The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Obtain building permit

        The building permit grants the right to build on a plot and authorizes
        construction as well. There are several building departments
        (Bauaufsichtsämter) located in the districts of Berlin. The location of the
        building site in Berlin determines which building department is
        responsible for issuing the building permit.

        To obtain a construction permit, BuildCo must provide the building
        authority with, among other documents, project design drawings, a
        building specification including a detailed description of the future use
        of the building, proof of stability, and other necessary proofs (e.g. heat
        insulation, sound insulation). The architect needs to sign the application
        for the building permit and must attach the design drawings, usually
        scaled at 1:100. Static calculations must be added. The building
        authority will produce static expert double-check calculations (carried
        out by a "Pruefstatiker"). The building authority will then forward the
        application to other relevant departments (e.g., the fire department,         25 days          EUR 6,107
   1
        planning department).

        The Building Procedures Regulation (Bauverfahrensverordnung,
        abbreviated as BauVerfVO) was amended on 22nd March 2013.
        According to the amendment, the applicant is now obliged to submit
        the building permission procedure documents electronically in Portable
        Document (PDF/A).

        Under a revised Berlin State Law, the Building Code Berlin (Bauordnung
        Berlin, abbreviated as BauO Bln), effective September 29, 2005,
        amended by Regulation from June 29, 2011, certain constructions
        require only a simple building permit (Section 64 BauO Bln) or a waiver
        (Section 63 BauO Bln, maximum value EUR 3,000.00). In the case of a
        simplified building permit under Section 64 BauO Bln, the application
        will be deemed to be complete and sufficient unless the building
        department notifies the applicant to the contrary within three weeks of
        receiving the application. If the building department remains silent for
        four weeks, the application will be deemed granted and construction

      may commence (Section 70, Paragraphs 3 and 4 BauO Bln, and Section
      71, Paragraph 7, Item 1 BauO Bln). It is the duty of the architect or the
      engineer to supervise compliance of the construction project with the
      applicable state law.

      In addition, upon receiving the application for a normal building permit,
      the building department has to notify the applicant within 14 days if
      the application is complete or if additional documents or plans are
      required (Section 70, Paragraph 1 and 2 BauO Bln). If the applicant fails
      to amend the application within a period determined by the building
      authority, the application will be deemed abandoned. If the application
      is complete, the building department will contact other departments
      involved (i.e., the fire safety and public street supervision departments).
      If the other departments fail to make a decision within a month, they
      will be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the permit. If the
      application is not complete for the purpose of these other
      departments, then this period of a month is interrupted until the
      application is completed by the applicant. Upon receiving consent from
      the other departments, the building department again has a month to
      decide on the application for a building permit.

      Apply for approval of static calculation

      The building authority appoints an independent engineer (either from a
      private company or from within the authority) who is responsible for
      verifying the static calculations (the “Pruefingenieur”).

      A legal certificate of static stability, issued by a “Pruefingenieur”, must
      be available at the time of start of construction.

      The cost of an independent engineer to double-check the static
      stability is calculated by a Regulation concerning the work of the
      “Pruefingenieure” and the payment (Bautechnische
      Prüfungsverordnung, abbreviated as BauPrüfV, effective February 12,
      2010, amended by Regulation from August 23, 2010). In the case of the         21 days       EUR 3,150

      warehouse considered here, the cost for an independent engineer is
      about EUR 3,150.00. The calculation is based on a volume of 3900 cubic
      meters and a chargeable building value of EUR 95 per cubic meters
      (Appendix 1 to Section 27 Paragraph 1 BauPrüfVO, Item 15). The
      chargeable building value amounts up to EUR 370,500.00 in accordance
      with the list. A structural framework of average difficulty considered
      (“Bauwerksklasse” 2-3, Appendix 2 to Section 27 Paragraph 4
      BauPrüfVO) gives a basic fee of about EUR 3,150.00 for a legal
      certificate of static stability, issued by a “Pruefingenieur”.

      Receive fire safety inspection from District Chimney Sweeper

      Before completion of the building shell, BuildCo must provide the
      building authority with a certificate confirming the suitability of the
      chimneys. Such a certificate by the District Chimney Sweeper is
      mentioned in Section 81, Paragraph 4 BauO Bln. The cost is EUR 31.20
      per hour (see Section 1, Paragraph 3, Item 3 a and Section 12 of the
      applicable city ordinance: Verordnung über die Kosten für Kehr und
      Überprüfungsarbeiten und Messungen durch den
      Bezirksschornsteinfegermeister in Berlin, abbreviated as KÜGebO,
      promulgated January 14, 1999, amended January 23, 2006). The
      inspection may take more than one hour, but it will not take more than         1 day         EUR 31

      a day. An appointment can be made on short notice, probably 1 -- 2
      weeks before the day of inspection.

      This procedure is for fire safety and for the cases where the heating is
      done by gas boilers. However, some buildings in Berlin will use a so
      called "long distance heating" system to heat the building, which is
      essentially heating by hot water from a centralized boiler. In this case,
      this procedure would not be required.

        The application can be submitted online by email. Documents to be
        submitted are: Architect’s plan indicating the room for the grid
        connection, a route in the building and on the lot for the cable, power
        performance balance for the building, technical information of the
        connection, registration number of the electrician and map of the area

        The installer identification from any other DSO of the electrician or the
        Master craftsman’s diploma, trading license and a standard form of the
        distribution operator is needed for the listing process. To be authorized

        he/she is licensed with the Chamber of Commerce and has a Craftsman
        Diploma. This is the general procedure and requirement to be allowed to
        work as electrician in Germany and to do the internal wiring in a house.
        The Master electrician ("Elektromeister") is always legally responsible for
        the internal wiring. All Master electricians (“Elektromeister”) in Berlin are
        registered with Vattenfall. This license is valid for all his/her projects in
        the area of the local DSO. Electricians working in the field of industrial
        (warehouses) connections are registered with Vattenfall in a second form
        through training. Those electricians receive a number
        ("Installateurnummer") and are allowed to install the meter. All
        electricians in Berlin that are working in the field of industrial
        (warehouses) connections are certified by Vattenfall. The list of those
        certified electricians is on the website of Vattenfall and can be obtained
        at the Guild of electricians ("Elektroinnung") as well. There is no external
        and no internal inspection. The internal wiring is never inspected by
        Vattenfall DSO, as they trust the electricians through a process of
        registration and diplomas.

        Make payment and await completion of external connection works
        and meter installation by Vattenfall Europe Distribution Berlin
        GmbH

        The customer is paying the estimate at a bank through a wire transfer.
        The required external connection works are underground work for the
        cable, building of metering, building of the grid connection, and
        connection of the building to the grid. The meter gets installed at the
        same time when the connection is done and by the same or another
        department if the meter installation is done by Vattenfall DSO. However,
        in most of the cases, the private electrician (the Master electrician) who
   3    did the internal wiring would install the meter. At this moment, this      14 calendar days     EUR 15,500
        private electrician has to hand over to Vattenfall DSO a form
        ("Errichterbescheinigung") that certifies that he installed the internal
        wiring according to technical and safety standards. In 98% of all cases,
        the internal wiring and the external connection works are done at the
        same time and usually the external connection works are completed
        before the internal wiring as this is usually more complex. Electricity
        starts flowing immediately.

      statutory right of preemption either does not exist or is not exercised.

      * Fulfillment of the pre-conditions for the validity of the purchase
      price and notarize sale agreement

      The following pre conditions have to be fulfilled for the maturity of the
      purchase price:

      (i) Consent or negative attest of the competent authority regarding any
      statutory pre-emption rights, applicable to all properties in Berlin.
      (ii) Registration of the priority notice in the Land Register (not mandatory
      but usual practice to secure the purchasers rank in the land register and
      avoid a third party purchasing the property in good faith).
      (iii) Consent to the cancellation of existing encumbrances
      (i)The civil council ("Bezirksamt") issues the consent or a negative attest
      to the transaction. The time limit given by the statute is that the civil
      council may exercise the right of pre-emption two months after
      informing the civil council of the notarised sale and transfer agreement.
      (ii)The priority notice prevents a purchase by a third party of good faith
      between the conclusion of the purchase agreement and registration of
      the purchaser; it usually ranks after the existing encumbrances and prior
      to any future encumbrances at the time of notarisation. This notice
      provides a very high level of legal and economic security and certainty.
      Upon registration, the notice protects against all intervening interests
      (including seller’s insolvency) pending completion of the transaction and
      actual change in registered ownership. By use of this notice, a purchaser         20 days        EUR 1388
      is legally protected against potential risks at an extremely early stage of   (simultaneous (registration fee of

      entered in the public register by the notary immediately following
                                                                                         and 4)        5/10 fee)
      authentication of the purchase contract. From that moment onward, the
      purchaser can rest assured that he can acquire title to the property if all
      prerequisites to maturity of the purchase price are fulfilled.

      The items (i, ii, and iii) above which are not accepted or taken over by the
      purchaser have to be in place. It might take substantial time to obtain
      them, particularly if they have come from public authorities. Such
      consents will be delivered to the notary and will usually be presented to
      the land register later when applying for the registration of the new
      owner (Procedure 4).
      Registration fee of the priority notice depends on the value of the
      property.

      If all pre-conditions to the maturity "Fälligkeit" of the purchase price,
      usually collected and examined by the notary, have been fulfilled, the
      notary issues a statement of maturity "Fälligkeitsmitteilung" to the
      purchaser. The purchaser is then obliged to pay the purchase price. The
      payment is evidenced by the seller confirming payment or a bank
      statement.
      If the respective declarations in rem have already been provided for in
      the sale and transfer agreement, the notary is usually bound by an
      escrow agreement not to forward them to the land register until the
      purchase price has been paid.

      (Section 311b German Civil Code). The transfer of title of a real property,
      governed by the law of disposition "Sachenrecht", also has to be in a
      certain form: the declarations in rem, which are in a format according to
      the land register regulation (Grundbuchordnung), and the transfer has to
      be registered in the land register. Such declarations in rem which are
      pre-conditions to the registration of the purchaser to be registered as
      new owner may either already be in the notarial deed or be given in a
      separate notarial deed.

      * Payment of the transfer tax and obtaining the confirmation

      The notary is obliged to provide a copy of each notarised sale and
      transfer agreement to the responsible tax authority. The tax authority will
      then issue a tax assessment and send it to the purchaser. The land
      register clerk will not register the purchaser as new owner if the transfer
      tax has not been paid. After payment of the real estate transfer tax, the 15 days, possibly

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

DB2010              Market (Finanzmarktstabilisierungsgesetz), which removed the
