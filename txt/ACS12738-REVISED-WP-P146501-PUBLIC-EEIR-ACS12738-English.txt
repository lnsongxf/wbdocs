Introduction


I
  f Turkey is to continue its trajectory of economic growth in a sustainable manner, energy
  efficiency (EE) will be of critical importance. Recognizing this, the government of Turkey now
  considers EE a key component of both its energy strategy and its National Climate Change
Strategy and Action Plan.
Over the past 5-10 years, Turkey has made considerable advances in establishing a strong policy
and legal framework, creating a robust institutional set-up, and developing programs to support
EE implementation. From an institutional standpoint, since 1981 the General Directorate of the
Electric Power Resources Survey and Development Administration (EIE) had been mandated with
EE policy making, implementation and promotion; in 2007 an Energy Efficiency Coordination
Board (EECB) was established under the 2007 EE Law to coordinate various EE policies, programs
and related efforts. Finally, in November 2011 EIE was converted into the General Directorate
for Renewable Energy (GDRE) and absorbed into the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
(MENR).
Objectives and Approach
In 2013, in consultation with the Turkish government, the World Bank conducted an EE institutional
review with the objective of improving Turkey’s ability to manage EE policies and programs, thus
helping it meet its stated national EE targets. The review involved a detailed assessment of the
current institutional set-up, including the roles and responsibilities for EE in Turkey along with
a comparison with international experience and best practices. This is the review’s final report,
and as such it contains a final set of institutional options and recommendations.
Assessment of Functions and
Responsibilities
The report team based its assessment of Turkey’s institutional roles and functions on two things:
a review of existing laws and documents and a set of interviews with public and private sector
stakeholders. The result was then analyzed across four major areas—policy, data and information,
incentives and technical assistance, and monitoring and evaluation—to identify current
responsibilities, gaps in relation to international best practices, and perceived overlaps and gaps
across the main energy-using sectors: industry, banks, public, residential and commercial. A
Functions and Responsibilities Matrix was then developed.
Summary of Major Findings
The Functions and Responsibilities Matrix shows clearly where the institutional set-up is
sufficient, where enhancements are needed, and what functions remain to be developed and
assigned. The key findings are as follows:
By Functional Area
    Policy Framework
•	 The policy framework related to EE is reasonably strong and is based on international good
   practice. The EE Law and subsequent regulations cover all key energy-using sectors, with
   relatively clear institutional mandates, roles and responsibilities, targets and implementation
   mechanisms, incentives and penalties, and pricing.


                                                                                                      9
     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




     •	 With the closure of EIE, the EE Law needs to be revised and updated, with responsibilities
        formally assigned to EIE reassigned to specific ministry departments and institutions, including
        GDRE. Ministerial roles related to supporting programs are less clear, which has created some
        institutional overlaps/competition in EE programming.
     •	 Additionally, some secondary legislation is still needed to complete the planned policy
        framework and to focus greater attention on the systematic enforcement of existing policies
        and regulations.
         Data and Information
     •	 In general, the institutional roles for data collection and information dissemination are in
        place. GDRE has primary responsibility for collecting energy consumption information for
        large users, and for developing and maintaining databases for such information. However,
        there is a need to strengthen GDRE’s ability in such areas as reporting enforcement, data
        cleaning and analysis, and development of benchmarking and sectoral analysis functions.
     •	 There is also a need to develop systems to collect information on implementation experiences—
        case studies, financing modalities, sample contracting schemes, and so on—in order to
        replicate successes and develop programs to further support financing and implementation.
     •	 Information campaigns have been successfully implemented but appear to have lapsed at
        times.
         Incentives and Implementation Support
     •	 A number of incentive schemes and technical assistance (TA) programs have been developed
        and are operational, but not all program planning and implementation functions—such as
        market studies, program design, implementation plans, monitoring and reporting, evaluation,
        and program redesign—have been formalized.
     •	 Although most incentive schemes target larger industrial consumers, funds have not always
        been fully utilized. There are no incentive programs specifically targeting public facilities,
        commercial buildings, or the residential sector, or for new mechanisms such as energy service
        companies (ESCOs).
     •	 While there are a number of TA initiatives across the institutions, most appear to be ad hoc in
        nature, funded by donors, and prone to phasing out after a few years. There are no functional
        EE information centers, websites, or other means of providing comprehensive technical,
        financial, and implementation information to end users.
         Monitoring and Evaluation
     •	 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions have yet to be fully developed and operational.
        Some M&E functions are planned, or have been assigned in policies, but no formal evaluation
        reports were identified.
     •	 Targets do exist at the national level, but limited analysis has been done on the reasonableness
        of the targets, implementation costs, sources of financing, and so on. There are no sector or
        subsector targets to determine the relative priority or energy savings potential across them.
        Nor does there appear to be an adopted methodology for determining how progress towards
        the national targets would be measured and at what intervals it would be reported.
     •	 At the program and project levels, there are no clear evaluation and measurement and
        verification (M&V) methodologies or plans to determine their impacts or efficacy. Such
        evaluation plans can help identify program objectives and goals, then develop indicators and
        methods to determine if and when the program has met them.

By Market Segment
   Industrial Sector

•	 Large industries have clear policy mandates under the EE Law and are able to access commercial
   financing through typical corporate lending. However, there is a lack of systematic subsector
   data analysis and benchmarking which would allow the government to identify high and low
   performers. Enforcement of industrial EE mandates, including assessment of the quality of
   compliance, needs to be strengthened.

•	 SMEs have moderate access to financing. There is a need to develop additional financing and
   delivery models for EE to help SMEs that have less access to traditional commercial credit,
   such as simple vendor leasing and ESCO schemes, to accelerate EE investments.
   Public Sector

•	 Public agencies have some policy mandates and TA programs, but there is no national level
   program to provide regulatory incentives, policy adjustments, financing and TA to fully serve
   this sector. Policy adjustments are needed to modify existing policies and regulations that
   create procedural barriers for public entities to implement EE improvements (such as public
   budgeting, procurement and borrowing). Enforcement of EE mandates for public entities also
   needs to be strengthened.

•	 A key gap is access to financing for both central and municipal entities. International experience
   suggests that a dedicated, quasi-public financing scheme may be needed for public sector EE
   projects until municipal credit markets are further developed.

•	 There is a need for improved subsector data analysis and benchmarking that would allow
   identification of high and low performers across a range of subsectors—such as public
   buildings, street lighting, municipal water pumping, and public transportation. Street lighting
   was specifically highlighted by several interviewees as an area where clarity on ownership
   and operations was needed.

         Residential Sector

     •	 The government has relatively strong programs for efficient appliances, through national
        standards and labeling, public awareness campaigns, and a developed retail credit market.
        Better public data is needed, however, to track market shares of efficient appliances and
        development of programs for low-income consumers.

     •	 Renovation of homes to reduce heating and cooling use is less developed, particularly for
        multifamily apartment buildings. While some building material standards exist, there is a
        need to develop programs to work with existing apartment management cooperatives
        and homeowner associations (HOAs) to help retrofit their buildings by improving access to
        appropriate financing, introducing incentives, and providing TA.

     International Review of Institutional Structures and Good Practices
     The international review examined dozens of country and agency set-ups and experiences in
     order to identify good practices and institutional options. The earlier research by the World Bank
     had identified seven basic institutional models for EE; these are summarized in Table ES-1, along
     with the main advantages and drawbacks of each.

Key Success Factors
Global experience has identified a number of key success factors and core competencies for an
EE agency as follows:
•	 Independence, autonomy and flexibility in decision making, and adequate resources,
   including staff and funding
•	 Dedicated to EE, visible to all stakeholders, and accountable for its actions and results
•	 Earmarked, long-term funding source to ensure stable and predictable funding levels
•	 Capable of engaging, working and influencing a wide range of stakeholders, including public/
   private organizations with EE responsibilities, regulators, utilities, and banks.
•	 Capacity to leverage private-sector participation in EE implementation and cooperate with
   EE equipment and service providers
•	 Credible systems for monitoring and evaluation its programs and activities
•	 Strong management and leadership and high caliber staff, with proper performance
   incentives to achieve institutional goals
In addition, five case studies, representing EE agencies with different institutional frameworks,
were selected for detailed assessment. These included France’s environment and energy
management agency (ADEME), India’s Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), the German Energy
Agency (dena), the United Kingdom’s Energy Saving Trust, and the Korea Energy Management
Corporation (KEMCO). The case studies information was used to document how each agency has
addressed some of the important gaps identified in the Functions and Responsibilities Matrix.
How Does Turkey Compare with International Good Practices?
1.	 The EE entity should be independent, autonomous and flexible.
	 With all EE function under MENR (largely within GDRE), the EE department’s independence
    and autonomy are low and subject to ministerial bureaucracy; staff may be subject to rotation
    or reassignment.
2.	 The entity should be dedicated to EE, visible to stakeholders and accountable for results.
	 GDRE is dedicated to both EE and RE; EE lost visibility by not having EE in its organizational
    name. Its evaluation functions remain underdeveloped, preventing GDRE from reporting
    impacts on its programs and assessing their cost-effectiveness and overall efficacy.
3.	 The entity should be able to engage, collaborate with, and influence a wide range of
    stakeholders.
	 While some outreach efforts exist, primarily with industry, there is a need for increased
    dialogue with banks and consumer groups. EE programs lack periodic feedback mechanisms
    that would allow revision on the basis of experiences and changing market conditions.
4.	 The entity should have strong program design, implementation and evaluation functions.
	 Although GDRE and other agencies have several ongoing programs, most do not appear to
    be based on systematic analyses, have program plans with clear objective statements, or be
    conducting ongoing monitoring using indicators and evaluations.
5.	 The entity should have good management/staff with incentives for good performance.
	 Since EIE was absorbed within MENR, GDRE’s ability to showcase its successes has been
    limited. Ministerial management and staff in general are difficult to remove for reasons of
    poor performance, and limited incentives exist for outstanding staff achievement.

     The institutional review also assessed EE governance—planning, people, programs, political
     support, and private sector engagement—in Turkey. Table ES-2 summarizes how the current
     institutional set-up in Turkey fares relative to these five key elements.
     Key Institutional Principles for Turkey
     While Turkey has done a commendable job in establishing a sound policy framework and
     creating a strong set of programs and institutions to support EE, additional enhancements are
     now needed to help elevate its national EE program to the next level of maturity and complexity.
     Some main principles that should inform institutional arrangements are as follows:
     1.	 Turkey should consider introducing a visible and independent EE entity.
     2.	 This EE entity would operate best with a management board with broad representation.
     3.	 The EE entity would serve as the primary implementing arm of the government for EE.
     4.	 The EE entity would develop and maintain all program functions—from market analysis
         to program formulation to implementation and evaluation, with public program plans and
         evaluation reports.
     5.	 The management team should be subject to periodic agency performance reviews by the
         board, and have flexibility to hire and fire staff and reward good performance.
     6.	 This new EE entity should make efforts to urgently address currently underserved markets,
         such as the public and residential sectors.

Institutional Options for Turkey
Based on the assessments conducted during this project, the following models were identified as
potential options for Turkey (Table ES-3). It should be emphasized that the options presented are
proposed as a potential restructuring of GDRE and not the creation of a completely new entity.
Institutional Recommendations for Turkey
In terms of specific institutional models, it is recommended that the government either establish
an independent statutory authority or a PPP to serve as its future EE agency. Both options would
provide sufficiently strong independence with suitable private sector input and influence. The
primary role of the new EE agency would be to serve as the implementing arm of the government
for EE programs.
The entity would initially be staffed with GDRE employees and possibly supplemented with
program staff from MoSIT and MoEU. Staffing would evolve over time, based on program needs,
skills mix, staff performance, funding, etc. In terms of programming, each existing EE program
would need to be approved by the board, with a program implementation plan prepared along
with a clear strategy, and would be made public once approved. Strategies and plans would be
developed for each of the main sectors—industry, public, residential within the first six months
of operation.


                                                                                                                    15

     The board itself would be chaired by MENR and have broad representation, including all
     government agencies with EE responsibilities. Representatives from select industrial associations,
     banks, consumer groups, academia, and civil society should also be considered. The board will
     have primary responsibility for oversight of the EE agency, including appointment and renewal
     of the management team, strategic documents, approval of annual budgets and work plans,
     approval of all new program plans, review of progress and evaluation reports, and other tasks to
     reasonably ensure effective operation of the EE agency.

     Because the board will make most of the program-level decisions, the EECB could be transformed
     into a higher-level EE Policy Committee, possibly chaired by the Prime Ministry, which focuses
     on issues such as inter-ministerial coordination, policy formulation and updates, and review of
     regulatory enforcement. This Committee could also make recommendations to the EE agency’s
     board in terms of new programming, public information needs on new regulations, and so forth.

     The government recently issued detailed action plans for many of the 10th Development Plan’s
     focal areas, including EE. The government is calling for “[GDRE] to be transformed into a stronger
     structure that will also steer and coordinate energy efficiency activities of other agencies and
     organizations as well.” While such enhancements will be needed to strengthen the GDRE’s
     institutional capacity, additional efforts may be needed to achieve parallel enhancements to
     governance, independence and accountability. Thus, implementing appropriate revisions to the
     structure of GDRE should be given a high priority to ensure that planned capacity enhancements
     will have the greatest impact and can be sustained.

     It is recognized, of course, that the selection of a specific model is a political decision. Nevertheless,
     the government is encouraged to select an option as early as possible and initiate a transition
     plan, as extended deliberations would likely create further uncertainty, potentially harming EE
     program performance. Once a decision is made, refinement of the institutional design, along with
     the development of more detailed transition and business plans, would then be necessary. The
     World Bank and donor community would stand ready to provide support in such an endeavor.

Background


I
     n line with its accession to the European Union (EU), Turkey must honor its global commitments
     for climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability. At the same time, it must
     sustain its economic growth. Energy efficiency (EE) will be critical in both respects.
Turkey imports 72 percent of its energy,1 which in 2013 accounted for US$56 billion, or 7 percent
of its GDP. Current projections suggest that continued growth in electricity demand will deplete
the power reserve margins within the next five years. Turkey’s energy intensity (i.e., energy
consumption per unit of GDP) is relatively low—0.11 toe/US$1000 (2005 purchasing power
parity) compared with the EU figure of 0.12 in 2011).2 However, it rose by 6.5 percent from 2005
to 2011, whereas in EU countries it declined by 8.4 percent over the same period. As energy use
per capita rises (1.52 toe as compared with 3.29 toe in the EU), its energy intensity is expected
to continue to grow.
Recent World Bank and other assessments have identified substantial potential for EE gains
across all sectors.3 In Turkey’s industrial sector, for example, where some industries consume two
to three times the energy of their peers in OECD countries, estimates indicate potential savings
of 25 percent. The similarly inefficient building sector could save about 30 percent. Realizing EE
gains of this magnitude is feasible and would substantially improve Turkey’s competitiveness.
Further, total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Turkey increased by more than 130 percent
from 1990 to 2012, presenting a major environmental challenge.4 The government recognizes
this and considers EE a key component of its energy security strategy as reflected in the 2011
document Turkey’s National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan.5
In 2011 the World Bank conducted a market assessment and initial policy/institutional review of
EE in Turkey (World Bank 2011a) and found that:
•	 The overall EE policy framework had been significantly enhanced in recent years.
•	 Although policies, technical capacity, and information gathering were fairly strong functions,
   critical gaps remained in each area.
•	 There were a number of systemic issues related to the institutional set-up and market
   development to fully mobilize commercial financing for EE.
•	 There was a need for a strong, dedicated institution focused on EE to ensure that the EE
   market realizes its potential. This would require:
      	Completing necessary secondary legislation;
      	Establishing national level programs in all sectors;
      	Matching financing, expertise, and information with demand for EE services; and
      	Developing new financing and implementation models for EE delivery – such as promotion
        of energy service companies (ESCOs) and energy saving performance contracts (ESPCs).

     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




     From an institutional standpoint, since 1981 the General Directorate of the Electric Power
     Resources Survey and Development Administration (EIE) had been mandated with EE policy
     making, implementation and promotion; in 2007 an Energy Efficiency Coordination Board (EECB)
     was established under the 2007 EE Law to coordinate various EE policies, programs and related
     efforts. Finally, in November 2011 a decision was made to close EIE and integrate its staff and
     functions into the General Directorate for Renewable Energy (GDRE) within the Ministry of
     Energy and Natural Resources (MENR).
     In 2013 the World Bank presented its assessment of Turkey’s overall EE program, based on its
     framework for successful EE programs (Figure 1-1).6
     The World Bank recommended a number of key actions with respect to policy and regulations,
     information, technical capacity, and finance, as follows:
     •	 Policy and regulation
         	Conduct a policy gaps analysis and complete necessary legislative updates and secondary
           regulations
     •	 Information
        	Introduce a one-stop shop for clients seeking to implement EE projects
        	Develop and maintain an energy database and establish benchmarking functions
        	Issue regular sectoral energy performance reports

•	 Technical capacity
    	Redesign the ESCO certification scheme to focus more on building demand and enabling
      services rather than seeking to regulate the market or promote only certain business
      models
    	Revise and create model EE project documents—from sample ESPCs and ESCO bidding
      documents to measurement and verification (M&V) protocols
•	 Finance
    	Institutionalize commercial bank lending for EE
    	Foster new financing schemes (cash flow–based, ESCO, leasing)
    	Introduce sustainable public sector, including municipal, EE financing schemes
    	Support development and scale-up of residential EE credit schemes
With respect to institutional structure, the World Bank recommended three key areas:
    1.	 Reform the GDRE so that it becomes a dedicated, accountable and visible EE entity with
        primary responsibility for EE program implementation
    2.	 Develop clear functions for market analysis, program design, implementation, evaluation,
        monitoring, etc., all of which feed back into program redesign to improve implementation
        effectiveness
    3.	 Enhance consultations with the private sector
Considering the importance of EE to the nation, the government decided that it was necessary
to examine options for developing a new institutional framework to maximize implementation
effectiveness and ensure the sustainability of EE policies and programs.

Objectives
Based on the above recommendations, an EE institutional review7 was undertaken in consultation
with the Turkish government. The principal objective was to improve the government’s ability to
manage EE policies and programs and thus contribute to meeting national EE targets. Specifically,
the review was designed to:
•	 Build on the global experience documented in An Analytical Compendium of Institutional
   Frameworks for Energy Efficiency Implementation (ESMAP 2008) and similar reports;8
•	 Develop case studies of five selected EE agencies representing different institutional
   structures;
•	 Conduct an assessment of the current Turkish EE institutional set-up;
•	 Survey the private sector (banks, ESCOs, equipment suppliers, etc.) and government agencies
   on policy issues, market challenges, barriers, and workable solutions to effectively implement
   EE;
•	 Explore sustainable financing mechanisms for EE markets currently not served or underserved
   by traditional financing institutions; and
•	 Identify institutional options for strengthening the government’s capacity to implement EE
   policies and programs.


7	 For the purposes of this review, EE was limited to demand-side EE only, since supply-side EE regulation and implementation is already underway with
   the regulatory agency, EMRA, and the utility sector. EE in transportation in the review was limited to vehicle standards, as other measures such as
   integrated land-use planning and modal shifts to public transportation are typically done through municipal planning and not EE agencies.
8	 These reports include IEA 2010 and World Bank 2011b.

     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




     Methodology and Approach
     The review consisted of the following tasks:
         1.	 Review and document the current policy and institutional framework.
         2.	 Conduct interviews with government and private sector stakeholders to obtain their views
             on the effectiveness of existing institutional arrangements, weaknesses and limitations,
             and options to remedy them.
         3.	 Document the current functions and responsibilities of various government agencies,
             analyze the current set-ups, and identify key gaps by sector and functional area.
         4.	 Review international experience with EE institutional set-ups, building upon previous
             studies and reports, with emphasis on countries that have been successful in delivering
             large-scale EE programs; then identify a range of institutional models and define their key
             characteristics, strengths and limitations.
         5.	 Summarize international good practices, conduct case studies of five EE agencies
             representing different institutional frameworks, assess how these have addressed
             some of the gaps identified in the Turkish institutional set-up, and identify a portfolio of
             institutional options to address these gaps and deficiencies.
         6.	 Conduct a stakeholder workshop to present the institutional gaps and deficiencies,
             summarize international experiences, present options and propose recommendations,
             and invite practitioners from the case study countries to share their experiences.
         7.	 Define a set of recommendations and institutional options that Turkey should consider for
             a revised EE institutional framework.

Introduction
This section summarizes the existing institutional framework for EE in Turkey, including:
•	 Key legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives related to EE
•	 Identification of key responsible agencies and their roles
   •	 Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and its General Directorate for
       Renewable Energy (GDRE)
   •	 Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU)
   •	 Ministry of Science, Industry and Trade (MoSIT)
   •	 Other government agencies
Key Legislative, Regulatory and Policy Initiatives
The most important piece of legislation is the Energy Efficiency Law (Law No. 5627) enacted in
May 2007.9 This Law, implemented by MENR, has been complemented by dozens of regulations
and communiqués.
A second important piece of legislation is the Law related to the Preparation and Implementation
of Technical Legislation of Products (Law No. 4703), enacted in June 2001.10 This Law, managed
by MoSIT, relates to EE since it governs household appliance labeling. In 2010, the Regulation
on the Eco Design of Energy Related Products11 was adopted in accordance with EU Directive
2009/125/EC and 11 other directives released later. In 2011, the Regulation on Indication by
Labeling and Standard Product Information of the consumption of energy and other resources
by energy related products12 was adopted according to EU Directive 2010/30/EU and four later
directives related to products.
In 2008 the Regulation on Energy Performance in Buildings, under MoEU, was adopted. Among
other things, it requires each new building to have an energy certificate specifying its energy
performance level.
In 2012 the High Planning Council approved the Energy Efficiency Strategy Paper,13 which calls
for energy intensity reduction of at least 10 percent for each subsector within 10 years, based on
2011 consumption levels.
The Energy Efficiency Development Program is included in Section 1.14 of the 10th Development
Plan (2014–18),14 which was approved in 2013. This Program includes performance indicators
such as (a) a reduction in primary energy intensity from 0.265 toe/US$1000 in 2011 to 0.246
in 2018 and (b) a 10 percent reduction in the energy usage of government buildings by 2018
compared to 2012.15 In November 2014 the government issued an Action Plan for the Program
for Improving Energy Efficiency under its 10th Development Plan that calls for, among other
things, improving the administrative and institutional capacity for EE.
Figure 2-1 shows the major legislation related to EE.

      in international dollars, using purchasing power parity rates based on the 2005 International Comparison Program (ICP) round. This method makes
      it possible to compare the output of economies and the welfare of their inhabitants in real terms.

     Major Agencies with EE Responsibilities
     The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR)
     MENR was first established in 1963 by Presidential order and subsequently codified by Law 3154,
     enacted in 1985. MENR’s legal mandate is
           to help define targets and policies related to energy and natural resources in a way that
           serves and guarantees the defense of the country, security, welfare, and strengthening of
           our national economy; and to ensure that energy and natural resources are researched,
           developed, generated and consumed in a way that is compatible with said targets and
           policies.16
     The General Directorate of Energy Affairs (GDEA) is the main policy body within MENR and is
     responsible for coordinating and supporting energy policy to ensure energy security, including
     natural gas, renewable energy (RE), and EE.

     General Directorate of Renewable Energy (GDRE)
     From its creation in 1981 until its closure in 2011, the General Directorate of the Electrical
     Power Resources Survey and Development Administration (EIE), an agency under MENR’s
     administration, was responsible for researching and promoting EE and RE. EIE’s main mission was
     to promote rational energy use and increase the demand for EE through concerted, integrated
     collaboration with related institutions. EIE carried out EE studies in end-user sectors, conducted
     energy audits in energy-intensive industries, and organized and conducted training, public
     awareness campaigns, and studies on policy and legislation.

In November 2011 the government issued a decree17 closing EIE and creating a new generate
directorate within MENR: the General Directorate for Renewable Energy (GDRE). Since the EE
Law refers to EIE rather than GDRE, the latter’s legal functions in terms of energy efficiency are
limited; however, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources has assigned EE functions to
GDRE through a Ministerial Decision. The EIE’s former EE functions are now contained within the
EE Department, one of five GDRE departments (Figure 2-2). GDRE maintains overall responsibility
for the EE Law, monitoring of compliance with various legal end-user obligations, collection and
analysis of energy consumption data, and implementing incentive and information and other
supporting programs.

MoSIT – Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Branch
The EE Law also assigns responsibilities related to the industrial sector and manufacturing to
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, now the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology
(MoSIT). The organization chart of MoSIT is provided in Figure 2-3.

     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




     MoSIT prepares sectoral strategy papers which refer to EE but typically do not include policy
     elements within them. Under this Ministry, the Environment, Climate Change, and Energy
     Efficiency Branch under the General Directorate of Industry (GDI), is responsible for the impacts
     of industrial policy on the environment, EE and climate change. GDI develops and implements
     secondary legislation on industrial energy use and equipment manufacturing (including eco-
     design and eco-labeling of appliances), develops and enforces technical standards for common
     industrial equipment, and coordinates testing protocols and verification of product compliance
     with the Turkish Standards Institute (TSE). Under Article 10.9 of the EE Law, MoSIT is assigned to
     enforce industry standards for consumer products.
     TSE currently operates a testing facility for electrical appliances such as refrigerators, lights,
     electric ovens, and televisions, and has plans to upgrade its laboratory testing capabilities to
     include additional appliances such as air conditioners and white goods. No facilities exist in the
     country for testing industrial equipment, such as electric motors.

     MoEU – Energy Efficiency Department
     The EE Law and Regulation on Energy Performance in Buildings also assigns certain
     responsibilities to the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, now the Ministry of Environment
     and Urbanization (MoEU). The organization chart of the Directorate of Professional Services is
     provided in Figure 2-4.
     The Energy Efficiency Department (EED), under the General Directorate of Professional Services,
     has been delegated responsibility for implementing the building EE policies. This Department’s
     functions cover residential and commercial buildings in accordance with the EE Law and
     Regulation on Energy Performance in Buildings, focusing on the development and enforcement
     of building codes and certificates for new and renovated buildings, standards for construction
     materials, training for design and construction firms, certification of companies to certify building
     performance levels, and conducts some outreach efforts on policy compliance.

Energy Efficiency Coordination Board
The EE Law also mandated the establishment of a central body—the Energy Efficiency
Coordination Board (EECB)—comprising high-level representatives from all ministries related
to EE, along with some industrial associations.18 The EECB’s main functions are to (a) prepare
national EE strategies, plans and programs, assess their effectiveness, and revise/implement
as necessary, (b) steer EE studies and approve authorization of certificates for EE service, (c)
approve EE projects eligible for government incentive schemes and monitor results, (d) establish
ad hoc commissions as needed, (e) set meeting agendas and participants for advisory committee
meetings, and (f) establish and publish fees for certificates each year.
As specified in the EE Law, the EECB meets four times in a year, although additional sessions
can be called. The Deputy Undersecretary of MENR chairs the Board, and GDRE serves as the
Board’s Secretary. The meeting minutes are documented. The quorum for each meeting is a
two-thirds majority and resolutions are passed by the majority of those present.19

Summary Timeline of Major Institutional Changes
A summary of the timeline for some of the important institutional changes related to EE is
presented in Figure 2-5.

          3. Stakeholder Interviews and Functional Review

Framework for Documenting Functions and Responsibilities
The report team developed a framework to document the existing institutional functions and
responsibilities of various government and private sector organizations in EE-related activities.
Based on international experience, this framework defined the major areas of functions and
responsibilities in the following categories:
   •	 Policy
      	Formulation
      	Implementation
      	Enforcement
   •	 Data and Information
      	Data collection
      	Reports and publications
      	Dissemination
   •	 Incentives and Implementation Support
      	Grants and financial incentives
      	Training and capacity building
      	Guidebooks, tools, templates, etc.
      	Stakeholder consultations
   •	 Monitoring and Evaluation
      	Targets
      	Measurement and verification
      	Evaluation
To characterize the EE functions and responsibilities for each of the above function areas, the
following market segments were defined:
    •	 Industry
       	Banks
       	ESCOs
       	Equipment suppliers
    •	 Public sector
    •	 Residential sector
    •	 Commercial buildings

Stakeholder Interviews
Process
The stakeholder interviews were designed to obtain information on the various EE-related
institutional functions and responsibilities in order to identify any existing gaps and deficiencies.
Questionnaires covered specific institutional goals and functions; programs; target indicators and
evaluation methodologies; mechanisms for coordination and information sharing; perceptions
on strengths and areas for improvement; possible gaps and/or overlaps; and areas/sectors
for new programming. Two separate Interview Guides were prepared, one for government
agencies and one for private organizations (see Appendix A). The team interviewed 32 people:

     20 representatives from government agencies and 12 from private sector organizations (six
     associations, three ESCOs, and three banks).
     Interview Findings
     While the main purpose of the interviews was to document the functions of each agency and
     identify potential gaps, they also provided some general indications and perceptions about the
     state of the institutional set-up. Responses to select questions are summarized in Table 3-1. In
     general, the private sector representatives interviewed were more critical of the institutional
     set-up than were the government officials.

     Functions and Responsibilities Matrix
     The interviews, along with the review of existing policies and regulations, also helped to complete
     a Functions and Responsibilities Matrix. The purpose of this matrix was to identify and document
     current responsibilities as formally mandated, gaps in relation to international best practices,
     and perceived overlaps and gaps as indicated by various interviewees. The matrix is presented
     in four tables as follows:
          •	   Table 3-2: Policy
          •	   Table 3-3: Information
          •	   Table 3-4: Support
          •	   Table 3-5: Monitoring and Evaluation
     The color coding in the Matrix indicates the following:
          •	 Items in black represent the facts based on existing legislation that addresses current
             functional requirements and obligations;
          •	 Items in red indicate confirmed gaps in institutional functions; and
          •	 Items in green are opinions from the interviewees, areas where there appears to be some
             confusion, or areas of perceived overlap.20

Summary of Findings
While the Functions and Responsibilities Matrix offers a wealth of detail on institutional functions
and gaps, it also offers some more general indications about where the institutional set-up is
sufficient, where enhancements are needed, and what functions remain to be developed and
assigned. This section will present some of these main findings in two ways: (a) by functional
category and (b) by market segment.

By Functional Category
Policy Framework

•	 The policy framework related to EE is reasonably strong and is based on international good
   practice. The EE Law and subsequent regulations cover all key energy-using sectors, with
   relatively clear institutional mandates, roles and responsibilities, targets and implementation
   mechanisms, incentives and penalties, and pricing.

•	 With the closure of EIE, the EE Law needs to be revised and updated, with responsibilities
   formally assigned to EIE reassigned to specific ministry departments and institutions, including
   GDRE. Although the current assigning of EE functions to GDRE was done through an MENR
   Ministerial Decision, this may not provide a solid legal basis because changes could be made
   over time as political appointments change.

•	 Ministerial responsibilities are clearly delineated in term of policy formulation and
   enforcement, but the development and implementation of supporting programs are not.
   This has created some institutional overlaps/competition in EE programming. A separate
   EE agency could better allow ministries to delegate certain supporting functions to it, thus
   effectively serving as the main implementing arm of the government.

•	 Additionally, some secondary legislation is still needed to complete the planned policy
   framework and to focus greater attention on the systematic enforcement of existing
   policies and regulations. Some of these revisions are updates to existing regulations (e.g.,
   administration of municipal street lighting), some are adjustments to regulations in other
   areas to accommodate EE (e.g., public budgeting and procurement rules to encourage EE),
   and some relate to new mechanisms for further development (e.g., ESCO contracting and
   accounting). Not all of these revisions have been assigned to specific institutions.21

Data and Information

•	 In general, the institutional roles for data collection and information dissemination are in
   place. GDRE has primary responsibility to collect energy consumption information for large
   users and develop and maintain databases for such information.

•	 There is a need to strengthen GDRE’s ability to enforce reporting, clean and analyze data,
   develop benchmarking and sectoral analysis functions, carry out periodic sector market
   studies, and disseminate periodic reports for public use.

•	 There is also a need to develop systems to collect information on implementation experiences—
   case studies, financing modalities, sample contracting schemes, and so on—in order to
   replicate successes and develop programs to further support financing and implementation.


21	 There is also a National EE Action Plan under development by MENR, supported by EBRD, which is expected to be available in 2015.

     •	 Information campaigns have been successfully implemented but appear to have lapsed
        occasionally. Most campaigns appear to have focused on broad public awareness;
        informational programs targeting specific sectors are primarily done through workshops. No
        evaluations of these campaigns appear to have been undertaken.
     Incentives and Implementation Support
     •	 A number of incentive schemes and technical assistance (TA) programs have been developed
        and are operational. Not all program planning and implementation functions—market
        studies, program design, implementation plans, monitoring and reporting, evaluation,
        redesign of programs, and so on—have been formalized. Thus while many programs have
        had good participation rates and provided valuable impacts, the lack of systematic planning,
        monitoring and evaluation limits the ability to determine the impacts, effectiveness or cost-
        efficiency of the programs.
     •	 Most incentive schemes target larger, industrial consumers. While funding has been
        consistently allocated, funds have not always been fully utilized. It appears that the process
        could be more streamlined and incentives more targeted. There are no incentive programs
        specifically targeting public facilities, commercial buildings or the residential sector, or for
        new mechanisms such as ESCOs.
     •	 While there are a number of TA initiatives across the institutions, most appear to be ad hoc
        in nature, many are funded by donors, and most programs tend to phase out after a few
        years. There are no functional EE information centers, websites, or other means of providing
        comprehensive technical, financial, and implementation information to end users.
     •	 Certification schemes are in place and many appear to be working well. The ESCO certification
        system needs to be revised, however, given the lack of ESCO activity and need to encourage
        more innovation in business models.
     Monitoring and Evaluation
     •	 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions have yet to be fully developed and made
        operational. Some M&E functions are planned, or have been assigned in policies, but no
        formal evaluation reports were identified. Formalizing these functions and operationalizing
        them remains a critical need, and would allow the focus to shift from outputs (workshops and
        energy audits, for example) to outcomes (such as investment volume and energy savings).
     •	 Targets do exist at the national level, but limited analysis has been done on the reasonableness
        of the targets, implementation costs, sources of financing, and so forth. There are no sector
        or subsector targets to determine the relative priority or energy savings potential across
        them. Nor does there appear to be an adopted methodology for determining how progress
        towards the national targets would be measured and at what intervals it would be reported.
     •	 At the program level, there are no clear evaluation methodologies or plans to determine their
        impacts or efficacy (these are referred to as impact and process evaluations). Such evaluation
        plans can help identify program objectives and goals, then develop indicators and methods
        to determine if and when the program has met them. This can help agencies determine when
        a program is no longer needed or when a program needs to be redesigned to improve its
        impacts and effectiveness.
     •	 At the investment or project level, measurement and verification (M&V) protocols are not
        yet developed or adopted. While some draft M&V guidelines exist, they do not appear to be
        widely understood or applied.

By Market Segment
Industrial Sector
•	 Large industries have clear policy mandates under the EE Law (in areas such as reporting
   energy use, appointing energy managers, and completing energy audits) and are able to
   access commercial financing through typical corporate lending. However, there is a lack of
   systematic subsector data analysis and benchmarking which would allow the government
   to identify high and low performers. Enforcement of industrial EE mandates, including
   assessment of the quality of compliance, needs to be strengthened.
•	 SMEs have moderate access to financing. While state-owned banks have been encouraged
   to and provide credit to SMEs, there is a need to develop additional financing and delivery
   models for EE, such as simple vendor leasing and ESCO schemes, to help SMEs that have less
   access to traditional commercial credit and thereby accelerate EE investments.
Public Sector
•	 Public agencies have some policy mandates and TA programs, but there is no national level
   program to provide regulatory incentives, policy adjustments, financing and TA to fully serve
   this sector. Policy adjustments are needed to modify existing policies and regulations that
   create procedural barriers for public entities to implement EE improvements (such as public
   budgeting, procurement and borrowing). Enforcement of EE mandates for public entities also
   needs to be strengthened.
•	 A key gap is access to financing for both central and municipal entities. International experience
   suggests that a dedicated, quasi-public financing scheme (such as an EE Fund) may be needed
   for public sector EE projects until municipal credit markets are further developed.
•	 There is a need for improved subsector data analysis and benchmarking that would allow
   identification of high and low performers across a range of subsectors—such as public
   buildings, street lighting, municipal water pumping, and public transportation.
•	 One particular area, raised by several interviewees, concerns municipal street lighting. Since
   the government is developing a transition plan to transfer ownership and operation of street
   lighting systems beyond 2015, there is an urgent need for greater clarity on the transition plan
   and for the development of appropriate options for street lighting upgrades and financing.
Residential Sector
•	 The government has relatively strong programs for efficient appliances, through national
   standards and labeling, public awareness campaigns and a developed retail credit market.
   Better public data is needed, however, to track market shares of efficient appliances and
   development of programs for low-income consumers.
•	 Renovation of homes to reduce heating and cooling use is less developed, particularly for
   multifamily apartment buildings. While some building material standards exist, there is a
   need to develop programs to work with existing apartment management cooperatives and
   homeowner associations (HOAs)22 to help retrofit their buildings by improving access to
   appropriate financing, introducing incentives, and providing TA.


22	 For multifamily apartment buildings, working with HOAs, apartment cooperative management, and so on is necessary for two reasons: (a) to
    clarify decision-making authority so that a simple majority (i.e., 51 percent) of homeowners are able to make an investment decision regarding
    EE renovations for the entire building, rather than requiring agreement by everyone, or 100 percent, before a project can go forward; and (b) to
    allow HOAs to legally borrow funds, sign contracts, etc. for EE improvements on behalf of individual homeowners. Without such provisions, it is
    extremely difficult for building-wide EE renovations (such as insulation of walls, floors, roofs, and common spaces) to be upgraded.

4. International Review of EE Institutional Frameworks
The report team conducted an international review of EE institutional frameworks in order to:
•	 Identify and review established institutional models in developed and developing countries
   for effectively promoting investments in demand-side EE;
•	 Emphasize frameworks that enable end-users, utilities and energy service providers, the
   private sector, the financial sector, and market intermediaries (such as ESCOs) to play an
   effective role in scaling up EE investments;
•	 Conduct case studies of EE agencies in five countries representing a range of institutional
   models; and
•	 Assess key characteristics and good practices of effective institutional frameworks to identify
   a portfolio of institutional options for EE in Turkey.

Review of Prior Research
Institutional frameworks represent the organizational structures and related instruments that
facilitate the development of enabling mechanisms (such as laws or decrees), the formulation of
government strategies and policies, the design and development of programs, the implementation
and financing of the programs, and the monitoring and evaluation of results. These frameworks
also include mobilization of private sector activities and cooperation with international
development agencies. Most countries have recognized that the design and deployment of
successful EE implementation programs requires that the institutional framework be capable
of helping to achieve the desired national EE goals and targets in consultation with the major
stakeholders, consistent with local market and economic conditions. Because the institutional
framework provides the basis for interventions designed to overcome market, economic, and
technical barriers, it needs to reflect the unique economic, market, technical, governmental, and
political characteristics and capacities of the country.
A number of prior studies that have reviewed institutional frameworks for EE implementation
across different countries. For this report the team reviewed three of the most important:
1.	 The review of EE institutional frameworks conducted by the World Bank’s ESMAP program
    in 2008, entitled An Analytical Compendium of Institutional Frameworks for Energy
    Efficiency Implementation (ESMAP 2008). The report reviewed 27 country EE institutional
    set-ups, developed a compendium of institutional structures, and provided guidelines for
    implementing institutions. The report identifies, analyzes, categorizes, and describes the
    main success factors of EE institutional models and practices in the main end-use sectors:
    industry, buildings, and residential.
2.	 The International Energy Agency’s 2010 Energy Efficiency Governance report, which includes
    an assessment of international enabling frameworks, institutional arrangements, functions,
    and coordination mechanisms (IEA 2010). The report identified a range of organizational
    types, from departments within energy ministries to state-owned companies and non-
    governmental organizations (NGOs), and highlighted several principles for configuring EE
    implementing agencies.
3.	 A 2011 World Bank report on institutional governance, Enhancing Institutional Governance
    for Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Implementation in Developing Countries, which focused on
    legislative frameworks, funding mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and coordination
    mechanisms to support the implementation of EE strategies (World Bank 2011b).

     The following discussion presents some of the findings from these studies.

     The Seven Basic Institutional Models
     The ESMAP institutional review identified and reviewed EE agencies spanning 27 developed and
     developing countries and varying in age from 2 to 30 years. Under the review, seven distinct
     institutional models were identified (Table 4-1).
     These models represent a range of different structures, from a national energy agency (with
     broad-based responsibilities that include EE) to independent EE agencies to public-private
     partnerships (PPPs). Whereas the older EE agencies, established during the 1990s, were mainly
     broad-based national energy agencies, in more recent years specialized agencies focused on EE
     and related clean energy investments were found to be more common. Several implementing
     institutions established in the last decade have been independent statutory authorities or
     government-owned corporations. The ESMAP study also found a few PPPs and NGOs serving in
     this institutional role.
     As with all institutional models, each has a distinct set of advantages and limitations (Table
     4-2). For example, while public agencies covering all energy issues may have greater influence
     and resources, competing demands and priorities may affect EE issues. On the other hand,
     independent agencies may have greater autonomy in carrying out their day-to-day operations,
     but their budget allocations and political support may be subject to greater variability if they are
     not mainstreamed within the political set-up. This combination of advantages and disadvantages
     for each model drives home the importance of carefully designing the institution to maximize
     inherent advantages while managing limitations.

     The three reports also provided guidance regarding the typical functions of EE agencies, the
     characteristics of good governance, and key success factors and core competencies. Table 4-3
     illustrates the typical functions of EE institutions, which include general administration; program
     development, planning and budgeting; program administration and management; program

Based largely on the ESMAP report, key success factors and core competencies for an EE agency
were determined to be the following:
•	 Independence, autonomy, and flexibility in decision making and adequate resources,
   including staff and funding
•	 Dedicated to EE, visible to all stakeholders, and accountable for its actions and results
•	 Earmarked, long-term funding source to ensure stable and predictable funding levels23
•	 Capable of engaging, working and influencing a wide range of stakeholders, including public
   and private agencies/organizations with EE responsibilities, regulators, utilities, and banks
•	 Capacity to leverage private-sector participation in EE implementation and cooperate with
   EE equipment and service providers
•	 Credible systems for monitoring and evaluation its programs and activities
•	 Strong management and leadership and high caliber staff, with proper performance
   incentives to achieve institutional goals

International Good Practices
The international review also identified good practices in terms of EE policies and programs for
EE agencies in key energy-using sectors—industrial, public and residential facilities—based on
four functional areas: (a) policy and regulations, (b) financing and incentives, (c) information and
awareness, and (d) training and capacity building. The review also looked at the subsectors or
functional areas identified in Section 3 as needing to be further strengthened: ESCO development,
program formulation and implementation, and M&E. The main elements of these good practices
are summarized below.
Industrial Sector
For the industrial sector, some of the good practices related to the four functional areas defined
above are illustrated in Table 4-5.

23	 While some countries rely on annual government budget allocations for EE agency and program funding, other countries have created automatic
    funding mechanisms from various revenue sources—such as annual government budget allocations, energy or environmental taxes, state or munici-
    pal bonds, revenues from privatizations, and IFI/donor funds—to ensure that EE funding does not vary with different government administrations.

     Although policies have been significantly mainstreamed across countries, full implementation
     and enforcement has been more piecemeal. Only a handful of governments have had the political
     resolve to actually shut down underperforming factories, levy major fines, or imprison owners
     for not complying with regulatory mandates. Access to quality information about subsector
     benchmarks, best practices, EE technologies, and so on has been a more common approach to
     engaging industry.
     With respect to financing industrial sector EE projects, some of the main mechanisms used to
     date include:
     •	 Establishing credit lines with commercial banks;
     •	 Credit or risk guarantee programs for small and medium enterprises (SMEs);
     •	 Vendor credit and leasing programs; and
     •	 Facilitating and promoting ESCOs, energy service providers (ESPs) and energy savings
        performance contracts (ESPCs).
     Strong monitoring of EE market barriers and successes, sharing of emerging good practices, and
     proactively addressing market failures can be critical to ensure a strong industrial EE program.
     Public Sector
     With respect to the public sector, including central and municipal facilities, the corresponding
     good practices related to the four functional areas are presented in Table 4-6.

Unlike the private sector, which responds to price signals and incentives, motivating the public
sector is more complex. Typically a greater focus on policy is needed, but with supporting
programs to make it easier and less risky for public officials to carryout EE improvements. An
important element of successful programs is the adjustment of public procurement regulations
and procedures to focus on (a) life-cycle costs, rather than the lowest upfront cost; and (b)
budgeting, so public agencies are not subject to reductions in their budget provisions if they are
able to lower their energy bills.
With respect to financing options, international experience demonstrates that, despite large
EE potentials and attractive payback periods, EE financing is hindered by a number of market
failures, such as (a) a limited number of creditworthy public agencies and municipalities; (b)
low or limited borrowing capacity; (c) small project sizes, leading to high transaction costs; (d)
limited budget and technical capacity to prepare high-quality EE project proposals; and (e) high
perceived risks, leading to behavioral inertia.
The experience of the World Bank and other international financial institutions (IFIs) indicates
that a number of financing options exist that may allow public facilities to address some of
these barriers. In Turkey, this “financing ladder”—which starts with public grants and ends with
advanced commercial financing—can help guide policymakers to select one or more options
that can then be designed to provide accessible financing products. As Figure 4-1 shows, while
commercial financing may be the long-term goal, some public financing mechanisms may be
necessary in the near-to-medium term to help public entities and municipalities transition to
more commercial schemes.
Of course, this ladder is only meant as an illustrative guide to assist with selection. Not all
mechanisms are mutually exclusive and governments need not move up every step of the ladder.
The selection of appropriate mechanisms—and their subsequent design—need to be based on a
number of factors, including (a) current legislative and regulatory conditions, (b) the maturity of
financial and public credit markets, (c) the current state of the local EE service markets, and (d)
the technical and financial capabilities of the public entities undertaking the EE projects.

     Residential Sector
     The residential sector also faces a number of barriers hindering financing of EE investments
     (World Bank 2014a). The key barriers in many countries are (a) small project size and relatively
     high transaction costs, (b) subsidized energy tariffs, (c) perception of high risk on the part of
     commercial banks, (d) issues with decision-making processes and creditworthiness in multi-
     family buildings, (e) relatively high commercial bank interest rates, and (f) high discount rates
     (or hurdle rates) on the part of residential consumers. Residential sector good practices are
     illustrated in Table 4-7.
     Appliance standards and labeling generally have the greatest impacts in this sector, since they
     can influence mass purchasing decisions. Public awareness can help to educate consumers about
     EE options so they are able to make informed decisions. However, since the residential market
     is diverse and heterogeneous, finding effective delivery mechanisms for EE programs, including
     incentives and financing, is a challenge. As a result, it is becoming more common to enlist energy
     utilities in the delivery of EE programs given their extensive reach and existing relationships with
     consumers.
     Because consumers tend to require very quick payback periods before they are willing to make
     an investment, incentive schemes can be a critically important mechanism. Often this means
     creating a dedicated funding mechanism, such as an energy or environmental tax, which
     automatically goes to fund such incentive schemes on a sustainable basis. However, these
     incentives need to be administered efficiently, transparently and equitably.
     International experience points to four main financing options to support EE improvements in
     residential buildings: (a) EE revolving funds, (b) credit lines with commercial bank financing, (c)
     partial credit or risk guarantees, and (d) utility EE obligations. Table 4-8 illustrates these options.
     As with the other sectors, the selection, design features, and products offered under each of the
     four options needs to be tailored to the specific country conditions.

Fostering the Development of Energy Services Markets
Energy service companies (ESCOs) and energy service providers (ESPs) can be effective models
to mobilize private sector financing, risk sharing and expertise for EE in all sectors. While
governments can take actions to facilitate this, international experience shows such actions
require a long-term commitment and are very complex. Focusing on simpler business models
first, and focusing on ESCOs as service providers only (rather than financing), have been shown
to be critical elements of an effective strategy.
Governments can encourage the establishment and growth of ESCO industries by undertaking
a set of legislative, regulatory, and policy initiatives targeted at (a) creating a large and stable
demand for ESCO projects in the public sector; (b) removing barriers to public procurement
of EE services and establishing clear regulations, rules, and procedures for public agencies to
work with ESCOs; and (c) facilitating adequate and affordable financing for ESCO projects (Figure
4-2). As these markets are catalyzed and the ESCO industry further developed, such models can
be extended to private industry and commercial buildings. By then, these companies will have
well-developed business models, proven track records, refined M&V processes, and stronger
financial positions to be better able to access commercial financing.
Program Formulation and Implementation
Due to prevailing market barriers, low awareness and technical capacity, behavioral biases, etc.
governments also need to develop supporting programs in addition to policy measures to help
end users overcome these barriers and implement EE measures. Such programs can take on a
wide range of functions including providing information, special access to financing, incentives
and subsidies, tools and guides, and training.

     Ideally, such programming should be done not in an ad hoc manner but systematically based
     on market studies, with program plans that have clear objectives, measureable indicators, and
     defined exit strategies. These plans should be subject to broad consultations with stakeholders
     including potential program participants, service providers, and financiers. Additionally,
     international experience provides the following lessons:
     •	 Policies need to be translated into effective programs.
     •	 Key steps in program design and implementation include:
         	Collection of relevant market data to determine EE potential and prevailing policy and
           market deficiencies;
         	Analysis and synthesis of data to determine program goals and expected impacts;
         	Development of program strategies and designs;
         	Identification of target markets;
         	Development of implementation strategy and plan, with broad consultations;
         	Engagement with implementing agents; and
         	Monitoring and evaluation of program results.
     •	 Program staff need to (a) learn from results to improve program designs and (b) phase out
        programs that have either achieved their goals or proven ineffective.

Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a critical function that enables an EE agency both to be
effective and to demonstrate its impact in order to maintain political support and funding levels.
Monitoring is the process of routinely gathering information on all aspects of the implementation
of the EE agency’s programs and activities. Monitoring measures the quality and effect of the
implementation process and procedures. The agency needs to prepare periodic performance
reports, including annual reports to the government, boards and other stakeholders. These
reports typically define specific reporting periods and performance indicators.

Evaluation aims to determine whether project objectives set in terms of expected outputs,
outcomes, and impact are being or will be met. Evaluation is an important part of good
institutional governance and is needed to test planning assumptions, monitor and report overall
results, compare program performance, fine-tune implementation processes, and incorporate
lessons learned into the agency’s future operations. In order to determine program impacts, EE
agencies must have sufficient market data to develop credible market baselines. Programs with
solid analytical underpinnings and clear and focused objectives are much easier to evaluate.

International experience indicates that, although formal and comprehensive M&E is good practice,
only a few EE agencies actually use it routinely. However, several recent policy innovations, such
as energy supplier or EE obligations (EEOs) in the EU, are now requiring proper measurement,
indicators and evaluations to demonstrate EE impacts as part of policy compliance monitoring.

Key elements of a good M&E program include the following:
•	 Setting targets based on sound data collection and analysis
•	 Developing and implementing monitoring and tracking systems
•	 Developing evaluation methods and tools
•	 Development of measurement and verification (M&V) protocols
•	 Evaluating program impacts/results against targets

     •	   Asking both “Are we doing the right things?” and “Are we doing the things right?”
     •	   Feeding back evaluation results to redesign or refocus programs
     •	   Establishing internal evaluation groups to conduct program evaluations
     •	   Engaging independent evaluation entities to evaluate agency performance and results
          achieved.

     Case Studies
     In addition to the international review, five case studies were selected for detailed analysis.
     These case studies represent EE agencies with different institutional frameworks, as shown in
     Table 4-9. A brief description of each agency is provided below. Additional details are provided
     in Appendix B.
     The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a statutory body within India’s Ministry of Power. In 2001
     the Indian Parliament enacted the Energy Conservation Act, which came into force in March
     2002. The Act established BEE as the key agency to assist in developing policies and programs
     that rely on market mechanisms and self-regulation to reduce the energy intensity of the Indian
     economy and promote EE and conservation.
     The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Agence de l’Environnement et de
     la Maîtrise de l’Energie, or ADEME) was established in 1992 by merging three environmental
     agencies created in the 1980s: the French Energy Management Agency (Agence Française pour
     la Maîtrise de L’énergie), the Energy Saving Agency (Agence pour les Economies D’énergie), and
     the Air Quality Agency (Agence pour la Qualité de l’Air).24 This merger allowed the agencies to
     pool their talents and resources and to approach environmental and energy problems using a
     broader, interdisciplinary framework. The ADEME talent pool today consists of more than 1,000
     staff at three central offices in Angers, Paris, and Valbonne; 26 regional branches across France;
     three offices in France’s overseas territories; and one office in Brussels.
     The Energy Saving Trust (EST), formed in 1992 after the Rio Earth Summit, is a non-profit
     organization with a charitable foundation aimed at promoting sustainable use of energy. The
     organization is mostly funded by the British government (including the Department of Energy
     and Climate Change, the Department for Transport, the Department for Trade and Industry, and
     the Scottish Executive) and also receives some funding from the private sector.
     The Korea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO) is a public organization responsible for
     the implementation of EE, new and RE deployment, and climate change mitigation policies and
     measures. It was established in 1980 by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy under
     the “Rational Energy Utilization Act.” Its primary function is nation-wide energy management
     by providing services that vary from technical and financial support to administrative services,

How Have the Case Study Agencies Addressed the Gaps?
Section 3 listed a number of important gaps identified by assessing Turkey’s institutional
framework on the basis of stakeholder interviews. These gaps included the following areas:
•	    Public sector EE financing and implementation
•	    Residential sector EE financing and implementation
•	    Development of guidebooks, tools, templates, etc.
•	    Monitoring and evaluation
•	    Development and promotion of ESCOs
Tables 4-10 through 4-12 summarize the ways in which the agencies in the case study countries
addressed some of these areas.

                                                        International Review of EE Institutional Frameworks




Summary of Lessons Learned
The following is a summary of the lessons learned from the international review of EE institutional
frameworks and programming:
•	 There is a wide range of institutional structures, even though national EE objectives and
   market barriers are generally similar across countries. Each model has its own characteristics,
   along with strengths and weaknesses.
•	 However, despite these institutional differences, there are several common attributes
   of successful EE agencies. The agencies tend to be autonomous and flexible, visible and
   accountable, properly staffed and resourced, and collaborative across a variety of stakeholders.
•	 EE agency functions are generally similar across countries and models, dealing with
   market studies, data collection and analysis, program planning and formulation, program
   implementation and administration, program evaluation, and reporting.
•	 There appears to be a trend away from broad-based energy agencies and toward more-
   specialized agencies with independent structures. This allows for easier decision making, staff
   retention, access to specialized skills, and program implementation.
•	 Management boards, with both public and private representation, are becoming more
   common to enable a broader range of stakeholders to influence the work program of the
   agencies. Boards also help to promote consensus-building on approaches, gain buy-in across
   organizations, and introduce greater accountability through performance reports and reviews.
•	 Dedicated funding for the EE agency needs to be assured to (a) improve predictability (thus
   facilitating private sector involvement) and (b) allow for long-term programs.
•	 Private sector input into policy formulation and program design, and participation in
   implementation, are important.
•	 Although EE agency M&E has not been systematic and well documented, many agencies
   are facing increasing pressure to be accountable for both measuring impacts and ensuring
   efficiency of use of public funds.
•	 ESCOs represent one delivery mechanism that can help serve the industrial, commercial and
   public markets, but it is neither the only one nor a “magic bullet”. ESCO development requires
   a long-term commitment and is complex. Starting with the public sector first, focusing on
   simpler business models, and fostering ESCOs as service providers rather than financiers have
   been shown to be effective approaches.
An important conclusion from the international review is that the selection of a particular
institutional structure appears to be influenced by:
•	 The urgency of the need for improved EE implementation and scale-up
•	 The legislative framework and the government’s commitment to EE
•	 Prior and existing EE policies and programs
•	 The organizational structure of energy decision making in the government
•	 Recognition of the importance of obtaining private sector input

•	 Recognition of the need for independence and flexibility in decision-making.

             5. Assessment of Turkey’s Institutional Set-up
                      and Recommendations for Enhancing
                                          Its Effectiveness

Institutional Set-Up Relative to International Good Practices
Section 3 documented the existing institutional set-up in Turkey; Section 4 summarized
international good practices. This section compares Turkey’s current institutional set-up
compares with some of these good practices.
1.	 The EE agency should (a) be independent, autonomous and flexible in decision making
    and (b) have adequate resources, including staff and funding, to carry out its functions
    and responsibilities. As long as all EE functions remain within MENR (largely under GDRE),
    the EE Department’s independence and autonomy will be limited and subject to ministerial
    bureaucracy. While staffing and funding may be adequate, there is potential for staff rotations
    to other departments and difficulties in recruiting highly specialized experts for special
    programs.
2.	 The agency should be dedicated to EE, visible to all stakeholders, and accountable for
    results. Although the existing EE Department within GDRE is dedicated to carrying out EE
    functions and responsibilities, the “EE” has been dropped from the General Directorate’s
    name, making it institutionally invisible within MENR’s organizational chart. Stakeholder
    interviews suggest GDRE has also faced some competition from other departments within
    MENR, and other ministries, on EE programming. Finally, the evaluation functions remain
    underdeveloped, preventing GDRE from reporting impacts on its programs and assessing
    their cost-effectiveness and overall efficacy—thus limiting its accountability for EE program
    results as well as its ability to demonstrate successes and justify funding levels.
3.	 The agency should have the capability to engage, collaborate with, and influence a wide
    range of stakeholders—including relevant government ministries and agencies, regulators
    and utilities, equipment and service providers, banks, and NGOs. While the EECB does include
    private sector representation in the form of industrial associations, the banking community
    and civil society are not represented. The EE Law also created an Advisory Committee so
    GDRE could consult with private sector/NGOs annually; the EE Strategy proposed measures
    to enhance the Committee’s effectiveness, but it does not appear that these changes have
    yet taken place. Stakeholder interviews indicate a need for greater interagency coordination
    at the working level. Several outreach efforts, such as Energy Efficiency Week, seek to engage
    with the private sector, but participation in such events has waned. Private sector interviewees
    requested increased dialogue on EE market challenges and proposed solutions, feedback
    mechanisms on existing EE programs, and better sharing of experiences and emerging good
    practices, all of which would enable GDRE to more effectively address current private sector
    challenges to support EE. Dialogue with banks and consumer groups, and leverage of private
    sector financing, need to be strengthened.
4.	 The agency needs strong program development, implementation and evaluation functions.
    For an agency to develop successful programs, it needs to be able to conduct market research
    and data collection, data and barrier analysis, program strategy development, program design
    and planning, implementation and administration, monitoring and evaluation, and program
    redesign based on evaluation and changes in market conditions. While GDRE and other


                                                                                                                   53
     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




         agencies have several ongoing programs—from incentive schemes to tools to information
         and training—most do not appear to be based on systematic analyses, and most lack both
         program plans with clear objective statements and ongoing monitoring using indicators and
         evaluations. Thus it is difficult to determine whether a program has met its goals, what the
         program impacts are, why some programs have lower-than-expected participation rates, and
         so on.
     5.	 The agency should have strong management and staff, with proper incentives for good
         performance. GDRE’s ability to showcase its EE-related successes is limited. Ministerial
         management and staff in general are difficult to remove for poor performance, with limited
         incentives for outstanding achievement. An independent agency regularly reporting its
         progress to a board, with management serving three-to-five–year terms (with renewals
         and modest staff bonuses subject to agency performance), could enhance institutional
         governance.
     It should also be pointed out that, while ministries around the world maintain overall
     responsibility for energy sector policies including EE, independent agencies are very often needed
     for implementing programs. The independence allows them to operate much more easily than if
     they are part of an existing ministry. They can more easily engage with relevant stakeholders, hire
     specialized consultants and firms for various programs, adjust programs as market conditions
     change, and hire specialized staff dedicated to EE. The government does not currently have an
     entity that can serve as the primary implementing arm for EE in Turkey.

     Good Governance
     In addition to the main attributes of good EE agencies, Section 4 also identified five elements
     of good governance—namely, planning, people, programs, political support, and private sector
     engagement. Table 5-1 shows how the current institutional set-up in Turkey fares relative to
     these five elements based on the stakeholder interviews.

     Key Institutional Principles for Turkey
     Turkey has done a commendable job in establishing a sound legislative and policy framework,
     creating appropriate institutions, and providing significant funding and support for EE. These
     actions have resulted in substantial EE gains and other benefits for the country. However, as its
     programs transition to the next level of maturity and complexity, additional enhancements will
     be needed.
     On the basis of the preceding assessment of Turkey’s institutions and relevant global experience,
     a number of principles are recommended for Turkey. These include:
     1.	 Turkey would substantially benefit from introducing a more visible and independent EE
         entity to serve as the country’s primary implementation arm.
     2.	 This EE entity would operate best with a management board with broad representation—
         including all relevant public agencies, the private sector, banks, academia, and civil society—
         which (a) convenes regularly to approve agency strategies, program plans, and budgets; and
         (b) receives progress and evaluation reports on agency performance to ensure accountability.
     3.	 Although each ministry—including MENR, MoEU, and MoSIT—will retain its responsibilities
         under the EE Law, the EE entity should serve as the government’s primary implementing
         arm. Ministries can temporarily assign staff to the agency to help develop new programs and
         ensure that program goals sufficiently align with policy objectives.

   Function                                Key Governance Questions, Situation in Turkey
                  •	 Are policies/strategies based on publicly available market assessments and analytical reports?
                     Policies are not always based on public studies and assessments.
                  •	 Are institutions accountable for meeting targets, enforcing policies and assessing compliance?
   Planning          Institutions are partially accountable for law compliance and enforcement, but generally not for
                     meeting targets.
                  •	 Are methodologies in place to measure progress towards objectives and targets? No, most are
                     still to be developed.
                  •	 Is there an agency dedicated to EE, with sufficient staff/resources? Yes, GDRE does have
                     adequate staff and resources. If new programs and incentive schemes are planned, additional
                     resources will be required.
                  •	 Is there a board or supervisory committee with broad representation? The EECB has broad
    People           representation, but participation by some private sector entities (e.g., equipment suppliers),
                     banks and civil society could be strengthened.
                  •	 Can the agency freely hire staff, fire people based on poor performance, pay reasonable
                     salaries, and offer long-term employment? No, GDRE is subject to MENR’s human resource
                     procedures; staff may be subject to rotation/reassignment.
             •	 Do EE programs have clear goals, plans and targets? No, most do not.
             •	 Are there requirements for periodic evaluations and adjustments? While the Law does refer to
 Programming    some requirement for evaluations, most have not yet been evaluated.
             •	 Are results reported regularly and publicly available? Few public reports on program results are
                available.
                  •	 Is EE part of broader economic development strategy? Yes, EE is referenced in the 10th
                     Development Plan.
    Political
                  •	 Are programs’ plans and results reporting at Ministers level? Yes.
    support
                  •	 Is funding for EE stable and predictable? Program funding has generally been consistent and
                     predictable.
                •	 Are private sector consultations part of policy and program formulation? Yes, private sector
                   consultations do take place.
 Private sector •	 Have they been consulted in evaluations? No, since evaluations are still under development.
                •	 Is private sector expertise/capital being sufficiently leveraged? Not enough; there is much
                   greater scope for leveraging the private sector.

4.	 The EE entity would develop and maintain all program functions—from market analysis
    to program formulation to implementation and evaluation. Programs should be based on
    (a) systematic market studies and data analysis; (b) identification of specific policy goals
    or barriers to be addressed; (c) implementation plans with clear objectives and indicators
    subject to broad consultation and available to the public; (d) strategic partnerships with the
    private sector during program implementation (including the outsourcing of highly specialized
    programs to qualified entities, possibly under performance contracts); (e) third-party
    evaluations to assess program impacts and effectiveness; and (f) mechanisms for allowing
    feedback from evaluations and market changes to inform the refinement of programs under
    implementation.
5.	 The management team should be subject to periodic agency performance reviews by the
    board, perhaps on a medium-term contract (three to five years, for example), with renewal
    contingent on satisfactory performance and achievement of agreed agency goals. The
    management team should have the flexibility to hire staff as new programs are initiated,
    to allow access of specialized, temporary skills, and to fire staff for nonperformance. Good
    performance should be recognized and, as appropriate, outstanding performance should be
    rewarded with financial incentives.

     6.	 Efforts should be made for the EE entity to urgently address currently underserved markets,
         such as the public and residential sectors. This includes conducting market assessments,
         identifying key impediments to EE investments, identifying necessary incentive and financing
         mechanisms, determining TA needs, and working with private sector and other partners to
         develop implementation and delivery strategies to serve these sectors.

     Regardless of which institutional model it may select, Turkey should adhere to the aforementioned
     key principles in order to (a) help elevate the country to best practice in terms of its overall
     institutional set-up and (b) provide a solid foundation for future policy implementation and
     programming. In terms of institutional models, there are a number of variations for how such an
     EE entity could be structured in practice, with varying degrees of government independence and
     ownership. Based on international experience, the following seven models have been identified
     as potential options for Turkey (Table 5-2). Each is briefly described below along with some
     pros and cons in italics. It should be emphasized that the options presented are proposed as a
     potential restructuring of GDRE and not the creation of a completely new entity.
     1. Dedicated General Directorate for EE within MENR
     This option involves creating a new general directorate within MENR dedicated to EE. This
     directorate would be at the same level as the current GDRE but would have the responsibility
     and authority for decision making related to all EE matters. An example of such a model is the
     Energy Efficiency Department of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam; indeed, most
     EE agencies started as units within ministries but have since become independent. While such
     a model could be the easiest to implement and help increase the organizational visibility of
     EE within MENR, it would be unlikely to provide sufficient autonomy or address such issues as
     institutional governance, flexibility, and dedicated staff. Use of this model is increasingly rare,
     and few countries have such set-ups anymore.
     2. Independent EE agency under MENR
     This model would involve the creation of an independent agency under MENR, but with a
     supervisory board consisting of public sector members. The board would have the authority to
     make certain decisions regarding policies and programs. This structure is similar to India’s BEE,
     the Russian Energy Agency (REA), Thailand’s Department of Alternative Energy Development
     and Efficiency (DEDE), Mexico’s Comisión Nacional para el Uso Eficiente de la Energía (CONUEE),
     and China’s Energy Research Institute (ERI) under the National Development and Reform
     Commission (NDRC). This option would help achieve greater independence and accountability
     (through its board), but in practice could still be subject to ministerial influence—to the detriment
     of its independence and flexibility.
     3. Independent EE agency reporting to multiple ministries
     Under this option, a new EE agency would be created jointly by MENR, MoSIT and MoEU,
     with possible coordination under the Prime Ministry. The agency would be governed by a
     management board comprising representatives from all three ministries plus other relevant
     public and private sector representatives, such as members of the current EECB. Examples of
     this structure include ADEME in France (which reports to the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable
     Development and Energy and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research) and the Austrian
     Energy Agency (reporting to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water and the
     Ministry of Science, Research and Economy). This option would help ensure that the EE agency
     serves as an implementing arm of all the relevant ministries with EE responsibilities, with greater

accountability and influence through the Prime Ministry and its Board. In practice, however, the
appointment of managers, approval of programs, and so on would still be dominated by its public
sector Board members, thus reducing some of the agency’s independence from the government.
4. Government-Owned Enterprise
This model would entail creating a new public corporation owned 100 percent by the government,
overseen by a government-appointed board. The board would consist of public sector
representatives, but may include non-shareholder private sector members. The government
would enter into a contract with the corporation for a given activity, with payments based on
clear deliverables. Examples of this option include the Republic of Korea’s KEMCO, South Africa’s
National Energy Efficiency Agency (NEEA), Finland’s Motiva, Norway’s ENOVA, and Spain’s
Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía (IDEA). Such a structure creates increased
independence and accountability and allows the corporation to earn fees for some programs
(training, certification, and conferences/expos, for example), creating increased incentives
for providing high quality and efficient services. However, the introduction of a government
corporation to provide fee-based services could detract from its role of providing a public good,
and could create a perception that a government company is seeking to compete with services
that could be provided by existing private companies.


                                                                                                                      57

     5. Independent Statutory Authority

     Under this model, an independent statutory authority would be established with a public-private
     board. While similar to an independent agency, such an authority would operate with increased
     independence from government agencies with greater power assumed by its board. Examples
     of this structure include EST in the U.K., Ireland’s Sustainable Energy Authority, the Energy
     Conservation Center of Japan (ECCJ), and Sri Lanka’s Sustainable Energy Authority. This model
     would provide greater independence for operations while allowing for funding to come from
     sources other than government budget allocations (such as donations, fees, or grants). It would
     also give public and private sector board members more-equal influence over program activities.
     Therefore, this model is recommended for further consideration by the Turkish government.
     6. Public-Private Partnership

     This option would create a new corporation with both public and private shareholders. Private
     shareholders would typically be more interested in influencing the EE agency’s work rather than
     earning a return on their investment. The shareholders would appoint a board of directors that
     would have overall responsibility for oversight and guidance, independent from any government
     agency. Examples include dena in Germany and the Polish National Energy Conservation Agency.
     Under this model, the private sector shareholders would have much greater influence than under
     the other models, since their influence would be based on the shares they hold. If the corporation
     were to provide fee-based services, then all shareholders could receive dividends or other financial
     benefits. This also creates increased accountability for the EE entity to demonstrate results and
     efficiency. Therefore, this model is also recommended for further consideration by the Turkish
     government.
     7. Small Agency with Program Outsourcing

     Under this model, a small EE agency would be established that would outsource most of the
     program development and implementation functions to one or more private or public agencies.
     Examples of this model include the energy efficiency utilities created in the U.S. states of
     Vermont, Delaware, and Oregon as well as the Standard Offer Program of the South African
     utility Eskom. Under such arrangements, the contracted implementers would be obligated to
     measure EE impacts using agreed methodologies, with some contractual provisions for meeting
     certain targets. Such an arrangement would allow much greater private sector participation in
     all aspects of EE programming (design, implementation, evaluation) and greater accountability
     through contract payments tied to performance. Program implementation would also be subject
     to competition among bidders, ensuring high-quality program capabilities. However, such a
     model could substantially disrupt the current EE department and make GDRE’s existing capacity
     partially redundant. Further, it would take time to develop and agree on proper methodologies
     for program evaluation and impact reporting and to build capacity among potential private
     sector service providers.

                Asssessment of Turkey’s Institutional Set-up and Recommendations for Enhancing Its Effectiveness




Recommendations and Conclusions
Regardless of which institutional option the Turkish government selects, the key principles
outlined in the institutional recommendations will be critical to ensuring that governance
structure and good-practice attributes are in place. These principles will help ensure that the
EE entity has sufficient autonomy and flexibility to develop and implement programs, proper
resources and staffing, and accountability to assess its overall efficacy and make any necessary
adjustments.

In terms of specific institutional models, it is recommended that the government establish either
an independent statutory authority or a PPP to serve as its future EE agency. As indicated in the
previous section, both options (5 and 6) would provide sufficiently strong independence and
accountability with suitable private sector input and influence. The primary role of the new EE
agency would be to serve as the government’s implementing arm for EE. This would include all
the functions discussed previously: collecting and analyzing energy consumption and EE; sharing
information on energy use patterns and EE options; development, implementing and evaluating
supporting programs; advising policy makers, end users, financiers, on EE options; providing
training and certification programs; and other functions as directed by their board. Boxes 5-1
and 5-2 (at the end of this section) provide additional information on how such entities could be
set up and made to function.

The entity would initially be staffed with GDRE employees and possibly supplemented with
program staff from MoSIT and MoEU. Staffing would evolve over time on the basis of program
needs, skills mix, staff performance, funding, and so on. In terms of programming, each existing
EE program would require first board approval, and then a program implementation plan that
would set forth clear strategy and objective statements, an outreach plan, target markets
and participation rates, an expected program duration, indicators, and an evaluation plan.
Implementation plans would be made public once approved by the board, along with annual
progress reports and periodic evaluation reports. Strategies and plans would be developed for
each of the main sectors—industry, public, residential—within the first six months of operation.

The board itself could be chaired by MENR and have broad representation, including all
government agencies with EE responsibilities. Representatives from select industrial associations,
banks, consumer groups, academia, and civil society should also be considered. The board will
have primary responsibility for oversight of the EE agency, including appointment and renewal
of the management team, strategic documents, approval of annual budgets and work plans,
approval of all new program plans, review of progress and evaluation reports, and other tasks to
reasonably ensure effective operation of the EE agency.

Because the new entity’s board would make most of the program-level decisions, the EECB could
be transformed into a higher-level EE Policy Committee, possibly chaired by the Prime Ministry,
that focuses on issues such as inter-ministerial coordination, policy formulation and updates,
and review of regulatory enforcement. This committee could also make recommendations to the
EE agency’s board in terms of new programming, public information needs on new regulations,
and so forth.

The government recently issued detailed action plans for many of the 10th Development Plan’s
focal areas, including a Program for Improving Energy Efficiency (November 2014). In it, the
government calls for GDRE “to be transformed into a stronger structure that will also steer and
coordinate energy efficiency activities of other agencies and organizations as well.” It further
elaborates that


                                                                                                                   59
     Republic of Turkey: Institutional Review of Energy Efficiency




           A specialized institutional structure where public, private and non-governmental
           organizations hold a stake in management and which is administratively and financially
           strong, will be established under [the] Renewable Energy Directorate General, and
           all energy efficiency activities will be gathered under this structure. The capacities
           of real persons and legal entities operating in the field of energy efficiency will be
           strengthened.”
     Although such enhancements will be needed to strengthen the GDRE’s institutional capacity,
     additional efforts may be needed to achieve parallel enhancements to GDRE’s governance,
     independence and accountability. Implementing appropriate revisions to the directorate’s
     structure should be given a high priority to ensure that planned capacity enhancements will
     have the greatest impact and can be sustained.
     While GDRE management does acknowledge many of the identified gaps in EE programming,
     they believe that the restructuring of EIE to GDRE has now been completed and they are already
     in the process of implementing a number of the measures recommended in this report, such as
     increased information sharing and development of monitoring and evaluation plans. Therefore,
     GDRE’s view is that another restructuring at this time may negatively affect ongoing EE activities
     and introduce new uncertainties. GDRE would thus prefer that their existing institutional capacity
     be strengthened in order to address the identified deficiencies.
     It should be acknowledged that another restructuring of GDRE, after the one in 2011, will likely
     have adverse short-term impacts on staff and program performance. However, the development
     of a new institution based on the principles outlined in this report could also significantly enhance
     outcomes in the medium-to-long term and is therefore recommended as a necessary investment.
     Strengthening GDRE without a parallel increase in independence, accountability and flexibility is
     unlikely to result in an increased rate and effectiveness of EE implementation in Turkey sufficient
     to meet the government’s ambitious EE targets. MENR has considerable experience with such
     restructurings, so such potential adverse effects can be minimized.
     It is also recognized, of course, that the selection of a specific model will ultimately be a political
     decision. Nevertheless, the government is encouraged to select an option as early as possible
     and initiate a transition plan; if done according to the principles set forth in this report, the result
     should be an enhanced EE institutional set-up and improved program performance that should
     accelerate the realization of its stated national EE goals and targets. Should deliberations on the
     various institutional models extend beyond a reasonable timeframe, it could harm EE program
     performance by creating uncertainty among staff and various stakeholders.
     Once a decision is made, development and refinement of the institutional design along with the
     development of detailed plans—including a transition plan, staffing arrangements, an operations
     manual, and a business plan—will be necessary. The World Bank and donor community stand
     ready to support such an endeavor.

                       Box 5-1. An Independent Statutory Agency
Under this model, an independent statutory agency (ISA) is established by legislation and governed by a gov-
ernment-appointed management board that often comprises both public and private sector representatives.
Although an ISA’s funding may come from a special allocation, existing ministerial budgets, or independent
sources (such as revenues or donations), it is otherwise an independent organization. ISAs typically enjoy in-
creased independence over typical government agencies; this allows them to undertake more innovative pro-
grams and activities, be more flexible in responding to changing market conditions, and influence EE efforts
across public agencies and private entities. ISAs may also have more-flexible procedures for procurement, hir-
ing and firing, and salary structures. However, increased independence can also imply reduced clout within the
government to push for supportive EE policies and measures, budget allocations and political backing.
Set-Up. Legislation would need to be developed and enacted to establish an EE agency as a not-for-profit ISA
in Turkey. The agency would be overseen by a management board that could include representatives from re-
lated ministries (e.g., MoF, MoEc, MoD, Treasury, MENR, MoEU, MoSIT), the private sector (e.g., industry/pro-
fessional associations, banks, ESCOs/auditors, utilities, municipalities) and others (e.g., academia, consumer
groups, other NGOs). The board would generally meet twice a year to appraise and approve its business plan,
new EE program plans, assess progress with existing activities along with periodic external evaluation reports,
review staffing and funding levels, and assess management performance. The organizational chart for the new
EE agency would depend heavily on what activities and programs the board would decide to undertake. (See
sample organizational charts from other countries in Appendix B.)
Funding. Part of the ISA’s funding could continue to come through MENR to support its core functions (name-
ly, monitoring of compliance with EE regulations, energy data collection and analysis, training, and review of
energy audits/plans), which are assigned to it under the EE Law and supporting regulations, and to partially
cover fixed costs such as staffing and overhead. For EE programs, the government or individual ministries (e.g.,
MENR, MoSIT, MoEU) could request, or the EE agency could propose, specific program plans to address certain
market segments or market failures; these might include, for example, awareness/education, administration of
grants and subsidies, market studies, or development of tools/guides/case studies. Each program plan would
set forth for the government’s consideration its objectives, market failure and proposed activities to address it,
proposed duration, incremental funding needs, additional staff/consultants, monitoring indicators, and evalu-
ation plans. Once the program is approved, the government would enter into a contract with the agency. The
agency could also develop program proposals to be funded by other partners, such as organized industrial
zones (OIZs), industrial associations, donors and international organizations, banks, and other entities subject
to board consent. If a given program is not performing as expected, the government or board could request, or
the agency could propose, that the program be redesigned or cancelled.
Staffing. Initially, the EE staff within GDRE/MENR would be reassigned to the new EE agency. The board would
competitively select a chief executive officer (CEO) to run the agency under a three-to-five–year contract sub-
ject to annual board review and renewable subject to good performance. In consultation with the board, ad-
ditional positions could be proposed by the CEO as necessary and with proper justification. Staff would be
assigned to various programs as they are approved and funded. Over time, well-performing staff should be
eligible for promotions and modest incentive payments; staff who are unable to perform adequately may be
reassigned or, if needed, let go. Temporary experts and other consultants may be hired from time to time to
help prepare specific program plans, provide inputs into public campaigns and guides/tools, or support the
agency during periods of intensive program activities.
Indicative Cost and Benefits. It is difficult to quantify the incremental costs associated with such an institutional
change, or the expected impacts. The most important element of the change is that the ISA would be held
more accountable for results and impacts rather than inputs/outputs, which then requires that it be sufficiently
independent to accept such accountability. Some upfront costs are likely but should be minimal; for example,
development and enactment of legislation to create the EE agency as an ISA, initial hiring of the CEO, possible
remuneration for some nongovernment board members, and office space should the EE agency have to be
moved out of the GDRE (formerly EIE) offices. However, the cost savings and benefits are equally important.
Older and outdated programs would be cancelled. Some staff may opt to remain within MENR and be assigned
to other departments. Over time, agency budgeting by program should create more-effective programs that
lead to better outcomes that use government resources more efficiently. Smarter EE programming should lead
to increased EE investments, which will help further stimulate the market and increase economic activity—in
terms of new company investments, commercial bank financing, energy audit/consulting studies, equipment
manufacturing and supply, and so on. Such increased activity and employment will yield important benefits to
the government, as well as the benefits from increased EE: improved energy security, reduced imports, budget-
ary savings in the energy bills in public facilities, and better environmental stewardship.

                                   Box 5-2. A Public Private Partnership
      A public-private partnership, or PPP, is set up as corporation whose shares are purchased by the government
      and private sector investors. Alternatively, it could be created as a nonprofit organization, in which case the
      private sector shares, or equity, would be provided as a way for private firms to support EE market develop-
      ment without necessarily receiving dividends or a high return on investment. The PPP is governed by a board
      of directors made up of the investors or their designated representatives. Funding can come from a special
      government budget allocation, existing ministerial budgets, or independent sources (e.g., revenues), but it
      generally operates like a company. A main advantage of such a structure is the private sector’s increased stake
      in ensuring its efficient and effective operation; also, its status as a corporation would allow it to be flexible and
      subject to commercial practices for procurement, staffing, and so on. However, conflicts may arise when public
      and private board members have competing objectives or perspectives for the PPP, and this may make it more
      difficult for the government to enter into sole-source contracts with it. It may also find it harder to influence
      public policies given its nongovernmental status.
      Set-Up. The PPP would be registered, either as a corporation or a nonprofit entity, according to Turkish law.
      It would be overseen by a board of directors that would include representatives from the government (e.g.,
      MoF, MoEc, MoD, Treasury, MENR, MoEU, MoSIT) as well as private sector investors that have purchased a
      minimum number of shares (e.g., industrial/professional associations, private companies, utilities, NGOs). The
      board would generally meet twice a year to review and endorse the business plan, review new and ongoing
      EE programs, review staffing and revenue levels, and assess management performance. As with an ISA, the
      organizational chart for the PPP would depend heavily on what activities and programs the board decides to
      undertake.
      Funding. While part of the funding could continue to come through MENR to support its legally authorized
      functions (i.e., monitoring of compliance with EE regulations, energy data collection and analysis), most of its
      operating costs would come from contracts with the government and other entities. As with the ISA option,
      individual ministries or private clients could request, or the EE Agency could propose, specific EE program
      plans to address certain market segments or market failures. Once approved, the government or private client
      would enter into a contract with the Agency based on the final program plan. If the programs do not perform
      as expected, the client can request, or the Agency can propose, that the program be redesigned or cancelled.
      Staffing. Initially, the EE staff within GDRE/MENR would be reassigned to the new EE partnership. The board
      would competitively select a CEO to run the PPP under a three-to-five–year, renewable contract subject to
      review by the board. The PPP would develop business plans addressing activities and programs, projected
      funding and revenues, staffing, and so forth. Well-performing staff should be rewarded for strong performance
      and low performing staff should be let go. Temporary experts and other consultants could be hired from time
      to time as e required.
      Indicative Cost and Benefits. As with the ISA option, quantifying the incremental costs and benefits associated
      with such an institutional change is difficult. Some upfront costs are likely but should be minimal, such as devel-
      oping and enacting legislation to create the PPP, initial hiring of the CEO, and office space should the EE Agency
      have to be moved out of the GDRE (formerly EIE) offices. Some of these costs can be covered by the sale of the
      shares to the private sector. Additional revenues from private sector clients may help cover some of the staffing
      and overhead costs, now borne by MENR. As with the ISA option, the potential cost savings and benefits will be
      high. Over time, Agency budgeting by program should create much more effective programs that lead to better
      outcomes with a more efficient use of government resources. Weaker staff will likely be let go. Smarter EE pro-
      gramming should lead to increased EE investments, which will help further stimulate the market and increase
      economic activity while providing a range of socioeconomic benefits to the government.

France: The Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME)
Overview
France established its Environment and Energy Management Agency (Agence de l’environnement
et de la maîtrise de l’énergie, or ADEME) in 1992 by merging three environmental agencies
created in the 1980s: the French Energy Management Agency (Agence française pour la maîtrise
de l’énergie), the Energy Saving Agency (Agence pour les economies d’énergie), and the Air
Quality Agency (Agence pour la qualité de l’air).26 This merger allowed the agencies to pool their
talents and resources and to approach environmental and energy problems using a broader,
interdisciplinary framework. The ADEME talent pool today consists of more than 1,000 staff at
three central offices in Angers, Paris, and Valbonne; 26 regional branches across France; three
offices in France’s overseas territories; and one office in Brussels.
ADEME operates as a public agency under the joint authority of the Ministry for Ecology,
Sustainable Development, and Energy, and the Ministry for Higher Education and Research.
The agency is governed by a Board of Administration consisting of ten representatives of state
ministries, three representatives of local authorities, two parliamentary representatives, five
other “qualified experts,” and six members elected from ADEME’s staff. It also has a 15-member
Scientific Council.27
ADEME offers companies, public authorities and individuals its technical skills, advice and support
for project implementation, as well as financial assistance for projects, in order to help them
implement EE solutions best suited to their needs. It also provides tools to support research and
fieldwork. In addition, ADEME provides training, conducts community awareness campaigns,
and spreads knowledge about the most effective EE practices and technologies. ADEME’s focus
areas are energy, air, noise abatement, transport, waste management, polluted soil and sites,
and environmental management. ADEME works to support implementation of France’s national
policy on the rational use of energy and to encourage public, business, industry, and government
bodies to save energy and use RE sources.
ADEME’s efforts are supported by a number of energy and environmental policies. For example,
the French government has agreed to a 17 percent reduction in final energy consumption28 by
2020. The nation is also committed to complying with the terms of the European Union (EU)
energy-climate package developed in 2008 and to improving energy efficiency by 20 percent by
2020.29 Additionally, France aims to reduce its energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of
GDP) by 2 percent each year until 2015 and then 2.5 percent per year until 2030.

     Policy Formulation and Implementation
     ADEME assists in policy formulation in France by providing scientific, technological, financial,
     and energy business-related advice and information. The agency also prepares documents and
     implements programs that can lead to the development of community initiatives in France as
     well as throughout Europe. ADEME does not directly implement policies or projects.
     Information Collection and Dissemination
     Data collection is an inherent part of the research projects and programs conducted by ADEME
     and its partner organizations. Some data are distilled and reported in its publications, whereas
     some are used to develop best practices, to improve programs, to support policy proposals, or
     to create the tools it offers for use to businesses and the general public.
     ADEME publishes a quarterly newsletter, ADEME & Vous, that addresses topics of interest to
     companies, local and regional authorities. Each issue updates readers on ADEME activities
     and provides in-depth information about one topic of concern. The ADEME website provides
     “Examples to Follow,” case studies of projects aimed at reducing energy use. These are intended to
     “promote and disseminate good practice in the areas of environment and energy management.”
     ADEME also provides a number of synthesis and analytical reports on its website, most available
     in English and French. Topics range from cement industry NOx emissions to energy for sustainable
     development to the economic impact in France of recycling plastic packaging.
     Funding
     In 2012, ADEME received €93.7 million (about US$129.3 million) for “Means” and €686 million
     (US$946.3 million) for Incentives. About 96 percent of its annual funding comes from the French
     government (French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Industry,
     and the Ministry) of Higher Education and Research, 3 percent is sourced internationally, and 1
     percent comes from private sources.30 The government funds come from taxes on vehicles and
     on the domestic consumption of natural gas.31
     Grants and Incentives
     In 2012, ADEME had a budget of €686 million (US$946.3 million) for incentives for a variety of
     energy and environmental projects. For example, businesses could apply for a grant for solar
     thermal water heaters in the amount of €350 per square meter.
     ADEME has been entrusted by the State with the management of future investments in the
     following areas:
     •	 €1 million for solar power, wind energy, marine energy, geothermal, carbon capture, storage
        and recovery of CO2, bio-based chemistry, the hydrogen vector, energy storage, buildings and
        industrial processes;
     •	 €165 million to promote experimentation and research for the integration of intermittent
        renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc.) in electricity networks and the development of
        smart products and services to control consumption electricity;
     •	 €210 million to support innovative solutions and demonstration projects relating to recycling
        and recovery of waste, remediation of soil, groundwater and sediment applications eco-
        design and industrial ecology;
     •	 €950 million to promote the development of technologies and innovative and sustainable
        (low carbon) solutions for land and sea travel.32

In 2012, ADEME’s regional management and the Picardie regional council committed to
experimenting with the creation of an “energy efficiency public service.” This service is designed
to remove impediments to single-family home energy rehabilitation projects, including
coordinating the services of contractors and having to pay for the project up-front. Throughout
2012, the regional agencies undertook feasibility studies to identify a mechanism that would
pay for the work on behalf of the homeowner and then receive payments from the homeowner
based on the energy savings achieved.
Training Programs
ADEME organizes formal training in energy and environmental issues for companies, NGOs,
public authorities, and the general public. It also provides information sharing opportunities and
conducts awareness raising campaigns. In 2012, 3,800 individuals participated in ADEME training
sessions and another 7,600 participated in seminars, technical sessions, or conferences.33 ADEME
also publishes informational guides; for example, “Healthy Air at Home” and “Successfully
Undertaking a High-performance Renovation” were added in 2012.
Guides/Tools
A part of ADEME’s mission is to develop practical tools and determine best practices based on
the research projects and fieldwork with which it has been involved. It disseminates these to
broad audience. For example, ADEME developed its IMPACT software to help local governments
and businesses assess the energy and environmental impacts of vehicle fleets. The Corporate
Environmental Plan (PEE), designed in cooperation with chambers of commerce, allows
businesses to assess their existing situation under an Environmental Management System.
“Impact Climat” is a tool that can be used to assess the impact of climate change on a territory.
ADEME’s Energy Info Points (Espaces Info Energie, EIE) provides the general public with best-
practice energy savings information for their day-to-day lives.
Stakeholder Consultations
A variety of stakeholders are involved in all of ADEME’s activities. The agency works with local,
regional, and national authorities on the design and implementation of energy management and
environmental protection projects. ADEME works with industries and individual businesses to
improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, limit waste, and implement management systems.
ADEME keeps the general public aware of the latest information on energy efficiency programs
and technologies and informs them on where they can find additional details to address their
specific questions.
Monitoring and Evaluation
ADEME indicates on its website that it “operates under the framework of bilateral cooperation
agreements or international programs, and uses all available leverage to develop and monitor
energy management policies; voluntary agreements, regulations, tax incentives, special rates
and financial incentives....” 34
ADEME also prepares monitoring and evaluation reports for climate change impacts at local and
regional levels.

     Energy Efficiency Programs
     In general, according to the information provided on the website, ADEME’s activities target
     primarily national and regional cooperation efforts. It shares its expertise and resources with local
     authorities, government bodies, industry professionals, research bodies, trade organizations,
     large developers, certification bodies, consumer associations, and banks. It functions as a resource
     center, providing coordination, encouraging collaboration, and conducting communication
     campaigns.35
     Public Sector Programs
     ADEME’s public sector programs include the following:
         •	 Assistance in the development of Territorial Climate Energy Plans (PCET) for public
            agencies;
         •	 The Cit’ergie labeling program—a “good conduct” label for public bodies (municipalities
            or groups of municipalities) that actively contribute to improving their sustainable energy
            policy in line with climate-related goals; and
         •	 Assistance for municipalities that are renovating and modernizing their street lighting.
     Residential Sector Programs
     ADEME’s buildings initiatives focus on new construction (residences and commercial buildings)
     as well as the current stock of residences and commercial buildings. The agency works with
     building industry professionals to increase the thermal and EE of buildings and to ensure that
     new buildings meet more-stringent standards for heating and electricity use. In addition, ADEME
     has determined that the building sector will be key to meeting France’s energy and CO2 emissions
     reduction goals by 2030. In particular, it will be critical to reduce the heating load of new and
     existing buildings.36 ADEME will be working at both the national and local levels to implement
     the Plan for Habitat Energy Renovation (PREH).
     Private Sector (including ESCOs)
     ADEME has created a partnership with the private sector to establish the Technical Industrial
     Centre (CTI) network. Also, ADEME is cooperating with the private sector to implement energy
     management systems.
     Enforcement
     ADEME has no enforcement responsibilities.
     Coordination with Other Agencies
     ADEME has formed partnerships with other agencies, professional organizations, political
     parties, public authorities, environmental and consumer associations, public research and
     educational groups in an effort to achieve its environmental and energy goals. Such partnerships
     can take the form of collaborative efforts, cross-sectoral framework agreements, or co-founded
     organizations (research foundations, interest groups, etc.). Examples include an alliance with
     France’s Professional Association of Car Manufacturers to reduce GHG emissions; research and
     development support in conjunction with the National Institute for the Industrial Environment
     and Risks (INERIS) and the Agricultural and Environmental Engineering Research Agency
     (CEMAGREF); and work with SME Development Bank (BDPME), EDF, and Charbonnage de France
     to implement a guarantee fund for investments in energy management.

     India: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency
     Overview
     The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a statutory body within India’s Ministry of Power. In 2001
     the Indian Parliament enacted the Energy Conservation Act, which came into force in March 2002.
     The Act established BEE as the key agency to assist in developing policies and programs that rely on
     market mechanisms and self-regulation to reduce the energy intensity of the Indian economy and
     promote energy efficiency and conservation.
     Specifically, BEE’s responsibilities are to:
     •	 Provide policy recommendation and direction for national energy conservation activities;
     •	 Coordinate policies and programs for the efficient use of energy with stakeholders;
     •	 Establish systems and procedures to verify, measure and monitor EE improvements;
     •	 Leverage multilateral, bilateral and private sector support to implement the Energy Conservation
        Act of 2001; and
     •	 Demonstrate EE delivery systems through public-private partnerships.
     BEE plays both promotional and regulatory roles. Its promotional functions include preparing
     educational curricula or training programs on the efficient use of energy or the conservation of
     energy, developing testing and certification procedures, formulating demonstration projects or
     pilot programs to show the energy savings that can be obtained from a variety of technologies, and
     providing financial assistance to institutions that adopt energy efficient practices or equipment.
     Its regulatory functions include developing performance standards and labelling for appliances and
     equipment, creating a national Energy Conservation Building Code, setting the guidelines surrounding
     mandatory energy audits, and certifying energy managers and energy auditors.
     The direction-setting and management of the BEE falls to the Governing Council, a body of 20–
     26 members appointed by the Central Government.37 The members are listed below to enable
     comparison to governing boards of the other case studies:
            (a) the Minister in charge of the Ministry or Department of the Central Government dealing with
            Power; (b) the Secretary to the Government of India, in charge of the Ministry or Department
            of the Central Government dealing with Power; (c) the Secretary to the Government of India,
            in charge of the Ministry or Department of the Central Government dealing with Petroleum
            and Natural Gas; (d) the Secretary to the Government of India, in charge of the Ministry or
            Department of the Central Government dealing with Coal; (e) the Secretary to the Government
            of India, in charge of the Ministry or Department of the Central Government dealing with
            Non-conventional Energy Sources; (f) the Secretary to the Government of India, in charge
            of the Ministry or Department of the Central Government dealing with the Atomic Energy;
            (g) the Secretary to the Government of India, in charge of the Ministry or Department of the
            Central Government dealing with the Consumer Affairs; (h) Chairman of the Central Electricity
            Authority; (i) Director-General of the Central Power Research Institute; (j) Executive Director of

Within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) adopted in 2008, the National Mission
for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) was launched, including several targets for 2014–15: annual
fuel savings of at least 23 Mtoe, a cumulative avoided electricity capacity addition of 19,000 MW,
and a CO emission mitigation of 98 Mt. These numbers amount to a 5 percent energy reduction by
          2
2015.38
Policy Formulation and Implementation
BEE was established to advise the government on policy formulation related to energy efficiency and
conservation, particularly in the areas of norms for consumption standards, labelling of equipment
and appliances, the establishment of building conservation codes, specifying the qualifications and
certification procedures for energy managers and energy auditors, setting the timing of energy
audits, and specifying the groups of energy users to be referred to as “designated consumers” and the
energy reporting requirements for them. (Designated consumers consist of high-energy users in the
following categories: thermal power stations, fertilizer manufacturers, cement producers, iron and
steel manufacturers, chlor-alkali producers, aluminum manufacturers, railways, textile producers,
and pulp and paper mills.)
BEE does not play a role in the implementation or enforcement of these EE policies.
Information Collection and Dissemination
BEE publishes a quarterly online newsletter, BEELINE, with articles on topics ranging from news
on new initiatives to photos of energy efficiency events to displays of winning artwork from a
children’s competition. BEE also provides information on its website about its programs in demand-
side management (DSM) in the municipal and agriculture sectors, the latest news updates related
to energy efficiency, information about equipment standards and labelling requirements, and
information needed for energy managers and auditors. A list of accredited auditors can also be found
on the site. Members of the “designated consumer” sectors can find links to presentations made on
topics of interest to them as well as “best practices” articles on exemplary companies in that sector.
Funding
The estimated budget for 2012–13 was Rs. 1,582 crores (about US$260 million).39
Grants and Incentives
The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of eight missions under India’s
climate change action plan, which took effect in 2010–11.40 The Ministry of Power and BEE have been
entrusted with implementing this mission in an effort to further focus on energy efficiency and to
provide funding for related programs. Programs under NMEEE are:
•	 The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT), a market-based mechanism designed to enhance the cost
   effectiveness of improvements in EE in energy-intensive large industries and facilities, through the
   issuance of energy savings certificates that can be traded;
•	 Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE), which leverages financial instruments such
   as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to help make energy efficient appliances affordable
   and increase their levels of penetration;
•	 The Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP), which uses energy savings to pay for EE
   projects;
•	 The Partial Risk Guarantee Fund (PRGF), a risk-sharing mechanism that lowers the risk to the
   lender by guaranteeing partial repayment in case of loan default. The repayment guarantee lowers
   one of the barriers (perception of high risk) to accessing commercial financing for EE projects

         financing; and
     •	 The Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE), which provides equity capital to support
        EE companies or projects, co-investing with private venture capital firms.
     Training Programs
     BEE provides training materials for energy managers and energy auditors on its website. The training
     programs for those positions are offered by technical colleges and universities across India.
     Guides/Tools
     Links on the BEE website take users directly to portals for the CFL exchange program, a page that
     allows consumers to calculate the energy consumption of a wall air conditioning unit, the star rating
     calculator, and information about energy manager and energy auditor training and certification
     programs.
     Monitoring and Evaluation
     BEE conducts a formal evaluation of its programs annually. Independent third-party evaluation
     agencies are selected on a competitive basis annually to conduct an evaluation of the prior year
     programs and to estimate and report the energy savings achieved.
     Energy Efficiency Programs
     The majority of BEE’s programs are directed at large-scale energy users in the industrial and
     transportation sectors, the designated consumers. BEE has also conducted a series of informational,
     awareness building workshops for small to medium sized enterprises. Currently BEE is implementing
     (in cooperation with the Small Industries Development Bank of India) a GEF program for capacity
     development and financing of EE in SMEs.
     Public Sector Programs
     BEE has conducted a demonstration program for public buildings EE improvement using the
     performance contracting model. This program covered a number of high profile central government
     buildings.
     BEE has also sponsored a municipal DSM project in the state of Gujarat. Another BEE activity has
     been the development of guidelines for improving the efficiency of street lighting.
     Residential Sector Programs
     BEE initiated a national EE lighting program named “Bachat Lamp Yojana” to promote energy efficient
     lighting in India, primarily at the household level. This program involves replacement of incandescent
     bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) as well as a plan to dispose of the CFLs at the end of
     their useful lives.
     BEE also has produced product and appliance labelling for air conditioners, freezers, lamps, and
     other appliances. BEE is currently cooperating with the World Bank on the Super Energy Efficient
     Appliances program.
     BEE has produced guidebooks for energy savings calculations in homes.
     Private Sector (including ESCOs)
     In 2009, BEE initiated an Agricultural DSM program in Karnataka, focused mainly on the efficiency of
     pumps used for irrigating fields. Energy audits were conducted and poorly performing pumps and
     motors were replaced, free of charge, with BEE Star labeled ones.
     As mentioned above, BEE implemented a pilot program for implementing EE in public buildings using
     the performance contracting approach. Energy service companies (ESCOs) were selected using a
     competitive bidding process to implement these projects.

The Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP), part of the National Mission for Enhanced Energy
Efficiency, is designed to be used in conjunction with ESCOs to improve EE in India. Under the
EEFP, BEE has developed the Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE) and the
Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE). The PRGFEE is designed to provide risk sharing
for commercial lenders to reduce their risk in financing EE projects. The VCFEE is designed to make
equity investments (in cooperation with private venture capital funds) in EE technology companies
or EE projects.
BEE is also working to standardize the methodology that will be used to audit the buildings consider
for the EEFP as well as to verify the performance and impact of EE measures put in place. A standard
performance contract is also being designed.
BEE has implemented a scheme for registration and accreditation of ESCOs. Over 100 ESCOs are
currently accredited.
Transportation Programs
Railways were designated as one of the nine groups of high-energy-using “Designated Consumers”
under the Energy Conservation Act of 2001. As such, the rail sector must appoint an energy manager
and must submit reports detailing the status of its energy consumption to BEE and a designated state
agency at the end of each fiscal year as well as the actions they have taken to reduce that energy
consumption.
Enforcement
BEE is not an enforcement body. BEE is mainly responsible for informational and technical support for
implementing the Energy Conservation Act of 2001, which relies mainly on self-reporting and market
mechanisms for enforcement.
Coordination with other Agencies
The breadth of the mandate for BEE and the types of policies with which it has been involved seem
to indicate coordination with other agencies. However, such partnerships are not called out in BEE
materials.

     Germany: the German Energy Agency (dena)
     Overview
     The German Energy Agency (Deutsche Energie-Agentur GmbH, or dena) is Germany’s center of
     expertise for EE, RE, and intelligent energy systems. Established in Berlin in 2000, the agency aims to
     provide a holistic approach to finding answers to questions surrounding energy efficient transportation
     systems, electricity, and buildings, energy services, and RE.41
     dena acts as the interface between business and politics in working to achieve Germany’s energy
     efficiency goals. Germany’s Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), in accordance
     with the EU Directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD), has set the
     target of reducing primary energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020 and by 50 percent by 2050,
     both compared to 2008. Additional EE and RE goals include:42
     •	 A 25 percent cut in Germany’s electricity consumption by 2050 (compared to 2008 levels) with an
        interim target decreasing consumption by 10 percent by 2020;
     •	 A doubling of the rate of energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings with the aim of a virtually
        climate-neutral building stock by 2050;
     •	 A 40 percent reduction in the final energy consumption in the transportation sector by 2050
        (relative to 2005 levels) and an increase of over five million electric vehicles by 2030;
     •	 A 20 percent reduction in the final energy requirement of buildings by 2020, and 60 percent by
        2050; and
     •	 An 80 percent share of renewables in the electricity supply by 2050.
     dena achieves these objectives using a staff of 185 engineers, physicists, economists, ecologists,
     geographers, architects, lawyers, political scientists and communication experts.43 Overseeing this staff
     is a nine-member supervisory board currently consisting of the State Secretary at the Federal Ministry
     of Economic Affairs and Energy; two members of the Board of Management of KfW Bankengruppe;
     the former State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building
     and Nuclear Safety; the State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure;
     the Chairman of the Board of Management of the Deutsche Bank Foundation; the State Secretary at
     the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture; the CIO Infrastructure Equity of Allianz Global Investors
     Group Gmbh; and a member of the Board of Management of DZ Bank AG.
     The agency operates as a for-profit company whose shareholders are the Federal Republic of Germany
     (50 percent) (represented by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in consultation
     with the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, the Federal Ministry for the
     Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, and the Federal Ministry of Transport
     and Digital Infrastructure, KfW Bankengruppe (26 percent), Allianz SE (8 percent), Deutsche Bank AG
     (8 percent), and DZ Bank AG (8 percent).
     Policy Formulation and Implementation
     Although dena does not have a direct role to play in setting EE and RE policy, it does influence policy
     through its publications, press releases, media campaigns, and its project choices. For example,
     in 2012 and again in 2014, dena published updates on the status of subsidies provided to solar
     photovoltaics (PV) worldwide. “Biomethane: The Energy System’s All-rounder,” published in 2013,
     explored reasons for combining biogas with natural gas in Germany’s distribution system. In an April
     2014 press release, dena’s chief executive spoke out in favor of expanding rather than abolishing
     the tax bonus for skilled tradesmen as a key step in achieving the EE goals for the building sector.
     Dena also participates in the discussions of some legislative processes, promoting the exchange of
     information among stakeholders, and sharing lessons learned with designated task forces.

In a similar manner, dena supports the implementation of German and EU policy in a variety of ways,
such as:
•	   Reduction goals;
•	   Overseeing collaborative projects to turn existing buildings into net zero energy buildings;
•	   Collaborating on a study of the cost of a national rollout of smart meters; and
•	   Partnering with the technical universities to study the impacts on the electrical grid of increased
     distributed generation, and to determine the role to be played by DSM, storage technologies, and
     other systems services.
Information Collection and Dissemination
dena publishes a newsletter, dena news, five times a year on its website. dena also provides easy
access to the agency’s press releases and publications on topics such as subsidies for solar PV, biofuels,
German RE industries, and the integration of RE into the electric grid. dena also works closely with
clients to prepare media campaigns appropriate to their projects. These campaigns have included
hotlines for answering questions, topic-specific workshops, technical seminars, the development of
pilot projects to demonstrate technologies, field studies and the associated reports, brochures, and
online information portals.
Funding
In 2013, the total revenue for dena stood at €19.2 million (about US$26 million). The financial support
for dena’s projects comes through a large number of partnerships from the public and private sectors.
Between 2005 and 2013, on average, 50 percent of the revenue came from public grants and 50
percent from cooperation with private partners. In 2012 dena collaborated with over 800 private
partners, particularly with energy supply companies, mechanical and plant engineering firms, and
the RE sector.
Grants and Incentives
dena does not offer grants or incentives itself, but can inform its clients about where to look for
funding opportunities.
Training Programs
Training is often a part of the projects in which dena is engaged. Two programs were designed with a
specific training component. The Solar Roofs Program, in place since 2004 and backed by the German
Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, promotes the use of solar PV outside of Germany.
Training programs accompany the technology transfers. dena has also been working with the Chinese
to develop programs related to energy efficient building techniques, technologies, and standards.
Guidebooks/Tools
dena publishes a wide range of studies sand reports on EE and RE. dena has developed a number of
internet based tools that can be used in support of EE and RE projects.
Stakeholder Consultations
The nature of dena’s mission requires that the agency interact and consult with stakeholders. Indeed,
“dena is developing EE and RE markets in cooperation with stakeholders from the worlds of politics
and business and from society at large.”44 The engagement of these stakeholders is necessary to
optimize the entire energy system over the long term, develop efficient and financially viable solutions
to the challenges faced, and to provide support as the process of transformation takes place.45
Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring of results is often an integral part of projects in which dena participates. For example, the
agency assisted a study of energy consumption data for 1600 heating, ventilation and air conditioning
systems to provide benchmark data against which savings can be measured.

     dena also assists its municipal clients in evaluating and managing their energy needs using its
     community-scale Energieeffizienz-Kommune approach.46
     Energy Efficiency Programs
     Since 2008, dena has been developing a comprehensive quality assurance program leading to energy
     certificates for buildings. The certificates inform prospective tenants or buyers of the energy costs
     they are likely to face, before they agree to lease or buy the space. The certificates also give public
     and private owners information about areas where they could begin to improve the energy usage of
     their buildings. In 2014, it will be mandatory to provide tenants and buyers with such a certificate.
     Public Sector Programs
     The state-owned Brandenburgischer Landesbetrieb für Liegenschaften und Bauen (BLB)—he
     Brandenburg State Office for Properties and Construction—commissioned dena to draw up a
     roadmap that would lead to the reduction of its primary energy use by 20 percent and its final energy
     consumption by 23 percent by the year 2030. Increasing the EE of its buildings will be a major part of
     this energy reduction: BLB manages over 200 state properties and roughly 700 state-owned buildings.
     dena also provided technical assistance to local authorities and public agencies in developing EE
     projects.
     Residential Sector Programs
     Dena has conducted a number of studies of energy-efficient refurbishment of residential buildings. It
     has also established the Stakeholder Dialogue on the Advancement of EE Products, and created the
     Alliance for Building Energy Efficiency (GEEA).
     dena is cooperating in the EU COHERENO (Collaboration for housing nearly zero energy renovation/
     Refurbishment from a single source) project, which aims to demonstrate that it is possible to
     transform the existing house stock into nearly net zero structures using cooperative business models.
     EU COHERENO will identify planners, consultants, and financiers that can collaborate and cooperate
     to form working groups. These will be presented to homeowners or building owners as single units
     with whom they will contract to execute their refurbishment projects.
     Private Sector (including ESCOs)
     dena has not participated in ESCO activities or projects in Germany. However, the agency partnered
     with German ESCOs to provide training for the Russian supra-regional distribution grid company
     MRSK Ural on the topic of “Grid Modernization: Regulation, Organization, and System Security.” No
     other information was given about programs involving ESCOs.
     Transportation
     Transportation is seen as a key component of German economic development. To help customers
     make better decisions regarding vehicles, dena is providing support for ecolabels for cars and tires. The
     agency is also working to speed the introduction of natural gas and biofuels into the transportation
     fuel stream.
     Enforcement
     dena does not have any enforcement responsibilities.
     Coordination with other Agencies
     Partnerships with other agencies and businesses are vital to dena’s success. Each project may
     involve its own particular set of partners. dena often coordinates with local, federal, and EU
     governmental institutions, consumer and environmental agencies, businesses, and trade
     organizations within Germany and outside its boundaries.

United Kingdom: The Energy Saving Trust (EST)
Overview
The Energy Saving Trust (EST), formed in 1992 after the Rio Earth Summit, is a non-profit organization
with a charitable foundation whose purpose is to promoting sustainable use of energy. Although
the organization is funded mostly by the British government (including the Department of Energy
and Climate Change, the Department for Transport, the Department for Trade and Industry, and the
Scottish Executive), it also receives some funding from the private sector.
EST works with governments, local authorities, organizations and businesses to achieve an 80 percent
reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.47 The Trust also helps people save energy and reduce fuel
bills, use water more sustainably, and reduce carbon emissions.
To achieve these goals, EST provides impartial energy-saving advice to households and communities.
In the meantime, EST actively promotes carbon emissions reduction in diverse forms. The activities
initiated by EST include delivering or managing government programs, testing low-carbon technology,
verifying certification and assurance for businesses and consumer goods, and developing models and
tools.
EST’s staff consists of several experts, each of whom focuses on a different energy/environment area.
Information Collection and Dissemination
EST provides several data services for its customers and partners. These data services include EMBED,
which is an online hub for storing and sharing building energy monitoring study data; a funding
database to provide information about loans or grants available to local authorities and housing
associations; the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), a national database which tracks the EE
characteristics of the UK’s housing stock; and Home Analytics that provide essential data and analysis
on the UK housing stock to help target retrofit activity.
EST spreads its knowledge and ideas through different ways including releasing publications,
providing updates on social media and through email subscriptions. Customers can also seek energy
saving information from the EST website, through a telephone advice service, and by applying for on-
site expert consultancy. Through 2012, EST had released over 670 publications including its annual
reports, pieces on strategy and research, those providing practical and technical guidance, and case
studies. The audience of its publications includes consumers, businesses, housing professionals,
transport fleets, local authorities, and corporations.
Funding
In 2012, EST’s total funding was £58.2 million, of which 49 percent came from the British government’s
Department of Energy and Climate Change, 3 percent from the Welsh government, 6 percent from
the Department of Transport, 34 percent from the Scottish government, and 8 percent from other
sources.
Grants and Incentives
As part of its work on spreading the word about energy savings, EST provides information about how
to find grants or financial support for individuals, households, communities or organizations. Those
resources can come from European funding, government funding, trusts and foundations, local
authorities, and so on. In addition, EST works with government on large governmental programs and
to provide grants. For example, in 2012–13, EST issued £5.21 million of domestic vouchers for the
Renewable Heat Premium Payment Program. In 2012, the total grant payments of EST were £17.3
million.
Training Programs
EST provides training services, mainly for organizations, on topics such as EE improvement, safe and
smart driving, green fleet management and capitalizing on the opportunities presented by Green

As of the fourth quarter of 2013, KEMCO employed 476 people. Those people are spread
across four headquarters offices, 17 departments, 1 affiliate, and 12 regional headquarters.
The Corporation is overseen by a Board of Directors. That Board consists of a chairperson
(recommended by Directors Recommendation Committee and appointed by the Minister of
the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE), an auditor (recommended by Directors
Recommendation Committee and appointed by the Minister of MOTIE), four executive directors
(appointed by the chairperson), six non-executive directors (appointed by the Minister of the
MOTIE), and an executive director (recommended by the chairperson and appointed by the
Minister of MOTIE) of the affiliated institution (Renewable Energy Center). There is also a
Directors Recommendation Committee consisting of ten independent members.
The organization chart for KEMCO is shown in Figure B-5.
Policy Formulation and Implementation
KEMCO develops and promotes RE policies. For example, MOTIE and KEMCO established new
criteria for fuel efficiency and GHG emissions.
KEMCO also works with and supports several ministries for energy and GHG-related policies,
including GHG & Energy Target Management Systems. KEMCO provides a range of efficiency
standards and certification programs, including Energy Efficiency Grade Label, High-efficiency
Equipment Label, Fuel Efficiency Rating System, Building Energy Efficiency Certification, and
e-Standby program. It oversees the KVER (Korea Voluntary Emission Reduction). In addition, its
New and Renewable Energy Center manages RE-related policies, including RPS.
In terms of enforcement of energy policies, KEMCO and the Korean government conduct a joint
inspection of the energy consumption of public institutions twice a year. Additionally, in order
to obtain a building permit, a property owner must fill out an energy-saving worksheet and
submit it to the local government office. The worksheet is reviewed by KEMCO at the request
of the permit authority. Finally, KEMCO assists in the administration of energy utility demand
side management (DSM), evaluating the report of plans and results of energy utility DSM, and
organizing a DSM committee.

     Private Sector (including ESCOs)
     KEMCO’s original target customers were SMEs, for which it offers audits (some are free to the
     customer) and a range of financing programs to assist the industrial client in implementing EE and
     onsite generation (like CHP) strategies. It has applied this same model to the commercial sector
     to help owners of commercial buildings and the services industry learn about cost-effective EE
     and onsite generation (like CHP) options, with financing assistance when appropriate. It also
     assists this sector with registration for GHG Certificates. Large and commercial sector clients can
     receive audit services but must pay a fee for them.
     KEMCO engages the private sector through training programs, auditing, consulting services, and
     partnerships. It promotes ESCOs and supports the government and ESCOs by operating Energy
     Conservation Fund and by providing policy recommendations.
     Coordination with Other Agencies
     In the conduct of its mission, KEMCO works with a range of domestic organizations, including
     central government agencies, ministries, local governments, companies, education institutions,
     and NGOs. It also works with the World Bank, IFC, and governments in developing countries to
     help developing countries build capacity and sustainability.
