I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Argentina perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Argentina
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Argentina
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From November 2015 to January 2016, 208 stakeholders of the WBG in Argentina were invited
to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management
Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on
WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 90 stakeholders participated in the survey
(43% response rate).

Respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Argentina; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Argentina; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’12 (response rate is 37%, N=104). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations. Few respondents from the office of a
       minister, local governments, private foundations, and other organizations were included
       in the “Other” category. NGO/CBO was renamed as CSO in the analysis. There were no
       respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a parliamentarian,
       independent government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups, or
       the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey and the FY’12 country
        survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 6.7; weighted mean in FY’12 = 7.1)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, moderately
        correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Argentina, the extent
        to which the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Argentina and the extent to
        which the WBG helps to achieve development results in the country.

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Argentina, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty eight specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Argentina. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at foreign direct investment; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Argentina, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at gender equity; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Argentina? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2012 appendices.

FY 2012 Number of comparable respondents = 100  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 83

By weighting the FY 2012 data against the FY 2016 data based on the question about current position
(H1: stakeholder group), the two years’ data has the same stakeholder composition and thus is
comparable. Only stakeholder groups which were present in both years were included in the weighting
and analysis. Respondents from the “office of the president/Prime Minister,” “office of
parliamentarian,” “independent government institutions,” “trade unions,” “faith -based groups,” “youth
groups,” “the judiciary branch,” and “other” were therefore not included in the analysis below. The
weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Argentina? (Choose no more
 than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
