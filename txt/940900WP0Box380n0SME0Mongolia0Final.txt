     The World Bank SME definition includes the following criteria: number of employees, total assets and total annual sales. For the purposes of this study
     we used the criterion “number of employees”: (i) microenterprises < 10 employees, (ii) small enterprises 10 < 50 employees, and (ii) medium enterprise 50
     < 300 employees.

     To be eligible for this survey, businesses had to be registered. Businesses can either register as Limited Liability Company (LLC), association, cooperation,
     sole entrepreneur with liability, or Joint Stock Company.

     By law a company can be registered as an association if it has at least five persons as owners and as a cooperative if at least nine persons are owners.

     These figures differ from the official numbers from Table 3. The reason is that numbers of employees fluctuate during the year. For this sample, number
     of employees during the season has been used.
