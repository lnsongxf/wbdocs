1   Introduction

    Measuring poverty and tracking it over time is an important prerequisite to national economic
    planning. Until recently, reliable information on the standard of living of all Iraqis was not forth-
    coming. Although household budget surveys were conducted in 1992/93 and 2002, they ex-
    cluded the Kurdistan region. Absence of o cial data on household expenditure or poverty line
    hampered the ability of Iraqi policymakers to understand the extent of the problem, analyze their
    causes, and devise appropriate policies.

    Iraq Household Socioeconomic Survey 2006/07 (IHSES) was the rst survey of its kind since 1988
    to cover all 18 governorates. The survey collected rich information on income, expenditure,
    employment, housing, education, health, and other socioeconomic indicators. It was followed by
    construction of an o cial poverty line and assessment of causes and consequences of poverty.
    IHSES 2006/07 also formed the basis for Iraq’s National Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2009.

    Building on the experience of the rst IHSES survey and using international best practice on
    sampling and questionnaire design and survey implementation, the second round of IHSES was
     elded in 2012/13. A nationally representative sample of more than 25,000 households from all
    18 governorates was interviewed on multiple topics. A comprehensive assessment of household
    welfare and its determinants was completed in 2014 culminating in the report The Unful lled
    Promise of Oil and Growth: Poverty, Inclusion, and Welfare in Iraq (The World Bank, 2014).

    Although national, regional, governorate, and qhada (district) level poverty rates can be estimat-
    ed from the IHSES 2012/13 data, sampling design and sample size of the survey does not allow
    reliable and representative poverty estimates at the nahiya (sub-district) level. To ll this data gap,
    a larger survey was designed to collect information on correlates of household welfare like demo-
    graphic characteristics, education, occupation, housing, and assets and estimate small-area pover-
    ty rates using projection methods. This report presents results from the exercise, the rst of its kind
    for Iraq. Poverty mapping not only provides a visual representation of poverty at subnational levels,
    it also reveals pockets of poverty and islands of prosperity where they exist. This knowledge is use-
    ful to inform decisions on policy design and targeting of development projects and programs.

2   Poverty Mapping Methodology

    Survey-to-census imputation

    Conventionally, the discussion and motivation for small area estimation is framed around impu-
    tation from survey to census. It combines the strengths of household budget survey and census
    to estimate poverty headcount and other indicators at small geographical areas. Budget surveys
    collect detailed information on household expenditure which yields average income, poverty
    headcount rate, and other welfare and inequality measures. The surveys usually allow subnation-
    al estimates at the rst administrative level such as regions, provinces, or urban and rural areas.
    However, the sample size of the surveys is usually too small to make reliable statements at lower
    administrative units like districts, sub-districts, or census tracts. On the other hand, all households
    are interviewed in a census which mitigates the small sample problem. The downside is that infor-
    mation on income or expenditure is typically not collected in the census. Small area estimation
    involves modeling a relationship between expenditure and individual, household, and location
    characteristics in the survey and imposing the relationship on the census to estimate household
    expenditure. Of course, for this exercise to be possible, the variables used for modeling household
    expenditure must be common to the survey and the census.

    We follow the small area estimation methodology developed by Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw
    (2002) (2003) (henceforth ELL). The exercise proceeds in three steps. First, the variables common
    to survey and census are identi ed. These usually include demographic characteristics like age,
    gender, marital status, ethnicity, education, and occupation, dwelling characteristics like owner-
    ship and occupancy of dwelling, type of wall, roof, oor, kitchen, toilet, sewage, garbage disposal,
    lighting, cooking fuel, heating, and drinking water, and ownership of assets like livestock and
    poultry, agricultural land, agricultural equipments, electronic equipments, furniture, and vehicles.

    Identifying the common set of variables is only the rst step; they also have to be vetted for sta-
    tistical comparability. For a variable to be used in modeling, the means of the variable, if not the
    distributions, must be statistically indistinguishable. Many variables have means that are statisti-
    cally di erent from each other which makes them ineligible to be included in the model.                   3

    In the second step, household expenditure is regressed on the                                                 1  nc

3   Data

    Imputation data for poverty mapping exercise comes from Iraq Poverty Mapping and Maternal
    Mortality Survey (I-PMM), a nationally representative survey of more than 300,000 households,
    conducted close on the heels of IHSES 2012/13. The objectives of I-PMM were twofold: to esti-
    mate maternal mortality rate and collect reliable information on socioeconomic indicators from a
    large number of households.

    The I-PMM data has many advantages over a regular census data because it was designed ex-
    plicitly to allow for small area estimation. The I-PMM questionnaire included the expected candi-
    date variables for modeling and imputation. Detailed information on the size, composition, and
    structure of the households came from the household roster and the survey asked about other
    usual strong predictors of welfare like education and occupation of household members, char-
    acteristics of dwelling, and ownership of assets. In addition, distance from and time taken to the
    nearest facilities captured location-level di erences which improved the prediction power of the
    regression models. Literature shows that the alteration of the wording of the question, response
    options, and ordering of the questions may a ect survey responses and often it is not possible to
    anticipate the direction and size of such bias. Thus the questions in the I-PMM survey were adapt-
    ed from IHSES with little modi cation. Oftentimes, there is a lag of many years between survey
    and census which strains the assumption of the stability of beta parameters. This was not an issue
    in Iraq because I-PMM was conducted immediately after IHSES 2012/13. Finally, to the extent that
    di erences in survey implementation cause di erences in data, this is less of a concern because
    both the surveys were conducted by the same team of Central Statistics O ce (CSO) and Kurdis-
    tan Rregion Statistics O ce (KRSO) sta and the two surveys were closely coordinated.

    Information on household expenditure for poverty mapping comes from Iraq Household and
    Socioeconomic Survey (IHSES) 2012/13, a nationally representative income and expenditure
    survey in Iraq. Modeled after the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS), it collects detailed
    data on household income and expenditure, health and education, employment and job search,
    displacement, housing and access to services, and many other socioeconomic indicators from
    more 25,000 households.
                                                                                                         7

5   Modeling

    The level at which regression models are run must be chosen judiciously. If a single model is
    speci ed for the entire country, the implicit assumption is that the parameter estimates on the
    regressors are the same for all regions of the country. In other words, a national model assumes
    that the relationship between household expenditure and household characteristics are uniform
    throughout the country. This may not be a tenable assumption in a country like Iraq with wide
    spatial heterogeneity in incidence of violence, endowment of natural resources, and robustness
    of factor markets. For example, returns to education are likely higher in Baghdad where formal job
    market is more robust than in the poorest governorates with thin labor markets. Fitting separate
    models by region allows the relationship between expenditure and the explanatory variables
    to vary and it reduces the standard error of poverty prediction due to the error in modeling. An
    alternative way to allow the coe cients to vary by region is to interact the variables with regional
    dummy variables in the regression. This approach is exible enough to allow di erential relation-
    ships across regions and also minimizes the chances of over tting.

    In this exercise, we proceeded in a top-down fashion to decide the level at which to model the
    relationship, starting from a national-level regression. The national model yielded accurate pre-
    diction for the whole of Iraq but the model could not capture the heterogeneity across gover-
    norates re ected by poor governorate level predictions compared to direct estimates from IHSES.
    In the next iteration, three regional models were tted, one each for Baghdad, Kurdistan (Duhok,
    Sulaimaniya, and Erbil) and Rest of Iraq (14 governorates). Accurate predictions were obtained for
    Baghdad and the three Kurdistan governorates but the third model was still not exible enough
    to capture the di erences across 14 governorates. Next, ve division-level models were run for
    Baghdad, Kurdistan, North (Nainawa, Kirkuk, and Salah ad-Din), Centre (Anbar, Diyala, Najaf, Kerbe-
    la, Wasit, and Babylon) and South (Qadisiya, Thi-Qar, Muthana, Maysan, and Basrah). The governor-
    ate level predictions from the division level regressions were not satisfactorily close to the IHSES
    estimates in the North, Centre, and South.

    Finally, one model for each governorate was run. One concern with running multiple models is
    the loss in degrees of freedom and the risk of over tting, i.e., the models are forced to explain the
                                                                                                            11

6   Poverty Lines

    The poverty line in Iraq is derived from the cost of basic need approach. It is de ned as the level
    of food expenditure necessary for minimum caloric intake and non-food expenditure necessary
    to maintain a minimum acceptable standard of living. The o cial poverty line is de ned nation-
    ally according to the patterns and distribution in non-food consumption in the national sample.
    Although it uses a single bundle of goods, it adjusts for spatial prices di erences. To account for
    di erences in tastes and habits in consumption, regional poverty lines for Kurdistan, Baghdad,
    and Rest of Iraq were also constructed at the request of the Iraqi government. Unlike the national
    poverty line, regional lines are derived based on consumption patterns within the region. The
    national and regional poverty lines are shown in Table 1.

    To be consistent with the o cial poverty estimates which are calculated using the unique nation-
    al poverty line, national poverty line is used for simulation in this exercise. A larger point is that
    for the purpose of poverty mapping, the choice of poverty line is not crucial. The goal of poverty
    map is to reveal the spatial heterogeneity in standard of living. As such, relative ranking of areas
    rather than absolute values is more important. The choice of the poverty line has little bearing
    on the ranking of areas within governorates. Indeed, correlation of within-governorate rank of
    nahiyas calculated using regional and national poverty lines is 0.87.

7   Administrative Structure

    There are three levels of administration in Iraq: governorates, qhadas, and nahiyas. The governor-
    ates of Duhok, Sulaimaniya, and Erbil form the autonomous region of Kurdistan and the governor-
    ate of Baghdad consists of the capital city and the outlying areas. The remaining 14 governorates
    constitute the rest of Iraq. Each governorate is subdivided into qhadas (districts) and nahiyas
    (sub-districts). The total number of qhadas and nahiyas are 120 and 393 respectively but their
    numbers per governorate vary widely (Figure 1).

    For the purpose of planning and policymaking, it would be ideal to be able to rank all communi-
    ties, villages, and towns. However, there is a trade-o between the level at which one estimates
    poverty and the precision of the estimates; the lower the administrative unit, or the smaller the
    area, the less precise the poverty estimates become. Number of households per village or town in
    I-PMM is too low for meaningful poverty projections. Therefore, in this exercise, the lowest admin-
    istrative level at which poverty rates are reported is the nahiya. This is already a stretch because
    some nahiyas have as few as 50 households.

8   Results

    Governorate level predictions

    The accuracy of the models is judged by comparing the governorate level predictions with direct
    estimates from IHSES 2012/13. This comparison is possible because IHSES 2012/13 is representa-
    tive at the governorate level. Direct and estimated poverty rates, standard errors, and z-values for
    the di erence in means are presented in Table 2.2 The projections are consistent with the IHSES
    poverty rates: the estimates for all 18 governorates fall within the 95 percent con dence interval
    of the IHSES mean and the largest absolute value of z-score is 1.48, well within the usual threshold
    of two standard errors.


    Robustness checks

    According to the IHSES, national poverty rate in 2012/13 was 18.9 percent, with the lower and
    upper bounds of the 95 percent con dence interval 17.9 and 19.9 percent respectively (Table 2),
    while the weighted average of predicted poverty rates is 18.2 percent. Thus the estimate falls well
    within 2 standard deviation of the IHSES rate and the absolute di erence is only 0.7 percent.

    With 18 governorates, there are 153 pairs of between-governorate comparisons of statistical sig-
    ni cance. In IHSES, 119 pairs of governorates have statistically di erent poverty rates. The imputa-
    tion results are remarkably consistent with the IHSES results: of the 119 pairs, 116 are statistically
    di erent in the imputation data as well. In addition, 14 new pairs of governorates are statistically
    di erent in the simulation, bringing the total to 130. This also shows that the loss in precision due

9   Maps

    Iraq

    The visual representation of spatial distribution of poverty con rms many of the previous analyti-
    cal ndings and intuitive notions of prevalence of poverty in the country. The added value of the
    map is the revelation of pockets of poverty and islands of prosperity that would not have been
    apparent otherwise. For instance, there is considerable heterogeneity in headcount rate even
    within the poorest governorates. Nahiya-level headcount rate in Maysan ranges from 21 to 72
    percent, a spread of 51 percentage points. The poverty rate in Thi-Qar is 37.6 percent, more than
    twice the national rate; nevertheless, Al-Nasiriya Qadha Center has a poverty rate of 23.1 percent,
    only slightly above the national average. Although the poverty rate in Baghdad is 10.8 percent,
    estimated poverty rate of al-Mishahda nahiya in Baghdad is 49.5 percent, almost ve times the
    governorate average, and it is statistically di erent from all other nahiyas in the governorate. Only
    through the small area estimation exercise do these patterns become apparent.

    Headcount rate and number of poor are alternative ways to visualize the spatial pattern of pover-
    ty. Areas with high headcount rate are typically areas that have historically been marginalized and
    left out of the development process. Where equity consideration and national political preference
    prioritizes the development of such regions, it is justi ed to allocate disproportionately higher
    budget to those areas to increase linkage with markets and build infrastructure networks like
    roads, electricity grid, and irrigation canals. Such areas are usually remote, rural, and sparsely pop-
    ulated. However, if the national priority is to reduce poverty headcount, it is e cient to focus on
    where most of the poor live. Usually, despite low headcount rate, urban and semi-urban areas are
    host to more poor people than the poorest parts because of the population size. This has import-
    ant policy implications as we discuss in the concluding section.

    Often there is little overlap between areas with the highest poverty rate and areas with the most
    number of poor people (Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 3 and 4). Not surprisingly, nahiyas with the
    highest poverty rate are in the Southern governorates of Maysan, Muthana, and Qadisiya. The
    nahiya with the highest headcount rate is Gammas in Qadisiya (77 percent) followed closely by             21

10   Conclusion

     Poverty map is a tool that combines the strengths of household budget survey and population
     and housing census to estimate poverty rate at small level of geographical disaggregation. Na-
     tionally representative budget surveys collect detailed information on household consumption
     which allows one to estimate poverty rate up to regional and rural/urban levels. On the other
     hand, census interviews all households but collects information on only a limited set of variables.
     Small area estimation entails estimating a relationship between household expenditure and
     observable household characteristics using the budget survey and imposing the relationship
     in the census to calculate predicted consumption—and poverty status—of each household.
     The information is then used to estimate average poverty rate at various levels of geographical
     aggregation. The exercise realizes its full potential when the estimated small area poverty rates are
     illustrated on a color-coded map. The visual representation of spatial distribution of poverty draws
     more attention and interest than presenting the information on a table ever could. It can galva-
     nize political will and support for poverty reduction.

     The discussion of poverty alleviation touches upon an important issue discussed earlier—the dis-
     tinction between poor areas and areas where the poor live. Areas that have historically been left
     out of the mainstream development process exhibit entrenched and widespread poverty. How-
     ever, areas with the highest poverty rate are not necessarily where most of the poor live because
     such areas are often sparsely populated. Urban centers and other populated areas might have low
     poverty rate but may host a large number of poor people due to their population size. The design
     and placement of programs and policies depend on whether the national priority is to target
     poor areas or poor people. To facilitate this discussion, the current exercise presents both poverty
     rate and number of poor at the nahiya level. As one can see from the maps, the areas with the
     highest poverty rate in Iraq are not always where most of the poor live. Indeed, there is no nahiya
     in common between ten poorest nahiyas and ten nahiyas with the most number of poor.

     Beyond visual illustration of distribution of poverty, the map draws its power because of its useful-
     ness to planners and policy makers. The most obvious use of poverty maps is for the targeting of
     antipoverty programs. Social protection programs often collect information on proxies of house-

International Experience on Uses of Poverty Maps
Poverty maps have been developed for at least 45 countries in the last fteen years. Once a map has
been developed for a country, it can be put to many uses as the following examples demonstrate.


Targeting
 Bulgaria: “In Bulgaria, poverty maps account for one of ve formal criteria used in allocating social
  infrastructure projects among municipalities…The steering committee of the Social Investment Fund
  has found that the maps are important in the allocation process because they have helped guaran-
  tee an objective ranking among municipality applicants. Indeed, the committee has considered the
  maps so helpful that it has now integrated the small area poverty estimates into the fund’s manage-
  ment information system.”
 Cambodia: “In Cambodia, the World Food Programme has integrated several maps, including
  information on infrastructure and vulnerability to ood and drought, into a GIS, along with small
  area poverty and nutrition maps. It has used the combined information to identify potential areas for
  its programs. The maps have also been used for resource targeting by, for example, the Ministry of
  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries.
 Kenya: “In Kenya, the allocation formula used in the Constituency Development Fund has been
  revised so that 25 percent of the allocations are based on the incidence of poverty, and those areas
  showing higher poverty incidence receive more resources from this portion of the allocations.


Identi cation of correlates of poverty
 Sri Lanka: “Overlaying the poverty map and a map depicting access to nearby markets or cities has
  demonstrated that poverty incidence is highly correlated with geographical isolation as measured
  by distance to the nearest market or city. This has prompted a shift to an emphasis on reaching areas
  that are more isolated. A similar exercise has been conducted with GIS data on drought patterns.”


Validation of existing targeting mechanism
 Morocco: “In Morocco, an analysis of public expenditure and poverty has provided a measure of the
  extent to which program allocations have matched the patterns of poverty (the targeting di erential
  approach). Morocco has found a strong correlation between poverty and other local data. This has
  enabled a deeper understanding of local conditions, the evolution of social conditions, and the e ec-
  tiveness of government programs in reaching poor areas.
                                                                                                          (continued on next page)

                         International Experience on Uses of Poverty Maps (continued)
                          Vietnam: “The poverty map was overlaid with information on communes receiving funds through
                           Program 135. The results of this exercise validated the program’s targeting criteria by showing that
                           most communes bene ting from Program 135 were in poor areas and that most poor areas were
                           included in the program, although the analysis did reveal a few gaps in coverage in the Northwest
                           region that needed attention.


                         Reform of existing programs
                          Sri Lanka: “In Sri Lanka, the small area estimates on poverty at the Divisional Secretariat level were
                           compared to the coverage of the Samurdhi transfer program, the largest welfare program in Sri
                           Lanka. Only a weak correlation was found between the areas targeted by the program and the areas
                           ranked as the poorest in the poverty map. This helped quantify the extent of mistargeting in the
                           Samurdhi program with regard to both undercoverage and leakage. As a result, the formulas for the
                           allocation of funds in the program were modi ed. This was very sensitive politically, as many people
                           stood to receive reduced bene ts or none at all because of the changes in the allocation criteria. As a
                           compromise, allocations remained fairly constant for existing recipient areas, but the poorest of these
                           areas saw an increase in funding.”


                         Monitoring poverty over time
                          Ecuador: “Ecuador was one of the rst countries to construct a series (or panel) of poverty maps.
                           It used data from 1990 and 2001, and the two maps helped identify areas where there had been a
                           signi cant increase in poverty over that time (for example, urban areas in the Coast Region, where
                           the 1990 poverty rates were lower), as well as areas where poverty had remained largely unchanged
                           (such as rural areas in the Coast Region, where the 1990 poverty rates were higher).”


                         Inter-agency coordination
                          Mexico: “…the president of Mexico has developed a plan to reduce poverty and promote human
                           development by focusing on the 50 municipalities with the highest poverty rates and the lowest hu-
                           man development indexes. Seven ministries operating 12 di erent but related programs now focus
                           as a priority on the poor in these 50 municipal areas. These seven ministries have had to coordinate
                           the 12 programs to meet the targets set out in the plan. Previously, each ministry and program had
                           its own priorities and objectives that were implemented in isolation.
                                                                                                                  (continued on next page)

  International Experience on Uses of Poverty Maps (continued)
   South Africa: “Data and maps on poverty, sanitation, clean water, and the incidence of cholera were
    used to help contain the spread of cholera in KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa in January 2001.
    Poverty and cholera data sets showed that the cholera outbreak had followed a river oodplain and
    was moving through poor areas toward other poor areas. The use of the data sets assisted in produc-
    ing a swift, well-coordinated response by national and local government departments (health, water,
    and so on)...”


  Sparking conversation on poverty
   Morocco: “Although there is less poverty in Morocco than in most countries in Africa, the poverty
    map in Morocco has highlighted the problem of persistent poverty and sparked a national conver-
    sation on poverty. King Mohammed VI has taken an especially keen interest, and the poverty maps
    have been used to help design and allocate the budget for his signature program, the National
    Human Development Initiative.
   Vietnam: “In Vietnam, poverty maps have revealed high levels of inequality both across and within
    regions. This strong message has resonated with many users and provided empirical evidence of
    patterns that were only suspected, but never documented.
