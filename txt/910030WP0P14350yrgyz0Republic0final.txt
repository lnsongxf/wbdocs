Overview

In an increasingly interconnected and globalizing world economy, newly created jobs require a higher degree
of analytical and interpersonal skills. With a per capita GDP in 2012 of US$1,155, the Kyrgyz Republic is a
low-income country. However, it is experiencing a number of structural changes with the size of the industrial
and service sectors—especially the latter—strongly on the rise. Detailed data analysis confirms that these
sectoral shifts are changing the demand for skills in the Kyrgyz Republic toward “new economy skills.” More
generally, the Kyrgyz aspiration to become a middle-income economy will require a labor force that has
diverse high-quality skills.

The goal of this report is to provide an in-depth analysis of the links that exist in the Kyrgyz Republic
between education, skills, and labor market outcomes. The analysis builds on a unique household survey—the
first ever conducted in the country—that goes beyond the traditional data and analysis on educational
attainment. More specifically, the survey includes large-scale assessments of cognitive and non-cognitive skills
of workers in both the formal and informal sectors, job seekers, and those who are inactive by testing and
interviewing respondents. This is a relatively rare occurrence in middle- and low-income countries, though
OECD countries tend to conduct these assessments more frequently.

The survey was developed specifically for this study and was conducted jointly by the German Society for
International Cooperation (GIZ) and the World Bank in 2013 (see Box 1). The study was conducted with
generous support from the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) for the “Skills for
Competitiveness and Growth: The Challenge of Labor Exporting Countries” Initiative. The report
complements and builds on past studies on the determinants of economic growth and the determinants of
employment outcomes. 1

The study contributes to the National Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2013–
2017) by offering: (i) a detailed empirical assessment of the links between education and skills and between
skills and jobs; and, (ii) specific policy goals deserving of particular attention when promoting job-relevant
skills development over the life cycle.

The main finding of the report is that skills are valued in the labor market, yet skills gaps persist. Three
findings are particularly noteworthy. First, youth with more cognitive and non-cognitive skills are more likely
to be employed than inactive or discouraged people. Second, among the employed, workers with higher
cognitive and non-cognitive skills are more likely to use those skills in their daily work. Third, among the
employed, workers with higher skills—cognitive skills especially—tend to have higher quality jobs.

However, the report shows that there are weaknesses in the way skills are formed. While skills are developed
during different stages in the life cycle and a host of actors are involved—families, for example, play a central
role—the Kyrgyz education system has a mixed record in skill formation. First, three quarters of 3- to 5-year-
olds lack access to preschools, raising concerns over the formation of cognitive and non-cognitive skills at an
early age. Second, while education completion rates are generally high, about half of the youth entering the
labor market with at most a secondary general education lack the cognitive, non-cognitive, and technical skills

needed to secure quality jobs. Moreover, too many tertiary graduates have skill levels that are comparable to
the skill levels of secondary general graduates. On the one hand, workers with higher educational attainment
generally have higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills. On the other hand, there is considerable variation in
cognitive skill levels across workers with identical educational attainment levels.

As discussed earlier, the detailed analysis of skills in the Kyrgyz Republic is a unique feature to this report.
This report defines workers’ skills as cognitive, non-cognitive (social and behavioral), and technical skills. This
study focuses on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Cognitive skills capture the ability to use logical, intuitive,
and critical thinking as well as skills such as problem solving, verbal ability, and numeracy. The cognitive skills
measured in this report include memory, literacy, and numeracy skills. Non-cognitive skills represent
personality traits and socio-emotional skills that are relevant in the labor market, including extraversion,
conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeability, and emotional stability. This survey measures the
following non-cognitive skills: openness/sociability, workplace attitude, decision making, achievement
striving, and growth mindset.

There is considerable scope for public policy to address the observed skills gaps. Policies can target the future
workforce, usually by focusing on families and communities and focusing on the formal education system,
and/or target the current workforce, by focusing on adult training institutions and on-the-job training by
firms. Taken together, the Kyrgyz findings and the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP)
Framework point to three policy goals that can strengthen the quality, relevance, and use of skills over the
life-cycle:

      To get children off to the right start: by continuing to emphasize public policies that seek faster universal
       access to early childhood development services, building on the nutrition and preschool strategies,
       and the recent findings from the institutional SABER ECD review 2 (see Appendix F: SABER ECD
       2013—Summary of policy options to improve ECD in the Kyrgyz Republic). These efforts should
       be promoted as an integral part of a strategy to build strong skills for the future.
      Ensuring that all students learn and build job-relevant skills that employers demand: by building on public
       policies, such as the education development strategy (EDS 2020), that: (i) seek to build strong non-
       cognitive skills at all education levels, alongside strong cognitive skills; (ii) promote non-cognitive
       skill building in schools; (iii) emphasize systematic measurement of skills alongside education and
       labor market outcomes; (iv) encourage more students to invest in technical/science training, both at
       the secondary and tertiary level.
      Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation: by emphasizing public policies that: (i) encourage firms to
       enhance skills use and skills investments; (ii) support migrants to build more skills to increase their
       earning capacity and therefore their ability to support their families.

This report begins by examining the characteristics of the Kyrgyz labor market, examining in particular
emerging signs that the demand for skills is structurally changing, alongside patterns of labor market
participation and the quality of jobs. Section 2 explores the demand for and use of cognitive and non-
cognitive skills in the Kyrgyz labor market. Section 3 then examines the formation of skills to determine
whether the education system is effectively imparting the cognitive and non-cognitive skills demanded by

skills that meet the Kyrgyz aspiration to become a middle-income country.



Box 1: World Bank/GIZ Kyrgyz Republic Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013)

The Jobs, Skills, and Migration survey is one of three identical household surveys conducted in Central Asia
in 2013 by the World Bank in collaboration with GIZ. The countries covered are the Kyrgyz Republic,
Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.+ It is representative at the national, regional (Oblast), and urban/rural level. The
survey collected comprehensive information not typically captured by traditional household surveys. It
includes two distinct instruments: a core questionnaire and a skills questionnaire. The sample size of the core
questionnaire was 1,500 households with a total of 7,706 individuals. Given that one individual per household
was randomly selected to partake in the skills questionnaire, this sample consists of 1,500 individuals. The
survey was conducted from July to September, 2013.

1. Core questionnaire*

The core questionnaire contains modules on education, employment, migration, health expenditure,
remittances, government transfers, financial services, subjective poverty, and housing conditions, as well as a
complete household expenditure module. The core questionnaire concludes with the random selection of a
household member aged 15 to 64 to whom the skill questionnaire is administered. The random selection is
based on a random number table (Kish grid).

2. Skills questionnaire*

The skills questionnaire contains detailed modules on labor and work expectations, migration and preparation
for migration, language skills, and technical skill training. A unique aspect of the survey are the cognitive and
non-cognitive questions to test skills. The cognitive skills module is based on a recent instrument developed
for a similar survey in Bulgaria. The non-cognitive test modules of the skills questionnaire are based on World
Bank Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) surveys. The skills modules were developed with
the support of a multi-disciplinary panel of experts in psychology, skills assessment, education, and labor
markets.

Road: Skills for Employability in Uzbekistan.”

1           Structural Changes and the Labor Market

This section presents labor market outcomes in the Kyrgyz Republic and attempts to answer three
fundamental questions:
    1) Are there signs that the demand for skills is structurally changing?
    2) How does labor market participation compare across cohorts and gender?
    3) What do we know about job quality in the Kyrgyz Republic?

The section that follows explores whether and how labor market participation and access to quality jobs are
related to individual skill levels and skill composition in the Kyrgyz Republic. In addition to the results
presented in the main body of the report, Appendix D: Summary Tables contains more detailed results on
labor market outcomes.



1.1                 Structural transformations are changing the demand for skills


After a dramatic decline in economic growth following independence, the Kyrgyz Republic experienced
positive, albeit volatile, economic growth (Figure 1). Before 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic created products
exclusively for the Soviet Union. However, with the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., demand for production
disappeared and many industries closed. In the absence of alternative markets, agriculture and service sectors
began to increase, and growth rebounded by the mid-1990s. GDP growth averaged 3.7 percent between
2002 and 2012. With a per capita GDP in 2012 of US$1,155 3, the Kyrgyz Republic is a low-income country.
While, on average, GDP growth rates have been positive, internal conflict has created a volatile growth
environment over the last four years, with growth rates ranging from negative one percent to 10 percent.

Labor productivity remains low, however, and formal job creation has remained well below population
growth. Between 1996 and 2012, formal employment rates grew at an average rate of only 0.14 percent per

year, while the population grew at a rate of 1.2 percent per year. The number of individuals entering the labor
market is disproportionately larger than formal job creation. Between 60,000 and 75,000 vacancies must be
created annually to absorb graduates entering the workforce; in reality, as few as 25,000 new vacancies a year
may actually be available in the Kyrgyz labor market (Kyrgyzstan Country Programme on Decent Work for
2010–2014; European Training Foundation, 2013). This equates to a vacancy for only one in three graduates.
Furthermore, labor productivity growth averaged less than two percent between 2000 and 2011 (Figure 2).
Comparatively, productivity growth averaged over four percent in Turkey and over five percent in Russia for
the same time period. Improving productivity rates are essential to accessing potential economic and social
gains.

Nevertheless, the structure of Kyrgyz economy has changed markedly over the past 20 years. In 1990, the
service, industry, and agricultural sectors each accounted for approximately one-third of GDP, with industry
being marginally the largest. The industrial sector largely collapsed after transition, but has begun a revival in
the last few years with the garment industry and private enterprises expanding. While agriculture became the
dominant sector in the 1990s, more recently agriculture has been replaced by the service sector. Today, the
service sector accounts for approximately 54 percent of GDP, as compared to 26 percent for the industry
sector and 20 percent for agriculture (Figure 3).

Currently, the majority of people with jobs work in the service sector. Sixty-four percent of the labor force
works in the service sector, 14 percent in industry, and 22 percent in agriculture. Thus, given their sectoral
shares in GDP, the share of agriculture in GDP is largely equivalent to its share in employment, while the
economic contribution in industry exceeds its workforce contribution and service productivity lags. Gender
disparities are prevalent in the industry sector, where 88 percent of workers are male. In many countries that
similarly undergo a process of structural shift, whereby jobs are shifted away from the traditional sectors
(agriculture and mining) to more modern sectors (industry and services), this shift implies a rise in importance
of the cognitive and non-cognitive skills in the economy (OECD, 2010).

Sectoral shifts have also been accompanied by a greater demand for “new economy skills,” as evidenced by
an analysis 4 of Kyrgyz Household Budget Surveys between 2006 and 2012. New economy skills are higher-
order analytical and organizational skills, including non-routine cognitive analytical and interpersonal skills.
Figure 5 illustrates the change in an index of the skills intensity of jobs relative to 2006, measured in
“centiles” (or less precisely, the percentile change in skills requirements in jobs in the Kyrgyz economy). The
graph shows that new economy skills have risen since 2009, with the largest increase between 2011 and 2012.
In addition, the demand for routine cognitive skills has shown a subtle increase as well. New economy skills
and routine cognitive skills are often associated with services and manufacturing jobs. Meanwhile, the
demand for routine manual skills—often associated with low productivity agriculture and retail
occupations—declined moderately. This shift in skills demand is consistent with shifts observed in other
Eastern European and Central Asian countries, as well as in many OECD countries, although the trends are
more muted in the Kyrgyz Republic.

In line with this shift, firms increasingly report that workers are not adequately prepared for the demands of
the labor market. In 2008, between 20 and 30 percent of businesses across the manufacturing, services, and
construction sector in the Kyrgyz Republic claimed that lack of skills was a major or very severe constraint to
their business (Figure 6), placing the Kyrgyz Republic below the mean in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
However, in the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey, 33 percent of firms identified an inadequately educated
workforce as a major constraint in the Kyrgyz Republic, significantly higher than the Eastern Europe and
Central Asia average of 22 percent. This level of employer dissatisfaction across sectors represents a real
concern regarding skills. 5




4 The analysis relies on a methodology first developed by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) and expanded by Acemoglu
and Autor (2011). It employs the skills requirement of different occupations in the United States as a benchmark,
defined by the O*NET dictionary of occupations. A given job can, on a skill of 1 to 5, require skills in four categories:
new economy skills, non-routine manual/physical skills, routine cognitive, and routine manual.

1.2       The high employment rate bodes well for overall skills use

The labor force of the Kyrgyz Republic is young and the overall employment rate is relatively high. The
population currently stands at 5.6 million with a growth rate of 1.1 percent per annum. 6 Over 60 percent of
the population is under the age of 30 and half of all individuals in the Kyrgyz Republic is under 15 years of
age, which is double the proportion among EU countries. Less than five percent of the population is over 65,
compared to 19 percent in EU countries. The employment rate measures the share of the labor force aged
15-64 years in jobs, and is therefore a first indicator of skills use: those people not in jobs are unable to use
their skills to contribute to the economy. The survey data show that 82 percent of men aged 15–64 and 59
percent of women are working, comparing favorably with rates of 73 percent and 58 percent, respectively, in
OECD countries.

The Kyrgyz female employment rate (59 percent) is much higher than in Uzbekistan (40 percent) and
Tajikistan (29 percent). Female participation rates are relatively similar for 15-19 year olds in the Kyrgyz
Republic, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. However, by age 20, marked variations in labor participation across
countries appear and remain throughout the prime working years (Figure 8). Overall, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan have female employment rates of approximately 40 percent and 29 percent, respectively, compared
to 59 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Migration is also an important dimension of the labor market in the Kyrgyz Republic. Five percent of the
Kyrgyz population migrates domestically, while over 10 percent, or more than triple the world average (3.2
percent), is currently abroad (Table 1). Women are more likely to migrate domestically, while men are more
likely to migrate internationally. Qualitative studies suggest that for youth, in particular, migration is viewed as
an opportunity to find a job and obtain experience and skills, since their received education and training is not
seen as providing the practical professional skills required for employment. 7

Research shows that generally the poor, but not the very poor, tend to migrate 8; however, consumption levels
appear to have less impact on the decision to migrate in the Kyrgyz Republic. All consumption levels have a
relatively similar migration profile (Figure 9). While the second quintile, at 18 percent, is the most likely to
migrate, 15 and 14 percent of the first and fifth quintiles migrate, respectively. This may be due largely to high
levels of informality and the perceived benefits of working abroad.

The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of regional and bilateral agreements regarding migratory movement, with
the Russian Federation dominating as the destination of choice for Kyrgyz migrants. A regional agreement
permits visa-free entry and waives requirements for pre-arrival employment guarantees to the Russia
Federation. Over 80 percent of emigrants choose Russia as their destination. The Kyrgyz Republic further
maintains bilateral agreements with Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan relating to the social protection of
migrants. 9 As such, Kyrgyz also migrate to these neighboring countries. In addition, Ukraine, Israel, and
Germany attract workers, though in substantially smaller numbers. The majority of migrants are involved in
individual entrepreneurship, travelling back and forth to sell goods; however many are also recruited to work
in agriculture, construction, department stores, and cafes. 10 Remittances accounted for almost one-third of
GDP in 2012, making migration more productive than any other sector given the percent of population
involved. The most lucrative remittances come from the Russia Federation (US$2,308 million), Israel (US$80
million), and Ukraine (US$74 million). 11

Migrants may also face job insecurity abroad, often exacerbated by work in the informal sector or illegal
residency in destination countries. In a recent survey, approximately one-third of migrant workers report that
they are working illegally in their host country. The same survey found that an estimated 61 percent of
migrant workers have not signed a written employment contract, and are thus excluded from the worker
protections guaranteed through existing bilateral labor agreements. 12 Low-skilled migrants in particular are
likely to work without the security of a contract.

1.3                                 Job quality remains a serious concern for effective skills use

Informality is extremely high, raising concerns regarding the effective use of skills. Informality is defined as
those who lack an employment contract or are unpaid family workers (similar to other research in Europe
and Central Asia). As shown in Figure 10, almost two thirds (62 percent) of Kyrgyz workers hold an informal
job. Nearly all individuals with only a secondary general education end up working in the informal sector (76
percent). Informality, while still extremely high, is the lowest in the service sector: 54 percent are working
informally, compared with 59 percent of industry workers and 89 percent of workers in agriculture.
Informality generates several challenges as workers without a formal contract must overcome multiple
barriers in managing shocks and risks (e.g. Koettl et al., 2012). Furthermore, other studies have shown that as
small informal businesses lack access to credit, they also often lack the means to make the type of capital
investments that complement the human capital skills and enhance their effective use. And, they have fewer
incentives to invest in worker training.

Overall, a large share of workers in the Kyrgyz Republic perform physical tasks and few workers learn new
things on the job (Figure 11). In this study, physical work is defined as regularly lifting or pulling anything
weighing at least 50 pounds (25 kilograms). Physical work is unsurprisingly common in the agricultural and
industrial sectors, and less so in the services sector. The majority of tasks performed at work are repetitive in
nature (82 percent), which holds for jobs in all three sectors. Manual, repetitive tasks limit the scope for on
the job learning, which is confirmed by survey respondents in all three sectors. Only about 42 percent of all

week. This share is slightly higher, at 45 percent, in services.

Overall, computer use is relatively low in the Kyrgyz Republic. As shown in Figure 12, 27 percent of service
sector workers use computers at work, compared with 19 percent in industry, and 9 percent in agriculture.
Furthermore, a higher proportion of young workers (25 percent) uses computers compared with older
workers (18 percent). Again, however, while the shift toward services is being accompanied by increased
demand for more complex skills (here: computer use), the overall level of complex skill use is relatively low
compared with other developing countries. Whereas computer use in Kyrgyz stands at 23 percent, in the
Yunnan province in China 55 percent of workers use computers, in Bolivia and Vietnam 35 percent use
computer, and in Sri Lanka 30 percent or workers use computers. 13

2                    Better Skills Are Good Predictors of Labor Market Outcomes

This section presents findings about the returns to skills in the labor market and the use of skills on the job in
the Kyrgyz Republic, and addresses two fundamental questions:

              1) What skills are valued in the labor market; and
              2) What skills do workers currently use?


In addition to the results presented in the main body of the report below, Appendix E: Cognitive and Non-
Cognitive Skill Mean Scores contains more detailed information on cognitive and non-cognitive skill
outcomes.

2.1                       Education is valued in the labor market

Employment rate increase with educational attainment. Among women, university and secondary
special/technical graduates are more likely to work than graduates with secondary general education. Among
men, employment rates are very high regardless of education levels. Overall, the employment rate among
adults with a university degree is 77 percent, compared to 57 percent among adults with a secondary general
education level. This positive correlation is fully driven by employment outcomes for women, however.
Among men aged 25–54, employment rates are approximately 90 percent, regardless of the level of
completed education, while 58 percent of female secondary graduates work compared with 72 and 75 percent
among secondary technical/special and tertiary, respectively.

Preschool attendance correlates with a higher probability of being employed, as well as having a better job
later in life, but mainly through higher educational attainment. While not implying causality, findings show
that adults who attended preschool as a child on average are more likely to be employed (83 percent)
compared to adults who did not attend preschool (77 percent). Among those employed, a larger share of

                                                                                          14
adults who went to preschool as a child has a job in the formal sector (55 percent compared to 37 percent).
Performing agricultural work is also less common among adults who went to preschool as a child. However,
when taking into account demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, area, and (most
importantly) educational attainment, preschool is no longer a significant correlate of employment outcomes
(Figure 14).

Among the employed, there is a modest wage premium to tertiary education. Figure 15 shows the average
percentage earnings premium for workers with a tertiary education relative to workers with secondary
education (both general and technical) with similar observed characteristics. On average, tertiary educated
workers have a 30 percent higher wage than similar workers with secondary education. Such a return to
tertiary education is a signal of a strong demand for tertiary educated individuals in the labor market.
However, in comparison with other countries in ECA, the college premium is the lowest in Kyrgyzstan.
There are two likely explanations. First, there is a relatively large supply of tertiary graduates: 27 percent of the
working population has a tertiary degree, which is higher than the 23 percent average in OECD countries.
Second, there is a positive correlation between the degree of modernization (reforms to transition to a market
economy) and the returns to higher education. 14 Average college premiums are highest in most EU-10
countries. The value and importance of tertiary education is likely to increase as the Kyrgyz economy
continues to modernize.

Workers’ own perceptions regarding the usefulness of their education point to tertiary standing out favorably.
Overall, tertiary graduates find their education the most useful with almost 60 percent responding that their
education is very useful. Only 25 percent of individuals with a secondary general education report their
education to be very useful, and less than 40 percent of secondary technical graduates find their education
very useful for their job (Figure 16).

2.2      Skills and employability are closely linked


Do skills matter? A well-functioning labor market values the skills imparted in the education system and not
only the diplomas granted by the system. While employees may have sufficient education credentials—and
education completion rates in the Kyrgyz Republic are high, as discussed below—employers may nonetheless
complain that employees do not have the right skills for the job. Recent studies show that the quality of
education (not the quantity) ensures that students develop valuable skills and matters to growth. 15

A worker’s skillset consist of three types of skills: cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, and technical skills.
Cognitive skills capture the ability to use logical, intuitive and critical thinking as well as skills such as problem
solving, verbal ability, and numeracy. Non-cognitive skills represent personality traits that are relevant in the
labor market, including extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeability, and emotional
stability. Technical skills include the use of methods, materials, tools and instruments, and extend to specific
skills relevant in particular occupations. Due to data limitations, this study focuses in particular on cognitive
and non-cognitive skills (see Box 2 for more details).

Box 2: Skills definitions in this study

The three cognitive skills measured in this study are memory, literacy, and numeracy. The working
memory score is based on twelve items that asked respondents to repeat a sequence of numbers of increasing
length. The literacy score represents reading comprehension skills and builds on five text comprehension
questions about a story card. The informational numeracy score is built using a total of 10 questions
measuring comprehension of a medicine instructions card, a bus schedule card, publicity, and a graph. It
should be noted that the numeracy score represents various aspects of numeracy skills, which often also
require a broader set of cognitive skills such as being literate. In particular, individuals with a high score on
numeracy have the ability to recognize and manipulate numbers contained in and represented by various
formats.

The five non-cognitive skills measured in this study are openness, workplace attitude, decision
making, achievement striving, and the growth mindset scale. The skills are built using the following
items:

       (1) Openness to New Ideas and People (5 items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are you
           interested in learning new things?”);

       (2) Workplace Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that take a very
           long time to complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”);

       (3) Decision Making (5 items; e.g., “Do you think about how the things you do will affect others?”; “Do
           you think carefully before making an important decision?”);

       (4) Achievement Striving (3 items; e.g. “Do you do more than is expected of you?”; “Do you try to
           outdo others, to be best?”); and

       (5) Growth Mindset Scale (4 items; e.g. “The type of person you are is fundamental, and you cannot
           change much”; “You can behave in various ways, but your character cannot really be changed.”).

First, cognitive and non-cognitive skills correlate positively with finding a job. Figure 18 shows that young
employed adults generally have considerably better cognitive skills—with the exception of literacy—and non-
cognitive skills than young inactive adults. The same gap is not observed between older adults (aged 55–64)
who are employed and older adults who are inactive, however, suggesting that inactivity among elder workers
is driven by reasons other than skills. For example, responses from qualitative interviews suggest that
personal ties are the most effective means for acquiring a job. 16 Furthermore, note that young employed
adults score significantly higher on nearly all cognitive and non-cognitive assessments than both employed
and inactive older adults. Notable exceptions are literacy and numeracy (cognitive) skills, and openness (non-
cognitive) skills.

Box 3: Existing literature shows a strong relationship between both cognitive and non-cognitive
       skills and employment outcomes

Past work has shown a strong and robust relationship between cognitive skills and labor market
outcomes. Studies using longitudinal household surveys in the US find that cognitive test scores during
schooling years are good predictors of the level of wages (Heckman, 2000; Heckman and Carneiro, 2003;
Cunha et al., 2006). Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that a shortage of skills is considered to be one
of the biggest barriers to employment (Sánchez Puerta, 2009). The empirical literature on cognitive
skills/labor market outcomes distils two types of causal pathways: (i) direct—e.g. Murnane et al., 1995 assess
the role of math skills of graduating high school seniors on their wages at age 24 and found a positive and
increasing impact of cognitive skills on wages; and (ii) indirect—e.g. Cunha et al. (2005) argue that cognitive
skills increase the likelihood of acquiring a higher level of education, which in turn leads to higher economic
returns.

Similarly, there is growing evidence that non-cognitive skills are also important for labor market
outcomes. Even though a more recent phenomenon, the empirical literature on the skills/labor market
outcomes nexus finds a strong and robust relationship between certain non-cognitive skills, such as
dependability, persistence, and docility and labor market outcomes (Heckman et al., 2006; Blom and Saeki,
2011; and Cunha and Heckman, 2010). A separate strand of the literature has argued that non-cognitive skills
are particularly valued in certain sectors (e.g. services). Finally, recent evidence in the context of high-income
countries has suggested that employers value non-cognitive abilities more than cognitive ability or
independent thought (e.g. Bowles et al., 2001).

All cognitive skills and most non-cognitive skills are higher among public and private sector employees
relative to the self-employed. In order to explore the relationship between a respondent’s skill set and the
quality of the job, the analysis from above is repeated restricting it to employment in the state administration,
SOEs as well as private enterprises employing more than 6 employees. The results below indicate that the
self-employed consistently score lower.

And, finally salaried workers in the formal sector possess better cognitive skills than salaried workers in the
informal sector. Consistent with the observation above, a higher skill set implies a higher chance of being in
a formal sector job, typically jobs in the state administration or state owned enterprise (SOE), as well as in a
medium or large privately owned company.

Box 4: Skills and migration in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan

Existing studies find that migrants and non-migrants differ with respect to education and skills.
Among the reasons are the selective migration of groups who can gain disproportionally from mobility
(Borjas, 1987), investments in higher education for those who aspire to migrate (Mountford, 1997), or
specific pre-migration investments in human capital (Danzer and Dietz, 2014). There is a broad range of
literature on the self-selection of migrants with respect to formal educational attainments (e.g., Chiquiar and
Hanson, 2005; Lanzona, 1998; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2005). However, evidence on the cognitive and non-
cognitive skill endowment of migrants is scarce.

An analysis of adults with the intention to migration in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan reveals
that working age adults who plan to migrate typically possess above average cognitive and non-
cognitive skills, compared to adults who have no migration plans (Figure 21). Note that this analysis
cannot be conducted for each of the countries separately because the sample size is too small. For cognitive
skills, the gap between working age adults who do and do not plan to migrate is sizeable for memory skills
(greater than 20% of a standard deviation) and modest for literacy skills, but there is no difference for
numeracy skills. For all measured non-cognitive skills, individuals with migration plans perform better than
individuals without migration intentions; the gap is especially large with respect to achievement striving,
reflecting the fact that migrating abroad implies a strongly positive contribution to family income in Central
Asia. The finding that individuals who are planning to migrate, on average, have better cognitive and non-
cognitive skills than others in the working-age population supports existing selection theories of migration.
The results also suggest that studies focusing exclusively on education may draw very different conclusions.

Similarly, migrants who have returned after working abroad have significantly higher cognitive and
non-cognitive skill outcomes than non-migrants (Figure 22). The gaps in cognitive skills between
migrants who have returned and non-migrants are very large in absolute terms and much larger than the gaps

                                                                                                         21
seen between adults who intend to migrate and adults who do not plan to migrate. While this potentially
implies learning effects through migration, it could also point to the fact that not all individuals who intend to
migrate follow through and actually migrate. On the other hand, the skills gaps between migrants who return
and non-migrants are lower than the gaps found between adults with the intention to migrate and working
age adults with no migration intentions. The notable exception is decision making, in which migrants who
return have high scores. Hence, while individuals who plan to migrate do not have much higher decision
making skills, actual migrants have much higher decision making skills. This result could point either to the
fact that adults with good decision making skills following through with their migration intentions, or that
migrants learn such decision making skills while abroad. Disentangling these different possibilities remains for
future research.

2.3    Workers with better skills use those skills more often in the workplace

Among the employed, individuals with higher cognitive skills are less likely to perform physically demanding
work, although perhaps not by as much as one might expect. The difference in physical activity is particularly
apparent for women, as 50 percent of women with low cognitive ability perform physical activities, as
compared to less than 30 percent of women with medium or high cognitive ability (Figure 23). Among men
with high cognitive ability, 57 percent engages in physically demanding work compared with 70 percent and
73 percent of medium, and low cognitive ability workers. Cognitive ability aside, physical work dominates in
the rural areas.

In addition, workers with higher cognitive skills tend to engage more in tasks requiring higher-level numeracy
skills. Figure 24 shows that workers with high numeracy ability are more likely to be using numeracy in tasks
on the job. Workers with high numeracy ability are twice as likely, on average, to calculate fractions, decimals
or percentages as individuals with lower numeracy skills. Meanwhile, individuals with higher cognitive skills
are almost three times more likely to use advanced numeracy skills on the job than their counterparts with
lower cognitive skills. These differences hold in urban and rural settings, and between men and women.

Workers with higher non-cognitive skills are also more likely to supervise others’ work. Workplace attitude is
a compilation of traits including having ideas others have not previously thought of; working very hard; and
enjoying working on things that take a long time to complete. Individuals with high workplace attitude are
more likely to supervise the work of others than those with low or medium workplace attitude (Figure 25).
This is particularly the case in rural areas and for men. Being more open and sociable also increases the
likelihood of having contact with people beyond one’s colleagues, such as clients, customers, or students,
allowing workers to increase their professional network.

2.4    There are deficiencies in the job search and skill signaling process


In sum, greater cognitive and non-cognitive skills correlate with better employment outcomes. Still,
respondent feedback suggests there is still considerable scope for improvement. Specifically, deficiencies in
job search methods and skill signaling among workers can also play an important role in explaining skill

                                                                 24
mismatches. Only about 40 percent of respondents report that they are able to certify or demonstrate their
qualifications to an employer, or have initial adequate qualifications (Figure 26). This aligns with findings that
workers’ qualifications are moderately applicable within the current labor market. Moreover, almost half of
respondents report significant barriers to learning about vacancies—an integral component to matching labor
supply and labor demand. 17 Almost half of respondents do not believe they have the means to learn about
job vacancies. And if they did, almost half feel unprepared to prepare a resume, perform in an interview, or
provide good recommendations.

is not the case for the rural population where access to the Internet is limited (World Bank, 2013b).

3     Skill Formation

This section first summarizes the literature on skills development and addresses a fundamental question for
the Kyrgyz Republic: does the education and training system impart the cognitive and non-cognitive skills
needed to successfully participate in the labor market?



3.1    Skills are formed throughout the life cycle

Skills are developed throughout all stages of life—from conception to preschool, primary, secondary, higher
education, and on the job—and there are sensitive and critical development periods for each type of skill.
Recent evidence suggests that the most sensitive and critical moments for skill building differ by skill type;
these “malleable” periods are depicted in green in Figure 27. Cognitive and non-cognitive skills are largely
formed earlier on in life, while technical skills are developed later.

The early childhood period is critical in the development of cognitive skills. This stage marks the first step of
skill-building, and it can be particularly critical in closing the gap between children from poorer and better-off
households. In fact, there are strong indications that the most critical moment for cognitive skill-building is
before a child turns 5. By ages 8 to 10, the foundation of an individual’s cognitive abilities is well set.
Technical skills are developed later—they are continuously developed throughout adolescence and into
adulthood. 18

Developing strong cognitive and non-cognitive skills early in the life cycle is imperative for building the skills
needed for productive employment later in the life cycle. Strong cognitive and non-cognitive skills feed into
the successful acquisition of technical skills, as solid cognitive and non-cognitive foundations will help
workers to strengthen their technical skills throughout their working lives. 19 These skills also shape the
capacity and motivation to absorb new knowledge, adapt, and solve new problems, thus affecting one’s ability
to learn across the life cycle. Such skills are crucial in a dynamic economy where specific skills can be
rendered obsolete. This is not to say that generic skills, particularly non-cognitive skills, are an alternative to
academic qualifications. Instead, careful attention to these skills is a powerful way to enhance educational
attainment, life-long learning, and employability. 20

3.2      Educational attainment rates are high, but the Kyrgyz Republic is missing important
         opportunities for skill development at various stages of the life cycle


Research shows that investing in children early can be the most cost-effective way to impart skills that
contribute to higher productivity later in life. The consequences of underinvestment in early childhood
development (ECD) are serious. Not only does early education help to build the foundation for learning skills
throughout life, but early childhood education is an important element in ensuring that youth have an
adequate amount of schooling to prepare them to enter the labor market. Early childhood development
includes not only the teaching of developmental skills to children, but also proper health care and nutrition.

The Kyrgyz Republic is investing in early childhood development through efforts to support appropriate
dietary consumption for pregnant women and children. Iron and folic acid deficiencies plague many children
in the region. The Government has sought to combat this with laws on salt iodization and flour enrichment.
The Ministry of Health has developed a nutrition strategy that emphasizes interventions targeted for young
children and pregnant women. 21

In addition, the Kyrgyz Republic passed a Law on Preschool Education in 2009, and investment in early
childhood education has increased in the last five years. However, at 24 percent, net enrolment rates for
children aged 3–5 remain low (Figure 28), and are well below the OECD average of 77 percent. Similarly,
enrollment among children under 3 years old is also well below the OECD average. Qualitative studies
suggest a lack of available pre-school facilities in the country. Those that are operational either have no space
to meet the demand or are too expensive for the general population. 22 Thus, one mechanism for addressing
the skill formation of future workers is to continue to create an enabling environment for early childhood
education and ensure access and quality to this education.

The next stage in skill formation is the formal education system. Overall, education completion rates are high
in Kyrgyz Republic. Only four percent of the population aged 25–29 has failed to complete at least secondary
general. Tertiary completion rates are 27 percent for the working age population. The overall tertiary
completion rate is higher than in OECD countries, where 23 percent of the working age population has
completed tertiary education. Tertiary education completion rates have continuously risen over the past 20
years, with various private institutions offering short practical programs. As many as 39 percent of 25- to 29-
year-olds have completed tertiary education. Finally, for individuals younger than 45, women are likely to
have a higher education level than men. For 25- to 29-year-olds, 56 percent of women have completed
secondary technical or university, while only 46 percent of men possess the same credentials. In addition to
the results presented, Appendix D: Summary Tables contains more detailed results on educational attainment
in Tajikistan among the working age population.

Changes in fields of study in tertiary education may illustrate some degree of the mismatch between skills and
the labor market. Figure 30 illustrates changes in fields of study between 2000 and 2010. In the Kyrgyz
Republic, more students chose to study services, health and welfare, and education in 2010 than in 2000. On
the other hand, fewer students opted to study social sciences, business, law, humanities, arts, engineering,
manufacturing and construction. Students are opting out of precisely those fields that require higher-level
skills, and which have an increased demand in the labor market of more modern economies. In particular,
professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics are considered critical to the development
of knowledge-intensive industries, but fewer students are choosing these fields in the Kyrgyz Republic. 23 The
change in fields of study may be related to the phenomenon whereby more and more students opting for
tertiary education as a means to postpone labor market entry. 24

Furthermore, the rise in tertiary education has been accompanied by a decline in secondary vocational
training. While consistent with the shift in the labor market toward the service sector, this may limit industrial
expansion. Many post-soviet countries experienced declines in production facilities after transition, and the
Kyrgyz vocational system lost its formal connection to the workplace. Professions offered in vocational
training are specialties that employers continue to recognize, but standards and equipment have deteriorated.
This deterioration has led to antiquated and low-quality content and an overall demise of the vocational
track. 25 While the agency responsible for vocational education and training has worked for many years to
improve employer involvement in vocational schools, their efforts are not widely considered successful.
Nonetheless, the analysis above showed that graduates from secondary technical/special institutions do tend
to have better labor market outcomes than those completing secondary general: women are more likely to
work, and both men and women with secondary technical/special are more likely to be in formal sector jobs.
Also note that in many countries, vocation graduates have employment gains at youth, but those gains may be
offset at older ages due to less adaptability and difficulties transitioning between jobs. 26 As a result, there are

many instances in which vocational education can remain a small part of an educational system, while the
emphasis can be on more adaptable skill development.

In 2012 the Kyrgyz Republic embarked on an ambitious education development strategy (EDS 2020). The
strategy is the first in the Kyrgyz Republic to include both general education and vocational education, and
sets development priorities. EDS 2020 focuses on quality, access, and inclusion. In addition, the strategy
focuses on the relevance of education to the labor market and employer interaction. 27

While the education system is traditionally relied upon to develop skills required for the labor market, skills
are also built outside of the formal system. Just as early education helps build skills before formal education
begins, professional education continues skill formation after formal education ends. After students leave the
formal system, on-the-job education and training can ensure that the workforce maintains adequate skills in a
rapidly changing economy. Ensuring adequate access to quality professional education is crucial for meeting
the skill needs of an expanding and rapidly changing economy. A significant portion of this learning takes
place as an adult in post-formal education. This includes skills acquired by performing specific tasks at work
and receiving on-the-job training. In the United States, it is estimated that on-the-job training contributes
approximately a quarter to half of all human capital. 28 Adult education and training also increases worker
productivity. A 2004 OECD study shows that employee training impacts the wage growth of both young and
highly educated employees.

Despite international evidence on the importance of post-formal education, few firms in the Kyrgyz Republic
offer formal training programs to full-time employees. Comparatively, Kyrgyz firms tend to underinvest in
their own employees, possibly as a result of market failures that dissuade such investments. Indeed, only
about 20 percent of all Kyrgyz firms offer their full-time employees formal training programs. In comparison,
almost 70 percent of Czech firms and 60 percent of Polish firms offer formal training to their full-time
employees (Figure 31). Kyrgyz firms fall significantly below the proportion of firms offering training in
Eastern Europe and neighboring countries.

3.3       Cognitive skill outcomes and educational attainment are correlated, but wide variations
          exist within education levels


International PISA results capture cognitive skills of the new generation of labor market entrants, and as such
act as a measure for the quality of education today. OECD PISA tests directly capture the reading, math, and
science abilities of 15 year olds, or cognitive abilities. Recent evidence shows that the tests also capture
differences in motivation, attention and persistence, or non-cognitive skills. 29 Such assessments are critical in
making informed policy and management decisions about learning and labor market outcomes. PISA
participation has led a number of countries to realize that their education systems are greatly in need of
reform and it has prompted reforms. While there are several examples, Germany and Poland are good
examples of countries that were spurred by weak PISA results to reform their education systems and thereby
improve their PISA performance.

Kyrgyz Republic was one of the few CIS countries to participate in PISA in 2006 and 2009. Scores improved
between the two testing periods in all three categories, but remained low. Even in 2009, 83 percent of
students still tested at or below the threshold for functional literacy. Thus, 83 percent of students were unable
to read and draw useful information from a simple text. In addition, 81.9 percent scored at or below basic
proficiency in science, and 86.6 percent scored at or below basic proficiency in math. Thus, the majority of
students did not reach the lowest level of foundation skills and remain without a minimum level of skills to
succeed in the knowledge economy.

Among adults, tertiary and secondary technical/special graduates display significantly higher cognitive abilities
than secondary general graduates, although there is considerable overlap across education levels. While
cognitive ability increases with education (Figure 32), heterogeneity is high within education categories. A
significant number of higher education graduates have lower or equivalent cognitive ability as individuals with
a general secondary education, and vice versa (Figure 33). The commonalities between education levels
suggest that issues with education quality may exist.

Tertiary graduates also have higher non-cognitive skills than secondary general and technical/special
graduates, but here too there is considerable overlap across education levels. While individuals with a
secondary vocational education scored relatively similar to individuals with a tertiary education on cognitive
skills, individuals with a tertiary education appear to have significantly higher non-cognitive skills. These
results are more pronounced for men than women (Figure 34). However, as with cognitive skills, there is a

Having attended an early childhood education program in the Kyrgyz Republic is significantly correlated with
cognitive skills later in life, even after controlling for educational attainment. Adults that have completed at

least one year in preschool as a child on average do significantly better on both cognitive skill tests (including
memory, literacy, and numeracy) and non-cognitive skills (such as openness, workplace attitude, and
achievement striving) than adults who did not go to preschool. When demographic characteristics such as
age, gender, marital status, area, and (most importantly) educational attainment are taken into account, having
attended preschool as a child remains a significant correlate of cognitive ability and in particular numeracy
skills and, to a lesser extent, literacy skills. Non-cognitive skills are also robust to controlling for such
background characteristics, openness, workplace attitude and achievement striving in particular (Figure 36).

4    The Skills Roadmap in the Kyrgyz Republic

The Kyrgyz economy is changing and with it the demands for skills. The service sector has been growing fast
and the industrial sector has also started to grow. These structural changes, as well as the Kyrgyz aspiration
more broadly to become a middle income country, require a different, more diverse skill set of the labor
force, which includes non-cognitive skills alongside high quality cognitive and technical skills. Policies can
target the future workforce, usually by focusing on families and communities and the formal education
system, and/or the current workforce, by focusing on adult training institutions and on-the-job training by
firms (Figure 37).

The development of skills policies can be informed by the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity
(STEP) Framework (see Box 5). The STEP Framework contains five steps to improve employability and
productivity in a country: (1) getting children off to the right start; (2) ensuring that all students learn; (3)
building job-relevant skills that employers demand; (4) encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation; and (5)
matching the supply of skills with employer demand. These steps apply to all countries, with the degree of
emphasis varying depending on the government’s strategic vision, which in turn is constrained by budget and
capacity constraints.




                                                          36
Box 5: The STEP Framework

The following is a summary of the STEP conceptual framework which brings together research-based
evidence and practical experience from diverse areas

Step 1. Getting children off to the right start: by developing the technical, cognitive, and non-cognitive skills
conducive to high productivity and flexibility in the work environment through early child education (ECE),
with an emphasis on nutrition, stimulation, and basic cognitive skills. Research shows that handicaps
developed early in life are difficult if not impossible to remedy later and that effective ECE programs can
have a very high payoff.

Step 2. Ensuring that all students learn: by building stronger education systems with clear learning standards,
good teachers, adequate resources, and a proper regulatory environment. Lessons from research and on-the-
ground experience indicate that the key decisions about education systems are how much autonomy to allow
and to whom, how much accountability to expect from whom and for what, and how to assess performance
and results.

Step 3. Building job-relevant skills that employers demand: by developing the right incentive framework for both pre-
employment and on-the-job training programs and institutions (including higher education). A growing body
of experience is showing how public and private efforts can be combined to achieve more relevant and
responsive training systems.

Step 4. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation: by creating an environment that encourages investments in
knowledge and creativity. Emerging evidence shows this requires innovation-specific skills (which can be
developed starting early in life) and investments to connect people with ideas (such as through collaborations
between universities and private companies) as well as risk-management tools that facilitate innovation.

Step 5. Matching the supply of skills with employer demand: by moving toward more flexible, efficient, and secure
labor markets. Avoiding rigid job protection regulations while strengthening income protection systems,
complemented by efforts to provide information and intermediation services to workers and firms, make up
the final complementary step that enables skills to be transformed into actual employment and productivity.

Within the STEP framework, the findings in this report point to several priority areas of public policies that
can strengthen the quality, relevance, and use of skills over the life-cycle:

     1. To get children off to the right start by continuing to emphasize public policies that seek faster universal
        access to early childhood development services, building on the nutrition and preschool strategies,
        and the recent findings from the institutional SABER ECD review 30 (see Appendix F: SABER ECD
        2013—Summary of policy options to improve ECD in the Kyrgyz Republic). These efforts should
        be promoted as an integral part of a strategy to build strong skills for the future.

     2. Ensuring that all students learn and build job-relevant skills that employers demand by building on public
        policies, such as the education development strategy (EDS 2020), that:

               •    Seek to build strong non-cognitive skills at all education levels, alongside strong cognitive
                    skills. Non-cognitive skills are already important in today’s labor market and are likely to

                                                         37
                       become more important for tomorrow’s labor market. Given the low secondary general
                       performance, a particular focus on strengthening secondary general education is particularly
                       important.

                  •    Promote non-cognitive skill building in schools. An increasing number of countries
                       worldwide have implemented national legislation to promote non-cognitive skill building in
                       schools, including Australia, Colombia, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom 31, and are
                       integrating non-cognitive learning into the regular school curriculum by training teachers,
                       adopting a structured curriculum, evaluating students, and investing in efforts to improve the
                       school climate. Schools provide an ideal environment for early cognitive and non-cognitive
                       skills development, given that children are typically in a single classroom with a single
                       teacher and the same group of peers for an entire school year. This “single point of entry”
                       reduces the costs of interventions and increases the likelihood of a positive impact on skills
                       development.

                  •    Emphasize systematic measurement of skills alongside education and labor market
                       outcomes. For example, carrying out national and international student assessments can help
                       to inform policy makers about the quality of secondary general education for preparing
                       students for the labor market.

                  •    Encourage more students to invest in technical/science training, both at the secondary and
                       tertiary level. This may also include demand-side policies that aim to improve basic
                       information on labor market outcomes for graduates of different degrees and specializations
                       (and thus also fall under STEP point 5: matching the supply of skills with employer demand), and
                       supply-side policies that aim to make these types of technical/science trainings more
                       accessible/attractive.

         3. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation by emphasizing public policies that:

                  •    Encourage firms to enhance skills use and skills investments. Building job-relevant skills will
                       require a multi-pronged effort that includes: (i) addressing the technical or job-specific skills
                       gaps by implementing labor market programs; and (ii) addressing market failures that
                       prevent firms from providing on-the-job training (OJT) and incentivizing firms to provide
                       OJT.

                  •    Support migrants to build more skills to increase their earning capacity and therefore their
                       ability to support their families. To do so, policy makers can introduce pre-departure training
                       programs for migrants to ensure that they have the basic language skills and knowledge of
                       social services provision and migrant protection programs. The Philippines, for example,
                       carries out pre-departure reviews and approvals of contract terms, in addition to providing a
                       mandatory pre-departure orientation. Better prepared migrants can find better quality jobs
                       that build more skills and provide greater earnings, which can boost remittances and boost
                       skills levels of return migrants.

Development and Scoring

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 34-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to assess five
different “cognitive” skills. These cognitive skills can be conceptualized as falling into two domains:

    (1) Executive functioning skills, defined as the cognitive control capacities that enable individuals to
        “organize their thinking and behavior with flexibility, decrease their reactive responding to contextual
        cues and contingencies, and engage in self-regulated … behavior” (Welsh et al., 2010). Researchers in
        developmental psychology and elsewhere propose that such skills are important for school readiness
        and labor force attainment since they enable individuals to regulate cognitive and emotional
        responses that in turn allow individuals to engage more effectively in learning activities (Fuchs et al.,
        2005). We assessed one component of executive functioning—working memory—using a 12-item
        memory scale adopted from the Skills and Labor Market Survey (ENHAB) 32. These items tested the
        short-term recall of increasingly longer number sequences (starting with two numbers and ending
        with 9 numbers). Enumerators gave respondents three practice examples with two-number
        sequences to train the respondents on how to answer the questions, and were instructed to read out
        numbers at a regular pace to avoid grouping.

    (2) Domain-specific skills, consisting of “knowledge of ideas, facts and definitions, as well as … formulas
        and rules” (Boekarts, 1997, p. 164) about specific domains such as literacy and numeracy. In turn,
        each broader domain can be conceptualized as including other branches; mathematics, for example,
        includes concepts such as number recognition, arithmetic, and graph comprehension (Fuchs et al.,
        2005; Pinker, 1990). In this study, we assessed various concepts within the domains of literacy and
        numeracy using multiple-choice questions with four answer choices. Within literacy, these concepts
        include: (1) semantics, assessed using seven items, with five items assessing respondents’ familiarity
        with vocabulary, one item testing understanding of a national idiom, and one item measuring
        comprehension of the meaning of a complex sentence; 33 (2) reading comprehension, assessed by asking
        respondents to read a 257-word non-technical narrative text and then answering five questions about
        the text; and (3) information comprehension, assessed using four items based on instructions for taking a
        medicine and reading a timetable describing inter-city bus schedules. Within numeracy, concepts
        include: (1) arithmetic, assessed using three questions about prices in an advertisement; and (2) graph
        comprehension, assessed using three questions based on a graph of Bulgaria’s population growth from
        1900 to 2011. The items assessing reading comprehension and semantics were taken from existing
        instruments fielded by the World Bank with Bulgarian students, while the items assessing
        mathematics and information comprehension were adapted from the Adult Literacy and Lifeskills
        Survey (Murray, Clermont, & Binkley, 2005).

32 The ENHAB is a recent survey in Peru which gathers data on cognitive and socio-emotional test scores, individual’s

characteristics, educational trajectory, and wages.
33 An issue with translation of the items comprising the semantics scale rendered the data from this set of items

unusable. The semantics scale was thus not considered for analysis, leaving the total number of assessed skills at five.

                                                          46
These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover, executive
functioning skills and domain-specific skills are related: A number of recent studies provide evidence that
executive functioning skills such as working memory actually contribute to the development of literacy and
numeracy skills (Blair & Razza, 2010; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng. 2008). From a policy perspective, this
suggests that educators should focus on the promotion of both executive functioning and domain-specific
skills, particularly in the pre-school and elementary school years when such functions are most malleable to
intervention (Welsh et al., 2010).

Analysis Strategy

All missing values were recoded as incorrect answers, resulting in a set of 33 dichotomous or binary items. 34
In choosing how to score the items, we were motivated by a primary concern of reducing the measurement
error in each score. That is, when we administer a survey measure or test, we want to ensure that the
variability in scores is due to what we are trying to measure - in this study, executive functioning or domain-
specific skills - as opposed to error or bias. Traditional or unrefined methods of scoring - such as summing
the survey items - do not account for this measurement error, leading to bias in future regression analyses (for
more information, see Box C1, “What is Factor Analysis and Why do We Use It?” in Appendix C). Refined
scoring methods that account for measurement error include the production of factor scores using factor
analysis or item response theory (IRT) methods.

Box B1: What is Item Response Theory and When Can We Use It?

Item Response Theory (IRT) is an approach, or family of statistical models, used to analyze assessment item
data, such as cognitive skills assessment data. Several IRT models have been developed to estimate ability or
person parameters that are scored either dichotomously (i.e. only two response categories) or polytomously
(i.e. more than two response categories; Hambleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991). Traditionally, IRT has
been used for educational applications for Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), test score equating, item
analysis, and test banking. However, due to the advantages of IRT, other disciplines have recently developed
an interest in using IRT for scoring, validation, and other psychometric analyses (Reise & Henson, 2003).

There are two over-arching families of item response models which differ greatly in theoretical and
mathematical background and analysis. The first of the two families, the logistic models, relate examinee
ability (θ) and item parameters using logistic functions. The logistic family of IRT models allow for the
estimation of up to three item parameters, or characteristics. The one-parameter (1PL) model is the most
basic and involves, as the name states, only one item parameter: the b-parameter is included in every IRT
model and is considered the difficulty parameter (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006). The b-parameter is at the point on
the θ scale where the probability of a correct response is equal to 0.50 and typically varies from -2.00 to 2.00
(Hambleton et al., 1991; Yen & Fitzpatick, 2006), increasing as items become more difficult. The two-
parameter model (2PL) includes a second item parameter, the discrimination parameter, a. a is the slope of
the item characteristic curve (ICC) at the point of inflection and the higher the value of a, the more sharp the
discrimination (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006). Finally, the three-parameter model (3PL) includes the c-parameter,
called the guessing or pseudo-chance parameter. This parameter was introduced to account for the possibility


34 Ideally, we would be able to identify four, not two, sets of responses: answered correctly; answered incorrectly; not

answered and didn’t know; and not answered due to time constraints or motivation but known. While such codes were
initially included in the survey instrument, issues with data processing rendered such codes unusable. We were thus
forced to collapse the codes into a dichotomous response: correct or incorrect. The implications of this choice are
discussed further in the Implications and Future Directions section.

that even students with low ability have some chance of answering even difficult questions correctly. This
parameter is not always necessary, and if set to zero, equates the 3PL with the 2PL (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006).

One of the big advantages of using IRT is that the ability or person parameters (θ) are not item or test
dependent, and item and test characteristics are not dependent on the ability or person parameters. This is
called the property of invariance (Hambleton et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). It means that the test and item parameters
remain the same regardless of the sample of respondents, and the ability or person parameters do not vary
depending on the test items administered or the time of test, provided the items are relevant to and
representative of the same domain of interest.

Although there are clear benefits to the invariance property, there are two integral assumptions of IRT. First,
there is an assumption regarding the dimensionality of the underlying ability or trait. While there are multi-
dimensional IRT models (MIRT), the traditional IRT model requires that a single trait or ability accounts for
an individual’s θ score. When this assumption of the data holds, the examinees can be placed along a single,
meaningful scale (Hambleton et al., 1991). Second, there is the assumption of local item independence. When the
items on an assessment are locally independent, a response to any item is independent of a response to any
other item on the same assessment for a given individual. This assumption allows us to determine the
probability of an individual response pattern occurring given the individual’s ability or trait level (Hambleton
et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). If either of these assumptions is not met, item and person parameters will not be
properly estimated and thus, indefensible.

In addition to these assumptions, an assessment of model-data fit is also important in IRT. A poorly specified
model creates problems with estimating both item parameters and θ scores. Consider the following: An
analyst mistakenly specifies a model which only specifies two parameters when in fact the data fit a model
consisting of three item parameters. Because the pseudo-guessing parameter has not been specified, the θ
values may be over-estimated as the individual’s ability to correctly guess the answer has not been taken into
consideration. Guessing is not considered to be included in ability and, as such, it should not be allowed to
unduly influence scores. While IRT provides distinct advantages to classical methods of analyzing assessment
data, these advantages come with several very restrictive assumptions which, if violated, calls into question
the validity of the results.



In order to assess whether it was appropriate to employ an IRT model with this data, we decided to first
empirically determine the dimensionality of the items by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with
an oblimax rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by country (N = 3,965). 35 Should a
one-factor model provide a good fit to the data, we would be able to proceed with IRT analyses. Should a
multi-factor model provide a good fit to the data, the dimensionality assumption required by IRT
methodologies would be violated. In that case, we proceed by examining the results of the EFA and
confirming the factor structure using the second half of the sample (N = 3,964). All analyses were conducted
in MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any clustering of the data due to
sampling design. 36 Responses were treated as ordered categorical data to account for the skewed nature of the
data.


35An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
36In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan—up to two individuals per household were administered the non-
cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to individuals being nested
in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.

                                                          48
Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual scores on
each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor scoring is preferable in
this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account for: (1) the weight of individual
item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the factors and measurement error (DiStephano,
Zhu, & Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in MPLUS,
which accounts for the non-normal distribution of item response (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012).

Results

The initial EFA indicated that a one-factor model did not provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (324) = 8981.68,
CFI: .888, RMSEA: .082, .081 < 95% CI < .084). 37 Thus we decided that it was not feasible to proceed with
an IRT analysis due to the plausibility of violating the dimensionality assumption. In examining the factor
loadings, we noted that the 12 items making up the original construct of working memory loaded cleanly onto
one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the exploratory analyses. We then chose a 2-factor
solution to model associations between the remaining 15 items. This model provided a good fit to the data (χ2
(76) = 1261.15, CFI=.951, RMSEA=.063, .060 < 95% CI < .066) while modeling the observed indicators
parsimoniously.

A confirmatory factor analysis then confirmed the fit of a 3-factor model for all 27 items in which factors
were allowed to correlate (χ2 (321) = 3128.37, CFI=.981, RMSEA=.033, .032 < 95% CI < .034). 38 The three
identified factors described in Table 1, below, were: (1) Working Memory (12 items); (2) Reading
Comprehension (5 items); and (3) Informational Numeracy (10 items). In addition, preliminary measurement
equivalence analyses indicate that this same factor structure provides a good fit to the data in Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan (χ2 (97c3) = 10531.15, CFI=.953, RMSEA=.061, .060 < 95% CI < .062). 39 Finally,
given the high correlation between the literacy and informational numeracy items, initial analyses were also
conducted to determine whether a higher-order “cognitive” factor may account for the covariation between
factors (Cattell, 1978). 40 This model was uninterpretable due to factor loadings above 1.

37 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit to the

data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the data while a
CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
38 Factor correlations in the CFA were: Working Memory-Literacy (r=.428, p<.001), Working Memory-Informational

Numeracy (r=.480, p<.001), and Literacy-Informational Numeracy (r=.69, p<.001).
39 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same way

across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that the same
factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the samples from all three
countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of which increases our certainty that
observed differences between countries is attributable only to true differences in the variability of the scores.
40 For over a century, researchers have been interested in defining and measuring an overall measure of cognitive ability,

or “g” factor (Jensen, 1998; Heckman, Stixrud, & Urzua, 2006). It is beyond the scope of this paper to comment
extensively on such research; however, as developmental psychologists with an interest in applying research to policy, we
take the position that it is useful to identify and understand the components of cognitive ability to better design programs
to support the development of such skills.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the cognitive skills module is best represented by three related
factors that correspond to some—but not all—of the five cognitive skills described above. For example, our
analyses indicated items 1-12 all indexed the hypothesized underlying executive functioning skill of Working
Memory, while items 13-17 corresponded to the hypothesized underlying domain-specific skill of Reading
Comprehension. Substantively, this indicates that individuals that have higher Working Memory factor scores
are better able to temporarily store and manipulate information that is necessary for domain-specific cognitive
tasks such as reading comprehension (Baddeley, 1992). Individuals with higher Reading Comprehension
scores have a better ability to read and process text and understand its meaning than individuals with lower
Reading Comprehension scores (National Reading Panel, 2000).

The other factor represented in the data is a combination of items meant to index facets of both Literacy
(items 18-21) and Numeracy (items 22-27). This pattern of relationships can be understood in that the
Information Comprehension items all involved number recognition (a component of numeracy), while the
Numeracy items all tapped the ability to locate and use information contained in various formats such as
advertisements and graphs (a component of information comprehension). Individuals who score highly on

                                                      50
Informational Numeracy have the ability to recognize and manipulate numbers contained in and represented
by various formats.

There are three things to consider when interpreting the above analysis. First, the factor scores created
through the factor analysis procedures described above are not invariant across different tests assessing
cognitive ability. While such scores could have resulted from using IRT methodologies, we have evidence that
using IRT with this cognitive assessment is not defensible given the likely violation of the assumption of
dimensionality and as a result, item dependence. As such, we proceeded with creating refined factor scores
that—although they do not inherently have the property of invariance—reduce the amount of measurement
error contained in the scores. It should be noted, however, that invariance is a property that can be assessed
through the use of factor analytic methods. Second, many of the items included in the cognitive skills
assessment are not “clean” items. That is, they assess more than one skill at the same time: Items meant to
tap the construct of Arithmetic, for example, also involve elements of reading comprehension and
information comprehension. The factors—particularly Reading Comprehension and Information
Numeracy—are thus highly correlated, which may be problematic for establishing predictive validity. To
address this, we recommend that future analyses with this data consider a bi-factor analysis in which
orthogonal or non-correlated grouping factors are created by allowing a “general” trait to correlate with the
items (Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Finally, as noted in footnote 2, we were limited in our ability to
discriminate between correct, incorrect, and missing answers due to issues in data processing. Given that
missing answers were all recoded to be incorrect, it is likely that the scores underestimate the cognitive ability
level present in the sample population. To address this, we recommend that future data collection activities
carefully assess the type and extent of missing data to allow for better sensitivity tests of results to such
specifications.

Development and Scoring

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 33-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to assess 11
different “non-cognitive” skills (see Table C1, below; Duckworth & Guerra, 2012). These non-cognitive skills
can be conceptualized as falling into two domains:

        (1) Personality traits, defined as enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving which are
            relatively stable across time and situations (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, & ter Weel, 2008;
            Paunonen, 2003). The “Big Five” factors of personality—openness, conscientiousness,
            extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability)—are the most widely
            accepted taxonomy of broad personality traits (Goldberg, 1990), having been validated for use
            across developmental stages (John & Srivastava, 1999) and cultures (Soto, John, Gosling, &
            Potter, 2008). The survey assessed each of these five factors with three items in the short Big
            Five Inventory (BFI-S) originally developed by John and Srivastava (1999) and later validated in
            large-scale panel surveys (Lang et al., 2011). Given its association with important labor market
            outcomes, assessed grit—a component of conscientiousness—was also assessed, with three
            items from the Grit Scale (Duckworth et al., 2007).

        (2)   Socio-emotional skills, defined as the learned knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to understand
              and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, establish and maintain positive
              relationships, and make responsible decisions (CASEL, 2014). Although different cultures may
              differentially name, conceptualize, and prioritize such skills, socio-emotional skills and learning
              are of critical importance across all regions of the world (Torrente, Alimchandani, & Aber, in
              press). There does not currently exist an organization of socio-emotional skills similar to that
              developed for personality traits; as such this survey measures socio-emotional skills that are both
              valued by employers in countries in Europe and Central Asia (World Bank, 2009, 2013) and
              amenable to intervention efforts (Yeager & Dweck, 2012). These skills include: hostile bias (2
              items; Dodge, 2003), decision-making (4 items; Mann, Burnett, Radford, & Ford, 1997),
              achievement-striving, and self-control (3 items and 2 items, respectively; Goldberg et al., 2006).
              In addition, the fixed vs. growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is fixed versus malleable,
              was measured (4 items; Yeager & Dweck, 2012).

These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover, personality traits
and socio-emotional skills are related: individuals with certain personality traits may tend to employ certain
socio-emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). For program and policy purposes, however, there is a key distinction
between personality traits and socio-emotional skills: while personality traits are predictive of labor market
outcomes, they are less amenable to direct change via intervention. Socio-emotional skills, however, have
been shown to be malleable to various intervention efforts across cultures (e.g., Jones, Brown, Aber, 2011;
Torrente et al., 2014). In turn, building socio-emotional skills can result in changes to enduring patterns of
thinking and behaving (Dweck, 2008).

Analysis Strategy

Our initial analyses revealed three main issues with the data. First, correlations between items in the same
groupings (e.g., openness, grit) were low—generally ranging from .2 - .4—suggesting that each item is
measuring a different facet of the grouping. Second, sum-scoring items according to the 11 hypothesized
constructs and computing reliability coefficients indicated the scores were composed of a significant degree
of measurement error. Third, the distribution of item responses across the Likert scales deviated substantially
from normality, invalidating the assumptions inherent in traditional statistical measurement techniques. To
address these issues, factor analyses were conducted in a multi-step process.

Given that the non-cognitive skills module has never before been administered in the countries of interest in
this study, we decided to proceed by first conducting exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) with an oblimax
rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by country (N = 3,885). 42 In doing so, we are
not making a priori assumptions about the factor structure of the module in these new contexts. Then, to
support the EFA results, the factor structure was confirmed (in a confirmatory factor analysis, or CFA) using
the second half of the sample (N = 3,887). All analyses were conducted in MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–
2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any clustering of the data due to sampling design. 43 Responses were
treated as ordered categorical data to account for the skewed nature of the data, and full information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was employed to handle missing data. 44




42 An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
43 In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan—up to two individuals per household were administered the non-
cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to individuals being nested
in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.
44 FIML utilizes all available data points, even for cases with missing item responses, by assessing during parameter

estimation missing data patterns as well as by using information from all available data points. While FIML does not
impute missing data, its use of information from all observed data is conceptually similar to missing data imputation,
where a missing value is computed conditioned on several other included variables (Muthén, Kaplan, and Hollis, 1987).
In this sample, 120 cases did not have data on any of the items and were removed from the analysis.

Box C1: What is Factor Analysis and Why Do We Use it?

Factor analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to examine the relationship between observed items
or indicators (see Table C1, above) and unobserved latent constructs or factors that are hypothesized to underlie
the associations between indicators (in this study, openness, conscientiousness, etc.). There are three primary
goals of or reasons to use factor analysis: (1) data reduction; (2) scale structure; and (3) to reduce
measurement error. First, survey instruments provide a lot of data—some surveys to assess adult personality
factors include over 500 items. Not only is it not practical to analyze that much data, but testing effects on
multiple discrete indicators increases the likelihood of having a “false positive,” or Type I error. Factor
analysis assists with data reduction by establishing a lesser number of factors that account for the variation
between indicators. Second, surveys are frequently designed to capture multiple constructs (in our study,
various personality traits and socio-emotional skills) using items that may relate more strongly to some
constructs than others. For example, in our study, the item “Do you think about how the things you do will
affect your future?” may be a better indicator of Decision Making than, “Do you ask for help when you don't
understand something?” Factor analysis allows us to understand the internal scale structure by quantifying the
number of factors in the data and the extent to which items are related to each factor. Finally, when we
administer a survey measure or test, we want to ensure that the variability in scores is due to what we are
trying to measure—in this study, personality traits or socio-emotional skills—as opposed to error or bias.
Traditional or unrefined methods of scoring—such as summing the survey items—do not account for this
measurement error, leading to biases in regression analyses. Factor analysis allows us to adjust for measurement
error by fitting an underlying model accounting for both variation among observed items and random error
variance.

There are two primary types of factor analysis: exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA). While both EFA and CFA attempt to model the relationship between observed items using a
smaller set of latent constructs, they differ in the a priori restrictions that are placed on the model. EFA is a
data-driven technique that is primarily used when the factor structure (e.g, the appropriate number of
underlying factors and the relationships of the items to the factors) is unknown, whether because the survey
has never been administered before or is being administered in new contexts. In CFA, a researcher uses a
strong theoretical foundation to specify at the outset the number of hypothesized factors and the patterns of
how the items relate to the factors. This solution is then evaluated with respect to how well it fits the
observed data. EFA is used most frequently early in the process of scale development, while CFA is used
once the researcher has established the factor structure based on prior empirical and theoretical grounds.



Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual scores on
each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor scoring is preferable in
this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account for: (1) the weight of individual
item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the factors and measurement error (DiStephano,
Zhu, & Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created based on the exploratory factor analysis solution using
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in MPLUS, which accounts for the non-normal distribution of item
response (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012).

Results

The initial EFA revealed two groupings of items: those that loaded well onto one factor, and those that did
not. The 4 items making up the original construct of “Fixed Versus Growth Mindset” loaded cleanly onto
one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the exploratory analyses; it was subsequently
confirmed to provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (2) = 27.52, CFI: .996, RMSEA: .057, .039 < 95% CI



                                                       57
< .077). 45 Also removed from analyses at this juncture were items that loaded below .2 on any construct and
items that were reverse coded due to factor-item correlations in unexpected directions. We then chose a 4-
factor solution to model associations between the remaining 18 items; in this solution, items were allowed to
cross-load on multiple factors and factors were allowed to correlate. 46 This model provided an excellent fit to
the data (χ2 (87) = 530.89, CFI=.985, RMSEA=.036, .033 < 95% CI < .039) while modeling the observed
indicators parsimoniously.

The four identified factors described in Table C2, below, were: (1) Openness to New Ideas and People (5
items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are you interested in learning new things?”); (2) Workplace
Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that take a very long time to
complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”); (3) Decision Making (5 items; e.g., “Do you think about
how the things you do will affect others?”; “Do you think carefully before making an important decision?”);
and (4) Achievement Striving (3 items; “Do you do more than is expected of you?”). As detailed above,
confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the fit of this model (χ2 (129) = 2336.52, CFI=.922,
RMSEA=.066, .064 < 95% CI < .069). In addition, preliminary measurement equivalence analyses indicate
that this same factor structure provides a good fit to the data in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan (χ2
(459) = 69484.24, CFI=.932, RMSEA=.068, .066 < 95% CI < .070). 47

45 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit to the
data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the data while a
CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
46 Factor correlations in the final EFA ranged from .1 to .65. The highest correlations were: Openness-Decision Making

(.535), Openness-Achievement Striving (.556), and Decision Making-Achievement Striving (.65).
47 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same way

across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that the same
factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the samples from all three
countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of which increases our certainty that
observed differences between countries is attributable only to true differences in the variability of the scores.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the non-cognitive skills module is best represented by five factors
that correspond to some—but not all—of the 11 personality traits and socio-emotional skills described in
Table C1. For example, our analyses indicated that items 19-22 and 16-18 index the hypothesized underlying
socio-emotional skills Fixed Versus Growth Mindset and Achievement Striving, respectively. Substantively,
this indicates that individuals that have higher Achievement Striving factor scores tend to strive to go “above
and beyond” and to do more than is expected of them, while individuals who have higher Fixed Versus
Growth Scores tend to believe new skills can be learned.

The other three factors represented in the data are combinations of items meant to index both personality
traits and socio-emotional skills; this pattern of relationships can be understood in that certain personality
traits tend to be related to certain learned attitudes and skills. For example, our factor of Decision Making
consists of items originally thought to index both decision-making skills and the trait of grit. In this case,
individuals who think carefully and thoroughly about the repercussions of their decisions and behaviors (see
items 12–15) tend to follow through with their actions (see item 11)—perhaps anticipating the repercussions
of not following through. Our factor of Workplace Attitudes and Behaviors consists of items meant to index
both Grit and Hostile Bias. Individuals who work very hard when others take a break (see items 6–8) may
tend to feel that others take advantage of them or are mean (see items 9–10). Thus individuals who score
higher on this construct may be workers who work hard and are innovative but perceive interactions with
others as hostile; individuals who score lower on this construct tend to work less hard and on discrete
projects, without perceiving workplace interactions as negative. Finally, our construct of Openness to New
Ideas and People reflects items thought to index the personality traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and
openness. Individuals who score high on this construct are social and open to new ideas, people, and things
(see items 1–5).

There are two plausible reasons why the data did not reflect the expected 11 traits and skills. First, only 2–4
items were used to originally index each trait/skill; this may not have been enough to validly and reliably fully
“capture” the constructs of interest. Instead, these items appear to reflect weak to moderately related aspects
of a trait/skill that co-vary with aspects of other traits/skills. This is unsurprising given demonstrated


                                                         59
correlations between: (a) Big Five personality traits (Digman, 1997); and (b) personality traits and socio-
emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). To address this issue, future surveys should consider including a broader
range of items to represent each trait/skill. A second explanation that we cautiously proffer is that the items
do not relate to each other in the same way in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan as in the samples from
which the items were developed. For example, in the Grit scale in this sample, “finishing what was begun” is
not related to “enjoying working on things that take a long time to complete.” In ECA contexts, grit might
not be well indexed by such behaviors. To investigate this, future research should: (1) conduct qualitative
