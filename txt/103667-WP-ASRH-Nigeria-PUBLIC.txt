Abstract: This study examines the determinants of adolescent sexual behavior and
fertility in Nigeria, with a special focus on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of
adolescents aged 10-19 years old in Karu Local Government Authority (LGA), a peri-urban
area near the capital city of Abuja. Using the last three waves of Demographic and Health
Surveys (2003, 2008, 2013), focus group discussions, stakeholder interviews, and a
specialized survey of 643 girls and boys aged 10-19 years old in Karu LGA, the study
narrows in on key challenges to and opportunities for improving adolescent sexual and
reproductive health outcomes.

The national median age at sexual debut for adolescent girls and boys is between 15 and
16 years of age. This is closely emulated in Karu LGA with a median age of 14.8 years for
girls and 15.3 years for boys. While data on pregnancies was limited in the Karu sample,
DHS data show that for girls, sexual debut is closely associated with marriage or
cohabitation, which in turn is a strong predictor of adolescent fertility. Poverty is another
strong predictor, with the odds of becoming pregnant being twice as high for adolescents
in the lower wealth quintiles compared to their counterparts in the richest quintile in the
country. While adolescents’ knowledge of contraception has increased from under 10
percent to over 30 percent, use of health services among adolescents for SRH (and
contraception) is limited due to factors such as fear of stigma, embarrassment, and poor
access to services, something also emphasized in focus group discussions.

Challenges for improving adolescent SRH outcomes relate to: (i) the paucity of data,
especially on the 10-14 year olds; (ii) availability and access to youth-friendly services and
the Family Life and HIV Education (FLHE); (iii) reaching out-of-school adolescents with
SRH information; and (iv) addressing ambiguities and gaps in Federal law and customs on
age at marriage, and generating support for the legal age at marriage of at least 18 years
old. Addressing these barriers at the State and sub-regional levels is going to be critical in
improving adolescent well-being.

Adolescents around the world face tremendous challenges to meeting their sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) needs. Inadequate access to health information and services,
poverty, inequitable gender norms, and conservative social norms contribute to a lack of
knowledge and awareness about puberty, sexuality, and basic human rights, which can
have serious implications on their health and welfare as well as that of their off-spring. For
example, an unwanted teenage pregnancy can not only limit the life chances of the
adolescent, but also those of her child. In comparison to children and adults, adolescent
health needs pose unique challenges to the health care system. For instance, an adolescent
may feel uncomfortable talking about body changes, if at all, to a complete stranger, or in
front of her/his parent. Adolescents may want to use contraception, but a service provider
may not provide these without parental consent; or because of personal bias. The hours of
service provision or location may not be user-friendly for someone between the ages of 10-
19 years, or of a particular gender. These issues have implications for inclusive growth and
shared prosperity.

This study was conducted as part of the Economic and Sector Work (ESW) on adolescent
sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) titled “Paving the Path to Improved Adolescent
Sexual and Reproductive Health”, and aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the
adolescent sexual behavior and fertility and its policy implications. The scope of the study
was developed and conducted in collaboration with the country health team, and was
designed as a knowledge and learning exercise looking at this very specific population of
adolescents and/or youth between the ages of 10 and 19 years (with two distinct brackets
of 10-14 and 15-19), to understand the challenges adolescents face, how these are being
addressed, what gaps exists, and how can these be filled.

In recent years, universal health coverage (UHC) has gained momentum, with the World
Health Assembly and the United Nations General Assembly calling on countries to
“urgently and significantly scale up efforts to accelerate the transition towards universal
access to affordable and quality healthcare services.” The UHC framework provides an
opportunity for renewed attention to meeting the health needs of adolescents through a
package of health services that includes appropriate interventions, provision of youth-
friendly services and promotes improved information systems that also include data
collection on adolescents. There is strong potential for applying the knowledge and lessons
learnt from this study and the broader ESW into operations, building on this knowledge to
fill existing gaps and address broader socio-economic issues that affect adolescent health
and well-being.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.      Nigeria is the most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa with a population of over
178 million. It also has a very young population. The majority of the population (63.3 percent)
is below the age of 25 years, and 22.5 percent of the country’s population between the ages of 10-
19 years. Figure 1 shows the current age structure of the country.

2.      Nigeria is a lower middle income country with a GDP (nominal) per capita of US$
3,148- in 2014, but with regional disparities. Poverty has been relatively high with just under half
the population (46 percent) living below the national poverty line. In 2010, 68 percent of the
population subsisted on less than US $1.25 (PPP) per day. Recent data based on a partial
reassessment of poverty suggest that poverty is much lower however, at 33.1 percent below the
national poverty line in 2012/13, but due to population growth, the absolute number of people living
in poverty remained unchanged at 58 million between 2010/11 and 2012/13 (World Bank 2014).

3.        Economic and social disparities separate the South and the North of the country. 1
Poverty estimates highlight the huge gaps within Nigeria – with only 16 percent of the population
living in poverty in the South West compared to 50 percent in the North East. Data also show that
while poverty has been declining in the Southern areas and North Central, it has in fact increased
in the North East and remains stagnant in the North West (World Bank 2014). This divide between
the South and the North is much deeper and complex, with ethnic and religious differences
contributing to pre-existing social fracture. The majority of the population in the Northern regions is
Muslim and in the Southern areas it is Christian. The North East and West suffer from volatility


1
  Nigeria is divided into 6 main regions: South-South, South East South West, North Central (where Abuja, the capital city
is located), North West and North East

                                                          1
created by religious extremism in recent years, and finds its roots in inequity and political instability
(LeVan 2013, Danjibo 2009). Beyond this, with over 10 distinct ethnic groups, sectarian tensions
and violence also scar the country (for example, Wee 2006; Nnonyelu 2013; Ogunlesi 2015).

4.      While secondary school enrolment is 54 percent, many adolescents, especially girls,
drop out of school early. Evidence indicates that 45 percent of girls and 31 percent of boys drop
out at the secondary level (UNICEF 2013; Population Council 2010). This is associated with
multiple factors such as poverty, absence of support systems, poor opportunities, and early
marriage, especially for girls (Group 2010; Izugbara 2015; Ogunlesi et al. 2013; Viner et al. 2012).
Consequently, adolescents who drop out of school are more prone to risky behaviors, including
risky sexual behavior, violence, and drug use (Ajaja 2012; Gasper 2011).

5.        As Figure 2 highlights, along with health policies and service delivery, socio-
economic and environmental factors affect adolescent health and development (Sawyer et
al 2012; Patton and Sawyer 2014; Viner et al. 2012). Adolescence is a time of transition. During
this critical and vulnerable time of biological, physical, psychological change, youth face new
challenges – initiating sexual activity, entering the age of risk-taking, entering into unions and
making decisions on family formation that affect future health and opportunities (WDR 2007, WDR
2012). Key investments in health (including sexual and reproductive health), education, and
economic opportunities for this cohort are important to ensure that they have the best possible life
chances to fully develop their human capital potential.

6.      The Government of Nigeria has long recognized the importance of investing in its
youth, including its health. Investing in the human capital of its youth, including their health, is
important for boosting Nigeria’s long-term prosperity. This includes a focus on adolescent sexual
and reproductive health (ASRH), as evidenced through government policies and programs. Key
among these are National Reproductive Health Policy and Strategy (2001), National Policy on
Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria (2007), and the Family Life
and HIV Education (FLHE) Program.

7.       This study examines determinants of adolescent sexual behavior and fertility in
Nigeria, with a narrower focus on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of adolescents aged 10-19
years old in Karu Local Government Authority (LGA), a peri-urban area near the capital city of
Abuja. It is part of a larger study on the country that examines the determinants of ASRH, barriers
to, and opportunities for addressing ASRH and aims to achieve a better understanding of the
current status of ASRH outcomes and main issues in the country.

8.       This study is divided into 4 parts and six sections. Part 1 provides the context of the study,
the study methods, an overview of adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Nigeria in
comparison to its neighbors, and the emerging themes of a literature review. Part 2 presents the
main findings of the study. Part 3 highlights key policies and programs related to adolescent sexual
and reproductive health in Nigeria. Part 4 presents conclusions and recommendations based on
the findings of the paper.


2. STUDY METHODS
9.       This study employs mixed methods to examine ASRH outcomes in Nigeria. It uses
data from the last three Demographic and Health Surveys (2003, 2008, and 2013) to map out major
trends in the country focusing on adolescent girls and conduct multivariate analysis to identify key
determinants of adolescent contraceptive use and pregnancies. The study further examines
knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about SRH and SRH services among adolescent girls and
boys in Karu LGA using quantitative and qualitative methods. Karu is one of 13 Local Government
Areas (LGA) in Nigeria’s Nasarawa State and has an estimated combined population of 216,230
people (Figure 3). Twenty percent of the population is young people aged 10-19 years. It is located
close to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Abuja, and its urban areas constitute one of Abuja’s
satellite towns. Karu LGA presents a melting pot of local and internal migrant populations
comprised of different religious and ethnic groups.

10.      In Karu LGA, survey data was collected on adolescents aged 10-19 years old. A
sample of 643 adolescents, both girls and boys, was used covering urban and rural areas. The
survey instrument was adapted from “Asking Young People about Sexual and Reproductive
Behaviours: Illustrative Core Instruments” by Cleland et al. (2001), and covered sexual behavior,
relationships, sexual and reproductive health knowledge, sources of information, availability and
accessibility of reproductive health services, and reproductive health outcomes. Data was collected
between July 30, 2014 and August 20, 2014 (for details see Annexes 1 and 3).

11.      The survey was augmented with seven focus group discussions (FGD) to delve
deeper into perceptions and attitudes. FGDs were conducted with adolescents, organized by
gender and age groups, parents, teachers, and health service providers to gain insights into
attitudes and behaviors (Table 3). Additional information on the focus group discussion is presented
in Annex 2 and Annex 4.

12.     The survey and FGDs in Karu LGA were especially useful in capturing the knowledge, and
perceptions of the population in the 10-14 year age bracket.

13.      The study was complemented by a comprehensive literature review and policy
mapping on ASRH. The literature review draws on peer reviewed journal articles, relevant reports
and studies, and white papers covering the period 1980 to 2013 that are available in the public
realm. The policy mapping is likewise based on a review of documents, websites, and stakeholder
interviews and discussions held during February 2014 with representatives of the government,
partner organizations, and civil society.

2. ADOLESCENT SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN NIGERIA

14.      At 576 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, Nigeria accounts for roughly 14
percent of the global burden of maternal mortality (DHS 2013/WHO 2014). Global evidence
shows that young girls bear a high burden of maternal mortality and morbidity. Data on sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) outcomes in Nigeria highlight the importance of focusing on adolescents
- just over 30 percent of deaths among female adolescents aged 15-19 years old are related to
pregnancy and child birth (DHS 2013).

15.     Nigeria’s adolescent fertility remains higher than the regional average. The national
adolescent fertility rate in Nigeria was 118 births per 1,000 women aged 15–19 years in 2013
compared to 106 births for the region. The rate of decline in Nigeria’s adolescent fertility is lower
than the regional average. This is associated with higher adolescent fertility in the North Western
States of Nigeria, where it is as high as 171 births per 1000 women aged 15-19 years. Only a
handful of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have higher adolescent fertility (Figure 3).

16.     Early sexual debut and marriage are closely associated with high adolescent fertility.
Although the age at marriage among 20–49 year old women is about 18 years, the average age at
sexual debut is roughly 15 years of age among adolescent girls in Nigeria. Data show that among
15-19 year olds, 22.9 percent are already mothers or are pregnant with their first child (DHS 2003,
2008, 2013), with little change over time.

                                                                                                                       5
17.     These problems are compounded among the poor. While reductions in early
childbearing have taken place among the rich, it still remains high among the poor – almost 60
percent of the poorest 20–24 years old women have had a child before reaching 18, compared to
only 10 percent of their richer counterparts. The differences are especially stark in urban areas. In
2008, 23 percent of poor urban adolescent females were pregnant or mothers compared to 4
percent of their richer counterparts.

18.      Uneven access to and use of maternal health services is one of the main obstacles
to improving maternal health outcomes. Despite high levels of health expenditure per capita,
Nigeria has one of the lowest rates of ANC and skilled birth attendance among West and Central
African countries, surpassing only Niger, Chad, and Ethiopia (Figure 4). While nationally, use of
ante-natal care (ANC) is relatively high at 60 percent, only 38 percent of births in the country are
attended by skilled health personnel (Table 1). Part of this low utilization is related to the significant
differences across Nigeria’s regions in access to and use of services. In the Southern regions, over
70 percent of pregnant women receive ANC and skilled birth attendance compared to only 24.7
percent receiving ANC and 9 percent receiving skilled attendance at birth in the North East (Adamu
2011). This is also likely indicative of income inequalities with the rich disproportionately using
maternal health services (Kruk et al 2008; Anwar et al. 2008).

19.      It is estimated that 2.6 million people in Nigeria are infected with HIV and a large
knowledge-behavior gap exists, especially among adolescents. Although at 3.1 percent, the
prevalence rate of HIV in the population aged 15–49 years is much lower than that of South Africa
(13 percent) and the regional average for Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 5), it is still a serious concern
due to the country’s large population. It is also more prevalent among young women than men. HIV
prevalence among women 15-24 years old is estimated at 1.3 percent compared to 0.7 percent
for men of similar age (UNAIDS 2013). Of concern is a large knowledge-behavior gap regarding
condom use for HIV prevention. While about 50 percent of young women are aware that using a
condom in every intercourse prevents HIV, only 7 percent of them report having used a condom at
their last intercourse.

20.     At 15 percent, the contraceptive prevalence rate in Nigeria is also among the lowest
among neighboring countries. It also has one of the lowest levels of unmet need for
contraception (Figure 6). Low contraception prevalence contributes to the high fertility rate, which
has remained steady at 5.7 births per woman for the past decade. Poor knowledge and
misinformation about modern contraception contribute to the rate of use and demand (Ankomah et
al. 2013).

21.       Over the past decade there has been an increase in contraceptive knowledge – but
it is likely driven by an increase in focus on HIV/AIDS and familiarity with condoms. Several
                                                                                                                 8
studies suggest that knowledge about HIV/AIDS is higher than other SRH issues (Boriri et al. 2008;
Oladepo and Fayemi 2011; Sangowawa and Adebiyi 2013). However, results are somewhat mixed
on the depth of knowledge and on how to protect oneself against HIV/AIDS. Wagbatsoma and
Okojie (2006) for example, find that while awareness about HIV/AIDS is high (99 percent), few
know about the causes (15 percent, n=852). Region and other socio-economic characteristics may
be playing a role. Ikechebelu et al (2008) sampled 148 young female street hawkers in two urban
settlements in Anambra State, and found that 54 percent were aware of the risk of contracting
HIV/AIDS from unprotected sex. In another study of urban slum dwellers around Ibadan, the
authors also found that most young people had heard of HIV/AIDS (Adedemji et al. 2007). Results
from a larger scale study in Ibadan (n=786) show that at 80 percent, knowledge about condoms as
protective against HIV/AIDS is high (Adedimeji et al. 2008).

22.       Among adolescents, access to contraception and the stigma attached to its use are
some of the main barriers. Female adolescents and young women are less likely than males to
initiate discussion or demand use of contraception. Concerns about infertility, death, being seen as
promiscuous, or upsetting their partners prevent young women from using or demanding use of
modern contraceptives (Ankomah et al. 2013; Amoran 2012; Adedemeji et al. 2007). As Figure 5
highlights, there is a stark gap between condom use among sexually active female and male youth
in Nigeria - 12.3 percent females compared to 44.7 percent males use condoms. This difference is
in keeping with the pattern of use among neighboring countries and the Sub-Saharan African
region.

3. MAIN THEMES EMERGING FROM THE LITERATURE REVIEW

23.      A review of literature focusing on adolescents highlights the key challenges in improving
their sexual and reproductive health outcomes. These are briefly discussed here.
                                                                                                                      9
24.      The age at sexual debut is early and sexual activity among adolescents is common.
Studies that focus on the 10-19 year old in-school group report a median age of 14 to 16 years for
both boys and girls (Murray et al. 2006; Wagbatsoma & Okojie et al. 2006; Fatusi & Blum 2008;
Olugbenga-Bello et al. 2009; Owoaje & Uchendu 2009). Studies suggest levels of sexual activity
ranging from 20 to 35 percent of the sampled population (Asubiaro and Fatusi 2014; Asekun-
Olarinmoye et al. 2011; Eke and Alabi-Isam 2011; Oyediran et al. 2011; Fatusi and Blum 2008;
Wagbatsoma et al. 2006). There is variation in outcomes depending on the region and the socio-
economic characteristics associated with those regions. For example, in Niger State (in the North
West) nearly 80 percent of girls (n=896) have had their sexual debut by age 16, with 14 percent
having experienced first sex between ages 9 and 12 (Sunmola et al. 2002). Another study of 1246
adolescents in secondary schools in Jos which is located in the North Central region, found that
the median age at sexual debut was 14 years, and more rural than urban students were sexually
active. Another study covering two Southern LGAs – Ugep in Cross River State, and Badeku and
Olunloyo in Oyo State – found that more than 1 in 5 adolescents had had sex before age 16 years
(Isiugo-Abanihe et al. 2012). Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews as part of the study
also reveal that young people felt that the age of sexual debut had decreased and both girls and
boys were initiating sex sooner and were more likely to have multiple partners. Asubiaro and Fatusi
(2014) also state similar results in their study of 1249 in-school students, ages 10-19 years, in
Lagos State (Southern Nigeria), with the average age at first sex being around 14 years for boys
and 15 years for girls.

25.     Poor economic conditions create opportunities for sexual exploitation of the
financially vulnerable. Young girls from low income groups, for example, may exchange sexual
favors for goods and services or money putting them at higher risk for not only pregnancies, but
also sexually transmitted diseases (Amoran 2012, Ochiogu et al. 2010, Ilika et al. 2006). For
example, one recent study in the Southern State of Anambra found that financial need and peer
pressure are among leading reasons for pre-marital sex and unwanted pregnancies (Ochiogu et
al. 2010). The authors surveyed 1,234 secondary school students and 46 teachers on sexual and
reproductive health education and teen pregnancies. They found that 27 percent of the teachers
and 44 percent of the students listing financial need as the main reason for pre-marital sexual
encounters. Other reasons cited by teachers included marital promise or peer pressure to get
married (25 percent), lack of religious commitment, and family instability (17 percent), ignorance (9
percent), and sexual abuse or rape (7 percent). Responses from the students on the other hand
suggested a more even breakdown among these other reasons for a teen pregnancy: According
to students in the sample, marital promise or peer pressure to get married (17 percent), ignorance
(16 percent), sexual abuse/rape (11 percent), and others including lack of religious commitment,
and family instability (12 percent) were the other main reasons (Ochiogu et al. 2010).

26.     In the more conservative North, early sexual debut is also linked to early marriages
(Asad 2009; Amoran 2012; Melvin and Uzoma 2012). Adebowale et al. (2008), using DHS data,
confirm that the age at marriage in the North and among Muslims is higher than in the South and
among Christians. The study finds that the average age at marriage for Muslims was 16 years
compared to 20 years for Christians. While there was a relatively small gap in number of Muslim
and Christian girls were being married between the ages of 15-19 years (46 percent vs 39.5


                                               10
percent), there were significantly more marriages among Muslim girls under age 15 years (39.5
percent) compared to Christian girls (11.9 percent).

27.     Out of school youth tend to be more sexually active (Nichols et al 1986; Makinwa-
Adebusoye 1992; Sangowawa et al. 2013). Sangowawa et al. (2013) found that 70% of out of
school girls (n=146), aged 15-24 years were sexually active in Ilero, a semi-rural town in South
western Oyo State in Nigeria. Owoaje and Uchendu (2009) report that nearly 80 percent of youth
(n=818) in their study of two LGAs in Ibadan were sexually active –with 83 percent male and 71
percent females reporting sexual activity. Another study, which draws on the 2003 DHS found that
25 percent of the young never-married male respondents aged 15-19 years and 62 percent of their
older peers aged 20-24 years had ever had sex (Oyediran et al. 2011).

28.       Age at marriage for women has been increasing, but very slowly. Under the Child
Rights Act of 2003, the legal age for marriage in Nigeria is 18 years. However, under parallel
systems – customary and Islamic – that also operate in the country, marriage can take place at
earlier ages. Due to this, there is limited enforcement of the law, and most women still get married
in their teenage years. Adebowale et al. (2012) analyze the data on age at marriage from DHS
2008, confirming that majority of the women married between ages 15-19 years (43.1 percent) and
about 27 percent married between ages 10-14 years. Using DHS data, Adebolwale et al. (2012)
show that in rural areas the incidence of early marriages with 31.7 percent of girls being married
between the ages of 10 and 14, and another 45.5 percent between the ages of 15-19. Although in
urban areas, the incidence of early marriage is lower, there are still a considerable proportion of
young girls being married in their teenage years, with 15.9 percent being married between the age
of 10-14 years and another 38.2 percent between ages 15-19 years.

29.     Early age at sexual debut and early marriage expose girls to a higher risk of early
pregnancy. This is linked to poverty, early marriage, or other vulnerable situations such as being
from broken homes or living on the streets (Olley 2006; Okoro and Obozokhai 2006; Owoaje and
Uchendu 2009). Girls who are out of school, or have had little or no education are also more likely
to experience a teen pregnancy (Sunmola et al. 2002; Okonofua 1994; Obono et al. 2010).

30.      A high proportion of teen pregnancies appear to be unwanted, especially in the case
of unmarried teenagers. A study in Sagumu LGA (Ogun State) in Nigeria surveyed 225 pregnant
girls aged 14-40 years. Study finds that 22.9 percent of the pregnancies were of teenagers and
among them over 48.2 percent were unwanted, compared to 13.6 percent unwanted pregnancies
in the older age group (Amoran 2012).

31.      Unwanted pregnancies also lead to high rates of unsafe abortions. While nationally
representative data is unavailable, studies suggest high prevalence of unsafe abortions among
adolescents. In one study, for example, 30 percent of girls in the sample (n=450) admitted that they
had been pregnant in the past, and all pregnancies were terminated (Owolabi et al 2005). Okereke
(2010) reports a 20 percent abortion rate among pregnant teens in Owerri (n=540 of which 30
percent became pregnant), with over a third of these being recurrent abortions. In Ilorin, all pregnant
girls reported terminating the pregnancy (28 percent of n=521) – (Aderibigbe et al. 2011). Earlier
studies also point to a high incidence of abortion among teens, suggesting little change in behaviors
over time with roughly between 20-25 percent pregnant girls reporting an abortion (Brabin et al.

                                               11
1995; Odujinrin et al. 1991), earlier study at a hospital in Benin City found that adolescents
accounted for 60.8 percent of all induced abortions (Omu et al. 1981). Studies also report familiar
reasons for inducing abortion including fear of violence and stigma, having to drop out of school
and reduced life opportunities (Otoid et al. 2001; Oye-Adeniran 2004).

32.      Early and unwanted pregnancies reduce girls’ opportunities and put girls at risk of
abuse and stigma. For instance, Ilika and Igwebe (2006) find that 97 percent of the girls in their
sample (n=136) had experience violence, with 57 percent having suffered from physical violence
at having become pregnant. Okereke (2010) finds that among pregnant teens who aborted a
pregnancy, fear of parental disapproval and humiliation (45.4%) was the leading concern, followed
by lack of established paternity of the fetus (25.3 percent), pregnancy hindering the prospects of a
future marriage (13.8 percent); and expulsion from school (12.5 percent). Another very small
qualitative study on adolescent mothers in Ile-Ife (Osun State, n=30) provides insights into the
quality of life of teenage mothers (Box 1). The study found that most of the girls felt stigmatized –
having to drop out of school, and losing support from family and friends(Melvin and Uzoma 2012).

33.       Education, especially secondary education for girls, can be a protective factor
against early marriage and pregnancy. Education brings with it the promise of a better life
through employment opportunities for both men and women; and it affords the opportunity for
marrying some equally or more highly educated and with greater economic prospects. Recent
evidence from Nigeria also shows that women with higher education are more likely to marry later
in life than those without an education – the average age at marriage for women with no education
is 15.7 years compared to 23.6 years for those with secondary or higher levels of education
(Adebowale et al. 2012). Similar results have also been found in earlier studies as well (Isiugo-
Abanihe 1994; Orubuloye 1998; Agha 2009). Some studies also find that religiosity is a protective
factor against pre-marital sex among students (Asubiaro and Fatusi 2014; Oladepo and Fayemi
2011; Abdulkarim et al. 2003). Agha (2009) also finds that living in a conservative environment
affects behavior too. His study finds that in the conservative Muslim North, there is also less
incidence of pre-marital sex among the Christian population.

Box 1: Not much changes in the cradle of human creation

Ile-Ife is an ancient town in the South-western State of Osun in Nigeria. In the Yoruba tradition, it is a holy city
and the cradle of all human life. Several small scale studies provide an insight into the life at Ile-Ife, including
sexual and reproductive health. While these are very small, qualitative studies, together they highlight the slow
pace of change in the past two decades. While this box focuses on Ile-Ife, the broad lessons also hold for
Nigeria overall.

A 1989 small scale study (n=48) in Ile-Ife of pregnant adolescents reported that all pregnancies were
unplanned, regardless of marital status. The study found that the majority of the girls (60 percent) did not have
access to contraceptive information (Alade 1989). Another, more recent study of adolescent mothers (n=30)
found similar outcomes – with at least half the pregnancies being unplanned and unwanted (Melvin and Uzoma
2012). Both studies indicate that majority of the girls did not return or plan to return to school after the birth of
their babies and most relied on their mothers for support. The Melvin and Uzoma (2012) study also found that
most of the girls felt stigmatized – having to drop out of school, and losing support from family and friends.
Many of the girls felt that they did not have either finances or know-how to care for the baby, especially in the
case of an illness, and there weren’t enough resources for them, even when they had family support.

On the other side of the story are boys. A 1993 study of in-school boys aged 15-19 in the city revealed that
over 79 percent were sexually active and had multiple partners. Use of condoms was also low since many
believed that is was only useful for preventing pregnancies (Jinadu and Odesanmi 1993). The Alade (1989)

                                                      12
study also found that contraceptive knowledge among adolescents was low. A more recent study, on the eve
of the introduction of Family Life Health Education also highlighted that most students, teachers, and parents,
(n=1000) at least in this city, held positive attitudes towards sex education (Orji et al 2003).

More recently, a larger study in the area (n=392) found that health services were not always available to
adolescents. The study, which focuses on in-school girls and boys, found that even when health services may
be available through the school, the quality of service provision is an issue with inadequate staffing,
unavailability of drugs, and/or unfriendly staff in at least half of the reported student encounters with health
services (Loto et al. 2004).

While this handful of studies cannot be used to generalize over the whole country or even a particular region,
they highlight some of the common issues faced by adolescents in Nigeria in relation to sexual and
reproductive health.

34.      Poor knowledge and misinformation about sexual and reproductive health and
contraception keeps its use at low levels. Adolescents may not always be accurately informed.
While knowledge of HIV/AIDS, fertility, and contraception in general has increased, misconceptions
persist (Nwaorgu et al. 2008, 2009; Amoran 2012). For example, Nwaorgu et al (2008) find that 51
percent of junior secondary students in Enugu State (n=412) did not know that girls can get
pregnant at first sexual intercourse, and 33 percent thought that washing the vagina after sex would
prevent a pregnancy. Makinwa-Adebusoye (1992) found that sexually active adolescents (n=5599)
were more knowledgeable about SRH than those who were not active; and about 60 percent of
girls and 57 percent of boys were aware of any contraceptive methods. Oladosu (1992-93) also
finds similar results (n=1678) using 1990 DHS data. Amazigo et al. (1997) found that only 36
percent of the students had correct information about pregnancy, and that girls were more
knowledgeable than boys (n=2460). In his study, Amoran (2012) finds that nearly all (99.2 percent)
respondents reported using a condom during risky sexual intercourse, but many did not know how
to use it properly - 41.1 percent of the teenage pregnant women and 28.6 percent of the older
pregnant women did not know how to correctly use a condom.

35.      Parent-child communication is one of the main sources of reproductive health
related information in Nigeria, however incomplete that information may be (Oladepo and
Brieger 1996; Nwalo and Anasi 2012; Iliyasu et al 2012). Asekun-Olarinmoye et al. (2011) find that
85 percent of the adolescent respondents in their sample of 342 in-school adolescents, aged 10-
19 in an LGA in Osun State had first received SRH education from their parents, and that the
majority focused on abstinence with about half discussing other methods such as condoms, and
pills. The Nwalo and Anasi (2012) study of female senior secondary school students (n=1800) in
Lagos city found that “the most accessible sources of reproductive health information mentioned
by the students were parents, textbooks, television, siblings, radio, friends, school teachers, music
and songs” – in that order. Other studies such as Ijatuyi (2005), Mabawonku (1998) and Bammeke
and Nnorom (2006) provide further evidence of the importance of parents as the first source of
information.

36.      Several studies also confirm the central role peers play as a source of sexual and
reproductive health information. Onyeonoro et al. (2011) find that the most common first sources
of information on sex were peers (76.3 percent) followed by the media (69.0 percent) among girls,
ages 10-18, in the Osisioma LGA in south western Nigeria (n=304). Rani, Figueroa and Ainsle
(2003), Mohammadi et al (2006) and Odusanya and Bankole (2006) report similar findings.
Adeokun et al. (2009) find that students in co-ed schools are better informed than those not in co-

                                                    13
ed schools, and that peers are a main source of information in their study of 4 North-Eastern
Nigerian states - Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and Yobe. Okanlawon. Asuzu (2011) also find a positive
effect of peer education on SRH knowledge. The authors conducted a quasi-experimental study
with 519 participants, and a 6 month intervention in 2 LGAs in Oyo State. The findings highlight the
potential of peer education in improving access to accurate information about SRH. Van der Maas
and Otte (2009) find similar outcomes in their study in a north eastern rural part of Ebonyi State –
those who received peer education have better knowledge and lesser misconceptions compared
to those who did not receive it.

37.     Evidence seems to suggest that knowledge about HIV/AIDS is higher than other SRH
issues (Boriri et al. 2008; Oladepo and Fayemi 2011; Sangowawa and Adebiyi 2013). This is
reasonable since HIV prevention has been a major focus of the federal government and efforts to
prevent spread of HIV/AIDS have been ongoing for over a decade. However, the results are
somewhat mixed on the depth of knowledge and on how to protect oneself against HIV/AIDS.
Wagbatsoma and Okojie (2006) found that while awareness about HIV/AIDS was high (99 percent),
few knew about the causes (15 percent). Region and other socio-economic characteristics may be
playing a role. For example, results from a larger scale study in Ibadan (n=786) show that
knowledge about condoms as protective against HIV/AIDS was high at 80 percent of the sample
(Adedimeji et al. 2008). In another study of urban slum dwellers around Ibabdan, the authors also
found that most young people had heard of HIV/AIDS (Adedemji et al. 2007). Ikechebelu et al
(2008) sampled 148 young female street hawkers in two urban settlements in Anambra State, and
found that 54 percent were aware of the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS from unprotected sex.

38.       Beyond knowledge, adolescent use of services is a key issue in Nigeria. Several
studies highlight the low usage of contraceptives among adolescents and youth (Okonofua et al.
2004; Olaseha et al. 2004; Bassey et al 2005; Adedimeji et al. 2007). Okpani and Okpani (2000)
report a 30 percent use of contraceptives among adolescent girls (ages 14-21) in Port Harcourt.
Sunmola et al (2002) report similar numbers (35 percent) in their study of young people (ages 11-
25) in Niger State. Other studies report even lower levels. In Calabar, only 6 percent adolescents
(n=888) between the ages of 13 and 18 years reported using contraception (Etuk et al. 2004). Oye-
Adeniran et al. (2005) found an 11 percent rate of contraceptive use among adolescents in 4 health
zones in Oyo, Anambra, Kaduna, and Bauchi States. On the other hand, at 62 percent, Adebowale
et al. (2013) report a higher use of condoms among males 15 to 24 years old using 2008 DHS data,
but they also point out that men over 20 were twice as likely to use a condom compared to younger
men.

39.      Even when services are available, adolescents may not use them. Okekere (2010),
for instance, finds that in his sample of 836 adolescents in Owerri city (Imo State), 73.4 percent
confirmed the availability of reproductive health center(s) within their residential neighborhood, but
only 21.5 percent were willing to purchase the contraceptives offered at these centers. He suggests
that this is a function of poor communication and cost of services among a population that is
generally illiterate and poor. Suleiman (2011) examines access to maternal and child health
services for young mothers using DHS 2008 data. He finds that adolescent women were less likely
than older women to receive ante-natal, post-natal care and skilled birth attendance. Data reveal
that the majority (85 percent) of women under age 20 years in the Northern regions and 56 percent
in the South delivered at home. Overall, about 25 percent of women under age 20 used skilled
                                               14
attendants at birth in the country, and about 32 percent received post-natal care within 42 days of
birth (Rai et al. 2012). Owolabi et al (2005) on the other hand found that girls were more confident
than boys that they could seek contraceptives and contraceptive advice from a health facility, shop
or a friend. Adekunle et al. (2000) report how biases among health workers also contribute to the
poor access to family planning services. In their survey of 735 health workers, the authors find that
those who approved of family planning were 12 times more likely to approve of adolescent
contraception than those who were not in favor of it and this is linked to their treatment of
adolescents – while 59 percent of the health workers reported seeing an adolescent seeking SRH
care, only 31 percent had prescribed contraceptives.

40.       Low usage is linked to several issues including convenience of access to services
and fear of stigma. Slum dwellers in Ibadan (n=1042) mention shyness, concern about self-image
and stigma, as well as perceived lack of trust by a partner as the reason why they do not bring up
use of condoms for example (Adedimeji et al. 2007). Another study of teen mothers highlights the
preference for emergency contraception over condoms because this was easier to access
compared to condoms, which they would also have to negotiate a price for. In other words, buying
emergency contraception is more discreet and there is less danger of being discovered by parents
(Ilika and Igwegbe 2006). Temin et al (1999), in a series of focus groups in Benin City found that
traditional healers are the most popular source of healthcare among adolescents with symptoms
of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) followed by patent medicine dealers, private doctors and
hospitals. Oye-Adeniran et al. (2005) also find that most respondents (19.7 percent) turned to
chemists or patent medicine shops for contraceptive needs, but their decision also depends on the
type of contraceptives they choose to use. For example, those who used injectables were more
likely to go to family planning clinics while those preferring intra-uterine devices (IUDs) were turning
to clinics. However this needs to be further explored as few studies look in depth into why and how
these choices are made.

41.     The following section focuses on the results of the study itself. It presents the nationally
representative findings from an analysis of DHS data for 2003, 2008, and 2013, and the results of
the knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives survey in Karu LGA.

1. AGE AT SEXUAL DEBUT AND MARRIAGE
42.       As the literature indicates, early sexual debut is a concern in Nigeria, especially
among girls. While the median age at sexual debut for women aged 20-49 years in Nigeria is
about 17.7 years, among adolescent girls (age 15 -19 years), it is lower, with a median age of
15.1 years. Data also suggest that co-habitation or marriage happens around the same time as
the first experience with intercourse for the 15-19 years age group (Figure 8a). On the other
hand, the median age at first sexual intercourse for boys aged 15-19 years, is slightly higher at 16
years (Figure 8b). As of 2013, only 4.2 percent reported being sexually active by age 15 and 22.2
percent by age 18 (DHS 2003, 2008, 2013).

43.      The age at sexual debut also shows some variation across regions. In rural areas, for
example the reported age at first intercourse is 16.7, compared to 19.3 for urban areas. Similarly,
in the North East and North West regions, the median age at first sex is 15.7 and 15.4 years
respectively, compared to 16.7 years in the South West (DHS 2013). Interestingly, the tendency
for early sexual debut is reversed for men. It is higher in the Northern areas compared to the South
- the median age at sexual debut is 21 years and 24 years for the North East and North West
respectively, whereas it is around 19-20 years of age in the Southern areas. This is likely related
to the sexual and reproductive behaviors in the North and South. Whereas in the South first sexual
encounters may be more likely to be outside of marriage, in the North, greater religious
conservatism may be confining sexual encounters to marital relationships, in which case it is likely
than men will be older than the women since they are expected to be gainfully employed by the
time they are married.

44.      In Karu LGA about 25 percent of adolescents sampled were sexually active, with the
median age at 14.8 (SD=1.8) years for girls and 15.3 (SD=1.6) years for boys aged 10-19 years
(Figure 9). It is 15 years for both girls and boys in the 15-19 age group. Karu LGA is located in the
North Central region, and the survey suggests a slightly younger age at sexual debut than reported
for the region - according to DHS 2013, the median age at sexual debut for girls aged 15-19 years
was 16.5 years, and that for boys was about 16.6 years. However, this difference may be due to
sample characteristics. The results are however aligned with the overall DHS results.

45.       There were proportionately more females than males who had initiated sex in the 10-
19 age group (23 percent compared to 19 percent), although this was not statistically significant.
These numbers are driven by the behaviors of adolescents in older age groups. In the 15-19 years
age group, 40 percent of girls and 35 percent of were sexually active. In the 10-14 years age group,
only 7 percent of girls and 4 percent of boys were sexually active. A very small proportion of the
sample (1 percent), were married. However, most participants had had only one partner. About a
third of the study participants had been in a heterosexual relationship.

46.     Focus groups conducted in Karu LGA suggest that while adolescents indicate a
preference to wait before initiating sex, it may not be the case. Adolescents thought that they
should be allowed to date by the time they are 16 years of age, and majority of boys and girls in
the focus groups though one should be at least 18 years old before having sex. However, focus
group responses from health care providers suggest that very young adolescents were accessing
SRH services because they needed them, supporting the evidence suggesting low ages at sexual
debut and pregnancy. As one participant stated,

    “A lot of them do come (to the health care centers), because in this center we have a case of
    less than 15 years, she’s already a mother; so, many of them will come, and when you run a
    pregnancy test it will be positive…” - Health Care Provider.

Another participant highlights the motivations of adolescents,

    “Some date because of marriage but some because of sex.” - Adolescent female (15-19 years).


47.    Focus groups also highlight the close relationship between marriage and sexual
debut for girls. Marriage in Nigeria is viewed with high regard. Adolescent participants stated that
when they date, they are “expecting marriage”, and that sex should be preserved for “the time they
get married”. Parents in focus groups emphasized that sex is only allowed within a marriage and
should be discouraged otherwise. Fathers were more agreeable to girls marrying early than
mothers in focus groups for the sake of financial stability.

    “A girl can get married at the age of 19 years and above, no problem but if a girl is not in school
    and she doesn’t want to learn any trade…at the age of 17 and above she can get married.” –
    Parent (Father).

    “I will not like it [early marriage] because the girl will still be in school. Even if she wants to
    marry it should be about 20 – 22 years. Afterwards the girl can still continue if her husband
    agrees…but 15 – 16 years [is] no good.” – Parent (Mother).

    “A girl as from 16 years above can marry but a man from 18 years … a girl is more likely to
    marry early but the man has to be ready because he would be the one to take care of the girl.”
    – Parent (Father).

    “Some parent use to force their child to marry a man that they did not love. Some parent want
    their child to marry a rich man but the woman will not like the man, that is why some parents
    use to like money even though, like a man brings a girl a man that is poor, the parents will not


                                               18
         agree that let them marry that man. They only want their child to marry a rich man.” - Adolescent
         female, (10-14 years).

48.      These discussions shed light on expectations of parents and their role in early
marriages among girls. One of the themes that emerged from the parents’ feedback is that men
take care of the family financially while the women are responsible for bearing and taking care of
children, and that marriages are meant for procreation. They shared that girls should be married at
a much younger age than boys “because if they get older say up to 40 years they are likely not to
get any man to marry them again” and that “girls can be married as young as 16 years but boys
have to consider their economic circumstances before marriage as they have to take care of their
families”. This highlights some of the deep set traditions and beliefs that contribute to the
vulnerability of female adolescents in being married early and often to older men.


2. FERTILITY AND PREGNANCY
49.     The adolescent fertility rate in Nigeria is 118 live births per 1,000 women aged 15-19
years. Nearly 1 in 5 girls in Nigeria between the ages of 15 and 19 years has either given birth, or
is pregnant, and as figure 10 highlights this is strongly correlated with sexual debut (r2=0.61) and
has been for the past decade (DHS 2003, 2008, 2013).

50.       Data from DHS also reveal that among women whose first pregnancy was in their
adolescence, the median age for the pregnancy was between 16.2 and 16.7 years of age (DHS
2013). There is little variation across age cohorts and across the DHS surveys, suggesting that for
groups of adolescents that are at high risk of pregnancy little has changed (DHS 2008, DHS 2013).
This is in keeping with the findings in literature, and alluded to in the Karu focus groups that certain
                                                                  19
    populations (such as those with little or no education or from low income households) are more
    vulnerable to early pregnancies.

    51.      In addition to age at sexual debut, adolescent pregnancies are also strongly linked
    to early marriage. Multivariate regression analysis of adolescent pregnancies using DHS data
    shows that being in a union is one of the strongest predictors of pregnancies among adolescent
    girls (Table 5). Knowledge of contraception and use of contraception are also linked to pregnancy
    (OR=2.2, SE=0.19; and OR=3.5, SE=0.41 respectively) which may be indicative of use of
    contraception by sexually active females. As expected, secondary education significantly reduces
    the odds of adolescent pregnancies (OR=0.67, SE=0.09), while the odds increase by poverty - the
    odds for becoming pregnant as an adolescent in the poorest household are over 2 times higher
    than for the richest households. While religion or ethnicity by itself does not appear to be significant,
    the odds of becoming pregnant in adolescence are significantly higher for Ijaw girls, and may reflect
    particular social attitudes among this population.

    52.      Data on pregnancies in Karu LGA was limited, and therefore did not lend itself to
    multivariate analysis. There were only 17 live births in the 3 years preceding the survey. However,
    bi-variate analysis indicates that pregnancy was associated with the age of the girl, her marital
    status, her education level and where she lived (Table 6). Fifty five percent (55 percent) of sexually
    active girls who lived in tribal settlements reported that they had been pregnant at least once in the
    past five years. This compared to 20 percent in farming areas and 30 percent in informal urban
    centers. It is likely that settlement type is a proxy capturing a number of factors such as cultural,
    religion and system variables.

53.     As expected, older girls (ages 15-19 years) were more likely to have been pregnant
compared to younger girls (ages 10-14 years) - 46 percent compared to 4.6 percent,
respectively. While the numbers are small, 71 percent of adolescent girls who had never been to
school had been pregnant in the past 5 years. Yet the numbers are too small to draw any
conclusions.

Pregnancy outcomes
54.      Not all pregnancies end in a live birth, especially if they are to very young
adolescents. Figure 11 presents the pregnancy outcomes to adolescents in the three waves of
the DHS (2003, 2008, 2013) and Karu LGA. While national data shows that over 70 percent of
births to adolescents aged 15-19 years have had live births, there were 8 -13 percent who aborted
their pregnancies. On the other hand, the data from Karu LGA suggests a much higher level of
abortions. This is likely driven by the small sample size. However, data also reveal that those with
most of the abortions were girls with a junior secondary, primary or no education, and mostly among
single girls. While data is lacking, the timing of these pregnancies is likely a factor in the high levels
of abortions – very early and unwanted, and associated with girls who may have either dropped
out of school or never went to school (Analysis of Karu LGA Survey Data 2014).

55.      Unwanted pregnancies also contribute to high rates of unsafe abortions. While the
latest nationally representative data puts abortion rates among adolescents at 9 percent (DHS
2013), as the literature highlights, studies suggest much higher prevalence of unsafe abortions
among adolescents, ranging from 20 to 30 percent (Owolabi et al 2005; Okereke 2010; Aderibigbe
et al. 2011).

56.       The dangers of early pregnancy are well documented in literature (World Bank 2010).
Loto et al (2004) compared 104 adolescents (under age 20) with 208 mothers aged 23 to 29 years.
The study showed that teenagers experienced significantly higher obstetric complication rates
compared to their older counterparts, including anemia in pregnancy, preterm delivery, low birth
weight and neonatal admission. Ebeigbe and Gharoro (2007) estimated that the maternal mortality
ratio for teenagers was 1835 per 100,000 births – more than double the national maternal mortality
ratio. The study also found a high rate of caesarian sections among teenagers even though there
were no significant difference in complications between these pregnancies and those of older
                                                 22
women. Another study that examined the prevalence rate of under-5 deaths found that 52 percent,
the under-5 mortality was significantly more pronounced among younger mothers (under age 20
years) compared to women aged 20-35 years (33 percent) Occurrence of under-5 deaths was also
significantly more frequent among women from rural residence, with less education, in those who
delivered at home, those who never gave birth with a medical doctor's assistance, among women
who never completed vaccination for their children, in those who never attended antenatal clinic
and those whose main source of drinking water was well water (Ayotunde et al. 2009).

3. KNOWLEDGE OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
57.     While there has been an increase in knowledge about sexual and reproductive health
and contraception in Nigeria, among adolescents it is still very low. Knowledge about
contraception has increased from under 10 percent to over 40 percent among adolescents aged
15-19 years over the past decade. However, over half the adolescent population still lacks proper
knowledge, with more awareness among boys than girls (Figure.12). However, when asked about
reproductive health itself, the level of knowledge is much less - less than 2 percent of boys and 6.6
percent of girls, aged 15-19 were able to correctly identify when a female is most likely to get
pregnant during the ovulatory cycle (DHS 2013).

58.     Data from Karu LGA highlight the limited levels of SRH knowledge, especially among
younger adolescents. While majority of the respondents (81.6 percent) had heard about
HIV/AIDS, only 23 percent knew of any other sexually transmitted infection (STI) for example.
Among those who knew of other STIs, only 14 percent were able to identify some of the signs of
STIs correctly, and older adolescents were more likely to be better informed that younger ones. In
the 15-19 years old age group, there was near universal awareness about HIV/AIDS, with 93
percent of girls and 91 percent of boys stating that they knew about the disease. On the other hand,

                                                        23
                  76 percent of girls and 68 percent of boys in the 10-14 years old age group knew about HIV/AIDS.
                  Two thirds of the respondents knew that one could easily be tested for HIV, and a similar proportion
                  knew that there was treatment for HIV/AIDs. This is consistent with the emerging evidence in
                  literature that SRH awareness tends to be in the context of the disease.

                  Knowledge of Contraception
                  59.    Aligned with the DHS findings, roughly 45 percent of the surveyed adolescents in
                  Karu LGA were aware of contraception. This is driven by the level of contraceptive knowledge
                  among older adolescents, aged 15-19 years who know at least one or more methods of modern
                  contraception (Figure 13). 2 However, younger adolescents show lower levels of knowledge,
                  especially girls - among the 10-14 year old age group 48 percent of boys and 58 percent of girls
                  had no knowledge of contraceptives.

                  socio-economic characteristics and knowledge of contraception among adolescents. The
                  analysis uses data from three rounds of DHS focusing on the sub-population of girls aged 15-19
                  years. It draws on both married and unmarried adolescent girls in the sample (Table 8). The data
                  highlight the importance of exposure to family planning messaging. Visiting a health facility or being
                  exposed to family planning messaging through audio and visual media are significantly and
                  positively related with knowledge of contraception among adolescents. While being visited by a
                  family planning worker is also significant, the odds are lower compared to other avenues of

                  2   The categories are based on an index of knowledge where None = 0, Medium>0 & <=0.33, High>=0.34.

                                                                   24
exposure. This is because the exposure of women under age 19 years to family planning workers
is very limited with only 2 percent (on average) having been visited by a family planning worker
(DHS 2008, 2013).

61.      Education and income are also strong predictors of contraceptive knowledge.
Having a primary or secondary education raises the odds of knowledge of contraception (OR=1.8
& 3.2) compared to no education. Higher than secondary education is not significantly related,
which is because the target age group is concentrated at the secondary or lower levels of education.
Being poor is negatively related with knowledge when compared to richer counterparts, once again
confirming what the literature suggests. By itself, religion does not seem to be a significant factor, 3
but when compared to each other, being Christian raises the odds (OR=6.06) of having
contraceptive knowledge significantly compared to other religions. Similarly, region by itself is not
a significant factor, but when compared to each other, the odds of knowing about contraception are
about 2 times the odds of contraceptive knowledge compared to North Central (with the exception
of South East). However, only the Northern regions have significant results. This needs further
exploration and may be related a number of factors such as earlier age at marriage and exposure
to family planning or programmatic interventions in those areas.

Sources of Information
62.      In keeping with the literature review, findings from the Karu LGA study reveal the
role of parents and peers as source of information about sexual and reproductive health
and contraception. Nature of information and gender of the adolescent seem to drive the source,
at least in Karu. Focus group discussions in Karu LGA with girls, aged 10-14 and 15-19 years,
reveal mothers as an important first source of information for issues such as puberty and body
changes. However, there is hesitation around more sensitive topics such as sex and contraception,
motivated by the concern that parents may think the girl is either sexually active or is interested in
having sex. Boys, on the other hand, consider hospitals or teachers/school as their first source of
information on issues such as puberty. They also voice similar concerns as girls about what their

                                               26
parents may think. Friends, peers, and other older people who the adolescents may trust such as
a neighbor or a relative also come across as important sources of information.

63.      Interestingly, quantitative analysis suggests that the in-school population of
adolescents look up to their teachers as the most important source of SRH information.
Nigeria introduced the Family Life and HIV Education (FLHE) program in schools in 2003 (for
example, see Kirby et al. 2007), and about half of the respondents in the Karu survey indicated that
they had received SRH education in school. This includes a high percentage of boys and girls in
both age groups (Figure 14). Seventy-five percent of the respondents (80 percent boys and 69.6
percent girls), name their school teachers as the most important source of SRH information
followed by mothers and peers. It is likely that the increased access to information students have
through their schools is partly responsible for why two-thirds of respondents place teachers as a
first source of information.

64.       The quality of information however may be poor. Less than half (47 percent) of
respondents believed that condoms were an effective way of preventing pregnancies. An even
lower proportion believed that condoms were effective in preventing HIV infection (40 percent), and
that condoms could prevent other STI infections (44 percent). Knowledge about the effectiveness
of condoms were even lower among the younger adolescents, aged 10-14 year olds. Additionally,
36 percent of all interviewed adolescents believed that the same condom could be used more than
once. Interestingly, and seemingly aligned with the data on contraception, boys were more
knowledgeable than girls about the use and effectiveness of condoms, but they were also more
likely to say that condoms could be used more than once, indicating the lack of accurate knowledge
(Table 9).

4. ATTITUDES SURROUNDING SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
65.     Perceptions and attitudes regarding sexual and reproductive health also influence
behavior and consequently outcomes (WDR 2007). Since this study included a component
specifically focusing on knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions in Karu LGA, there is an opportunity
to explore what adolescents in that area think about their sexual and reproductive health and
norms.

66.     Evidence indicates that attitudes towards pre-marital sexual relationships are
relaxing. While 65 percent of boys and 71 percent of girls and boys surveyed in Karu LGA thought
that people should remain virgins until they get married, they also did not think that there was
anything wrong with unmarried boys and girls (56 percent boys, 55 percent girls) having sexual
intercourse.

67.     Yet, the majority believed that they should have sex only after marriage, and this is
reflected in their behavior. About 75 percent (n=643) of the adolescents surveyed had never had
sex. The main reasons given for not having started engaging in sexual activities included: that sex
before marriage was wrong (82 percent), they were afraid of getting HIV/AIDS or another sexually
transmitted infection (68 percent). However, about 20 percent of the adolescents said they had not
had an opportunity to engage in sex yet.

68.       Peer pressure is a challenge. Thirteen percent of the respondents also expressed that
they had experienced some form of peer pressure, especially from friends, to engage in sexual
activities. Focus group respondents also felt that there was a lot of peer pressure to date or engage
in sexual activity.

        “Some of the girls they use to accept [to date a boy] because they want to be like their friends.” -
        Adolescent female (15-19 years).

        “[they are] pushed into doing it.” – Adolescent female (15-19 years).




                                                  28
69.     Relatedly, being assertive in negotiating relationships is important. While majority of
the respondents felt that a sexual partner could request using a condom, in practice few had done
it themselves. A higher proportion of boys (64 percent) compared to girls (57 percent) aged 15-19
years felt that a younger person could suggest using a condom to their older sexual partner. Thirty
four percent of boys and 22 percent of girls said they had the confidence to insist on using a condom
every time they had sex; and 26 percent of boys and 30 percent of girls felt confident that they
would not have sex with someone who was not prepared to use a condom. Figure 15 provides
more insights into adolescents’ assertiveness regarding condom use.

 I would refuse to have sex with someone who is not
              prepared to use a condom


         I feel that I know how to use a male condom
                             properly

70.     Adolescents also expressed fear of stigma if they were assertive about
contraception. Thirty one percent (31 percent) of boys and 24 percent of girls felt that if a girl
suggested using condoms to her partner, it would mean that she did not trust him. These sentiments
were much stronger among the older adolescents. Almost a third of participants felt that
contraception was the woman’s responsibility.

71.      At the community level, access to contraception may be impeded by norms, morals,
attitudes and beliefs that adolescents should not be sexually active and that they therefore do not
need contraception.

        “because if there are no condoms many teenagers will not have the idea to have sex” -
        Adolescent male (10-14 years)

        “you have moral instruction, you will be able to hold yourself; and you will not take those
        things (sex and contraceptives) to be anything, because you know yourself and you stand

                                                 29
         on what you have learned from the Church, from the family, and to the school through
         moral instruction” – Educator/Teacher

72.       These attitudes are also linked to sexual violence. When there is too much pressure to
engage in a sexual relationship, or when one person forces himself or herself on the other, because
one has a weaker voice, it contributes to gender-based violence. .About 15 percent of boys and 11
percent of girls believed that boys were justified in beating their girlfriend if they believed that the
girlfriend had done something wrong. Moreover, 70 percent of boys and 71 percent of girls were
unsure whether or not it was acceptable for a boy to force a girl to have sex. Of those who were
unsure or agreed that a boy should sometimes force a girl to have sex, 10 percent of boys aged
15-19 years had forced a girl to have sex with them, while 33 percent of girls aged between 10-14
year and 16 percent girls aged between 15-19 years reported having been forced by their partner
to have sex, the first time they had sexual intercourse. Focus group discussions with adolescents
further underscore how there is acknowledgement and even justification (among boys) for violence:

         “Some they force to have sex with you, you wouldn’t like it but they will force you to do
         it……because he is stronger than her.” – Adolescent girl (10-14 years)

          “I want to tell you, it is good to beat her, because I’m already married to her and she’s
         obliged to satisfy my sexual needs as long as she lives with me” – Adolescent male (15-19
         years)

          “…I will seriously beg her, but if she refuses I will force her.” – Adolescent male (15-19
         years).

5. USE OF SERVICES AND CONTRACEPTION
74.      Availability, access, and use of reproductive health services adds to the risks
associated with adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including
pregnancies. One of the major problems in addressing ASRH is that use of services remains low
- partly due to social and cultural reasons, and partly due to limited access to these services. This
section covers use of contraception and use of health services.

Use of Contraception among Adolescents
75.     Use of contraception among sexually active adolescents in Nigeria is very low
(Figure 16). Among sexually active adolescents, only 17 percent of boys and 5 percent of girls were
using contraceptives, and roughly 65 percent expressed that they did not intend to use
contraception. One of the key reasons for this is fear of social stigma. Participants in the Karu LGA
study, particularly girls, indicate that they would not ask their partners to use condoms because it
may be perceived as a sign of infidelity or promiscuity. Slum dwellers in Ibadan (n=1042) mention
shyness, concern about self-image, stigma, and perceived lack of trust by partner as the reason
why they do not bring up use of condoms for example (Adedimeji et al. 2007). One study of teen
mothers highlights the preference for emergency contraception over condoms because it is more
discreet and there is less danger of being discovered by parents (Ilika and Igwegbe 2006).

Determinants of Use
76.    Multivariate analysis among women aged 15-19 years highlights the determinants of
contraceptive use. It confirms the importance of family planning messaging (OR=1.86, SD=0.38)

                                                              31
and visiting a health facility (OR=1.15; SD=0.066) which may also increase exposure to family
planning messaging. The analysis also confirms the importance of a woman’s education,
specifically secondary education (OR=1.88; SD=0.55), as well as that of her partner. Interestingly
religion and wealth do not seem to be significant determinants. While women who were currently
pregnant were not significantly likely to use contraception, those who had at least one living child
were. Additionally those who wanted medium sized families (3 or 4 children) were also significantly
likely to use contraception (Table 11).

Use of Health Services
77.     Use of sexual and reproductive health service among adolescents in Karu LGA is
limited, especially for unmarried girls. Only 10 percent had visited a health facility or doctor for
SRH services, with the largest proportion (15 percent) being girls aged 15-19 seeking
contraception, abortions, pregnancy, or STI related services. Embarrassment and fear of
stigmatization are among the main concerns adolescents express as a reason for not using public
health services. Focus group discussants mention turning to private hospitals, traditional healers,
patent medical vendors (PMVs), or chemists for reproductive health services, specifically
contraception, and in cases of unwanted pregnancies and abortions. In the words of one parent:

          ‘The services are for everybody, but for young people they are ashamed or afraid of people
          knowing their secret and their issues being told to their parents. That is why most of them feel they
          don’t have the space to access such things (services).” - Parent (Father)



78.       Ten percent of all study participants (n = 51) had visited a health facility or doctor for
services or information related to sexual and reproductive health. By far the largest proportion of
adolescent who sought services related to contraceptives, pregnancy, abortions or STIs were girls
aged 15 – 19 years (15%), Figure 8 below, while younger girls (10 – 14 years) had the least (2
percent) visits. Of those who visited a health facility, 28 (54.5 percent) had visited government
facilities while 15 (29.4 percent) had used private hospitals.

79.      Close to half of all 342 participants indicated that they lived far from health facilities and
services. The majority of participating adolescents (n = 492, 77 percent) felt that young people
needed their own dedicated youth friendly treatment clinics. Eighty five percent (85%, n = 547)
believed that young people should receive services on contraception, pregnancy and sexual
reproductive health and this was unanimous across gender and age. When they become sexually
active, unmarried adolescent girls and young women face much greater difficulties in obtaining
contraceptives than married women, due to the stigma attached to being sexually active before
marriage.

            III. POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENT

80.     In 1999, Nigeria initiated a series of reforms to update its policies on health and
development. Health sector reforms were undertaken between 1999 and 2007 to improve the
conditions of the health sector. A new National Health Policy was adopted in 2004 that aimed to
address the weaknesses in the health system. This included strengthening the primary level health
services and rolling out of an integrated maternal and child health strategy that focused on
increasing access to skilled attendance at birth and family planning. The National Health Policy
also emphasized the importance of investing in sexual and reproductive health, committing itself to
the millennium development targets for maternal, and child health and combatting HIV/AIDS
(FGON 2004, 2009).

81.      As part of reviving primary care services, a minimum package of services was
developed, which incorporated maternal and child health care, including family planning.
Family planning services would be offered to “couples to educate them about family life and to
encourage them to achieve their wishes with regard to: preventing unwanted pregnancies; securing
desired pregnancies; spacing of pregnancies; and limiting the size of the family in the interest of
the family health and socio-economic status. The methods prescribed shall be compatible with their
culture and religious beliefs” (FGON 2004).


Box 2: Nigeria’s Health Sector Reforms (1999-2007)

Nigeria’ government initiated health sector reforms in 1999. These reforms were a starting point for revitalizing
the health sector and reversing the negative health trends in country. For example, between 1990 and 2002,
DPT immunizations declined considerably – going from 56 percent to 25 percent, and life expectancy barely
budged from around 46 years of age. The reforms aimed to address the weaknesses in a health system that
had been crippled due to inefficient investment and brain drain.

One of the main issues had been the collapse of the primary health care system due to neglect and inadequate
investment. Higher level facilities absorbed about 75% annual capital investments. Despite this, there was a
lack of sufficient investment in the health system (due to the devaluation of the Niara) that led to its decline.
One survey of 15 tertiary health facilities, for example, found that operating equipment in all facilities was
broken and in disrepair or simply unavailable. Furthermore, poor working conditions contributed to low morale,
regular strikes by health care workers and a brain drain - with qualified health personnel seeking employment
outside of Nigeria where quality of services and working conditions were better.

Health sector reforms were initiated with the aim of making health care accessible, equitable, and affordable
as well as cost-effective and efficient. This involved improving the governance structure and management,
building public-private partnerships for service delivery, and reducing the disease burden – especially from
malaria, HIV/AIDS and its opportunistic diseases including non-communicable diseases.

The reforms helped to revive the primary health care system and established a National Hospital Services
Commission to manage all federally funded tertiary health care facilities in the country. A national health
insurance scheme was also launched, initially being rolled out in 14 states, and a National Health Bill, outlining
the roles and responsibilities of the tiers of government was also enacted.

The reforms contributed to the following key outcomes:
1.        Development and implementation of the National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP): The
principles underlying the development of the NSHDP were alignment, harmonization, mutual ownership and
accountability in line with the Paris Declaration of AIDS Effectiveness. Developed through a participatory
process, the NSHDP aimed at a single national health plan for the country, a single fiduciary framework, a
single results framework and a single monitoring and evaluation framework for all levels of government. While
a single national health plan/policy has been implemented, problems remain with monitoring and evaluation.
                                                     35
2.        Repositioning the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA): One of the aims
of the reforms was to rebuild primary healthcare services, increase their coverage, and provide cost-effective
high impact interventions, the NPHCDA was repositioned to provide leadership for scaling up of the Minimum
Health Care Package through the Ward Health System, and plays critical role in implementing policies and
programs at the primary care level. The current engagement of the World Bank on results oriented services
for maternal and child health are also in coordination with the NPHCDA.

3.       Health insurance: By 2009, Community-based Health Insurance had been rolled out to 70% of people
in the informal sector and other vulnerable groups for making health services more affordable for these
population groups.

4.       Integrated Maternal Newborn and Child Health Strategy: The strategy aims to reduce maternal and
child mortality (MDGs 4 and 5) with interventions at the political ward level using midwifery corps scheme to
ensure availability and access to critical human resources. By 2009, it had been rolled out in 14 states. An
overall RH policy was also initiated in 2001 to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing RMNCH.

82.      Despite reforms, challenges persist in the health sector. One of these is poor
governance and accountability. Nigeria has a three-tier health system that has been
decentralized to the State and Local Government Authority (LGA) levels. While the Federal
Government finances the public health sector, (and operates some of the hospitals directly), LGAs
and the States do not have to report their budgets or expenditures to the Federal government.
“Such patterns also characterize practices at the facility levels and are inherent in the input-based
or historical budget financing systems through which facilities are currently financed” (World Bank
2012). With no monitoring, it is difficult to estimate how the funds are spent at the local and State
levels perpetuating the higher risk of corruption and wastage. There is recognition that it will require
both capacity building, and a change in organizational culture to achieve further gains in health
service provision.

1. KEY POLICIES
83.     Within this environment, two policies have been pivotal in the direction the country
has taken on ASRH. The first is the National Reproductive Health Policy and Strategy (2001),
which paved the way for Nigeria’s largest SRH education program – the Family Life and HIV
Education (FLHE) Program. It was also the first to provide an overarching framework for addressing
SRH. The second is the National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and
Young People in Nigeria (2007). The policy, which is currently in effect, emphasizes the
importance of access to information and youth friendly services, and encompasses reproductive
health, HIV/AIDS, risky behaviors, and education.

84.     The following section provides an overview of the policy environment in Nigeria that has
defined how ASRH is addressed in the country.


Overall Policy Environment: defining the boundaries of engagement
85.     In 2009, Nigeria unveiled its Vision for 2020 (NV20: 2020). Nigeria to one of the most
populous countries in Africa, with a very large youth population, and potential for rapid economic
growth and raised productivity provided the right types of investments are made. With this in mind,
                                                   36
Nigeria’s Vision 2020 aims for the country to become a major economy rivaling the BRICS by 2020
(FGON 2009a). This necessitates investments across all sectors of the economy, including health,
as outlined in the strategy, and is the guiding framework for current policies and programs in the
country.

86.       The Transformation Agenda: The Transformation Agenda is based on and draws its
inspiration from the NV 20:2020 and the 1st National Implementation Plan (NIP). It aims to deepen
the effects and provide a sense of direction for the current administration over the 2011-2015
period. The agenda aims to strengthen focus on key interventions across sectors, including
health, to operationalize the goals of NV20: 2020 and other development plans. In health,
activities are guided under the National Strategic Health Development Plan 2010-2015 (discussed
below).

87.      Recognizing the importance of a healthy and productive labor force, the Agenda also
focuses on job creation, especially for youth. Unemployment data show that the highest
proportion of unemployed is youth with a secondary or tertiary education. Despite economic growth,
job creation has not kept pace with the speed of new entrants into the labor markets. Literature
highlights the risks of youth unemployment with negative behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and
alcoholism, which are also linked to violence. To address this gap in employment, the
Transformation agenda calls for implementing a youth employment safety net support program that
includes conditional cash transfer and vocational training. It also aims to align university curricula
with market requirements (FGON 2011).

88.      The National Strategic Health Development Plan 2010-2015: The NSHDP was
developed to mobilize resources to “significantly improve the health status of Nigerians
through the development of a strengthened and sustainable health care delivery system”.
The plan focuses on improving service delivery at all levels, enhancing good governance and
accountability as well as better management, and making services affordable for the more
vulnerable groups of population (pregnant women, children under 5, and the elderly). The plan also
defines an essential package of services which includes RMNCH services including family
planning, PMTCT, and management of HIV/AIDS, along with immunizations, and pregnancy
related care (FGON 2010). While the plan does not mention adolescents as a particular population
group, nor does it mention adolescent/youth friendly services, it does include monitoring of
indicators related to unmet need and contraception prevalence as well as condom use for high risk
sex. Given that majority of the Nigerian population is under the age of 30, and that there is a high
rate of teenage pregnancies (121 births per 1000 women aged 15-19), it would be useful to also
enhance youth friendly service provision as part of the service delivery package, especially in future
planning. This would include for example, training modules on youth friendly/sensitive service
provision as part of basic training of health service providers or investing in patient confidentiality
and privacy at facilities.

89.      National Youth Policy (2009): In keeping with the focus on its young population,
Nigeria has also enacted two policies focusing on youth. Both policies broadly cover the roles,
responsibilities and rights of young people. The 2009 National Youth Policy builds on the first youth
policy of 2001, and promotes a holistic approach to addressing youth issues including
social, economic and health concerns. The 2009 policy provides a framework ‘to promote the
                                               37
fundamental human rights of young men and women and protect their health, social, economic,
and political well-bring to enhance their participation in overall development’. The policy lays out
the protections for and responsibilities of the youth. This includes protection from violence and
harmful traditional practices and calls on them to promote reproductive health and rights (FGON
2009b). In doing so, the National Youth Policy continues to create space and aligns with the
National Policy on Reproductive Health for Youth and Adolescents (discussed below).

90.      National Policy on Population and Sustainable Development (2004): The population
policy of Nigeria (2004) also creates space for addressing the needs of young people. Nigeria
enacted its first population policy in 1988, and the second one in 2004. The first policy emphasized
the links between better maternal and child health outcomes and fertility regulation as well as
economic growth. The second policy also emphasizes the link between health, population growth,
and economic growth. The policy addresses maternal and child mortality as well as HIV/AIDS, and
brings in the importance of the youth, stating that “Young people are the future leaders of the
nation. Appropriate provisions for their growth and development shall be made in recognition of
their special needs” (Lozanes 2012; www.population.gov.ng).


Reproductive health and adolescents in policy
National Reproductive Health Policy and Strategy (2001):


91.      As part of health reforms, Nigeria also adopted a national reproductive health policy
which still guides the government’s engagement on sexual and reproductive health in the
country. The policy was a first step in bringing attention to adolescent sexual and reproductive
health issues. While other policies on maternal and child health or HIV/AIDS had been enacted
previously, this was the first comprehensive policy that provided an overarching framework for
addressing sexual and reproductive health. Following the principles laid out at the International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 1994, the policy was inclusive of women and
men and promoted a cross-sectoral approach to improving sexual and reproductive health
outcomes through engaging education, reducing poverty, and other social aspects such as
gendered power relations. It also aimed to address gender based violence, and female genital
mutilation/cutting.

92.       The policy was critical as it acknowledged the reproductive health risks of youth
(ages 10-24), specifically raising concerns about the age at first intercourse, teen
pregnancies, sexual abuse, and spread of HIV/AIDS. These concerns in fact were among the
justification for initiating a national reproductive health policy. The recent National Policy on
HIV/AIDS (2009) also includes a focus on youth, highlighting them as among the most vulnerable
groups.

93.      The reproductive health policy paved the way for Nigeria’s largest sexual and
reproductive health education program - the Family Life and HIV Education (FLHE) Program,
which began operating in 2003 (discussed later). The FLHE is nested in the education sector, and
finds strong support in the National School Health Policy (2006). The policy includes family life and
HIV/AIDS as key components of the school health education curricula aligning it with the objectives

                                              38
of the reproductive health policy to improve access to information on reproductive health for young
people.


National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria
(2007):

94.      Following ICPD 1994, the government of Nigeria also developed an adolescent
specific framework on reproductive health along with a broader frameword on adolescent health
and development by 2005.. In 2007, and in alignment with other key policies, the government
introduced a comprehensive policy on adolescent health and development, which is currently in
effect. The 2007 policy aims to “promote the optimal health and development of adolescents and
other young people in Nigeria”. The policy emphasizes the importance of access to information and
youth friendly services, and encompasses reproductive health (including HIV/AIDS), social issues
such as risky behaviors, and education. The policy also lays out a broad outline of the roles and
responsibilities of the ministries of health, education, youth, and women’s affairs and development.
The policy supports the FLHE mandate as part of the education sector, and lays the responsibility
for youth friendly health services with the Ministry of health. It also holds it responsible for advancing
the youth in health and development agenda for the country.

95.        While successful implementation of the strategy requires coordination among
Ministries, on the ground, this is lacking. A case in point is the lack of coordination between the
Federal Ministry of Education (FMoE) and the Federal Ministry of Women’s Affairs (FMoW). While
the first is responsible for implementing the FLHE, the latter is responsible for reaching out of school
girls, but there appears to be a lack of communication and coordination in ensuring that the different
populations are covered. Moreover, there also appears to be no formal coordinating mechanism
connecting the FMoE. FMoW, and FMoH on improving access to information and services related
to sexual and reproductive health (Federal Ministry of Education, Interview).


National Gender Policy (2008):

96.       The National Gender policy brings together various gender related polices in the
country and focuses on five critical areas: (i) bringing about a change in gender perceptions
and stereotypes through sensitization and cultural re-orientation; (ii) promoting women’s human
rights, especially related to sexual and gender based violence (SGBV); (iii) promoting the
empowerment of women and integrating gender within key sectors; (iv) enhancing women’s
political participation and engendering governance ; and (v) supporting institutional development
and building strategic partnerships.

97.    In terms of reproductive health, it aims to integrate gender and human rights into
national curricula. Aligned with the National Policy on Reproductive Health for Adolescents it
promotes reduction of harmful traditional practices including FGM and early child marriages and
addresses gender-based violence and HIV affected women’s rights.




                                                 39
2. PROGRAMS

98.      The Family Life and HIV Education (FLHE) program is the central piece of the
government’s efforts to improve ASRH outcomes in Nigeria. Initiated in 2003, the program
targets in-school adolescents, ages 10-17 years. It is implemented through the Federal and State
Ministries of Education and Local Government Authorities (LGA). Under the National Response to
HIV/AIDS mandate, the FMoE has adopted a two-pronged approach to HIV/AIDS: (1) the FLHE,
which is being implemented countrywide and the FCT with support of Global Fund resources, and
(2) co-curricular strategy, which includes peer education and mentoring. Rising from the mandate
to include reproductive health education in schools, the program focuses on upper primary (junior
secondary) and higher secondary school curricula in the country to improve knowledge about
sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.

99.     The FLHE is built into the curricula, and covers topics on puberty, personal skills (such
as self-esteem and values), sexual health, relationships, and sexual behaviors. However, the
program stops short of promoting contraception, opting to support abstinence as a means for
avoiding unwanted pregnancies, or reducing the risk of HIV/AIDS.

100.    Since its implementation began in 2003, the FLHE has faced some challenges.
Although being implemented country-wide, according to recent data, it only covers 13 percent of
in-school adolescents (NACA 2014). While there has been no large scale impact evaluation,
evidence of the FLHE’s influence has been mixed. A survey conducted in 2006 showed that only
45 percent of teachers sampled (n=1,131) had ever heard of the program (FMoE 2006); while
several other studies highlight improvements in knowledge and attitudes among students due to
FLHE (for example, Arnold et al. 2012; Adeniyi 2011).

101.     Teaching and providing contraceptives to adolescents remains a highly contested
issue especially in many developing countries (Arai 2003). School-based sexual and
reproductive health interventions for in-school adolescents are widely recognized in Nigeria.
However teachers have different perceptions and desires when it comes to getting involved in
sexual and reproductive health education (RHE) (Adegbenro, Adeniyi et al. 2007; Aransiola et al.
2013). Aransiola et al. (2013) found that the majority of teachers in Nigeria were supportive of RHE
or sexual education to be part of the education syllabus and were willing to teach it (Aransiola, Asa
et al. 2013). However a large proportion of these teachers were uncomfortable with the inclusion
of contraceptive matters in the curricula neither were they comfortable with making contraceptives
directly available to adolescents in schools. They preferred teaching ‘biology-focused pubertal
related information’ (Aransiola, Asa et al. 2013). Studies have found that teachers in Nigeria,
especially in urban settings, were supportive of RHE being taught in schools but their rural
counterparts were less keen of the idea. The majority of teachers in a study conducted in rural
communities in south-west Nigeria for example found that teachers were unwilling to be involved
in sexual education even after receiving sexual education training (Adegbenro et al. 2007).

102.    Quality of education varies, with willingness and interest at the State level to implement
the program. One of the main challenges in implementing the FLHE is the overall structure of public
education. Like the public health sector, the education sector is decentralized, with implementation

                                              40
in the hands of the States governments. Whereas there may be interest at the Federal level to
implement the FLHE, at the states level it is the willingness and interest of the government on how
well the program performs. Because of this, there are variations in the extent of FLHE integration
into the curriculum and quality of implementation.

103.    There is also a standalone information system that collects data on FLHE
implementation. 4 Based on this, in Phase II, 127,401 students have been reached, and over 2500
teachers trained in 21 States. This is only within the public education system. At the State level,
coordination is through the State Desk Officers, and implementation varies depending on the
resources available to them. The political will at the States level is very important for quality FLHE
implementation. The big gap here is the out of school youth population. While the FMoWASD
addresses them, there is no mechanism for coordination. According to the FMoE the only
collaboration is on addressing the needs of the orphans and the vulnerable.

104.    One of the issues initially was the lack of adequate funding. However, funding has
been increasing with support from the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The FLHE
has been receiving Global Fund support since 2009. FLHE is in its second phase of funding through
the Global Fund. This runs from 2010- 2015, after which new funding will be sought. The Society
for Family Health (SFH) is the recipient of the Global Fund Phase II funding in Nigeria. The funds
support the FLHE with the FMoE as the sub-grantee of the funds. The organization has 18 locations
and 12 programs country wide. In addition, SFH supports a peer education program in some
schools through the FLHE (with 10 students being trained as peer educators per school). Health
clubs with membership of teachers and students are also encouraged to promote long-term
sustainability.

105.   Among the barriers to a comprehensive scaling-up the program are the “gate
keepers” of society – a small but vocal minority that is defining the cultural boundaries of
what is appropriate. This means that messages get watered down. Vocal activism against the
program has been a drawback to the potential the program holds in educating young populations
comprehensively on sexual and reproductive health (SFH Interview February 2014).

106.     Another challenge is that what students learn in school may not be reinforced in
their daily lives. The reasons for this may range from discomfort in speaking about SRH with
parents to receiving inaccurate or limited information at home. For example, one qualitative study
of SRH communication between mothers and daughters in Northern Nigeria (n=184) found that
while most mother-daughter pairs communicated about SHR (at least 69% of the sample), it
revolved around puberty, marriage, stigma related to premarital sex and unwanted pregnancies as
well as STIs including HIV/AIDS. Less discussed were issues around sexuality, family planning,
and complications related to child bearing such as fistula (Iliyasu et al. 2012). Similar results are
also expressed in other studies (Izugbara 2008, Iyaniwura 2006, Bastien et al. 2011). One way to
reinforce what is being taught in schools is to connect the FLHE with service provision, for example,
by linking the program to counselling services on SRH.




4
 The data system for FLHE is not linked to the EMIS or HMIS. One potential reason for this is that the data is not aggregated
enough/no appropriate indicator for inclusion in the EMIS.
                                                          41
107.    Appropriate teacher training provides another challenge. It needs to be continuous
and mainstreamed within the national teaching curricula, which is currently not the case. Currently
teachers have to be specifically trained to participate in FLHE, but this is inefficient and not
sustainable. However, there is advocacy around that right now and the expectation is that this will
happen.

108.     On the ground, there is also an issue with expectations. Teachers feel that FLHE
presents additional workload on top of an already full workload (Dlamini et al. 2012). Most people
think that they should be paid to teach FLHE since it is donor funded. However, they need to be
reminded continuously that FLHE is integrated into the curriculum which they are already paid to
teach. The issue of different cultures and different attitudes was also raised as well as discomfort
in addressing SRH issues.

Other Programs:

109.    In conjunction with the mandate for reaching in-school and out-of-school
populations, several other programs have also been initiated. While the FLHE reaches the in-
school adolescent population, those who are out-of-school do not have access to the same type of
streamlined education. There are a few efforts ongoing to reach these populations. Although
information on their implementations is scarce, they are briefly discussed here.

110.    The Peer Education Plus (PEP) program is one of the programs focusing on out-of-
school population. This program is implemented by the same civil society organization that
working with the government to implement FLHE – the Society for Family Health (SFH). Peer
education plus is an existing model of affecting behavior change. As part of addressing HIV/AIDS,
SFH is partnering with the National Agency for Control of AIDS (NACA) on Peer Education Plus
focusing on HIV/AIDS and reproductive health. The program targets high risk populations, training
peer educators who then work with the high risk groups.

111.     Another program that supports young women is a Mentorship program initiated by
the Federal Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Social Development (FMoWASD) for girls who
drop out of school due to pregnancy or are single parents to teach them life skills. The
program’s aim is to provide these young mothers with skills that they can use to generate an income
and be financially stable. The program also provides education and information related to sexual
and reproductive health. According to FMoWASD, the program is being expanded at the State level
with support from the State ministries, but challenges exist such as limited financial resources, and
need for advocacy with other government agencies to promote gender and women’s well-being.
The FMoWASD is also actively engaged on violence against women. This includes working on
legislation, advocacy with police and the attorney general, and religious organizations. This
includes support to (1) the Network of Men against VAW; (2) Restoration of girls who have
experienced violence; (3) expansion of the violence prevention program (in some cases, in
collaboration with the FMoE).

112.    While these are promising programs, they are small in scale, and each operates
independently of the other, and the FLHE. Each has a different target audience and is administered
through different government agencies (NACA and FMoWASD), but broadly speaking, their
objectives are to reach out to out-of-school populations with information and education.
                                              42
Coordination between these programs and the FLHE at the Federal and State levels (where they
operate at State level) has the potential of more pro-actively reaching the population of school drop
outs, through early identification of the drop-out population, and having similar messaging on sexual
and reproductive health.




                  IV. RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS

113.     Adolescents are an important age group in Nigeria. They comprise over 20 percent
of the population. Their well-being is essential to Nigeria’s future, not only in terms of economic
but also social development and stability. Within the realm of health, sexual and reproductive health
is a key component in the determination of future outcomes. This is recognized in policy and has
been put into practice, most visibly through the FLHE program. Based on the evidence presented
in this study, the following recommendations are presented as points to consider in future policy
and programmatic interventions on adolescent health, and in particular adolescent sexual and
reproductive health:

114.     Improving the depth and quality of SRH knowledge: Whereas knowledge regarding
contraception and HIV/AIDS has increased, there are still considerable gaps in the quality of
information and the depth of knowledge. Adolescents, especially the very young do not have
complete information and myths persist especially about pregnancies and fertility. Depending on
the topic, it is likely that girls may have more information than boys or vice versa. While there is a
need to continue to expand coverage of existing programs, there is also a need to ensure that
adolescents are receiving accurate information. This requires working across sectors and with key
partners such as the UNFPA, and the Global Fund to find solutions.

115.     Enhancing the FLHE: The FLHE is a promising program. Its effectiveness can be
improved through better funding and coordination between the ministries of education and health
and women’s affairs to create links between education and access to services. The FLHE will also
benefit from more comprehensive curricula and some mechanism to ensure its reinforcement
outside of schools. In this regard, parent information sessions may be organized to help them learn
techniques for communicating on SRH issues with their children. In addition to parents, other key
stakeholders such as community leaders may benefit from information and advocacy around the
program. This could happen in campaigns organized by the DoH or community workshops
organized by churches, NGOs.

116.     Provision of youth friendly services (YSF): This is important in removing some of the
barriers to use. Adolescent friendly services may be available and adolescents may not have
access to them due to inconvenient locations, opening hours, cost or stigma they may experience
in their communities. Policy makers committed to increasing adolescents’ access to and use of
services should ensure that providers are trained to work with young people, respect confidentiality
and offer complete, evidence-based and accurate information. The National Primary Health Care
Development Agency has played a facilitating role in developing guidelines and identifying a
minimum package of services at the primary level and Nigeria provides some YFS at the secondary

                                               43
and primary level. These efforts need continued support, especially in rural and farming
communities.

117.     Revisiting child marriage in policy and practice: The ambiguity surrounding age at
marriage also needs to be addressed. Global evidence indicates that the risk of death from giving
birth is much higher for younger adolescents when their bodies are not fully developed. Children
whose mothers die at birth also face higher risk of mortality before age 5. Public awareness based
on these types of messages may be useful in the longer-term in reducing maternal and child
mortality and morbidity in the country.

118.     Gaps in data – health metrics: Not specific to Nigeria, but quite applicable is the limited
data on all adolescents. This includes data by gender, age, and marital status. Data on boys is very
scarce, DHS data is only for 20 and above in most cases, and not all the same questions are asked
of boys as for girls, making comparisons difficult. Data on 10-14 years is extremely difficult to come
by because it is rarely collected (due to ethical considerations). Since adolescents are an important
age group, it is essential that surveys are reexamined to collect data on the 10-19 years of age
population for both boys and girls. Additionally, the data do not cover unmarried populations for
some of the questions. Perhaps what is needed is a separate tool on adolescents with its own set
of topics including issues such as risky behaviors (smoking, drug use, alcohol consumption and
others).

       KARU LGA: QUANTITATIVE STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Karu Local Government Area (LGA) is made up of four districts: Guruku-Kabusu, Aso, Kodape and Karu; and
two development areas: Karishi and Panda. Karu has an area of 40,000 hectares and has a population of
about 216,230 people, 20 percent of whom are aged 10-19 years (GoN 2006). It is located about 60 km from
the Abuja city centre in Nasarawa State of Nigeria and is one of 13 LGAs in Nasarawa.

Sampling and Sample Size

Assuming an initial adolescent fertility rate of 21 percent, and that the indicator will be reported with 95 percent
confidence interval, then 255 adolescents were required to be sampled to give an estimate of fertility with a
precision of 5 percent. We assumed a 20 percent non-response rate and 20 percent chance of not meeting
an adolescent in a household, and determined the final sample size of 638 adolescents. A stratified random
method was used to choose representative samples of locations across the settlement types and
characteristics. The population of adolescents in the LGA was estimated to be 20 percent and there are five
settlement types hence, 20 percent of number of villages per stratum was used to randomly select the number
of villages to be visited per settlement type.

In each of the 5 settlement areas, a geographical mapping exercise was carried out to create the sampling
frame. The primary enumeration units were households from districts in these study areas. All households in
each of these districts were then counted. Households from each selected enumeration area were selected
using systematic sampling, i.e. starting from a randomly selected starting point; enumerators selected every
nth house or enumerated all households depending on the size of the district:
     •   Sampling in big selected towns used a sampling fraction of 5
     •   Sampling from smaller towns selected every 2nd household.
     •   Sampling in Zhayi, Kudu and Guruku I included all households because there were very few houses
         in these towns.

Enumerators visited each of the selected households and randomly select one eligible adolescent using
random number generator cards when households had more than one adolescent. The interviews were
conducted in private and each interview took an average of 45 minutes. In situations where an adolescent
was not available at the time of the visit, a letter was left at the household scheduling an appointment for the
interview at a later time. Three follow-up visits were made.

Variables collected

The research instrument was adapted from an instrument developed by Cleland et al. (2001) titled “Asking
young people about sexual and reproductive behaviours”, Illustrative Core Instruments. The instrument covers
different domains that include: sources of reproductive health information; sexual reproductive health
knowledge; sexual behavior including condom use; relationships; availability and accessibility of sexual
reproductive health services; and reproductive outcomes such as number of pregnancies and live births.

Data management and data analysis

Data was collected between the 30th of July 2014 and 20th of August 2014 using paper based face-to-face
interviews with selected adolescents residing in Karu at the time of the study. After each day of data collection,
all questionnaires (both new and completed) were collected from the enumerators and kept in the custody of
the supervisor. At the end of fieldwork, all tools were sorted and grouped per enumerator, and prepared for
data entry. Data was captured using Epi Info with quality control checks done using SPSS. Data was
transferred and analyzed in STATA (version 12). Sampling weights for Karu were not available to be used for
estimation. Baseline characteristics of respondents are presented in Table A1.1.

The field team manager under the supervision of the statistician ensured quality control of all field work including
data collection/interviews. In addition, the supervisor made post-interview visits to the sampled households where
enumeration had taken place. These visits helped to understand the views of parents and adolescents from the
selected households regarding their understanding of the overall aim of the survey, their feelings towards the
data collection processes and to check on the progress made by the enumerator(s). The supervisor purposively
chose 1-3 villages per day for the visit.

Study Limitations

It is important to get reliable and valid results in any study. This study was designed to capture sexual and
reproductive health outcomes for adolescent boys and girls in Karu. It was also meant to map out sources of
sexual and reproductive health knowledge, access and utilization of these services in the area.


                                                                    52
The areas mapped out for the survey covered the main different settlement types found in Karu; urban formal
and informal, tribal and farming areas. Although we assume that the selected sample was representative of
the adolescent population in Karu, there is no independent way of verifying this assumption. We could not get
local estimates of the distribution of children aged 10 – 19 stratified by age and sex, thus reported estimated
are not weighted. A few adolescents especially girls refused to take part in the study. Some of the reasons
given for refusal were the lack of consent from husbands and, some married adolescents who had children
felt that they could no longer be considered as adolescents; they felt that they were grown up women. The
fact that some individuals refused to participate in the study is likely to introduce some biases including
selection bias. If those who refused to participate were systematically different from those who were
interviewed, then the results cannot be generalized to all adolescents in Karu. Rates of being sexually active
as well as fertility levels may be underestimated in this study because those who refused to take part in the
study were likely to be married.

Karu is a satellite city of Abuja, which is likely to have different socio-economic characteristics compared to
other settlements in Nigeria. Nigeria is known to have two main dominant religious groups, the Muslim
population who are found predominantly in the North of the country and Christians who are likely to be found
in the Southern part of the country. These two religions have different views and practices on sexual and
reproductive matters. Although Karu, is said to consist of a culturally and religiously diverse group of people,
it is unlikely that the results obtained in this study can be generalized to the whole of Nigeria.

        KARU LGA: QUALITATIVE STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

Karu is one of 13 local government areas in Nasarawa State and has an estimated combined population of
216,230 people, 20 percent of whom are aged 10-19 years. Of the 12 communities sampled for the quantitative
survey, five were selected for the qualitative study, and included: Karu, Mararaba, Auta Gurugu, Guruku1 and
Kudu (rural). The target groups for the focus group discussions included adolescents between the ages of 10-
19, health care service providers, educators, and parents.

The following criteria were applied in making the selection: (1) the study had to cover both urban/rural
communities; (2) the distance from Karu Local Government Secretariat; (3) the size and accessibility of
community.

The FGDs covered the following topics:
    •  Potential reasons behind adolescent pregnancies in Karu, Nigeria.
    •  Factors that contribute to ‘unsafe’ sexual practices among adolescents.
    •  Receptiveness to various SRH awareness interventions and programs.
    •  Demand and supply side factors and constraints of SRH services that prevent or encourage
       adolescents to using these services.
    •  Opportunities and platforms that exist within health, education, and other sectors that can maximize
       improvements in ASRH within the Nigerian context.
Sampling and Sample Size

The research used purposive sampling to conduct focus group discussions to maximize variation and include
as wide a selection of individuals as possible for a representative sample.

Adolescent Focus Groups: Adolescents were stratified into the very young adolescents (10-14 years old)
and older adolescents (15-19 years old). The local chiefs identified and helped to mobilize adolescents who
participated in the discussion groups. Of the 16 adolescents aged 10-14 years selected to participate in the
focus groups, 10 were urban residents and 6 were rural dwellers. Of the 17 15 – 19 year old adolescents who
participated in the discussions, 11 were from rural communities whilst 6 were from urban areas. There were
9 males and 7 females in the 10 to 14 years old age group and, 9 males and 8 females’ participants in the 15
to 19 years old discussions. This resulted in a total of 4 FGD being conducted with adolescents.

Service Providers: Service providers were categorized into educators and health care providers. The service
providers were made up of 8 educators and 8 healthcare providers. These were identified with the support of
the Heads of the Departments of Education and Health and the Social Mobilization Officer of the LGA Health
Department. Among the healthcare providers were a doctor, 2 nurses, 2 community health providers and 3
private medicine vendors (also called Chemists). Two of the 8 educators were primary school teachers, while
the remaining 6 taught in secondary schools. They were selected based on their willingness and availability
to participate in the focus group discussions. A total of 2 FGD were conducted with service providers; 1 for
healthcare providers and another for educators.

Parents (Adults): One FGD was held with parents of adolescents. Of the 12 parents that participated, 7 were
males and 5 were females. An equal number of participants (6) came from the rural and 6 from urban
communities. The community heads were responsible for identifying rural parents that participated in the
discussions, while the Social Mobilization Officer contacted parents from the urban communities. Of these
parents, two were also heads of their communities.

FGDs were conducted predominantly in Pigeon or English to ensure the participation and understanding of all
members of the group. All discussions were held in the same location in Karu town. The 4 FGDs for
adolescents were all held on the same day, but separately. Male and female facilitators led the discussions
for male and female adolescent groups respectively, while a male facilitator was used to guide the discussions
with parents, educators, and healthcare providers.

Semi-structured interview guides were used to collect data for the FGDs. These instruments were developed
and informed by a review of relevant literature including (Cleland et al 2001), “Asking young people about
sexual and reproductive behaviors”, Illustrative Core Instruments.

This study examines the determinants of adolescent sexual behavior and fertility in Nigeria, with a special focus on
knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of adolescents aged 10-19 years old in Karu Local Government Authority (LGA), a
peri-urban area near the capital city of Abuja. Using the last three waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (2003,
2008, 2013), focus group discussions, stakeholder interviews, and a specialized survey of 643 girls and boys aged 10-
19 years old in Karu LGA, the study narrows in on key challenges to and opportunities for improving adolescent sexual
and reproductive health outcomes. This includes addressing gaps in health data, especially for the 10-14 year olds; (ii)
scaling up availability and access to youth-friendly services and the Family Life and HIV Education (FLHE); (iii) reaching
out-of-school adolescents with SRH information; and (iv) generating greater support and enforcement, especially at the
sub-regional level, of the Child Marriage Act (2003) which sets the legal age at marriage at 18 years old.
