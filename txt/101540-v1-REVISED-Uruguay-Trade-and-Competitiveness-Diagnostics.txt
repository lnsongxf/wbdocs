This report has been prepared as part of the Uruguay Pro-Growth Public Policies and Competitiveness
Programmatic Approach.

The report provide a basic diagnostic of Uruguay’s export competitiveness challenges based on the analysis
of publicly available data and evidence, by examining export dynamics and outcomes and using field
interviews with the public and private sector. The report then formulates a number of hypotheses for an in-
depth competitiveness diagnostic of the external sector, as well as policy recommendations to further trade
integration and on how to increase benefits from integration.

The report was prepared by a World Bank team led by Gonzalo Varela (GTCDR) under the guidance of Jesko
Hentschel (Country Director, LCC7C) and Marialisa Motta (Practice Manager, GTCDR). The following team            5
members were part of the core team of the report: Gonzalo Varela (GTCDR), Alberto Portugal (GTCDR), and
Daniel Reyes (GTCDR). Ana Fernandes (DECTI) and Esteban Ferro produced the background paper ‘Exporters
in Uruguay: Competitiveness and Dynamics in 2005-2013’. The macroeconomic context and public policies
section was produced by Cristina Savescu (GMFDR). Administrative assistance was provided by Silvia Gulino.
Writing and editing support was provided by Esther Florence Thiyagaraj and Susi Victor.

     The remainder of the document is structured as
     follows. Section 1 analyzes the macroeconomic
     environment in which exporters operate in Uruguay
     during the period of analysis. Section 2 looks at level,
     growth, composition, and market share performance of
     Uruguay’s exports, as well as the country’s main trading
     destinations. It also briefly considers the evolution of
     FDI inflows and their sectoral composition. Section 3
     focuses on the diversification of products and markets,
     considering several measures of concentration, including
     the share of top five products and markets in exports,
     and the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index for Uruguay’s
     export portfolio. Sections 4 and 5 address quality and
     sophistication and survival, respectively.

            Source: Authors’ calculations using data from WITS. Note: The RCA index is the ratio of a country’s export share in a specific sector to the
            world share of that sector in total world exports. An RCA index above the unit indicates that the country’s share of exports in that sector
            exceeds the global export share of the same sector in the same period. In such cases, we infer that the country has a comparative advantage
            in that sector. Export value is in thousands of U.S. dollars.

Some of the informational barriers that exporters
face are subtler than finding buyers or doing
market research and may be related to the design of
strategies to conceive, produce, and market products
that are fit for foreign markets. These strategies
are not implemented as isolated improvements in
the firm’s operations but as coherent elements of a
different approach to business. Artopoulos, Friel, and
Hallak (2010) termed these export-related managerial
practices ‘export business model’ (EBM). The authors
provide evidence that firms that adopt drastic changes
in their production and market methods are more
successful in entering and surviving in international
markets. Informational barriers may prevent especially
small firms from adopting these managerial practices.

         Calculating export sophistication, denoted by        percentage of a poor country’s exports but is a
         EXPY, is a two-stage process. The first stage        significant component of many rich countries’
         is to measure the income level associated with       export baskets.
         each product in the world, termed ‘PRODY’. The
         PRODY of a particular product is the GDP per         The second stage is to measure the income
         capita of the typical country that exports that      associated with a country’s export basket as
         good. Typical GDP is calculated by weighting         a whole; this is its EXPY. From the first stage,
         the GDP per capita of all countries exporting the    each product that a country exports will have a
         good. The weight given to each country is based      PRODY. The EXPY is calculated by weighting the
         on ‘revealed comparative advantage’, defined as      PRODY by the share that each good contributes
         the share of its exports that comes from that        to total exports. If butter makes up 15 percent
         good relative to the ‘average’ country. The PRODY    of a country’s exports, its PRODY will be given a

         the GDP per capita of all countries exporting        are made up of ‘rich-country goods’ will have a
         that product. Therefore, a product that typically    higher EXPY while export baskets made up of
         makes up a large percentage of a poor country’s      ‘poor-country goods’ will have a lower EXPY.
         export basket will have stronger weights toward
         poor countries’ GDP per capita. This will be less    A shortcoming of PRODY, and thus of EXPY,
         the case for a product that makes up a small         is that it does not take into account the
                                                              quality differences within exported products
                                                              across countries. For example, exports of fully
                                                              traceable fresh beef are likely to be highly more

                                                              However, all beef exports are clustered together

               Measuring Relative Quality of Exports Using Disaggregate Trade Data
               We rely on the UN-COMTRADE database to
               characterize the relative unit values of exports.
               As in Schott (2004), unit values were calculated
               simply as the quotient of general imports values       where u itc denotes the unit value of the good and
               and quantities. Within any product (six-digit          u it90 denotes the value at the 90th percentile of
               combined nomenclature code) for any given year,        the unit value distribution across countries for
               we then have a distribution of unit values of          that product. R itc denotes the relative quality of
               imports from the different source countries. For       the country’s export of that good, that is, quality
               each good i and exporting country c, in time year      relative to other countries exporting the same
               t, we generate a measure of relative quality R as,     good.
