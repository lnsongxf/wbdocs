INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Country Context

The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) has
experienced sustained robust economic growth over
the past decade; indeed, it is one of the fastest
growing economies in East Asia-Paci fi c. As a
reflection of such progress, the country was recently
changed classification from low income country to
lower-middle income country, and is on track to
achieve its long-term goal of graduating from Least
Developed Country status by 2020. Such growth has
helped alleviate poverty, which has declined from 34%
to 23% in the last decade, lifting half a million people
out of poverty (World Bank, 2015).

Despite these achievements, significant economic
disparities persist across Lao PDR, particularly
among the country’s diverse ethnic groups and
between different geographical areas. The country
has 49 officially recognized ethnic groups, with four      In conjunction with countries across the world, Lao

    schools. Subsequently, children of 3 and 4 years of
    age have especially limited access to ECE services.
    Coverage of ECE services also varies significantly
    across geographic, socioeconomic and ethnic
    dimensions. While almost 60% of 3 and 4 year olds
    attended Kindergarten in Vientiane Capital in
    2011/12, just 15% of the same age group attended
    in Saravan province in Southern Lao PDR. Of all
    children enrolled in ECE, 90% are Lao-Tai while the
    remaining 10% are from other ethnic groups. Less
    than 8% of children from the lowest income quintile,
    from rural areas without roads or from non Lao-Tai
    communities, have access to ECE services (World
    Bank, 2014b). Lack of access, combined with poor
    child nutrition due to food insecurity and malnutrition,
    is detrimental to children’s development and their
    readiness to learn at school. Overall this translates
    into long term negative implications for the human
    development of Lao PDR.

    including a results framework and monitoring system.
    Also included in this component is an independent
    evaluation of the project’s impact on a range of child
    outcomes.

    The investments that this project offers are expected
    to contribute to reducing poverty in project target
    areas by improving children’s educational attainment;
    higher educational attainment is associated with
    higher income both in urban and rural areas (World
    Bank, 2014a). Research around the world has also
    demonstrated (see for example Burger, 2010; Elango,
    Garcia, Heckman, & Hojman, 2015; Engle et al.,
    2011) that disadvantaged children (i.e. those who
    have larger developmental deficits) gain more benefit
    from ECE participation when compared to their more
    advantaged peers. In this way, the project is also
    expected to reduce the large disparities in education-
    al attainment of children across income groups,
    ethno-linguistic groups and gender, and therefore
    contribute to shared prosperity and educational
    equity. Early childhood development is the greatest
    enabler of human capability, allowing children to grow
    up to participate fully in economic, social and civic life.

CCDG (Community Child Development Groups):
delivery of community-based playgroups, including
training of locally recruited “teachers”, construction
of a purpose-built hut and grants provided to
communities to sustain implementation;

MAT (Multi-age Teaching): local pre-primary teachers
trained in the delivery of a purpose-designed
curriculum for children aged 3-5, in one class; and

CAC (Community Awareness Campaign):
a 12-module ECD training course provided to the
Village Education Development Committees, which in
turn enables the Committees to undertake community
awareness training of parents in their village.

In each target village, the following selection
processes were employed in order to collect data at
the village, household and child level. The head of
each village was selected to provide village level data.
If the village head was not available to participate, the
deputy village head was selected, and if the deputy
was also unavailable then the head of the Village           Figure 2:

complete a number of tasks. These assessments are
described in more detail below.

    The index provides a score for each child on these
    seven developmental domains. Scores for each of the
    domains range from 0 to 1, with1 being the best
    score and 0 being the worst. This score is derived
    from taking the average of all items in that domain.
    The data are not weighted or age standardised, so
    older children should receive higher scores in each of
    the domains to reflect more advanced development.
    From these seven domains an overall development
    score is derived, also ranging from 0 to 1; with 1
    being the best score. This overall score is derived
    from taking the average of all domain scores.

    Measurement of Development and Early Learning
    (MODEL) the instrument used to directly assess
    children’s development was the MODEL, developed by
    the Measuring Early Learning Quality and Outcomes
    (MELQO) initiative. The primary purpose of MODEL is
    to aid in the measurement of child development and
    learning at a population level. The tool can be used
    for children aged 3 to 7 years, and directly measures
    their pre-academic skills (through asking them to
    undertake tasks that include early literacy and numer-
    acy skills) as well as their executive function. To date,
    MODEL has been utilised in a range of
    developing countries include Bangladesh, Cambodia,
    Columbia, Kenya and Sudan. As with the eHCI, results
    from the MODEL can be used to present a nationally
    representative distribution of child development,
    which can then inform policy planning and budgeting,
    including resource allocation, curriculum design and
    teacher training programs, and ongoing monitoring of                        The MODEL was adapted for use in Lao PDR. The

important events had occurred in the village in the
past three years, 32 percent of villages had
experienced crop damage, 15 percent had new

experienced: the establishment of a new health
centre, a storm, or aridity. The establishment of a new
pre-primary classroom, a new teachers’ house, a new
factory/industry, or the arrival of electricity for the
community were each experienced by 1 percent of
villages. A few villages had also experienced a
robbery, damage to a bridge, the establishment of a
canteen room for children at school, a new temple,
the establishment of a market and a new village office

Few households had moved villages in the past four       to drinking water
years (3 percent). Of these, the majority had moved
once only (89 percent), while a few had moved
villages twice or three times (10 percent and 3
percent, respectively).


Drinking Water
The majority of households reported their main
source of drinking water to be a gravity fed water
system (74 percent), while others used piped water
(11 percent), bottled water (8 percent), surface water
(4 percent) or well water (3 percent)A few used water
from a borehole or rain water (both <1 percent). While
almost a third of households had this source of water
within their house (30 percent), the majority of
households (70 percent) had their main source of
water located outside of their house. For most, this
was relatively close by. For 32 percent of households,
their main water source was 10 or fewer metres away,                          Within House            51-100m

  different types of aid – 2 percent had received
  financial aid in the form of cash, and 11 percent had
  received aid in the form of rice (or other food) or
  goods (2 percent), clothing (5 percent), equipment to
  clean their latrine (4 percent), or agricultural tools,
  household equipment and articles, livestock, education
  equipment and filtered water (each less than 1 percent).

  existed in their village, 17 percent said that there was
  no VEDC, and 10 percent did not know if there was a
  VEDC.

  safe for children to play outside of the house (75
  percent), while 24 percent thought it was not safe and
  some did not know (1 percent). The majority of
  villages reported that they did not have open areas for
  children to play outside of their houses (95 percent).

THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
OF CHILDREN IN NORTHERN LAO PDR
Information on children’s health and development         Figure 13:
was gathered from the primary caretakers of 7,520        Caretaker's level of education
children. Additional information on children’s
development was obtained through a direct
assessment of children’s capabilities.



Caretakers
The majority of caretakers surveyed were female (88
percent) and identified themselves as the mothers of
the children being assessed (85 percent). The
remainder were the children’s fathers (11 percent),
grandparents (3 percent), aunts, uncles and siblings
(<1 percent). Caretakers ranged in age from 14-78
years old, with the majority aged 20-29 years (57
percent) or 30-39 years (28 percent).Much smaller
percentages of caretakers were aged less than 20 (4
percent), between 40-49 years old (8 percent), or over                           No school
50 years of age (4 percent). Caretakers had low                                  Attended but did not

   Leu, Yang, Cingmoon, Kmer, Toum, Singsili, Hor and Ilmain ethnic groups had 1 percent or fewer. Table 6 below
   presents children’s ethnicities across the five provinces. Khmu children make up the majority of the samples in
   Phongsaly and Oudomxay, while almost all children in Xayaboury were of Prai ethnicity. The sample in Houaphanh
   was made up of predominantly Lao-Tai and Hmong children, while children in Borlikhamxay were predominantly
   Lao-Tai, Hmong or Khmu.

   Child Health

   Good health and nutrition are essential not only for
   children’s survival, but for healthy development and
   growth. Health and nutrition lay the foundations for
   development throughout childhood, in turn having a
   positive impact on later learning, educational
   achievement and adult productivity. To promote
   holistic child development, good health and nutrition
   for the country’s children is critical.

Table 15 below presents results from a univariate
general linear model exploring how children’s
development scores are associated with their care-
taker’s level of education. Again, there was a statisti-
cally significant relationship across all domains of
development, with the strongest association
observed between caretaker’s education and
children’s scores in the literacy domain. This is
consistent with international evidence – caretakers
who are able to read and write are more likely to try to
foster these skills in the children they are caring for,
while it is very difficult for illiterate caretakers to
teach their children early literacy skills that they do
not have themselves.

    Approaches to Learning
    Children’s approaches to learning include how they                                                            interact with people and objects. With adult support,
    learn and develop new skills, and their attitude                                                              children feel safe and confident to try new things and
    towards learning experiences. For infants and                                                                 take risks. When parents nurture their children’s
    toddlers, this begins with their interest in the world                                                        natural curiosity by playing games, talking to them
    around them, and their curiosity and willingness to                                                           about their experiences, counting, reading and so on,
                                                                                                                  this lays a foundation for future learning and success.

    Early Numeracy Skills
    Basic numeracy skills and knowledge of numeracy
    concepts – such as being able to recognize a number,
    having knowledge of smaller objects and heavier
    objects, and the ability to count – are important for
    children to be ready to learn at school. Children will
    have a greater interest in learning at school when
    they have already developed an interest in counting,
    recognising numbers and shapes.

    As mentioned above, results demonstrate that
    children in northern Lao PDR have particularly poor
    numeracy skills, relative to other domains of
    development. Figure 25 below shows that when
    examining indicators of early numeracy skills as
    reported by caretakers, there are significant
    disparities across age, ethnicity and family
    background (refer to Tables 12 to 15 for significance
    values). As would be expected, children’s score in this
    domain of development increased significantly with
    age. Furthermore, while still low overall, Lao-Tai
    children’s maths skills were better developed than
    those of Khmu and Hmong children, or children of
    other ethnicities, while children with better educated
    parents had higher scores in this domain than
    children whose parents did not go to school. Despite
    these significant main effects, no interaction effects
    between children’s gender, caretaker’s education, and
    children’s ethnicity were found.

  19 percent could count to at least 10, 7 percent could                                                with Lao-Tai children on average being able to count

Familiarity with Print Concepts
These items assessed children’s familiarity with books; how to open them, where to start reading and so on.
Items were combined and the average was taken to give an overall score of 0-1, 1 being the best score. The
majority of children (53 percent) did not provide a response when asked these questions –a reflection of the fact
that 45 percent of households had no books, so children had likely not come across a book before. Just over a
third of children (35 percent) had at least some knowledge of books. Of the 47% of children who provided a
response, Figure 36 below shows that age was an important factor in being able to complete these tasks
competently. Small disparities in performance by ethnicity are also apparent, with Lao-Tai children performing
better than children of all other ethnicities, and children of parents who completed secondary school being more
familiar with books and print concepts than children with less educated parents.

Name Writing

Children were asked to write their name any way they
knew how. Almost half of children did not respond
(49%), 3% of children said that they did not know how
to write their name, 23% did not write anything, 18%
made some scribbles with no discernible symbols,
and 7% were able to write some symbols or letters,
albeit incorrectly. No children were able to correctly
write their name.

Executive Functioning

Executive function skills are the mental processes
that enable planning, memory, the focus of attention,
and management of multiple tasks. Good executive
functioning is important for children to be able to
remember instructions, plan their actions, solve
problems, and complete tasks – all of which a child
will need to do at school and throughout life. Poor
executive function can negatively impact a child’s
ability to learn new things, and therefore their overall
development.

Development of a child’s executive function was
measured via three direct assessments. Again, it
should be noted that there were a large number of
children who gave no response to these direct              Heads Toes Task
assessments, or gave an ‘I don’t know’ response,
rather than answering the question correctly or
incorrectly. This is likely due to children feeling        In this task children were asked to play a game in
uncomfortable that they were in an assessment              which they must do the opposite of what the
situation with an unfamiliar person, despite the           enumerator asks. For example, the enumerator
efforts enumerators made to make children feel at          instructs children to touch their head, but instead of
ease. The number of missing data for each direct           following the instructions, the children are supposed
assessment measure is included below.                      to do the opposite and touch their toes. This task is
                                                           designed to measure a range of aspects of executive
                                                           function including inhibitory control, working memory
                                                           and attention focusing. Children receive one point for
                                                           each correct answer they provide. The scale ranges
                                                           from 1-10, with 10 being the best score.

                                                           The large majority of children (81%) did not respond.

                                                           from 6-10, with 7% getting a top score of 10. Figure

negative impact on their learning and development.
Children whose parents engaged in simple yet
stimulating activities with them, such as storytelling,
drawing, reading, and playing, were developing better
than children whose parents had not been interacting
with them at home. The great importance of these
parent-child interactions is highlighted by the fact that
these activities were associated with increases in
children’s development almost as large as the
influence ECE attendance had on development.

    Finally, the ECE project will also implement
    complementary support services such as disability

    communities, and to provide children with nutritious
    meals in order to facilitate healthy balanced diets and
    concentration in class.

    For these interventions to be successful, it will be
    extremely important that the education of parents,
    teachers and community members is implemented
    effectively, and that the key messages around
    improving child development are delivered clearly and
    successfully to families living in the communities of
    northern Lao PDR.
