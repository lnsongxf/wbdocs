Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for Indonesia.
          The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice team,
          under the guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri, Practice Manager, and Ndiame Diop, Lead
          Economist. Led by Alex Sienaert, Country Economist, and with responsibility for Part A, editing
          and production, the core project team comprises Arsianti, Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin,
          Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Yue Man Lee, Elitza Mileva, Bede Moore and Violeta Vulovic, with
          additional editing by Peter Milne. Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto.
          Dissemination is organized by Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Desy Mutialim and Nugroho
          Sunjoyo, under the guidance of Dini Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Ekaterine Vashakmadze (Part A,
          international context), Monica Wihardja, Taufik Indrakesuma, Matthew Wai Poi and Edgar Janz
          with guidance from Vivi Alatas (Part B.1, rice prices), Della Temenggung and Connor Spreng
          (Part B.2, OSS), Elitza Mileva (Part B.3, potential GDP growth), and Arvind Nair and Yue Man
          Lee (Part C, natural resource sector). Key data and input were received from Dwi Endah
          Abriningrum, Dani Nugroho, David Elmaleh, Cindy Paladines, Michaelino Mervisiano, Imam
          Setiawan, Daim Sukriyah and Ikuko Uochi. The report also benefited from discussions with and

 Executive summary: High expectations




Bold fuel subsidy    Effective January 1, 2015, Indonesia’s new government took the decisive step of
reform and an        implementing a new fuel pricing system, dramatically reducing gasoline and diesel
ambitious budget     subsidy costs. This paved the way for the government’s first budget, passed in
have raised          February, to shift spending towards development priorities, especially infrastructure,
expectations and     the allocation for which is double the 2014 outturn. Successful implementation of
placed a focus on    the bold vision of the budget, however, will require overcoming administrative
implementation       constraints to spending and dramatically lifting revenue collection performance.
                     Achieving this, and having the benefits flow through into faster economic growth
                     and poverty reduction, is likely to take time, especially with the pace of sustainable
                     economic growth having slowed, due partly to lower commodity prices. Beyond the
                     fiscal sector, reforms taken in the first months of the government’s term in key
                     areas such as investment licensing also face complex challenges to make operational.
                     The government has signaled its strong reform intentions, and raised expectations.
                     Early progress will now need to be consolidated by effectively implementing major
                     reforms and the budget posture, against a still-challenging global economic
                     backdrop for Indonesia.

Global economic      The key global economic trends affecting Indonesia’s outlook remain broadly similar
conditions have      to those reported in the previous IEQ. High income economies are strengthening,
continued to         supported by a continued recovery in the US, gradual acceleration of activity in the
improve, but lower   Euro Area, and a return to growth in Japan. Economic conditions across developing
demand from China    countries are more varied. For example, India recorded strong output growth in the
is cutting into      final quarter of 2014, but other major developing economies contracted or grew
Indonesia’s          only very sluggishly. The outlook is for global growth to continue to pick up over
exports…             coming quarters, but only moderately from an average 2.5 percent in 2012-14 to 3.2
                     percent in 2015-17. Global trade growth is anticipated to remain sluggish, suggesting

                        that lifting Indonesia’s export performance, which has been hampered by renewed
                        real effective exchange rate appreciation since mid-2014, and weaker commodity
                        demand (notably from China), will remain a challenge.

…contributing to a      As lower global commodity prices have pushed down Indonesia’s export revenues,
sticky current          the overall current account deficit has remained relatively sticky, at 2.8 percent of
account deficit,        GDP in Q4 2014. An exception is the sharply lower level of global oil prices since
though lower global     June 2014, which is a significant positive for Indonesia’s trade balance given that net
oil prices bring some   oil imports are large (USD 23.9 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP, in 2014). However,
relief                  lower global oil prices are also expected to weigh on Indonesia’s export revenues
                        from natural gas (USD 12.1 billion in 2014), capping the expected current account
                        balance gain from the oil price shift seen to date to under 0.5 percent of GDP.
                        Imports have remained subdued, down 9.8 percent year-on-year (yoy) in US Dollar
                        terms on a 3-month moving average basis through January, notably including capital
                        goods (-14.0 percent), historically a good leading indicator for fixed investment.

GDP growth              Indonesia’s economic output expanded by 5.0 percent yoy in the final quarter of
dropped to a 5.0        2014, and also at 5.0 percent for the year as a whole, extending the trend since 2012
percent pace in the     of moderating growth. The national statistics agency has rebased GDP from the
final quarter, with     year 2000 to 2010, and revised it in accordance with the latest international
slow exports still      standards, resulting in measured output being larger by approximately USD 35
weighing on the         billion in 2014 than previously (a 5.3 percent increase in nominal GDP), and small
economy, and signs      reductions in recent output growth (by an average of 0.1 percentage points per year
of continued            from 2011-2014). While domestic demand growth edged higher to 4.4 percent yoy
downward demand         in Q4 2014, real fixed investment growth, at 4.3 percent yoy, remained relatively
pressures               weak, and a large statistical discrepancy between GDP measured on a production
                        and expenditure basis (up 5.0 and 2.4 percent yoy, respectively) complicates
                        inference. External demand continues to be a clear drag on growth, with net exports
                        subtracting 2.0 percentage points from year-on-year growth. This exceptional
                        weakness owes partly to a very high base of comparison as mineral exports surged
                        at the end of 2013 (ahead of the January 2014 partial ban on raw mineral exports)
                        but, even looking over 2014 as a whole, export volumes increased by only 1 percent.
                        High frequency economic activity data remained soft into the start of 2015.

With inflation and      Indonesia’s reformed fuel pricing system has allowed lower economic fuel prices to
credit decelerating,    be transmitted quickly to consumers, substantially unwinding the 34 percent average
BI cut key policy       increase in gasoline and diesel prices in November 2014. Consequently, a rare two
rates by 25 basis       consecutive months of price deflation occurred in January and February, cutting
points in February      headline CPI inflation to 6.3 percent yoy, from 8.4 percent yoy in December.

prices is felt…        This dramatic decline will support global activity in the medium-term but is
                       contributing to diverging economic performances across net oil exporters and

                       inflation moving towards policy targets, improved current account balances and soft
                       growth has allowed several central banks to cut interest rates since the start of the
                       year. In oil-exporting countries, however, central banks have had to balance the
                       need to support growth against maintaining stable inflation and investor confidence
                       in the face of currency pressures. For Indonesia, a net oil importer whose net oil
                       and gas trade deficit stood at USD 11.8 billion in 2014 (1.3 percent of GDP), the
                       drop in oil prices has significantly lifted the terms of trade and facilitated needed

…with the prices of              Beyond oil, weak commodity prices continue to weigh on Indonesian export

                                 demand from China for Indonesian imports, notably commodities, has been a
                                 source of ongoing downward pressure (Box 2). Despite the only modest

The global economy               The outlook is for global growth to continue to pick up over coming quarters, but
is still expected to             only moderately from an average 2.5 percent in 2012-14 to 3.2 percent in 2015-17,
pick up, but sluggish            accompanied by weak trade growth. The slow pace of global trade growth suggests
trade growth and                 that significantly accelerating Indonesia’s exports will likely not be possible unless
gradually tightening             the country succeeds in growing its global market share in existing products or
financial conditions             entering new markets. Other key features of the lackluster recovery, including
will likely pose                 accommodative monetary policies in major economies and soft commodity prices
challenges                       are also likely to persist, although financial conditions will tighten gradually. As
                                 monetary policy begins to tighten in the United States, capital flows to developing
                                 countries are set to moderate. They will, however, slow unevenly across countries,
                                 with investors focusing more on country-specific vulnerabilities and differences in
                                 economic, political, and monetary policy and growth prospects. For Indonesia,
                                 these shifts in capital flows could pose significant challenges over 2015 and beyond.

                2. Growth has slowed with no signs of an imminent pick-up
GDP growth in Q4        In the fourth quarter of 2014, Indonesia’s real GDP grew 5.0 percent year-on-year
2014, and for 2014 as   (yoy), similar to the third quarter when it rose 4.9 percent – on the basis of
a whole, was 5.0        Indonesia’s newly revised and rebased GDP (see Box 1). This took GDP growth in
percent…                2014 as a whole to 5.0 percent, down from 5.6 percent in 2013 and marking the
                        slowest annual expansion since 2009, when the economy grew 4.7 percent amidst
                        the 2008/9 global financial crisis.

…supported by           Domestic demand has continued to underpin growth, rising 4.4 percent yoy in Q4
domestic demand,        2014, similar to 4.3 percent yoy in the preceding quarter. Considering the main
especially              components of expenditures, private consumption rose 4.9 percent yoy and thus
consumption…            contributed 2.8 percentage points to fourth quarter growth, the same amount as in
                        the previous quarter. Government consumption was higher by 2.8 percent yoy in
                        the fourth quarter, up from growth of only 1.3 percent yoy in the prior quarter, and
                        adding 0.4 percentage points to overall GDP growth. Fixed investment was higher
                        by 4.3 percent yoy in Q4 2014, up from its 3.9 percent yoy expansion in the third
                        quarter but still at a subdued level, adding 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth.

…while net external     In the fourth quarter in 2014, goods and services export volumes were lower by a
demand weighed on       significant 4.5 percent than in the same quarter of 2013. This is a demanding
growth in Q4 2014       comparison since Q4 2013 saw a surge in export volumes as producers front-loaded
                        exports ahead of the January 2014 imposition of a partial ban on raw mineral
                        exports (see the March 2014 IEQ). However, even looking over 2014 as a whole,
                        exports were up only 1.0 percent. By contrast, import volumes had a much firmer
                        tone in the fourth quarter, rising 3.2 percent yoy, due in part to a temporary boost
                        from higher fuel imports ahead of the November 2014 subsidized price increase.
                        Consequently, weak external demand weighed significantly on the economy in Q4
                        2014, subtracting 2.0 percentage points from GDP growth year-on-year.

On the production       From the production perspective, primary sector output growth was subdued in the
side, the standout      fourth quarter, with agriculture up a low 2.8 percent yoy compared with 3.6 percent
feature of Q4 2014      in Q3, and mining and quarrying output still weak (up 2.2 percent yoy). In the
was strong              secondary sector, manufacturing growth softened to 4.2 percent yoy in Q4 2014,
construction sector     down from 5.0 percent yoy in the previous quarter, while the construction sector
growth                  grew by a robust 7.7 percent yoy in Q4, compared with 6.5 percent yoy in Q3.
                        Amongst the services sectors, weakness was concentrated in the wholesale and retail
                        trade and repairs sector, up at 3.5 percent yoy compared with 4.8 percent growth in
                        Q3 2014, and in the accommodation, food and beverages category (up 4.9 percent
                        yoy compared with 5.9 percent yoy in Q3).

While real GDP          Overall, the last national accounts release of 2014 continued the pattern in recent
growth was stable       quarters of gradually moderating GDP growth on the back of subdued investment
over H2 2014, other     growth, reflecting in part commodity and export sector weakness and policy
features of the         responses to maintain macroeconomic stability. While real GDP growth converged
national accounts       on the 5.0 percent level over the second half of 2014, however, there are also
point to an ongoing     indications that downward pressures on demand growth persisted through the end
moderation in           of the year. In Q4 2014, the GDP deflator, the broadest measure of prices in the
demand growth…          economy, grew by a low 3.7 percent yoy, down from 5.1 percent in Q3. Measured at
                        current prices, GDP rose 8.9 percent yoy, down from 10.3 percent yoy in Q3.
                        Finally, GDP growth from the production side was an unusually large 2.5
                        percentage points higher than that measured on the expenditure side (excluding the

                              difficulties is not unusual, but the large size of the difference in the fourth quarter
                              would also be consistent with demand lagging supply, to the extent that real final
                              sales fell short of output, which would be a headwind for future output growth.

…while economic               High frequency economic activity indicators also point to continued softening,

have also remained            contracted 15.6 and 9.7 percent on a three-month moving average basis compared
generally soft                with their year-ago levels (3mma) through January, hampered by relatively tight
                              credit and, by some accounts, anticipation of the November 2014 rise in subsidized
                              fuel prices. Overall retail sales as measured by BI rose 9.2 percent 3mma yoy, well
                              down from 14.4 percent in mid-2014. Cement sales over the 3 months through
                              January were flat compared with their year-ago level, while in the manufacturing
                              sector, the purchasing managers index (PMI) compiled by HSBC fell to 47.5 in
                              February, marking the fourth consecutive month of contraction, and a record low in
                              the nearly 4-year long series. Imports of capital goods, a generally reliable leading
                              fixed investment indicator, fell 14.0 percent 3mma yoy in January.

In the base case              Looking ahead, the World Bank expects GDP growth for 2015 of 5.2 percent,
GDP growth is                 picking up modestly to 5.5 percent in 2016 (Table 2, both unchanged from the prior
expected to pick up           projections in the December 2014 IEQ). The baseline projection is based on private
only modestly to 5.2          consumption growth remaining relatively stable, coupled with an acceleration in
percent in 2015 and           fixed investment spending to above 6 percent by the first quarter of 2016. Export
5.5 percent in 2016           volumes are expected to stage a gradual recovery but imports will also pick up on
                              the back of the expected firming in investment, including more infrastructure
                              spending. In combination, imports and exports (net exports) are not expected to
                              add to growth over the forecast period through 2016. Risks to the baseline growth
                              expectation are to the downside, as ongoing downward pressures on household
                              spending and investment growth from relatively tight credit and profit margin
                              pressures could continue to filter into activity. The key source of upside risk is a
                              faster than expected investment acceleration, but if this is not coupled with
                              improved export growth, external constraints to growth could tighten quickly.

Box 1: Indonesia’s rebased and revised GDP
Indonesia’s national statistics agency (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) released quarterly national accounts statistics on
February 5. As well as providing data for the final quarter of 2014, this release also incorporated two significant
revisions to Indonesia’s GDP statistics: first, it shifted the basis of the computation from the year 2000 to 2010 and,
second, it adopted a significantly updated methodology and presentation of the statistics, updating Indonesia’s national
accounts from the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA) to SNA 2008.

As a result of the revisions, Indonesia’s economy looks significantly bigger, and marginally slower growing, than
previously believed. Total output in current prices is about 4.4 percent larger than previously estimated in 2014 (and 5.2
percent larger on average over 2010-2014). This is a significant change, adding IDR 448 trillion, or about USD 35 billion
at the current market exchange rate, to the estimated size of the economy as of 2014. Roughly a third of the extra
measured output is due to the incorporation of new kinds of economic activity under SNA 2008, and about two-thirds
comes from more accurate measurements of previously-measured kinds of output, according to BPS. Although the
improved measurement of output results in a higher level of GDP, it also results in the measured rate of growth of the
economy since 2011 being lower, by a significant 0.3 percentage points in 2011, about 0.2 percentage points in 2012 and
2013, and a marginal 0.04 percentage points in 2014.

GDP is an essential yardstick against which key economic stocks and flows are measured. As a result of the revision,
and in the case of fiscal data also the new availability of Q4 2014 GDP, changes to important ratios include:
 • The current account deficit (or surplus of investment spending over savings): at USD 26.2 billion in 2014, was
   equivalent to 3.1 percent of GDP, now a smaller 3.0 percent of GDP.
• The external debt stock: at USD 293.6 billion as of December 2014 (as defined by Bank Indonesia), was equivalent
   to 34.7 percent of GDP for 2014, now a smaller 33.0 percent
• The fiscal deficit, at IDR 227.4 trillion in 2014, was 2.3 percent of GDP, now a narrower 2.2 percent. Tax revenues,
   at IDR 1,143 trillion in 2014, were equivalent to 11.4 percent of GDP, now a lower 10.8 percent.

As the above examples show, the magnitude of the changes to GDP ratios for Indonesia are not large enough to
prompt a rethink of economic conditions and risks. In contrast, some recent historical and methodological revisions in
other economies have resulted in far greater differences. In April 2014, for example, Nigeria’s GDP revisions
approximately doubled the measured size of the economy, causing it to overtake South Africa’s as Africa’s largest.

Beyond the change to top line GDP and hence some major ratios, the revised figures also mark an important step
forward in the continual process of improving the statistics tracking Indonesia’s large and rapidly evolving economy.
Thanks to the new methodology, more detailed sectoral data are now available, with the number of major sectors rising
from 9 to 17. Using the previous sectors as a basis for comparison shows how, under the new estimates, the services
sectors collectively account for a larger share of measured output (Figure 5), while the average growth of services
sectors in recent years was a little lower than previously measured, except for finance and real estate (Figure 6).

                   3. Regulated fuel price changes have been the major driver of inflation
Inflation rose sharply        The 34 percent average increase in subsidized gasoline and diesel prices in
at the end of 2014,           November 2014 caused inflation to rise sharply, to 8.4 percent yoy in December, up
due to the November           from 4.8 percent yoy in October. This increase, while large, reflects the direct and
2014 rise in                  wider input-cost effect of fuel prices on the overall consumer price index (CPI)
subsidized fuel               level, rather than an increasing rate of price rises over time. This is consistent with
prices, but                   the inflation effects of the previous, June 2013, increase in subsidized fuel prices,
underlying inflation          the large impact of which on price levels dropped out of the year-on-year inflation
pressures have                comparison in July and August 2014, causing year-on-year inflation to fall from 6.7
remained                      percent in June 2014 to 4.0 percent in August 2014. Stripping out the estimated
contained…                    impact of the November fuel price rise, underlying inflation pressures have
                              remained contained. Had fuel prices remained unchanged through the end of 2014,
                              headline CPI would have likely risen by 0.4 percentage points over November and
                              December, ending the year close to flat at 4.9 percent.

…and retail fuel              Following the fuel price reforms that took effect on January 1, 2015 (see Box 3), the
price cuts in January         prices of previously subsidized low octane gasoline, and diesel, were cut by an
have subsequently             average of 18.1 percent from their November levels, reflecting lower landed fuel
caused price                  prices. This contributed to headline CPI falling by 0.2 percent month-on-month
deflation                     (mom) in January, reducing inflation to 7.0 percent year-on-year, and by a further
                              0.4 percent mom in February, cutting year-on-year inflation to 6.3 percent. Core
                              inflation, which measures underlying inflation pressures by excluding more volatile
                              prices including for food and fuel, has held at just under 5.0 percent since
                              December. Rice prices, however, spiked in February, as discussed in Part B.1.

Inflation momentum            The inflation outlook depends crucially on future retail fuel price changes, which in
is expected to stay           turn depend on global oil prices and the exchange rate. RON88 gasoline prices were
moderate, capping             raised marginally, effective March 1, by IDR 200 per litre, while diesel prices were
headline inflation at         kept unchanged (see Box 3). Under baseline assumptions, inflation is expected to
an average of 6.5             decline to below 5.0 percent yoy by the end of 2015, bringing annual average
percent for 2015              inflation in 2015 to 6.5 percent, reflecting stable underlying inflation momentum

                              and the large November 2014 price increase dropping out of the annual
                              comparison. Risks to the inflation outlook are balanced. Demand-side pressures
                              should be limited by the moderate pace of growth relative to what Indonesia has
                              sustained in recent years, albeit with only a modest output gap at present (see Part
                              B.3.). The risks of higher inflation come mainly from continued depreciation of the
                              Rupiah, or future increases in fuel prices. Pass-through of Rupiah depreciation into
                              inflation has so far not been apparent (and regression estimates suggest that a 10
                              percent Rupiah depreciation causes only an approximately 0.3 percentage point
                              increase in prices). However, exchange rate pass-through is expected to strengthen
                              following the move to make previously subsidized gasoline, and diesel, prices
                              dependent on Rupiah-denominated economic prices.

                         lower oil prices are expected
                         to materially reduce the net oil trade deficit, but weaker commodity prices, as well as
                         rising capital import demand, including due to increasing infrastructure investment,
                         will likely keep the overall current account deficit sticky over 2015.

…with lower oil          The current account deficit narrowed to USD 6.2 billion in Q4 2014 (2.8 percent of
prices contributing      GDP), from USD 7.0 billion (3.0 percent of GDP) in the prior quarter. The oil and
to the modest            gas trade deficit, at USD 2.8 billion, shrank by a modest USD 354 million compared
narrowing of the         to the previous quarter. The non-oil and gas trade surplus rose by USD 526 million,
current account          to USD 4.9 billion, mostly due to an improvement in export revenues while imports
deficit to 2.8 percent   remained relatively flat. January customs trade data showed a large trade surplus of
of GDP                   USD 709 million, up from USD 187 million in December, mostly due to lower
                         crude oil import costs. Going forward, the net oil import bill is expected to fall
                         further as lower global oil prices compared with 2014 filter into refined fuel costs.
                         However, the benefit to the overall current account deficit is expected to be partly
                         offset by reduced natural gas export revenues as contracted prices catch up to lower
                         global oil benchmarks (see Part C for a discussion of the oil and gas sector outlook).
                         Other sub-account balances in the current account remained broadly stable between
                         Q3 and Q4 2014; the service trade deficit rose by USD 190 million to USD 2.79
                         billion in Q4, and the income deficit fell by USD 170 million to USD 5.76 billion.

Commodity export         Exports were lower than their year-ago level by 10.1 percent in Q4 2014, at USD
revenue pressures        43.2 billion, the weakest level since the third quarter of 2010. Commodity-related
continued through        export revenues, especially oil and gas, but also coal and mineral products, were

                         China and Japan have been a key source of continued downward pressure on
                         Indonesia’s exports (Box 2). Manufacturing exports stood at USD 19.8 billion in Q4
                         2014, up by 5.2 percent yoy and reducing the contraction in exports overall by 2.0
                         percentage points, but without sustained upward momentum.

Imports remained                     Imports declined by 5.9 percent yoy in the fourth quarter of 2014. This was due
subdued, mainly due                  mainly to lower fuel import costs, but all major import categories—consumer
to falling oil import                goods, raw materials, and capital goods—remained considerably lower compared
costs                                with their year-ago levels (Figure 9). Consumer goods imports were lower by 10.3
                                     percent yoy, pushing overall imports down by 0.7 percentage points, while capital
                                     and raw material goods imports together contributed 1.5 percentage points to the
                                     total import contraction in Q4 compared with the year-ago level. The continued
                                     weakness in imports, albeit with signs of capital imports recently stabilizing, is
                                     consistent with other indicators of soft domestic demand conditions through the

Box 2: The end of Indonesia’s export boom1
Indonesia experienced an export boom from 2003-2011, during which the US Dollar value of exports approximately
tripled. Export revenues fell in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, but growth quickly resumed, peaking in 2011.
Commodity2 exports drove this growth, and increased from 52 percent of total export revenues in 2001 to 68 percent in
2011, as manufacturing and other exports grew at a slower pace and contracted as a share of exports from 48 to 32
percent. Since 2011, however, exports have slumped. Merchandise exports which contributed to 24.1 percent of GDP
in 2011 fell to 21.1 percent to GDP in 2014. Exports contracted in each of the last three consecutive years, to be down
by 13.4 percent in US Dollar terms in 2014 as compared to the peak in 2011, a comparable fall to the 15.1 percent
contraction during the global financial crisis in 2009, albeit over a much longer period (Figure 10).
Like the rise of exports before 2011, the decline of exports in the last three years has been due to commodity-related
exports. Commodity export revenues were over a fifth lower (-21.7 percent) in 2014 than in 2011, lowering the share of
commodity exports to 62 percent of total exports in 2014. Non-commodity, primarily manufacturing, exports grew only
very slowly over this period, to be only 5 percent higher in 2014 than in 2011, averaging USD 65 billion annually during
2011-2014 (Figure 10 and Figure 11).
Sharp falls in global commodity prices have driven much of the decline in Indonesia’s commodity export revenues. The
index of global benchmark prices for Indonesia’s six major commodities exports, weighted by export revenue share, was
40 percent lower in February 2015 than its February 2011 monthly peak (Figure 12). In addition, Indonesia’s
commodity exports have been impacted by lower coal demand from China (although partly offset by increasing demand
from India, with overall coal export volumes growing modestly), declining oil and gas output, and the sudden stop of
exports affected by the partial ban on raw mineral exports introduced in January 2014 (see Part C). For crude palm oil
(CPO), strong volume growth has compensated for lower prices, benefiting from rising demand from Pakistan, some
European countries, and the addition of 25 new export markets (destination countries for CPO exports) from 2011 to
2014 (Figure 11).
Indonesia’s exposure to Japan and China as key export markets has also recently been a source of downward pressure.
Rising exports after the 2009 global financial crisis through to 2011 were strongly related to rising demand from these
two countries. Exports to China doubled from 2009 to almost USD 23 billion in 2011, causing China to overtake the
US, Europe and Singapore as a key export destination, second only in importance to Japan since 2011 (Figure 12). Over
the last three years, however, exports sales to both China and Japan have fallen sharply, accounting for most of the drop
in total exports. Lower oil and gas production combined with the recent oil price plunge has driven much of the fall in
exports to Japan, which were 31.2 percent lower in 2014 than they were in 2011. Exports to China dropped by 23.5
percent from 2011 to 2014, with most of the fall occurring last year when the continued slowing of China’s economy,
the related drop in mineral prices and demand, and the mineral export ban in January 2014 slashed exports by 22.3
percent yoy. Coal exports to China dropped by 23 percent to only USD 4 billion in 2014 from USD 5.6 billion in 2011,
while minerals and rubber exports fell by 70 percent and 64 percent during the same period, leaving exports of each of
these commodities at less than USD 800 million in 2014 from more than USD 1.7 billion in 2011. In combination,
weaker commodity exports to Japan and China contributed 7.3 percentage points to the drop in aggregate exports from
2011 to 2014 (Figure 13).
The outlook for exports appears challenging, with global commodity prices and trade flows more generally not expected
to pick up sharply. Significantly accelerating Indonesia’s exports will likely not be possible unless the country succeeds
in growing its global market share in existing products or entering new markets, which in turn will require
improvements in Indonesia’s international competitiveness.

                               sector and revenues) and human development outcomes from 2002 to 2013, and managing the medium-term
                               vulnerabilities arising from the projected decline in commodity prices and production.

                               commodities such as CPO and rubber. The discussion in Part C focuses in more detail on the natural resource

                        expected to push up imports and the current account deficit. Compared with the

                        2015 and has been revised lower by 0.4 percentage points in 2016, reflecting lower

               5. The Rupiah has strengthened in real effective terms
While the Rupiah        Since July 2014, the Rupiah has depreciated against the US Dollar, by 10.2 percent
has depreciated         (through March 13, 2015). This must be seen in the perspective of pronounced
against the US          dollar strength against not just the Rupiah, but most global currencies. The broad
Dollar, it has          USD index gained 17.2 percent over July 2014-February 2015, a historically very
appreciated in real     large increase. This can be attributed to the rebound in relative economic growth in
effective terms…        the US, and to monetary policy divergence between the US (where the US Federal
                        reserve is expected to begin raising rates later in 2015), Euro Area (where the ECB
                        in January began a major “quantitative easing” program) and Japan. Considering the
                        performance of the Rupiah against other currencies (Figure 14), on a trade-weighted
                        (effective) basis the Rupiah was stronger as of January by 3.9 percent yoy (as
                        measured by BIS). In real terms (i.e. adjusting for Indonesia’s relatively higher
                        domestic inflation), the trade-weighted exchange rate has strengthened steadily since
                        June 2014, and was up by 10.0 percent yoy as of the latest available BIS estimate, for
                        January. Consequently, as of January the Rupiah was only 3.2 percent below its 10-
                        year trend, compared with 12.2 below trend at the end of 2013, following the large
                        currency adjustment that year (Figure 15).

                6. Major expenditure reallocation and ambitious revenue collection targets
                   under the revised 2015 Budget
The 2015 revised         In January, Indonesia’s new government proposed its first Budget, revising the

reform agenda            particularly infrastructure, agriculture, and social programs. This reallocation
                         towards productive expenditures is a major positive development. However,
                         effective execution of the budget will require continuing to address capital spending
                         challenges, and the increase in budgeted revenues needed to finance the envisaged
                         spending increases is extremely large. Consequently, fully implementing the new
                         budget stance will likely take time, and over the course of 2015 the authorities will
                         likely face the challenge of adjusting spending to account for lower than budgeted
                         realized revenues while preserving the improved allocative efficiency of the Budget.

The 2014 fiscal       The revised 2015 Budget inherits significant fiscal challenges. The provisional fiscal
deficit outturn was a deficit in 2014 was IDR 227.4 trillion (2.2 percent of GDP4), slightly smaller than
modest 2.2 percent    the revised 2014 budgeted level of 2.4 percent of GDP. Revenue collection

revenue               this was compensated for by means of major expenditure adjustments, including
underperformance… cuts in line ministries’ budgets, a sharp increase in subsidized fuel prices in
                      November, and lower capital spending.

…and the budgeted The 2015 revised Budget targets a smaller fiscal deficit than in 2014, of 1.9 percent
fiscal deficit falls to of GDP (Table 4). Underlying macroeconomic assumptions were also revised from
1.9 percent for 2015… the original 2015 Budget, to align better with recent developments, including slightly
                        lower GDP growth (5.7 percent from 5.8 percent prior) and higher inflation (5.0
                        percent from 4.4 percent). The Rupiah-US Dollar exchange rate is assumed to
                        average IDR 12,500, up from IDR 11,900 in the original Budget. Following the
                        recent international oil price fall, the assumed Indonesia crude oil price for 2015 is
                        now USD 60 per barrel, down significantly from USD 105 per barrel under the
                        original budget. Oil and gas lifting assumptions were also revised down to 825,000
                        barrels per day and 1,221 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, following weak
                        outcomes relative to targets in 2014 (Table 4).

…based on very           Targeted revenues under the revised 2015 Budget are higher by 14.6 percent than
ambitious revenue        the 2014 outturn. This significant increase comes despite the expected lower level of
targets…                 international oil prices in 2015 relative to 2014, accounted for in oil- and gas-related
                         revenues which are budgeted to decline by 43.4 percent for income tax and 62.5
                         percent for non-tax revenues. Driving the strong increase in overall revenues despite
                         the sharp falls in oil- and gas-related revenues (which accounted for about a fifth of
                         revenues in 2014 - see Part C for further discussion on the medium-term picture for
                         oil and gas revenues), is a significant rise in other tax revenues, especially value-
                         added tax (VAT). VAT is targeted to increase by 42.5 percent relative to the 2014
                         realization, and income taxes from non-oil and gas related sectors are targeted to
                         increase 36.9 percent from the 2014 outturn.

depend on                     problems, particularly land acquisition for new infrastructure projects. The
overcoming                    preliminary expenditure outcomes of the 2014 Budget demonstrate the challenge; in
execution                     2014, total expenditure disbursed at 94 percent of the revised Budget, or 96 percent
challenges…                   of the original Budget, with a mixed performance across spending categories. Core
                              line ministries’ spending (e.g. on personnel, material, and capital) disbursed at 18
                              percent and 12 percent lower than the original and revised 2014 Budgets, while
                              realized non-line ministry spending, such as subsidies and interest payments, tracked
                              the revised Budget closely. Capital spending fell well short of the budgeted amounts,
                              disbursing only 73 percent of the Budget and 84 percent of the revised Budget, with
                              spending contracting sharply in nominal terms from 2013, by 26 percent.

…and significantly            The second challenge for meeting ambitious development spending goals is posed
raising revenue               by the higher revenues needed to fund them. The large fuel subsidy cost savings
performance                   generated by the January 2015 reform, of approximately 1.8 percent of GDP in
                              2015, are offset by the negative impact of lower global oil prices on oil and gas
                              revenues, which are projected by the government to contract by 1.9 percentage
                              points of GDP in 2015 compared with 2014. The funding of the planned 1.0
                              percentage point of GDP increase in central government capital spending in 2015
                              compared with 2014, therefore, depends either on meeting the target of a 1.4
                              percentage point of GDP increase in tax revenues in 2015, an increase in the budget
                              deficit, or a combination of the two. As the end of the first quarter nears, the space
                              for additional revenue gains in 2015 through policy and administration changes is
                              shrinking and a significant revenue shortfall appears likely.

Box 3: Fuel pricing reforms have slashed subsidy costs but realizing the full benefits will require transparent
and consistent implementation
In a major policy shift, the new government announced further fuel subsidy reform on December 31, 2014, following
the one-off 34 percent average gasoline and diesel price increase in November 2014. This new fuel subsidy scheme,
effective January 1, 2015, is guided by the Presidential Regulation (Perpres No. 191/2014) and regulated by the
implementing regulation of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) (Permen ESDM No. 39/2014). The
new policy includes the following key features: i) introduction of a new pricing method, entailing semi-automatic price
adjustment, allowing gasoline and diesel prices to track the movement in international oil prices and the exchange rate,
ii) removal of the subsidy for gasoline (RON 88, “Premium”) (though the regulated price will still incorporate additional
transport costs for delivery of fuel outside Java, Madura, and Bali), and iii) introduction of a fixed per liter subsidy at a
maximum level of IDR 1,000 for diesel. The new prices of gasoline and diesel will be announced every month, or every
two weeks if deemed necessary, by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resource based on the monthly average of the
reference international oil price (e.g., Mean of Platts Singapore) and the USD/IDR exchange rate.

The new fuel pricing scheme is expected to have a number of positive impacts on fiscal management and the economy:
 Reduce budget uncertainty: the floating fuel price scheme will reduce fiscal exposure to international crude oil price
    and Rupiah depreciation. This exposure is now limited to potential changes in the required volume of subsidized
    diesel due to price-induced changes in demand (expected to rise if the price falls and vice versa), but this is a small
    uncertainty at a subsidy rate maximum of IDR 1,000 per liter, and to kerosene and LPG economic price changes.
    Reduce fuel subsidy spending and safeguard fiscal sustainability: the new subsidy scheme significantly reduces fuel
     subsidy costs. Fuel subsidy cost is projected to fall sharply from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.6 percent of
     GDP in 2015. This is a major boost for the sustainability of Indonesia’s fiscal position and for positioning the fiscal
     sector to support a more equitable economy.
    Expanding fiscal space to redirect spending to productive spending: the projected fiscal savings are crucial to open
     up the fiscal space needed to increase spending on priorities for development, like infrastructure and health,
     although in the near term the downward pressure on oil-related revenues due to the fall in global oil space limits
     the net increase in fiscal space.
    Lower inflationary pressure: there will no longer be very large, once-off fuel price adjustments of the kind seen in
     2005, 2008, 2013, and 2014. These large pent-up price shocks likely added to inflation risk perceptions, due to their
     uncertain timing and the threat that such very large supply-side price shocks could trigger higher longer-term
     inflation. The elimination of this source of the inflation risk premium should contribute to the stability of inflation
     expectations (in the past prices were artificially suppressed for long periods through below-market fuel pricing. This
     came at the cost of uncertainty about when this would end, a risk which has now been removed).
While the announced reforms are a major positive development, some subsequent announcements and actions have
generated uncertainty over the implementation of the reformed system. The timing of the January 19 price
announcement was unexpected, the pricing formula appears to have been unevenly applied for March, with the price of
only gasoline (but not diesel) being changed as of March 1 (possibly due to a shift in the per liter diesel subsidy level,
though this is unclear), and uncertainty about possible additional changes to smooth fluctuations (the government is
reportedly considering adapting a threshold mechanism to manage oil price volatility in the future but more detailed
information is not yet available).1 Specific components of the fuel price formula have also not been published.

More steps are needed to ensure the transparent and consistent application of the reform, thereby safeguarding its
credibility and many benefits. Principles to achieve this include the need for the implementation to be:
 Transparent: to realize the benefit of reduced inflation uncertainty from eliminating larger adjustments, and to
     prevent the new system from increasing inflation uncertainty, it is critical that the basis of the price change is clear
     (e.g. according to a published formula with observable benchmarks) and that the timing of price changes is known
     (e.g. once per month on a date, according to a pre-announced schedule). Regularly publishing the formula and
     related information could reduce the risk of uncertainty and ensure public support at times of price increases.
 Consistent: for the reform to remove the fiscal risks associated with the budget’s previous, heavy negative exposure
     to Rupiah-denominated fuel costs, it is critical that it is applied consistently. Otherwise, the government may begin
     again to accumulate higher subsidy costs, and there will be uncertainty as to whether the fiscal sector will continue
     to be safe from future rises in global oil prices or currency depreciation.

The World Bank           Based on macroeconomic projections for 2015 and the budget posture (aiming for
projects a fiscal        strong increases in capital and related expenditures), the World Bank projects a
deficit of 2.5 percent   budget deficit for 2015 of 2.5 percent of GDP, larger than the budgeted amount
of GDP in 2015…          (Table 4). This projected deficit level is based on the expectation that the rule
                         constraining the central government fiscal deficit to a de facto maximum of 2.5
                         percent of GDP will bind in 2015, and that the deficit will be capped at this level by
                         significantly restraining expenditures through budget cuts or low budget execution
                         in some areas, including capital spending.

…driven by a             On the revenue side, the World Bank projects a significant shortfall of IDR 282
significant expected     trillion (2.4 percent of GDP). This is driven by differences in macroeconomic
revenue shortfall        assumptions, especially lower GDP growth and a lower oil price. In addition, given
                         that details are not yet available on major revenue-enhancing measures that the
                         government may implement over the remainder of 2015, this projection excludes
                         possible gains from tax policy and administration changes. Consequently, the World
                         Bank projects that total revenues will decrease by approximately 3.7 percent relative
                         to 2014 levels. This decrease is mainly driven by a 57 percent reduction in projected
                         oil and gas related revenues, reflecting lower production and (in particular) the
                         assumed decline in Indonesia crude oil prices to an average of USD 55 per barrel in
                         2015 compared with USD 96.5 per barrel in 2014. Other revenues are projected to
                         increase in nominal terms, but at a much lower rate than targeted in the revised 2015
                         Budget. VAT and income taxes from non-oil and gas are projected to increase by
                         11.2 and 10.4 percent yoy, respectively, broadly in line with the trend in recent years.

There is still scope     Expenditures are projected in the base case to be broadly flat in nominal terms in
for capital spending     2015 compared with 2014, but with a markedly different composition. As per the
to rise from 2014        revised budget, wasteful fuel subsidy spending is projected to drop from IDR 240
levels, but it will be   trillion to IDR 67 trillion, and transfers to regions are projected to rise from IDR
significantly short of   574 trillion to IDR 664 trillion. Assuming that capital spending will be prioritised so
the budgeted level       that personnel and material spending is kept to 3.8 percent of GDP (as it was in
                         2014), instead of rising to 4.6 percent of GDP in the revised budget, there will still
                         be some space to increase capital spending - from IDR 135 trillion in 2014 up to
                         IDR 200 trillion in 2015. This would achieve a major, 47.8 percent, increase in
                         central government capital expenditures from 2014 (1.7 percent of GDP compared
                         with 1.3 percent in 2014), but would still be far short of the budgeted 103.8 percent
                         annual increase in nominal capital spending for 2015 (which would constitute 2.4
                         percent of GDP, a level not seen since the early 2000s). However, this is dependent
                         on the government choosing and being able to maintain personnel and material
                         spending at much lower levels than budgeted.

                7. Making credible progress towards ambitious fiscal and development
                   targets is a key challenge for 2015
The considerable        Fiscal management to account for the likely slower-than-budgeted revenue growth,
revenue challenge       and capital budget affordability and execution challenges, while preserving the
may lead to             improved allocative efficiency of the newly revised 2015 Budget, will be a key policy
excessive focus on      challenge over 2015. There is a risk that, with tax revenue collection targets for 2015
short-term, ad-hoc      being hard to achieve, excessive focus is placed on short-term, ad-hoc measures to
measures on the         meet revenue targets, which may have negative impacts on revenue performance in
revenue side…           the longer term. For example, international experience suggests that tax amnesties,
                        in general, do not have a significant effect on revenue collection, especially in the
                        long term, and can negatively affect future tax morale and compliance.10 Indonesia
                        introduced a tax amnesty in 2008, known as the “Sunset Policy”. According to DG
                        Tax, it resulted in an additional 5.4 million taxpayers becoming registered, and
                        additional revenues of around IDR 7.5 trillion. This estimated revenue gain was
                        small relative to GDP (approximately 0.2 percent), with no visible material effect on
                        the tax-to-GDP ratio over the longer-term.11

…and risks to       With below-budget revenues meaning that the unprecedented expansion in the
medium-term quality central government capital budget will likely need to be scaled back, there is a need
of spending         for a continued strong focus on maintaining a strategic approach to growing and
                    raising the quality of the government’s portfolio of investment projects over the
                    medium-term.

…with the uncertain     Following through on fuel subsidy reform, a central pillar of the government’s fiscal
future trajectory of    reforms, with consistent and transparent implementation of the new pricing
oil prices increasing   mechanisms, can play a role in maintaining fiscal credibility. This will be particularly
the need for            important if global oil prices were to rise significantly, which without consistent and
consistent              transparent application of price adjustments could raise concerns about the fiscal
implementation of       sector again becoming burdened by fuel subsidy costs. Conversely, if oil prices were
reformed fuel pricing   to fall further this would be a net negative for the fiscal balance since, following the
                        January 2015 reform, the loss in revenues from a drop in oil prices offsets the
                        associated decline in spending. A sensitivity analysis suggests that every USD 10
                        drop in crude prices generates a direct, net negative fiscal cost of approximately IDR
                        16.5 trillion (around USD 1.4 billion or 0.14 percent of GDP).

SOE performance is      The government’s capital injection to a number of SOEs with an IDR 70.4 trillion
increasingly in focus   (approximately USD 5.4 billion) 2015 Budget allocation highlights the key role of
                        SOEs for planned infrastructure development. This makes the performance of
                        SOEs with respect to the quantity and quality of investments increasingly central to
                        gauging the success of the government’s ambitious development plans.

Significant, and       As the government moves forward on its ambitious infrastructure development

external financing     quality external financing. Macroeconomic management challenges and growth risks
requirements place a   from external economic conditions and shocks could also re-emerge (for example,
premium on             due to any abrupt tightening in global US Dollar market liquidity conditions as US
securing more, and     monetary policy normalizes). Indonesia’s current account deficit (projected at close
higher quality,        to USD 30 billion in 2015), and short-term external debt burden (USD 58.4 billion
investment inflows     as of December 2014, according to BI), already generate significant ongoing gross
                       external financing needs. Ambitious infrastructure development plans will add to the
                       financing needs of the economy directly, and indirectly through more imports of
                       machinery, equipment and other inputs for projects. Aside from a continued focus
                       on maintaining and increasing policy and reserve buffers, credible reform
                       implementation to address Indonesia’s supply-side constraints would help to
                       generate a positive cycle of increased and more stable external financing (FDI and

Rice prices in                   Indonesia’s rice prices spiked in February, with retail prices ending the month
Indonesia spiked in              approximately 12 percent higher year-on-year, and wholesale prices increasing by
February, and there              about 14 percent (Table 5). Domestic rice production contracted in 2014 and stocks

prices rising at a               if it proves to be short-lived, however, the February price spike conforms to a
faster rate, and being           consistent trend since 2004 of Indonesian rice prices rising at a faster rate than

rice prices in                   food price crisis (Figure 23). The following section provides a brief overview of the
international markets            groups that are impacted by rising rice prices, and a discussion of some of the
                                 factors that may be driving the recent, and long-term, increase in rice prices.

                          (Table 6). Estimates for 2013 suggest that about four-fifths of total households, and
                          a fifth of rice farmers, are net consumers of rice.13 Poor households are also mainly
                          net buyers of rice, and are particularly impacted by high rice prices, because on
                          average 25 percent of their total spending is on rice. Consequently, the Word Bank
                          estimates that a 12 percent increase in rice prices, if sustained, causes a 1.3

                       not been effective in supporting productivity…

Indonesia’s market        Rice consumption per capita in Indonesia has fallen from 96kg in 2005 to 85kg in
for rice, which is not    2014, based on World Bank staff estimates from Susenas data. Total consumption,
fully integrated, is      however, will likely continue to rise, as rice remains a key part of the diet of
likely to keep            Indonesia’s growing population.14 This structural rise in rice demand will put ever
growing                   greater pressure on Indonesia’s domestic rice production, which currently accounts
                          for around 95 percent of supply. Adding to the challenge from generally rising
                          demand is the fact that rice demand is not uniform across Indonesia. People in
                          different provinces consume different varieties of rice, and there are transport and
                          information frictions across the country (discussed further below). This means that
                          rice does not flow smoothly at a given time from areas with surplus production to
                          areas with excess demand.

Poor quality data on      The limited availability and quality of data on both rice production and
both rice production      consumption reduce the ability of the government and researchers to understand
and consumption           Indonesian rice supply and demand. Production data are based on “eye estimate”
limit the evidence on     and “crop-cutting” methods that are less accurate than satellite data. Price data is
market conditions         available for early monitoring systems, but domestic stock data at main warehouses
and the ability to        and distribution points is lacking. Data released by the national statistics agency
make informed             (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS), showing consumption at 139.15 kg per capita per year in
policy decisions…         2014 (revised to a projected 124.89 kg in 2015) would suggest a surplus of domestic
                          supply of rice, which is inconsistent with high rice price inflation and the observed
                          need for imports.15

                             Indonesians are estimated to have been net rice consumers as of 2007 using IFLS, see Warr, P., 2014, “Food

                             estimates based on the Susenas 2013 Core and Consumption Module are that about 22 percent of rice farmers
                             and 83 percent of total households are net consumers of rice.

Productivity is                There are a number of factors that contribute to lower productivity. Indonesia’s
hampered by a range            average operational farm size, especially in Java, is below that in peers such as
of factors including           Thailand and the Philippines (Figure 26). Farms also tend to be highly labor
slow                           intensive; in 2013, Indonesia had the highest labor intensity rate out of China, India,
mechanization…                 Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam (Figure 27). While the international evidence
                               is that smaller farm sizes do not necessarily reduce productivity, they do reduce
                               potential economies of scale and the rate of mechanization, and these factors may
                               be weighing on Indonesia’s rice productivity growth, as well as being associated with
                               low wages for agricultural workers.

…poor infrastructure Other key challenges to improving productivity include low levels of technology and
and connectivity…    information (such as the adoption of innovative high-yielding and high-variety
                     seeds), low agricultural research and extension spending, and land administration
                     bottlenecks (limiting the titling which is commonly needed for loan collateral). Poor
                     infrastructure (irrigation, water resources, road-access to markets) and high logistics
                     costs also weigh on Indonesia’s rice market.16 Inter-island shipping costs are high
                     due to poor port infrastructure in Eastern Indonesia and significant backhaul

                                problems for ships returning to Java from eastern Indonesia. Trucking costs, both at
                                origin and destination cities, are the main logistical cost for rice in reaching markets.
                                Congestion in major cities and poor road maintenance in eastern Indonesia also
                                drive up costs.

…while increased                Public spending on agriculture, including rice, has increased significantly, but
public spending on              allocations have not been effective in supporting domestic productivity growth. The

spurred growth                  in 1970-80 to 35 percent in 2009 and the agriculture share of the budget doubled
                                from 3 percent in 2001 to 6 percent by 2008. This increase did not result in a
                                corresponding rise in agricultural production, which increased by an average of 3
                                percent between 2001 and 2009.17 The weak apparent impact of spending on
                                productivity can be attributed to the poor allocation of spending; agriculture subsidy
                                spending towards private inputs such as fertilizer increased by four times between
                                2001 and 2009, while public spending for irrigation remained flat. Research for
                                Indonesia has shown that spending on public goods such as irrigation has a positive
                                and significant impact on GDP per capita growth in agriculture, while public
                                spending for fertilizer subsidies has a negative impact.18

                      Bulog). OP is the main price-stabilization mechanism in cases of consumer rice
                      price inflation. The regulation allows a market intervention if there is 10 percent rice
                      price inflation from the three-month average price level until the rice price stabilizes.
                      Since 2009, rice imports have been rule-based, according to three criteria: (1) the
                      difference between the domestic rice price and the prevailing HPP rises beyond a
                      threshold level; (2) whether the amount of Bulog rice reserves fall below a certain
                      level; or (3) if the projected surplus from domestic rice production over
                      consumption is less than a set amount.21 Bulog is the sole importer of rice, except
                      for high-quality (0%, 1% and 5% broken) and aromatic varieties of rice.

                      assistance program that distributes subsidized rice (Beras Miskin, Raskin) is not
                      intended to stabilize prices, but it may sometimes be used to mitigate the impact of
                      a rice price shock among poor and vulnerable households, such as during the 2008
                      food price crisis. Taken together, OP, rice imports and Raskin directly affect only a
                      small share of total rice production (Figure 28). The small amount of OP released,
                      less than one percent of total rice production, likely explains why this mechanism
                      has had no significant impact in reducing prices.22

priority for the new    government as a key policy priority, investors report that obtaining the various
government              permits and licenses needed to establish a power plant can take over 4 years. The
                        importance of streamlining business licensing is recognized by the government to be
                        a major policy priority, and this section provides a brief overview of the steps that
                        have been taken so far in this area, as well as remaining challenges.
                    a. Business licensing is a major reform priority of the new government…

Previous attempts to    A number of initiatives were undertaken to improve and simplify licensing
improve business        application processes at the national and sub-national levels during the previous
licensing and           administration, but with limited results (Box 4). Creating a single point of contact
develop one-stop        for investors’ license applications is a way to make interactions with the public
services for licenses   authorities easier for applicants, and to create an institutional setting in which inter-
have yielded few        agency collaboration and simplification or streamlining of licensing processes
results                 generally becomes easier and more compelling. Previously, no significant progress
                        was made on the development of such centralized “One-Stop Services” (OSS) at the
                        national level, nor in simplifying application procedures for, and speeding up the
                        issuance of, business licenses. At the sub-national level, where businesses also need
                        to obtain licenses (including from different agencies), some sub-national OSS were
                        championed by reform-minded local leaders with notable success. The variance in
                        how well subnational licenses are processed has been, and remains, considerable.27
                        For most businesses, that need to obtain both national and subnational licenses, and
                        especially for smaller and locally focused businesses that need only sub-national
                        licenses, well-run OSS and the resulting improvement in licensing processing can
                        make a big difference to the accessibility, ease and cost of investing and doing
                        business.

The government has      The new government has put improved investment licensing back at the top of the
put business            reform agenda. It has publicly and repeatedly committed itself to improving the
licensing back at the   business environment in Indonesia and to making it easier, cheaper, and faster for
top of the reform       firms to comply with regulatory requirements. In his first impromptu visit (blusukan)
agenda                  after being inaugurated, the President visited the Investment Coordinating Board
                        (Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal, BKPM) in October 2014, and instructed BKPM
                        and relevant ministers to implement a central OSS within three months (i.e. by
                        January 2015). He also emphasized that investors should need to visit only BKPM
                        to apply for licenses at the national level. At the time of the President’s visit,
                        investors still needed to apply for licenses from various ministries and agencies

                          outside BKPM at the national level, as well as for sub-national licenses, while BKPM
                          itself only processed fourteen licenses, including the principle license at the start of
                          the licensing process and the operational license at the very end of it. Once fully
                          implemented, a central OSS will mean the integration of all licensing processes at
                          the national level under one roof, simplifying the currently complex web of business
                          licensing across the different national and sub-national agencies (Figure 29). The
                          intended result is quick, simple, transparent and integrated licensing services. The
                          President also announced that he would put pressure on governors, district heads
                          and city mayors to implement effective sub-national one stop services, with possible
                          budget transfer consequences for those failing to implement the changes.28
                       b. …and initial reform momentum has been strong

BKPM is reforming         Towards the end of the previous administration, BKPM had conducted an initial
its services to meet      mapping of business licensing procedures for selected sectors and identified
ambitious targets         potential areas for reform. The agency was also in the process of implementing
                          gradual reforms to improve its services to investors, including a review of the
                          application process and the introduction of an online application system. In
                          anticipation of the greater responsibilities to come, BKPM announced the full
                          implementation of its mandatory online application, effective December 15, 2014.
                          Although the online application had already been introduced for certain types of
                          licenses, full implementation was brought forward despite limited pilot testing of the
                          system’s readiness or private sector familiarization with the new processes.

BKPM has been             To prepare for the launch of the central OSS in January 2015, BKPM worked with
working with              the relevant ministries and agencies towards achieving four key milestones. First, the
relevant ministries to    development and issuance of ministerial decrees on the delegation of authority to
transfer licensing        BKPM, and the assignment of liaison officers from ministries and agencies to the
authority to BKPM…        central OSS, including a list of the licenses to be processed under the central OSS.
                          The liaison officer may have a mandate to process and issue the license directly, or
                          may transfer the application to their ministry or agency if it requires substantive
                          technical knowledge (for example interpreting environmental testing results or
                          certain types of construction and engineering permits). Second, the development
                          and issuance of ministerial regulations on standard operating procedures for all
                          licensing processes under the central OSS. Third, the organizational set up of the
                          central OSS, including front office and back office arrangements (software and
                          hardware), business processes, a call center, and a monitoring and tracking system.
                          Fourth, the initial engagement of the private sector in the reform process, including
                          gathering feedback and identifying problems, and initial outreach and
                          communication.

…and a single             As a result of the measures summarized above, BKPM now provides a single
physical location for     physical location at which investors can apply for many national licenses. While this
obtaining national        is a significant step forward, many challenges remain before realizing the goal of

Problems are                     In the weeks after the central OSS was established and started to deliver integrated
apparent with the                services, several implementation issues have been identified. Despite the
newly implemented                implementation in mid-December 2014 of an online application system, investors
online application               complain that the system is not reliable and lacks user-friendliness. Consequently,
system                           most investors continue to visit the central OSS in person, to consult with staff and
                                 seek solutions. This raises concerns regarding BKPM’s current ICT system and its
                                 capacity to support a fully integrated OSS. In addition, applications for licensing
                                 processed by sectoral ministries’ and agencies’ liaison officers dropped in the weeks
                                 following the integration of the central OSS in January. The fact that many investors
                                 continue to submit their applications directly to the sectoral ministries and agencies,
                                 or have delayed their submissions, suggests limited familiarity with how the central
                                 OSS works.

                                 BKPM to obtain each license and apply for the next one in the chain. BKPM still
                                 only processes licenses for about 300 business types out of a total of 1,200. Much
                                 work, therefore, remains to be done to realize the vision of integrated, efficient
                                 licensing.

                                 regulations governing required licenses will be needed (for example, regarding

                          become a critical issue, as the government has set an ambitious target of an
                          additional 35,000 megawatts in electricity generation capacity by 2019. The second
                          phase of central OSS implementation will include further sectors at the national
                          level. The piloting of sub-national OSS integration will be conducted in stages from
                          January 2015 until the end of 2016.

towards integrated        The development of integrated business processes will require detailed mapping of
processes                 all licenses. For example, initial mapping of electricity generation licenses needs to
                          be followed up with specific mapping for different types of power generation,
                          detailed business processes (step-by-step procedures for investors), and
                          requirements and supporting documents and procedures for each license.
                          Furthermore, an integrated business process will only make a significant difference
                          to overall licensing procedures if the government can simplify and streamline the
                          procedures first, and then apply these across central and sub-national OSS.

Box 4: Past reform initiatives to develop a central OSS and simplify business licenses
Law No. 25/2007 on Investment mandated the establishment of one-stop services (OSS) for business licenses
(Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Pintu, PTSP), with Presidential Regulation No. 27/2009 later providing implementation
guidelines.30 Subsequently, the government identified the simplification of business licensing as a priority area and
mandated BKPM to conduct a detailed mapping of the licensing process and draft new regulations to simplify this. For
sub-national OSS, BKPM issued service standards for the implementation of OSS in 2009. This initially created some
confusion, as the Ministry of Home Affairs had previously issued regulations (in 2007) concerning the division of
responsibilities between national and sub-national governments. Ultimately, a lack of sustained high-level focus on
streamlining and integrating licensing processes through the central OSS and sub-national OSS meant that only a
handful of licenses (out of thousands) were delegated to BKPM, and overly complex and inefficient licensing
procedures remain the norm for investors at both national and sub-national levels.

Presidential Regulation No. 27/2009 on PTSP also tasked BKPM with developing an electronic online system (Sistem
Pelayanan Informasi dan Perizinan Investasi Secara Elektronik, SPIPISE) for investment licenses within three years. The
system aimed to provide a national single window (NSW) for licensing applications and approvals. It was intended to
involve the central OSS at the national level through BKPM, together with sub-national OSS through provincial and
district and city governments. The online system was also to provide access to processes for the licenses issued by
Indonesia’s technical ministries in order to create a single source of information for investors. Today, while this online
system is running and can be accessed by investors through BKPM’s website, it is far from effective and issues remain
to be resolved. Some sub-national governments also use the online platform, but far fewer than initially targeted.31

Efforts to simplify business licenses and revitalization of the PTSP to attract investment were re-introduced in the
August 2013 Economic Policy Package (see the December 2013 IEQ). Initially, the Government decided to focus on
highly complex oil and gas sector licenses. However, the complexity of the sector and low ministerial-level commitment
towards meaningful reform led to these efforts running out of steam. This experience provides a useful lesson on the
importance of having strong and dedicated coordination, high-level ministerial commitment and a focus on specific
sectors that are relatively easy to manage. Once success in those sectors is forthcoming, these experiences can be applied
to increase the odds of success in more complex and challenging sectors.




                            30 The guidelines include: (i) OSS are run by the central government (through BKPM) and by subnational
                               governments; (ii) authority to issue licenses and other non-licensing facilities may be delegated by the technical
                               ministries to the head of BKPM; and (iii) further provisions regarding OSS will be issued by regulations from
                               BKPM.

                3. The sustainable pace of GDP growth in Indonesia: a closer look
Indonesia’s              Economic growth has been slowing consistently, albeit gradually, in recent years.
sustainable pace of      This slowdown has coincided with the weakening trend in global commodity prices
economic growth is       since 2011, begging the question of to what extent previously high commodity
in focus after the       prices provided a boost to growth and what pace of economic expansion can now
commodity boom           be sustained in a post-commodity boom era. From an economic policy perspective,
                         this question is particularly important in light of the government’s goal of lifting
                         growth to 7 percent over its first term (i.e by 2019). This section examines the
                         evidence on Indonesia’s recent growth dynamics and current sustainable growth rate
                         as the commodity boom fades, while Part C focuses on the natural resource sector’s
                         recent role in Indonesia’s economic development and the medium-term outlook.32

Commodity prices         Commodity prices are an important determinant of growth in major commodity
have played a major      exporters such as Indonesia. As discussed in detail in Part C, persistently rising
role in Indonesia’s      commodity prices in 2003-2007, and again in 2009-2010 during the recovery from
economic growth          the global financial crisis, resulted in higher corporate profits, household incomes
performance since        and government revenues (Figure 30). This in turn boosted the demand for
2003…                    consumption, supporting domestic output of goods and services (along with an
                         increase in imports) over this period. In addition, a significant increase in
                         investment was observed, a portion of which supported the expansion of the
                         productive capacity of the economy, especially in the mining sector (Figure 30).
                         Construction sector investment also received a considerable boost during the
                         commodity boom. Since 2013, however, investment and GDP growth have slowed
                         down as the prices of Indonesia’s main export commodities have declined.

…but observed            To understand the implications of these shifts for Indonesia’s growth performance,
growth at any one        it is important to distinguish between the economic growth observed at any one
time is not the same     time, and potential (or sustainable) output. Potential output and the output gap are
as Indonesia’s           key macroeconomic concepts on which many important policy decisions depend.
sustainable growth…      Economists generally define potential output as the level of output that is
                         sustainable given the underlying structure of the economy. The output gap is the
                         difference between actual GDP, as measured by a national statistical office, and
                         potential output. Sustainability means that, other things equal, the level of potential
                         output does not generate unwelcome economic outcomes such as high inflation or
                         an unsustainably large current account deficit. Inflation tends to rise when output is
                         above potential and vice versa.

…and commodity           Potential output depends on many factors related to the underlying structure of the
prices affect both the   economy. The commodity boom boosted both potential output, through the rise in
cyclical and the         productive capacity, and actual output, through higher domestic demand. This
potential rate of        explains why the country’s potential growth tends to move together with the global
growth                   commodity cycle, but by less than one might think looking only at actual growth
                         rates. Growth at any one time also reflects demand effects which are only
                         temporary, unless new investment leads to permanently higher productivity growth.

Estimates of            How much of the recently observed decline in GDP growth can be attributed to
potential output can    lower sustainable growth and how much to the cyclical component of growth? To
incorporate             answer this question, World Bank staff have used a multivariate unobserved
commodity prices…       components model to estimate potential output growth (Box 5). In a second
                        specification of the model, a price index of Indonesia’s five main export
                        commodities was included in the equation for the output gap. This modification
                        allows the cyclical effect of commodity prices to be separated out from their impact
                        on potential growth.

evidence that re-       accounting for lower commodity prices, is about 5.5 percent per year. This follows a
accelerating            decade during which potential growth was estimated at 6 percent or above. This
sustainable growth      suggests that a considerable portion of the recent growth slowdown (to 5.0 percent
will require major      as of Q4 2014, see Part A) can be attributed to a reduction in the sustainable growth

                        expect growth to bounce back easily to the 6-7 percent growth rates seen over 2010-
                        2012. Instead, major policy reforms and implementation will be required, including
                        in the area of investment licensing discussed in Part B.2 since the amount and
                        quality of investment spending are critical determinants of growth. Furthermore, as

                        headwind for growth.

Box 5: Estimating potential output growth in Indonesia
    How is potential output measured? Unlike actual GDP, which is calculated using household surveys, government budgets, financial
    statements of private and public enterprises etc., measuring potential output is challenging as it is not observed. Approaches to
    estimating potential output vary from univariate statistical methods to fully fledged structural models. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
    filter and the unobserved components model belong to the first group of estimation techniques. Their main advantages are low data
    requirements (only time series of GDP), transparency and simplicity. These methods filter out a trend component of GDP (potential
    output) from a cyclical one (output gap) at a particular frequency based solely on the statistical behavior of the GDP series. The main
    disadvantage of the purely statistical methods is that they do not incorporate economic information.

    In contrast to univariate filters, multivariate filters combine the statistical approach with structural economic relationships. One such
    relationship is the Phillips curve, which describes a positive relation between (expected) inflation and the level of actual output. The
    Phillips curve contains information about the supply side of the economy and the stage of the business cycle. Following Gerlach and
    Smets (1999)1, World Bank staff have estimated a multivariate unobserved components model for Indonesia with data starting in
    2000. In addition to the Phillips curve, the model includes an aggregate demand equation which relates the output gap to the real
    interest rate. The estimates show that Indonesia’s potential output rose steadily after the Asian financial crisis (Figure 31). It followed
    the trend in commodity prices, reaching 6.1 percent in 2007 at the peak of the commodity boom. After a decline related to the global
    financial crisis in 2008-2009, potential output increased to 6.4 percent in 2011 again on the back of strong commodity prices.

    Going a step further, and adapting the idea of Borio, Disyatat and Juselius (2013)2, an index of Indonesia’s five main export
    commodity prices can be included in the aggregate demand equation. It can reasonably be expected that the commodity cycle
    amplifies Indonesia’s business cycle by boosting output temporarily (see Part A). The model estimates show precisely this: in periods
    of steep increases (decreases) in commodity prices, the commodity price neutral potential output grows at a more subdued (faster)
    pace compared with the non-adjusted potential output (Figure 31). For example, during the global financial crisis the commodity
    price adjusted potential output stood at 5.4 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the non-adjusted estimate. According to this
    approach, the World Bank’s current estimate of potential output growth is 5.5 percent.

    Finally, the structural approaches derive a measure of potential output by estimating a structural economic model. These models
    allow for direct economic interpretation variables and are very useful for policy analysis, but they are data intensive, complex and
    hard to replicate. One of these methods is the production function approach (in this case, a Cobb-Douglas with constant returns to
    scale), which decomposes the growth rate of potential output into contributions from the following factor inputs: Indonesia’s
    physical capital stock, labor force, average years of schooling and the return to education (combined into “human capital”), and total
    factor productivity (Figure 32). The latter input is calculated as a residual and theoretically represents the effect of technological
    change and efficiency improvements. The results of this growth accounting exercise indicate that in Indonesia, like in other Asian
    emerging markets, capital accumulation contributed to a significant extent to growth (above 4 percentage points on average) in the
    1980s and 1990s. In recent years, as the pace of capital accumulation declined (to 2.5 percentage points of total growth) relative to
    earlier decades, a larger part of potential growth (around 1.5 percentage points) was attributed to total factor productivity.

…pushing up                   Price increases led to large production increases for some commodities in
Indonesia’s                   Indonesia, mostly for export. The increase was most dramatic for coal and crude
commodities                   palm oil, with a nearly four-fold increase, and nickel, with a three-fold increase, in
production and                production volumes from 2002 to 2013 (Figure 34). In contrast, production of
exports                       crude oil fell by 35 percent, and natural gas and tin production remained stagnant,
                              from 2002 to 2013. In the case of nickel and tin, almost all of the production was
                              exported, either in raw or processed form, and for coal the share of exports in
                              production increased, from 72 percent in 2002 to 80 percent in 2013. In contrast,
                              for natural gas the share of domestic sales in production rose from 25 percent in
                              2002 to 50 percent in 2013, driven by an increase in the use of gas for domestic
                              power generation and the enforcement of domestic market supply obligations.

                              41 This supply inelasticity is due to the time lag in projects going from exploration to production. For example, for

                        (Figure 38), with the commodity trade balance averaging 6.1 percent of GDP from
                        2002 to 2013, while the non-commodity balance averaged only 0.2 percent of GDP.
                        This reliance on commodity exports to pay for mainly non-commodity imports may
                        be in line with Indonesia’s comparative advantage, but does make the economy
                        vulnerable to commodity price volatility (see Box 2, and Part A, Section 7).

In contrast to the      Indonesia’s crude oil production declined in the last decade, from 1.26 million

                        trade deficit to USD 23 billion in 2012 (Figure 43). Since 2012, even with the
                        moderation in oil prices, the oil trade deficit has continued to increase, to USD 25
                        billion in 2014, reflecting ongoing declines in oil production and increased fuel

a marked rise in the    increase was due to rising investment prices, real investment growth averaged an

ratio                   sectors due to increased returns in those sectors, as well as higher investment in

                        percent annually from 2002 to 2012, which should have led to a 30 percent annual
                        increase in coal-related revenues, given the absence of major changes in the fiscal
                        regime. However, revenue from coal sales only increased 18 percent annually from
                        2002 to 2012. A joint study conducted by the World Bank and the Ministry of
                        Finance on mining non-tax revenue (NTR) administration, focusing on coal,
                        estimated that 22 to 46 percent of potential NTR (IDR 16-51 trillion) from reported
                        coal sales was not collected in the 2010-12 period due to weak compliance.

Prices for                     The prices of Indonesia’s natural resources exports have declined significantly from
Indonesia’s natural            their peaks, with a 45 percent decline in the price of coal, a greater than 50 percent
resource                       decline in crude oil prices and a 25 percent decline in the metals and minerals price
commodities are                index from 2011 to end-2014 (Figure 44). In the medium term, international coal
projected to continue          prices are projected to increase marginally from end-2014 levels to USD 79 per ton
to moderate                    by 2019, still 35 percent below the peak in late 2011, Similarly, for crude oil, natural
                               gas, and nickel, prices are projected to recover marginally by 2019, but still remain at
                               34 percent, 26 percent and 27 percent below their end-2011 peak levels respectively.

The price decline is           For coal, base metals and precious metals, the key factors driving the decline are
structural and is              declining demand from China and over-supply from projects that were initiated
driven by declining            during the commodity boom. The decline in oil prices has been driven by the
global demand and              increase in global supply from unconventional oil sources in North America, a
oversupply from                moderation of demand, especially in the OECD countries and the lack of supply
projects initiated             response from OPEC. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) prices, which are relevant as
during the                     Indonesia’s is the world’s third largest LNG exporter, are expected to decline in line
commodity boom                 with crude oil prices as contracts for sales are often indexed to oil prices.

revenues                GDP) in oil and gas revenue, from 3.0 percent to 0.8 percent of GDP, due to the

                        (diesel, kerosene and LPG) and electricity subsidies, but the net fiscal impact is
                        negative because the decline in revenue is more than the reduction in expenditure.
