Tenure Registration in Rwanda

 INTRODUCTION

 Since 2010, the Government of Rwanda
 addressed land tenure through a series of actions
 including the establishment of institutional and
 administrative structures for land management
 and administration. At district, town, and
 municipality level, District Land Bureaus
 (DLBs), complemented by sector and cell level
 land committees, assumed responsibility for land
 administration and planning. After careful
 piloting in 2008/09, a process for systematic low
 cost demarcation and adjudication using aerial
 photography or high resolution satellite imagery
 was roll-out nationally. In less than 3 years, the
 Rwanda Natural Resource Authority (RNRA)
 demarcated 11.4 million out of an estimated 11.5
 million land parcels in the country in a
 participatory way and at a unit cost of less than
 USD 6 per parcel (Nkurunziza 2015).

 Positive impacts at household levels were
 identified at various stages of the project             Fig. 1. Parcels on a Rwandan hill

 Table 3 presents results separately for residential and agricultural land. Although more relevant
 for sales than for non-monetary transfers, presence of a SLMs emerges as a key determinant of
 having transactions formalized. It is estimated to raise numbers of registered sales by about 0.79
 for residential and by 0.96 for agricultural land per quarter per cell, corresponding to 64% and
 117% increases for residential and agricultural land, respectively, per year. While structural
 characteristics such as the number of residential parcels in the cell and the share of urban
 population in the sector are strongly associated with registration of residential transfers, this is
 relatively less the case for agricultural land. Distance to the DLO, which serves as a proxy for
 transport costs, is significant and quantitatively large for agricultural land, in particular for non-
 monetary transactions; estimated coefficients suggest that for distances above 10 km from the
 DLO, the likelihood of registration of non-monetary transfers will be cut by half and that of
 sales by about a fifth. At the same time, while it is possible that the awareness campaigns made
 a significant contribution to the observed increases in the number of registered transactions over
 time, conduct of land week events in specific sectors, over and above national campaigns, does
 not seem to have had a significant impact on greater formality.                                          Table 4: Key household characteristics
