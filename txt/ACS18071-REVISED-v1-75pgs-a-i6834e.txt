Oyster culture in Chanthaburi, Thailand
Molluscs feed low on the food chain, which make them a relatively cheap source of protein. Culture plots can
be established and managed by individual farmers, a cluster of farmers, or the community. This neat and well-managed
stretch of oyster culture units in Chantaburi Province, Thailand, reﬂects some of the advantages of community-based
aquaculture management in terms of an equitable and conﬂict-free access to the water resource, clean culture environment
and improved incomes. Off-bottom culture techniques include polyethylene rafts, longlines, racks and cages.

    Spatial planning refers to the methods used by the public sector to influence the distribution of people and activities in spaces of
    various scales. Spatial planning takes place at the local, regional, national and international levels and often results in the creation of a
    spatial plan. Spatial planning also entails a system that is not only spatial, but one that also engages processes and secures outcomes
    that are sustainable, integrated and inclusive (FAO, 2013).

    The FAO workshop “Increasing Public Understanding and Acceptance of Aquaculture – the Role of Truth, Transparency and Transformation” was held in
    Vigo, Spain, in October 2015. The workshop covered a number of core topics related to the perceptions of aquaculture, including transparency and
    ethics, communication, collaboration, responsibilities and new approaches to better management of sector performance and perceptions (FAO,

Fish ponds for culture of Nile tilapia, African catﬁsh and African bonytongue, Cameroon
There is considerable potential to expand inland aquaculture in Africa to improve food security. The ﬁrst step in aquaculture planning
is identifying areas that have potential for aquaculture. In this scoping process, it is important to review any existing coastal zone
management plan to establish whether it facilitates aquaculture development. Legal and regulatory frameworks should establish
clear mechanisms for aquaculture zoning and site selection in waterbodies considered “common property” and the granting of
tenure rights, including aquaculture licences.

Shrimp aquaculture ponds in Sinaloa, Mexico
The Mexican National programme for Aquaculture Management was created to: (i) enable an orderly and competitive aquaculture
sector that is sustainable; and (ii) regulate and administrate the sector using processes and tools such as the delimitation of aquaculture
zones. In this programme, shrimp farming in Sinaloa State is used as one example to illustrate how aquaculture is managed through
aquaculture production units or aquaculture zones.

Tilapia cage culture in Beihai, China
When there are several farms in an enclosed or well contained waterbody, it is essential to develop and implement an area management
plan to minimize risks of disease and environmental risks.
Tilapia is cultured in many types of production systems. This ﬂexibility makes the ﬁsh attractive to farmers in many parts of the world
for subsistence and commercial production. Tilapia is also a favourite for many consumers. Fish from this farm in China is destined for
the American market, although consumption is increasing locally. This strong demand is supporting increased production around the
world in ponds and cages, in fresh and brackish water. However, as the industry grows, the risks also grow. Farmers must do their part
to reduce environmental and disease risks on each farm as part of a larger resource management system that will protect the quality
of water resources and the livelihoods for producers. Standardizing production practices and coordinating disease risks through area
management strategies are key aspects for ensuring sustainable growth of the industry.

   that increased risk requires increased monitoring eﬀorts. The involvement and value of locally collected information
   should be seen as very relevant to farmers to better understand the biophysical processes and become part of the
   solution, e.g. rapid adaptation measures and early warning, long-term behavioural and investment changes. Key
   activities include training of local stakeholders on the value of the information, monitoring, and use of the feedback
   for decision-making. It is also advisable to provide/implement some simple network/platform to receive and analyse
   the information, to coordinate and connect with broader forecasts and monitoring systems, and to provide timely
   feedback that is useful to local stakeholders. In such cases, well organized AMAs can generate information and
   facilitate feedback for faster responses.
   A recent consultation on developing an environmental monitoring system to strengthen ﬁsheries and aquaculture
   resilience and improve early warning in the Lower Mekong Basin took place in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2015 (FAO, 2017).

62 | Aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management under the ecosystem approach to aquaculture
  The ecosystem approach to aquaculture provides the conceptual guideline for spatial planning
      and management. This publication describes the major steps related to these activities.
 The rationale for and objectives of each step, the ways (methodologies) to implement it, and the
  means (tools) that are available to enable a methodology are described in a stepwise fashion.
    Recommendations to practitioners and policy-makers are provided. A separate policy brief
   accompanies this paper. The beneﬁts from spatial planning and management are numerous
    and include higher productivity and returns for investors, and more effective mitigation of
     environmental, economic and social risks, the details of which are provided in this paper.

                  This publication is organized in two parts. Part one is the “Guidance”;
   it is the main body of the document and describes the processes and steps for spatial planning,
   including aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management. Part two of the publication
       includes six annexes that present key topics, including: (i) binding and non-legally binding
international instruments, which set the context for sustainable national aquaculture; (ii) biosecurity
    zoning; (iii) aquaculture certiﬁcation and zonal management; (iv) an overview of key tools and
 models that can be used to facilitate and inform the spatial planning process; (v) case studies from
 ten countries – Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Oman, the Philippines, Turkey, Uganda and
         the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and (vi) a workshop report.

   The country case studies illustrate key aspects of the implementation of spatial planning and
 management at the national level, but mostly within local contexts. Take-home messages include
  the ways in which institutional, legal and policy issues are addressed to implement the process,
                                       or parts of the process.
