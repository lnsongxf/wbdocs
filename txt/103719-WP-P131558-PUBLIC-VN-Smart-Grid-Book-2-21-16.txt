      Finally, the legal and regulatory environment for the                 policy; (iv) Quality of Service regulatory policy (indicators,
      revised Smart Grid roadmap was analyzed in the areas                  incentives, penalties); and (v) Smart Grid Policy. The main
      of: (i) System Security policy; (ii) Renewables and their             recommendations are summarized in Table 6.

       Policy Area                       Recommendation

       System Security policy            The Grid Code should be complemented by the on-line security assessment criteria in order to
                                         avoid repeating past errors. Additionally, it should establish the tools that the System Operator
                                         must have in order to evaluate the security and perform on-line monitoring and control of the
                                         voltage/dynamic stability of the Vietnamese Power System.

       Renewables and their policies     Renewable energy planning should complement the developed Smart Grid roadmap in order
       and incentives                    to take advantage of those applications that ease the integration of renewable sources in the
                                         transmission network.

       International Interconnection     A greater degree of clarity in this area is needed. This may have some significance for the
       policy                            development and deployment of some of the Smart Grid initiatives, e.g., HVDC interconnection,
                                         more stringent requirements for online monitoring and security assessment to ensure
                                         frequency/voltage problems do not cascade from one system to another, etc. A policy that
                                         addresses these points may enable the inclusion of technologies like HVDC and increment the
                                         use of SVC for maintaining the stability of the systems and links.

       Quality of Service regulatory     The Grid Code should be revised to include clearly defined penalties for failing or incentives for
       policy (indicators, incentives,   exceeding quality of service requirements.
       penalties)

       Smart Grid Policy                 The Smart Grid policy should complement Decision No.: 1670QĐ-TTg of November 2012 with
                                         both KPIs and penalties in order to measure and track the performance of Smart Grid initiatives.

NPT is currently building a technical man-

aims to increase power system opera-

the LLS as a suitable and reliable application to calculate

the number of lightning events per year can be defined
and expressed as a mean, thus giving an indicator for

to improve the voltage profile by continuously regulating

      E.5.1	    Optimized energy generation mix
      The replacement of conventional power plants with
      wind generation (as well as other alternative ener-
      gies) to supply an ever-growing demand entails dif-
      ferent investment strategies for the construction and
      operations of new power plants. The leveled cost of
      energy (“LCOE”) is a possible mechanism for esti-
      mating the size of the investment required.

      LCOE is often cited as a convenient summary yard-
      stick of the overall competiveness of different gen-          Source: Energy Information Administration, 2014, (5)
      erating technologies. It represents the energy cost
      of building and operating a generating plant over an
      assumed life and duty cycle. Key inputs to calculat-
      ing LCOE include capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and
      variable operations and maintenance (O&M) costs,              FIGURE 89: LEVELIZED COST OF ELECTRICITY (LCOE) FOR NEW

      each plant type.

      In order to assign a financial value for the annual ben-
      efits related to the optimization of the generation mix
      it is preferable to start from a forecast of the LCOE
      values over at least two time periods (mid-term and
      long-term) because this parameter can change signif-
      icantly over time for some generating technologies.

      A credible international source like the U.S. Energy
      Information Administration (EIA) was considered as a
      source to capture the variability of the stabilized cost of
      new generation resources predicted in 2019 (Figure 88)
      and 2040 (Figure 89). These forecasted figures are
      available from the annual energy outlook 2014.

      Considering the current energy mix of Vietnam’s
      power generation profile, the gas-fired power plants
      and conventional fossil-fuel plants are considered
      candidates for replacement with wind generation
      because of their predicted costs. The benefits of
      wind generation would still be a net positive if an

      251.  Table 61 reports that the major costs are only in the first few years because of the installation of the FLS smart grid application. The benefits increase over 
          the  time  because  of  the  cumulative  effect  on  an  increasingly  extended  power  system.  Maximum  yearly  value  of  costs  is  $4,200,000  in  the  first  year  of 
          investment, while maximum yearly value of benefits of $2,455,732 occurs in the last year of the timeline.

This document presents a study on smart grid technology options
for Vietnam. With electricity consumption nearly matching
generation in recent years and insufﬁcient investment in new
power plants, the electricity grid is under constant strain by the
growing economy. Realizing the large technical, institutional
and ﬁnancial challenges posed by this expansion level will be
a key priority for Vietnam’s grid system operators in the short
term. Building on international experiences the report identiﬁes
viable smart grid solutions for Vietnam’s transmission network.
