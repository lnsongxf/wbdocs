 BOX 2:  Examples of Measures to Alleviate Competitiveness Concerns and Support
 Efficient Firms
 In the EU ETS free allocation of allowances is being gradually replaced by auctioning, with implementation at
 a faster pace for the sectors that are not trade exposed (such as power). Sectors exposed to leakage will con-
 tinue receiving a larger portion of their cap through free allocation. The arrangements for addressing carbon
 leakage have been designed to provide an ongoing incentive for firms to outperform others in their sector in
 terms of emission efficiency. The benchmark for free allowances is based on industry emission performance
 so that only the top 10 percent of performers receive free allowances to cover 100 percent of their emissions.
 Other firms receive the same volume of free allowances as best performers, but those firms that do not meet
 the benchmark have to purchase additional allowances at the market price to cover their actual emissions.
      Sweden refunds the revenues of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) charge on large boilers, stationary combus-
 tion engines and gas turbines to participating entities in proportion to their energy output. Although not a
 carbon pricing instrument, this redistribution scheme penalizes emissions and rewards efficiency at the same
 time, while not affecting firms’ production levels. In this way cash stays within the sector, while companies
 have incentives to reduce emissions and increase production efficiency (Sterner and Höglund (2000), Gers-
 bach (2004), Fisher C. (2011)).
      Since 1993 Denmark has rebated a portion of the carbon tax to various businesses, but not in propor-
 tion to their emissions. The Danish government provided a 97 percent reduction in carbon tax payments
 for some energy intensive firms of which 22 percent was conditioned on signing agreements to reduce
 their energy use—the rebate that was later abolished. From 2010 firms under EU ETS are exempted from
 the CO2 tax and the rest pay the full tax. At the time of writing this report the Danish CO2 tax was around
 23 EUR/tonne, an increase from 12 EUR/tonne in 2010. (Jens Holger Helbo Hansen, Ministry of Taxation,
 Denmark—personal communication.)




 BOX 3:  Linking the California and Québec Emissions Trading Systems
 California and Québec, which together with British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario, form part of the West-
 ern Climate Initiative (WCI), linked their emissions trading systems from January 1, 2014. Together, they form
 the largest carbon market in North America. Compliance units are fully fungible across both jurisdictions.
 Four auctions have been held to date (November 2014 and February, May and August 2015). The systems
 were designed to be linked, and assessed to ensure equal stringency prior to linkage, to ensure the environ-
 mental integrity of the scheme. In April 2015 Ontario announced its intention to join the regional program.
 Linkages would increase the total emissions covered by the caps, further enhance efficiencies and reduce

  BOX 4:  South Africa’s Carbon Tax Proposal
  South Africa’s proposed carbon tax covers CO2e emissions from fuel combustion, coal gasification, and
  non-energy industrial processes, as determined by the carbon content of the fuel consumed. The tax is
  scheduled to start in 2016 at a rate of 120 South African rand/tonne CO2e (US$10/t CO2e) and increase by
  10 percent per year until 2019. It is expected to cover approximately 75 percent of total national emissions.
      To ameliorate potentially damaging economic impacts to South African companies, the government
  agreed to introduce tax-free thresholds under which business will not have to pay. The tax-free threshold will
  be fixed at 60 percent of tax payments due, meaning that companies are responsible for paying the tax on﻿
  40 percent of their total emissions. Trade-intensive and other sectors with limited potential to reduce emis-
  sions (such as the cement, iron, steel, aluminum and glass sectors) will have higher tax-free thresholds,
  reaching up to 90 percent. Tax-free thresholds are planned to be phased down after 2025 or replaced with
  thresholds based on firm-specific carbon budgets. A combination of the tax-free thresholds and an annual
  increase of the carbon tax rate is expected to provide a clear carbon price signal (Morden et al, 2015).

  BOX 6:  Carbon Taxes and Specific Taxes on Energy Use
  Taxing Energy Use (OECD, 2015) shows the differences in implicit carbon tax rates among fuels and uses.
  This OECD analysis considers explicit carbon taxes and implicit carbon tax rates from specific energy taxes,
  as these are economically similar, to calculate the total effective tax rate on CO2. On average, the effective
  tax rate per tonne of CO2 in an OECD country in 2012 equals €164 per tonne of CO2 on average for oil prod-
  ucts used in road transport, €24 on average for oil products used for heating and process use, and €€5 on
  average per tonne of CO2 for coal and peat used in heating and process use. The differences in effective tax
  rates are very large, with the lowest rates benefiting the most emission intensive fuels. What does this imply
  for the practice of carbon pricing?
       One approach would be to assume that some prevailing taxes include an implicit carbon component, as
  well as components to address other policy goals (e.g. raise revenue, combat pollution, reduce congestion,
  improve the political feasibility, slow adaptation to changing circumstance, etc.). Taxes could be reformed
  to ensure that the carbon component is made equal across fuels and user types, as would be the case with
  a carbon tax. The exercise may be worth pursuing when a major overhaul of excise taxes to optimize their
  effectiveness in curbing a range of external costs is envisaged, but may provide little guidance for the intro-
  duction of carbon pricing.
       A second approach would be to require that the tax on all sources and uses of energy is at least equal
  to the aspired level of carbon prices. Alternatively, the carbon price could be added to all excise taxes on
  energy use except where there are explicit carbon taxes or cap-and-trade schemes. The difference between
  these two alternatives reflects a view on whether current taxes contain some degree of implicit carbon taxa-
  tion. The choice between both may mainly be a matter of political expedience. The importance of the reform
  in both cases is that all forms of energy use would be subject to at least the intended carbon price. Given
  the currently low carbon prices for large portions of energy use, especially carbon-rich coal, large gains are
  to be had from such reforms.


12  –  The FASTER Principles for Successful Carbon Pricing
      BOX 7:  Carbon Pricing and Complementary Technology Policies:
      The EU and US Cases
      The EU ETS does not prescribe how member states should use the revenues from allowance auctions. How-
      ever, in Phase III 300 million emission allowances from the New Entrants’ Reserve (NER) were set aside to
      be sold at the EU level to support one of the world’s largest funding programs for innovative low-carbon
      energy demonstration projects. The program was conceived as a catalyst for the demonstration of environ-
      mentally safe carbon capture and storage (CCS) and innovative renewable energy technologies on a commer-
      cial scale within the European Union. In the context of the upcoming ETS review, the European Commission
      considers continuing to sell allowances to establish an “innovation fund” that would also promote indus-
      trial breakthrough technologies. In addition the “modernization fund” is proposed by dedicating a por-
      tion of total revenues from allowance sales to improve energy efficiency and energy systems in the poorer﻿
      EU countries. In addition, the EU has agreed that at least 20% of its budget for 2014–2020—as much as €180
      billion—should be spent on climate change-related action. For example, the research and innovation program
      (Horizon, 2020) with an envelope of €63bn has the objective of 35% climate mainstreaming (over €22bn) over
      the period. The focus will be on research and innovation activities on energy, climate and clean technologies.
           While the United States does not have a national carbon price, it has advanced a comprehensive suite of
      low-carbon energy technology policies and measures. For example, the U.S. government funds about half of
      the basic research into energy technologies, or about US$6 billion a year. A number of experts (e.g. Newell,
      2015) have recommended a significant expansion of this funding (US$3 billion or more, or about 1.5 percent
      of revenue from an expected U.S. carbon tax) targeted strategically (e.g., for electricity storage, safer tech-
      nologies for nuclear power, direct conversion of solar energy into electricity), though spending should be
      ramped up gradually to allow time for training of additional engineers and scientists. The U.S. tax code also
      provides tax credits for private R&D expenditures into energy and other technologies, with resulting budget-
      ary costs approaching US$10 billion a year (Newell, 2015).

14  –  The FASTER Principles for Successful Carbon Pricing
  BOX 8:  Government Support for Fossil Fuels
  Taxpayers continue to bear substantial costs as governments support the exploration, extraction and con-
  sumption of fossil fuels, in contradiction with climate-change mitigation objectives. The International Energy
  Agency estimates that price-driven subsidies for the consumption of fossil fuels in a selection of emerging
  and developing countries amounted to US$548 billion in 2013 (IEA, 2014). The OECD estimates that support
  for the production and consumption of fossil fuels in advanced economies amounts to about US$55–90 bil-
  lion per year (OECD, 2013b).
       The IMF finds that pre-tax subsidies for petroleum products, electricity, natural gas, and coal reached
  US$ 490 billion worldwide in 2013, or 0.7 percent of global GDP (IMF, 2015). The IMF then adds a measure for
  “non-internalized externalities,” which are meant to account for the failure of governments to fully internalize
  environmental damages and other consumption-related externalities (e.g. road accidents, traffic congestion,
  carbon emissions, air pollution) through higher taxes on energy products. Using this approach, it finds that
  government support for fossil fuels could be construed as dramatically higher, even up to $5.3 trillion (IMF,
  2015). Setting energy prices to levels that are commensurate with supply costs in developing and emerging
  countries would help reduce global CO2 emissions in the order of 2–6 percent points (IMF, 2015); (IEA, 2014).

 BOX 9:  Managing Interactions between Carbon Pricing and Other Policies
 The European Union
 The EU climate-energy package includes a number of policies to support a triple target by 2030: reducing
 greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels; increasing the share of renewables in the EU’s
 energy mix to 27 percent; and achieving a 27 percent increase in energy efficiency above 2005 levels. This has
 led to national-level policies implemented in parallel to the EU ETS, e.g., feed-in tariffs and other incentives
 to promote new renewable power, energy efficiency obligations and subsidy programs. These policies have
 increased renewable energy penetration, reduced electricity demand and thus contributed to additional
 surplus of allowances that were not accounted for at the time ETS was designed. This has further reduced
 already low carbon prices, making carbon-intensive, coal-based generation more competitive in electricity
 markets when compared to gas-fired electricity (Böhringer et al, 2010). Renewable support systems, how-
 ever, achieved their objectives as industrial and energy policies—renewable energy costs decreased, pen-
 etration rates increased and European companies became global leaders.
      Recognizing these tensions, the European Commission (EC) in 2013 recommended that member states
 limit financial support for renewables to only the amount that is necessary to make renewables competitive
 in the market. The EC advised that as technologies mature, renewable support schemes should be gradually
 removed, while incentivizing producers to respond to market developments (EC, 2013). This was followed up
 by new state aid guidelines that promote a gradual move to market-based support for renewable energy. To
 increase cost effectiveness and limit distortions, the new guidelines foresee the gradual introduction of com-
 petitive bidding processes for allocating public support and also foresee the gradual replacement of feed-in
 tariffs by feed-in premiums (EC, 2014). At the same time, the Market Stability Reserve was introduced to
 reduce price fluctuations by changing the surplus if it becomes too large or too small. Some member states
 (e.g. UK) went further and introduced carbon price floor and CO2 emission standards for new coal generators
 that are comparable with gas-fired power generation.

 California
 California’s emission trading system is a key element in implementing its 2006 Global Warming Solutions
 Act. California Governor Jerry Brown further pledged that by 2030 the state will cut petroleum use by up
 to 50 percent, expand renewable energy supply to half of the state’s electricity use, double energy savings
 in existing building by 2030 (relative to current levels), address short-lived climate pollutants, and manage
 natural and working lands to store carbon. In April 2015, the governor’s Executive Order established a target
 of greenhouse gas emission levels 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. California also has complementary
 policies affecting sectors that are covered by the ETS as part of an overall strategy for emission reductions.
 Policies in capped sectors address market failures, drive technology and systems innovation and investment,
 and have multiple benefits that are not adequately captured by ETS itself.

BOX 10:  China’s Alignment of Policies
China has considerable experience aligning carbon pricing programs along with other climate policies. In
November 2014, the announcement of the joint statement regarding action plans on climate change beyond
2020 between the United States and China highlights two of China’s policy alignment priorities: (1) to peak
CO2 emissions by 2030 and try to reach this peak as early as possible; and (2) raise the share of non-fossil fuels
in primary energy consumption to 20 percent by 2030.
     China has large and growing experience with the Clean Development Mechanism voluntary emissions
trading platforms, and a large-scale pilot emissions trading system. Since 2011, China has been experi-
menting with seven regional carbon market pilots. Each pilot covers a large city—Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,
Chongqing and Shenzhen—or a province—Guangdong, and Hubei. Together the pilot systems account for
over 1 billion allowances per year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission, making
China the world’s second largest carbon trading market following the European Union’s EU ETS. Building
from these pilots, China has announced the creation of a national ETS, scheduled to begin in 2017, with the
start-up phase followed by a roll-out phase in 2020.
     Complementary to carbon pricing, China has established a number of complementary climate poli-
cies, including low-carbon city-development programs, which include pilot demonstration projects in clean
transport and green industrial parks, and local air quality improvement initiatives. Furthermore, there are
several subsidy programs for renewable energy. In 2014 the government announced plans to cut fossil fuel
dependency, reduce carbon emissions, and increase renewable energy generation (NDRC, 2014). It also set
2020 targets for primary energy consumption, coal use and the share of non-fossil fuel energy production in
the national energy mix (China State Council, 2014).

  BOX 11.  Academic Literature Provides a Useful Reference for the Long Term
  Carbon Price Trajectory That Is Consistent with Global Climate Stabilization Targets
  Academic studies suggest that socially efficient carbon prices should increase at the social discount rate,
  typically by around 2–5 percent a year in real terms, starting from the levels that are significantly higher
  than most existing carbon market prices (IAWG, 2013) (Stern, 2006). It is not evident from the literature and
  empirical experience that limiting carbon price development to a narrow bandwidth is a necessary condition
  for successful carbon pricing or that this optimal path needs to be strictly followed in all circumstances. In
  reality the phasing of financial carbon price trajectories will be shaped by political economy considerations,
  business cycles as well as economic and social realities in different countries. Nonetheless, incentives would
  be aligned and investment planning optimized if producers and consumers expected a broad-based and
  long-term convergence of the average international carbon price signals with what scientists suggest would
  be socially optimal for the global economy.

  BOX 12:  British Columbia’s Carbon Tax: A Phased Approach
  The Canadian Province of British Columbia launched its carbon tax in 2008, at a rate of Can$10 per tonne of
  CO2. The government introduced a schedule with four annual increases of Can$5/tonne, allowing the tax to
  reach a pre-determined rate of Can$30/tonne in July 2012. The tax applies to the carbon content of all fossil
  fuels purchased or used in the province, as well as methane and nitrous oxide.
       Carbon tax revenue has risen from Can$306 million in the first year of the tax to Can$1,120 million in fiscal
  year 2012/2013, or about 5 percent of total provincial tax revenue for that fiscal year. When introduced, the
  carbon tax led to an increase in the price of gasoline of around Can$0.0234 per liter, a modest increase in
  the context of normal price fluctuations. The fact that there was little evidence of any negative impacts from
  the tax helped to dampen opposition and played a major role in getting the principle of the tax accepted.
       While the initial price of British Columbia’s carbon tax was relatively low, the legislated annual tax
  increases meant that the government was able to raise the tax in subsequent years with minimal political
  controversy, because the increases were clear and anticipated. The province was able to move from a low to
  a more stringent price with less opposition than might have been the case if a Can$30 rate per tonne was
  implemented upfront. At the same time, expectations of progressively rising prices to 2012 provided incen-
  tives for clean technology investments.
       By July 2012, British Columbia’s carbon price contributed Can$0.067 to the average Can$1.38 price per
  liter of gasoline in Vancouver, compared to approximately Can$0.40 contributed by other local, provincial
  and federal taxes. Changes in the political landscape in the province and growing business concerns regard-
  ing potential competitiveness impacts prompted the government to freeze the carbon tax at Can$30 per
  tonne for five years in 2013.

 BOX 13:  Reinforcing Stability and Predictability in the EU Emissions
 Trading System (EC, 2015)
 Phase I of the EU Emissions Trading System (2005–2007) relied on EU member states to issue allowances in
 accordance with national allocation plans because the European Union lacked sufficient information about
 member state emissions levels to establish a harmonized cap. The majority of member states over-allocated
 allowances in an effort to safeguard economic competitiveness, leading to a rapid reduction in the price of
 allowances in 2007. Phase I allowances could not be carried over to Phase II in order to shield future trading
 from the risk of potential excess allowances and to guarantee that the ETS delivers the emission reductions
 necessary for compliance with the EU commitment undertaken in the Kyoto Protocol. The number of allow-
 ances was reduced in Phase II (2008–2012) by 6.5 percent to stay below 2005 emissions levels.
      Phase III of the EU Emissions Trading System (2013–2020) includes an EU-wide emissions cap, in place
 of national caps, and uniform allocation rules to avoid potential market distortions and reduce the potential
 for member states to over-allocate allowances. The cap is reduced by 1.74 percent each year. When the
 economic crisis of 2008 eroded the carbon price level by reducing the economic output of industry, many
 stakeholders urged the European regulator to step in and protect the price level. Pros and cons of market
 flexibility versus policy predictability were extensively discussed.
      A wide ranging policy debate was held in Europe considering structural reforms to the EU ETS, to address
 the surplus of allowances on the market. A widely held view emerged that volume based measures, such as
 the recently adopted Market Stability Reserve (MSR), would be more suitable than discretionary price mea-
 sures such as a minimum carbon price floor. An extensive discussion of the merits of the options considered
 can be found in the Impact Assessment that accompanies the legal proposal on the Market Stability Reserve
 (Source: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52014SC0017).
      Several options were considered as part of the discussion on structural reform of the EU ETS including
 increased targets, retiring allowances, an extended scope and discretionary price measures, some of which
 were dismissed because they would only address the issue in the long term.
      Discretionary price-based mechanisms, with an explicit carbon price objective, would alter the very
 nature of the current EU ETS from a quantity-based market instrument. Because they require a process to
 decide on the level of the price floor, the carbon price could become primarily a product of administrative
 and political decisions (or expectations about them), rather than a result of the interplay of market supply
 and demand. Setting the minimum price too high would just fix the carbon price, reduce the flexibility and
 result in higher abatement costs, while setting it too low would not be effective in addressing the surplus and
 create more certainty about the price. Stakeholders also indicated that a minimum price would also compli-
 cate linking the EU ETS to other emissions trading systems and would not result in an additional environmen-
 tal benefit without cancellation of allowances. More certainty for investors through a minimum price could
 come at the risk of imposing excessive costs on ETS participants and society if technological breakthroughs
 substantially lower abatement costs (European Commission, 2014).

    BOX 14:  Reinforcing Stability and Predictability in the Emissions Trading Systems
    of California and Québec
    In the linked California and Québec ETS, market intervention is triggered by the price of allowances. In this
    system, an auction reserve price or floor price is set. If the market price falls below the auction floor price,
    then some allowances may not be sold at auction. The California Air Resources Board and the Québec
    government may only sell unsold allowances if the closing price of the auction exceeds the floor price for
    two consecutive joint auctions. The floor price was initially set by Québec and California at US$10 in both
    American and Canadian currencies for 2012, the year the two programs took effect and a year before their
    first compliance periods began. This price has since increased annually by 5 percent plus the rate of inflation,
    calculated by the Consumer Price Index in each jurisdiction. Accordingly, in 2015, the Auction Reserve Price
    was set at US$12.10 and at Can$12.08. For each joint auction, the harmonized regulations stipulate that the
    floor price is the higher of the California or Québec floor price according to the exchange rate published by
    the Bank of Canada on the day prior to the auction. For example, for the May 2015 joint auction, the floor
    price was set at US$12.10 or Can$14.78 per allowance (i.e., per ton of CO2e.) and some vintage 2013 allow-
    ances that had not been sold were put back on sale after the closing price of the two prior joint auctions
    exceeded the floor price.

  BOX 15:  Ireland’s Carbon Tax and Public Acceptance During the Fiscal Crisis
  The adoption of Ireland’s carbon tax provides insight into the value of effective stakeholder engagement
  to implement a carbon tax, as well as Ireland’s effort to align implementation of the carbon tax as part of a
  broader fiscal reform.
       In 2010, in the middle of a financial crisis, the government of Ireland introduced a carbon tax that cov-
  ered CO2 emissions from non EU ETS sectors, and in particular natural gas and mineral oil used in transport,
  space heating in buildings, and by all businesses not covered by the EU ETS. Fuel use in agriculture is also
  included. Therefore, the tax targeted emissions associated with the general public’s day-to-day activities,
  e.g., driving and home heating. The carbon tax rate on natural gas and mineral oil was increased to €20 per
  tonne CO2 emitted on combustion in 2012.
       A carbon tax on solid fuels was introduced in 2013, at a rate of €10 per tonne of carbon emitted on
  combustion. The rate was increased to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted on combustion in 2014. There was
  some opposition to the introduction of the solid fuel carbon tax on grounds of the impact on lower income
  households who rely more on solid fuels. To reduce the impact of the carbon tax on homes, the Government
  has offered generous grants for retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency together with free upgrades
  for the elderly and vulnerable. Businesses dealing in solid fuels complain that they are suffering a loss of
  business from cross-border sales as their customers are sourcing solid fuel from Northern Ireland where it
  is not subject to a carbon tax. (Source: Emma Clutterbuck, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, personal
  communication.)
       One study, conducted by the University College Dublin, notes that the tax rate—set at €15 per tonne
  of CO2, which is high relative to the EU ETS allowance price—has been socially accepted. Along with other
  supporting factors, effective engagement and good planning are credited with creating circumstances that
  resulted in a carbon tax being proposed and subsequently introduced in Ireland. Specifically, the study
  states that lengthy and detailed stakeholder consultation processes carried out during the program design
  stage resulted in a rule that was more politically acceptable and nuanced than it would have been with-
  out this process. A key lesson from Ireland’s experience includes understanding main priorities across a
  wide spectrum of interest groups. In this case, the farming lobby was important. Furthermore, the carbon
  tax aligned with interest to put the climate and energy agenda at the center of Ireland’s economic revival,
  moving to a low-carbon economy and radically enhancing energy efficiency. An important rationale for the
  carbon tax was that it would stimulate new enterprises in renewables and energy efficiency and encourage
  innovation (Convery et al, 2013).
       Another important lesson (supported also by the experiences of Sweden and Chile) is that carbon taxes
  are easier to introduce as part of a broad fiscal reform.

26  –  The FASTER Principles for Successful Carbon Pricing
BOX 17:  Building Trust in Market Practices
EU ETS
One of the lessons learned from the initial phases of the EU ETS is that the absence of a single, transparent
trading registry contributed to a higher risk of potential market misconduct and abuse. Therefore, the EU
created a system-wide registry to replace individual national registries for all ETS account holders as well as
the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), which automatically checks, records and authorizes all transac-
tions that take place between accounts in the Union registry. This was supplemented by fixing the VAT rules
and improved market oversight. These verification steps helped to ensure that any transfer of allowances
from one account to another is consistent with EU ETS rules. (Source: http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/
registry/index_en.htm)

California’s ETS
The California Air Resources Board—the agency responsible for designing and implementing the state’s
ETS—utilizes another option to maintain a well-functioning market that is free of abuse. It conducts market
surveillance and analysis and uses an independent market monitor to examine ETS auctions and all holding
and trading of compliance instruments for the trading program. Activities in related markets are also tracked
and analyzed. These actions have contributed to a widespread acceptance of a carbon price.
