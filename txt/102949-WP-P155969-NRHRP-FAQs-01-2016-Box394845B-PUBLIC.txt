Frequently Asked Questions on
Rural Housing Reconstruction Grants
WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION GRANTS ?
Eligible households will be determined through the
Earthquake Household Damages and Characteristics
(EHDC) survey, which is taking place in the 14 most-
affected districts. Houses eligible for reconstruction grants:
i) are owner-occupied, ii) include one kitchen to one house,
and iii) do not include an annex structure/house. Experts
suggest that about 80% of the eligible beneficiaries will
fall under these criteria. The Project's Grievance Redress
Mechanism (GRM) will handle other complex cases (e.g.,
multiple households in a house, split families, resettlement,
land ownership issues, etc.).
WILL ALL ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE ?
The Project will fund as many eligible households as possible with the available funding (approximately
55,000 anticipated), while other donors and the Government of Nepal will cover the remaining eligible
households. Priority will be given to the most-affected areas and more vulnerable population.
How WILL THE ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLD BENEFICIARIES BE INFORMED ?
The Government of Nepal will publicly disclose the list of eligible household beneficiaries at the Project
relevant sites.
How WILL ELIGIBILITY RELATED GRIEVANCES BE ADDRESSED ?
The Project's Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will align with and support the mechanism proposed
in the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development's (MoFALD) Grievance Redress and Management
Procedure (GRMP), specified in document #2072.


﻿Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program
How MUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL EACH BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLD RECEIVE ?
The Project will follow the Government of Nepal policy and provide uniform assistance packages totaling
NPR 200,000 per beneficiary household.
IS THE ASSISTANCE PACKAGE INTENDED TO COVER THE FULL REPLACEMENT COST OF
THE DESTROYED HOUSING STRUCTURES ?
No. The assistance package was only calculated to cover the cost of constructing a housing unit with
earthquake resistant standards. Any additional reconstruction costs will be borne by the beneficiary
household. Any additional kind of construction (e.g., animal shelters, storage, etc.) will not be covered by
the assistance package.
How WILL THE PAYMENTS BE MADE ?
With the support of the Project, beneficiaries are responsible for opening an account at a qualified financial
institution of their choice prior to enrollment. The housing reconstruction grants will be released to the
accounts of enrolled beneficiaries in three tranches linked to pre-approved milestones:
1. Upon signing of the Participation Agreement (PA)
2. Upon completion of the lintel/wall (verified by Inspection Teams)
3. Upon completion of the roof (verified by Inspection Teams)
WHO WILL REBUILD THE HOUSING STRUCTURES ?
Beneficiary households will be responsible for rebuilding their housing structures to meet the inspection
criteria. The beneficiary household may choose to rebuild themselves and/or hire labor according
to their needs (e.g., masons, carpenters, etc.). The Project will provide training to local artisans, facilitate
building of material markets and disseminate information on earthquake-resilient construction techniques,
all in coordination with partner organizations to assist the reconstruction process.

Housing reconstruction and human settlements were identified in the PDNA as the largest
single need, accounting for almost half of the total reconstruction needs


﻿WILL THIS PROJECT REPLACE OTHER KIND OF ASSISTANCE ?
No. Beneficiary households will remain eligible to receive assistance unrelated to the reconstruction of
core housing units.
CAN BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS USE MATERIALS OF THEIR CHOICE ?
There is no restriction in the use of materials as long as it complies with the earthquake-resilient construction
techniques defined by the Project.
CAN BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS DESIGN THEIR OWN HOUSING STRUCTURES ?
The Project will prepare a selection of preapproved core housing unit designs for beneficiary households.
Beneficiaries are free to use their own designs, as long as it is in compliance with the Nepalese Building Code.
IS THERE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTIONS ?
Beneficiary households will have to obtain a building permit for new construction and will have to comply
with the Nepalese Building Code (NBC).
WILL BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ?
Mobile Teams will conduct regular site visits to provide assistance to beneficiary households.
Frequently Asked Questions


﻿ARE HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE ALREADY REBUILT OR REPAIRED THEIR HOUSE ELIGIBLE
FOR GRANTS ?
Yes, as long as the household complies with the
eligibility criteria at the moment of the survey.
Beneficiary households that have already rebuilt
or repaired their housing structurewill only receive
the housing reconstruction grant in lump sum
after being verified by Inspection Teams to ensure
compliance with earthquake resilient measures
defined by the Project and attaining the Building
Construction Completion Certificate from the
VDC Secretary. If the rebuilt or repaired housing
structure requires retrofitting or other structural
improvements to meet the requirements, it is
the responsibility of the beneficiary household
to implement the changes to receive the housing
reconstruction grant.
How MUCH TIME WILL BENEFICIARIES HAVE TO COMPLETE THE WORKS ?
Beneficiary households will have a maximum of 24 months to complete all project works.
