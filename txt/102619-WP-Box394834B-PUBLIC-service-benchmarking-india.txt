FOREWORD
India’s rapid economic growth in the last two decades has been accompanied by increased levels of
urbanisation. Our cities, which are engines of growth, are under great strain to meet the growing
demands and aspirations of their people.

Recognising the growing importance of improving efficiency in delivery of basic services in our cities, the
Government of India has launched a series of initiatives aimed at enabling urban local bodies to meet the
unprecedented challenges that they face today. These include schemes such as the Jawaharlal Nehru
National Urban Renewal Mission, Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium
Towns, Capacity Building for Urban Local Bodies, National Urban Transport Policy, National Urban
Sanitation Policy, National Mission Mode Project on E-governance and credit rating of select
municipal bodies.

As part of the ongoing endeavour to facilitate critical reforms in the urban sector, the Ministry of Urban
Development has now adopted National Benchmarks in four key sectors—Water Supply, Sewerage, Solid
Waste Management and Storm Water Drainage. Investments in urban infrastructure have, however, not
always resulted in corresponding improvements in levels of service delivery. There is, therefore, a need
for a shift in focus towards service delivery. This is especially the case in water supply and sanitation.
It is hoped that the Handbook of Service Delivery Benchmarking developed by the Ministry of Urban
Development through a consultative process shall provide a standardised framework for performance
monitoring in respect to water supply, sewerage, solid waste management services and storm water
drainage, and would enable State level agencies and local level service providers to initiate a process of
performance monitoring and evaluation against agreed targets, finally resulting in the achievement of
service level benchmarks identified in the Handbook.

The Ministry of Urban Development would facilitate the adoption of these benchmarks through its various
schemes and would also provide appropriate support to municipalities that move towards the adoption of
these benchmarks. I encourage all State and local level functionaries to use this Handbook in achieving
our shared goal of improved service delivery for our citizens.

PREFACE
The Ministry of Urban Development initiated an exercise to develop standardised service level benchmarks
with respect to basic municipal services in the year 2006. Subsequently, a core group comprising the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the Public Record of Operations and Finance (PROOF),
the Water and Sanitation Program–South Asia (WSP–SA) and Municipal Commissioners of Pune,
Bangalore, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Kolkata was constituted by the Ministry of Urban Development, which
developed a draft Handbook of Service Level Benchmarking that was circulated among all the States and
other key stakeholders. Based on the comments received, the draft was revised and a National Level
Workshop was held in July 2008 for the adoption of benchmarks with respect to basic municipal services
related to water supply, sewerage, solid waste management and storm water drainage.

This Handbook is a result of work done over a period of about two years and is designed to enable the
systematic and sustained monitoring of services using standardised indicators against agreed targets and
benchmarks. It will help effect performance improvements in the identified service sectors by (i) helping
local decision-makers identify gaps, plan and prioritise improvement measures; (ii) enabling the
identification and transfer of best practice; (iii) enhancing accountability to customers for service delivery
levels; (iv) providing a framework that can underlie contracts/agreements with service providers; and
(v) making it possible to link decision-making on financial allocations to service outcomes.

It is expected that State governments and cities would adopt this performance monitoring framework at
the Urban Local Body (ULB)/parastatal level, and undertake to regularly collate and analyse the
performance data to improve the quality of the decision-making process in the sectors identified in this
Handbook. Its adoption by all States shall facilitate uniform measurements and reporting systems, which
will be of immense help to the management of the service utilities in making the right comparisons aimed
at improving the efficiency of the infrastructure. It shall also be of great help in shifting the focus from
infrastructure to service delivery.

I would like to sincerely thank all the persons associated with this exercise, especially all the State
Government Secretaries of Urban Development, Municipal Commissioners, WSP–SA, CRISIL, PROOF             , ICAI
and Technical Cell (Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission [JNNURM]) in the preparation of
this Handbook. I am also grateful for the support received from the Secretary, Urban Development,
Dr. M. Ramachandran, who has been the driving force behind this exercise. I indeed hope that this
Handbook would mark a watershed in the urban sector.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
The minimum level acceptable standard for water supply service should be a household level water
supply connection, that is, a direct piped connection for water supply within the household. Water
provision to households (urban poor or otherwise), at common public standposts cannot be
considered as an acceptable/long-term permanent service provision standard. The social costs of not
having access to a piped water connection at the household level are significant. Innovative service
delivery options may be adopted for delivery of piped water connections to properties with
inappropriate tenure rights (as in many urban slums). It is therefore important to measure this
performance indicator, the benchmark value for which should be 100 percent.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
This frequently used performance indicator provides an overall indication of the adequacy of the
water supply to meet the needs of the citizens in the city. Per capita water supplied, expressed in lpcd,
indicates the adequacy of the municipal water supply system in being able to source, treat water to
potable standards and supply it into the distribution system. Therefore, this indicator should be
periodically measured and monitored. Monitoring this on a monthly basis will reveal seasonal
variations. The benchmark value for this indicator is 135 lpcd. However, the additional information in
respect of the areas where water is supplied at the rate of 70 lpcd should also be indicated. The key
limitation of this indicator is that it provides information on a city-wide basis, and does not reveal
intra-city variations.

                                  operation. The population served is calculated on the basis of past
                                  census figures, extrapolated to current levels. Reliable estimates of
                                  the floating population are not available.

Intermediate level (C)            The quantity of water produced is estimated on the basis of

                                  industrial consumption are periodically monitored. The population
                                  served is known with reasonable accuracy. Any expansion of
                                  municipal limits and other significant factors are measured and
                                  factored into the current population computation. The floating
                                  population is estimated with reasonable accuracy.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
While water is a basic need, the supply of potable water to citizens at their doorstep involves
significant costs in building, operating and maintaining a system to do so. In a water supply system,
the quantum of service provided to citizens is directly measurable, and therefore it is necessary that
all the water supplied to all categories of consumers should be metered. Metering will also induce
efficiency in use of water, reveal physical and administrative leakages in the system, and enable
high-end consumers to be charged for consuming more. Therefore, to introduce a volumetric-based
tariff structure for water charges, metering all connections is essential. It is, therefore, important to
monitor this indicator, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.

                                     Reliability of Measurement
Reliability scale                 Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   A few meters have been installed. All installed meters are assumed to
                                  be functional and used as the basis for billing water charges.

Intermediate level (C)            Meters are installed for only certain categories of consumers. It is
                                  assumed all consumers of these categories have meters installed
                                  which are functional and used as the basis for billing. Records
                                  do not reveal the exact number of connections which are metered.
                                  Water is charged on the basis of average readings for the consumer
                                  category or on the basis of past trends in most cases.

Intermediate level (B)            Databases/records reveal the list of consumers that have meters
                                  installed in their water connections. However, there are no clear data
                                  on functioning of meters, and no linkage with the billing system that
                                  may or may not use metered quantity as the basis for billing.

Highest/preferred                 Billing records and databases clearly identify consumers with meters
level of reliability (A)          (against specific meter serial number). Billing processes reveal regular
                                  reading of meters and meter readings are the basis for charging
                                  consumers. Records on standposts are available. Databases of water
                                  connections and meters are complete, and spatially referenced with a
                                  geographic information system (GIS) database. There is a mechanism
                                  in place to repair meters if found faulty. Processes for installation of
                                  new water connections, installation of meters and generation of water
                                  bills based on this are interlinked, and the data systems enable such
                                  continuity of data flow regarding these.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
The reduction in NRW to acceptable levels is vital for the financial sustainability of the water utility.
NRW can be reduced through appropriate technical and managerial actions, and therefore
monitoring NRW can trigger such corrective measures. The reduction of real losses can be used to
meet currently unsatisfied demand or to defer future capital expenditures to provide additional supply
capacity. The reduction of NRW is desirable not just from a financial standpoint, but also from the
economic and environmental benefits’ point of view. The benchmark value for NRW may be
considered at 20 percent, the levels achieved by most well-performing utilities in developed countries.
NRW is also influenced by factors outside the control of the water utility such as the topography of the
city, age of the network, length of the network per connection and water use per capita.

Lowest level of reliability (D)   The quantity of water produced is estimated on the basis of assumed
                                  pump capacity and efficiencies, and the number of hours of
                                  operation. A few meters have been installed in the distribution system
                                  and at the consumer end. The quantity of water sold to the category
                                  of consumers to whom bills are raised is estimated on the basis of
                                  assumed average consumption in that category and the number of
                                  consumers in that category.

Intermediate level (C)            The quantity of water produced is estimated on the basis of

                                  bulk production points. Meters are installed for a select category of
                                  consumers, such as commercial and bulk consumers. For other
                                  categories of consumers, such as domestic consumers, the number of
                                  such consumers and the average consumption per consumer are
                                  considered, to arrive at the quantum of water sold.

Intermediate level (B)            The quantity of water produced is computed on the basis of
                                  measurement at bulk flow meters at the outlet of the treatment plant
                                  and/or at all bulk production points. The quantum of water sold is
                                  based on the metered quantity for bulk and commercial consumers.
                                  For households, ferrule size (the size of the distribution pipe outlet at
                                  the consumer end) of each consumer connection as well as the hours
                                  of supply are known, to compute the quantum of water sold.

     Continuity of water supply       Hours      Continuity of supply is measured as the average number of
                                     per day     hours of pressurised water supply per day. Water pressure
                                                 should be equal to or more than a head of 7 metre (m) at the
                                                 ferrule point/meter point for the connection (7 m head

     supply per day                              DMA) should be measured continuously for a period of seven
                                                 days. The average of the seven days should be considered for
                                                 that month. Measurement should exclude hours of supply
                                                 where the pressure is less than the minimum standards for

                                      Rationale for the Indicator
Almost no Indian city has a continuous (24x7) water supply system, the norm for all cities in the
developed world. From a citizen’s perspective, it is desirable to have round-the-clock water supply
daily, as it eliminates the need to provide and manage household/establishment level storage, and
other resultant inconveniences. Water utilities in most Indian cities provide intermittent and limited
number of hours of supply, as a means to manage inadequate supply. A number of studies have
demonstrated the negative fallouts of designing and operating a system for intermittent water supply.
A number of cities are undertaking substantial investments to improve this service level. It is,
therefore, critical to monitor this indicator on a city-wide basis and move towards the benchmark
value of 24 hours.

     related complaints received        per month for testing in the month. Samples should be drawn
     per month                                    at both points—outlet of the treatment plant and at
                                                  the consumer end. The sampling regimen should
                                                  meet laid down standards and norms.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
The quality of water supplied is as important a performance indicator as other service delivery
indicators. Poor water quality can pose serious public health hazards. Water-borne diseases are quite
common in Indian cities, particularly among the urban poor. Although, in most cases, the source of
water that causes such diseases/epidemics is not the municipal piped water supply, it is very
important to monitor the supply. Therefore, this performance indicator must be regularly monitored,
the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.

resolve them. While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more
work needs to be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactory resolution of those
complaints on time. As water supply is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is
24 hours or the next working day. It is, therefore, important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark
value for this indicator will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the city, age of the
network, etc. The benchmark value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Financial sustainability is critical for all basic urban services. In services such as water supply, benefits
received by the consumers are more direct and can be quantified. Therefore, through a combination
of user charges, fees and taxes, all operating costs may be recovered. Therefore, this indicator is
critical for measuring overall cost recovery, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent. Cost
recovery objectives provide a basis for tariff fixation, enable setting targets for revenue mobilisation
and cost control in the delivery of water supply services.

Lowest level of reliability (D)   There is no segregation of budget heads related to water supply
                                  services and sanitation from the rest of the functions of the agency.
                                  A cash-based accounting system is practiced. There are no
                                  clear systems for reporting unpaid expenditure, or revenues that are
                                  due. Disclosures and reporting are not timely. Audits have a time lag
                                  and are not regular.

Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.

Intermediate level (B)            Budget heads related to water and sanitation are segregated. Key
                                  costs related to water and sanitation are identifiable, although
                                  complete segregation is not practiced (for example, electricity
                                  costs for water supply services are not segregated from overall
                                  electricity costs of the ULB). Key income and expenditure are
                                  recognised based on accrual principles. Disclosures are complete
                                  and are timely.

Highest/preferred level           In case of multi-function agencies such as municipal corporations, the
of reliability (A)                budget heads related to water and sanitation are clearly separated.
                                  Cost allocation standards for common costs are in place. An accrual-
                                  based double entry accounting system is practiced. Accounting
                                  standards are comparable to commercial accounting standards with
                                  clear guidelines for recognition of income and expenditure.
                                  Accounting and budgeting manuals are in place and are adhered to.
                                  Financial statements have full disclosure and are audited regularly
                                  and on time.

     the indicator

     a. Current revenues collected in      Rs crore Revenues collected for bills raised during the year.
     the given year                       per annum This should exclude collection of arrears as inclusion
                                                    of arrears will skew the performance reflected.
                                                    Collection efficiency is in fact an indicator of how
                                                    many arrears are being built up, and therefore only
                                                    current revenues should be considered.

     b. Total operating revenues billed    Rs crore The total quantum of revenues related to water
     during the given year                per annum supply services that is billed during the year. This
                                                    should include revenues from all sources related to
                                                    water such as taxes, charges, cess, surcharges, sale

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
For a water utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost
recovery objectives but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also
important that the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get
accumulated as arrears. It is, therefore, critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for
collection efficiency may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the
dues may be delayed to the next year.

Reliability scale                  Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   There is no segregation of arrears versus current year revenue
                                  collection. A cash basis of accounting is followed. The accounting
                                  code structure does not enable clear segregation of water revenues.

Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.

Intermediate level (B)            There is clear segregation of current year revenues collection versus
                                  arrears collection. However, revenue collection is not matched against
                                  the specific bill issued. Overall accrual principles of accounting are
                                  followed, and therefore deposits and advances are not included in
                                  income and expenditure, respectively.

Highest/preferred level of        Collection records are maintained for each billing cycle. Collections
reliability (A)                   are clearly identified against the specific bill which has been issued.
                                  Overall accrual principles of accounting are followed, and therefore
                                  deposits and advances are not included in income and expenditure,
                                  respectively. The accounting code structure also enables monitoring of
                                  billing and collections for each ward within the ULB.

Last mile access to toilets is key to improvement in service levels of sanitation facilities. In many Indian
cities, there is inadequate access to toilet facilities. Therefore, it is important to measure this
parameter. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent. Substantial investment in this area
is being taken up under the Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) component of JNNURM as well
as the Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) scheme.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Last mile access to sewage networks is key to improvement in service levels of sewage management.
In many Indian cities, sewage also flows through open drains/storm water drains, posing serious
public health hazards. Also, the coverage of sewage network services is very low across most Indian
cities. With substantial investments in this area being taken up in programmes such as JNNURM, it
would be important to monitor this indicator to observe the impact being made on the ground.
Therefore, it is important to measure this parameter. Its benchmark value is 100 percent.

                                  sewage connections taken (from the sewage department), and new
                                  properties being developed (from the building plan approval
                                  department). Field surveys throughout the city should be carried out at
                                  least once in five years.

                                                        linked to the quantum of water supplied through piped
                                                        systems, and other sources such as bore wells, when
                                                        they are very extensively used.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
While the performance indicator for coverage provides an idea of infrastructure available for access
to sewage networks, the effectiveness of the system in capturing the sewage may not be adequate.
Therefore, the performance indicator related to collection efficiency signifies the effectiveness of the
network in capturing and conveying it to the treatment plants. Thus, it is not just adequate to have an
effective network that collects sewage, but also one that treats the sewage at the end of the network.
The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.

                                  estimated on the basis of flow or treatment plant capacity. No
                                  estimates are available for water consumed from other sources.

Intermediate level (C)            Water production is based on ‘C’ category systems for measuring
                                  NRW. Sewage intake is estimated on the basis of flow or treatment
                                  plant capacity. No estimates are available for water consumed from
                                  other sources.

Intermediate level (B)            Water production is based on ‘B’ category systems for measuring
                                  NRW. Periodic measurement of wastewater collection is based on flow
                                  assessment methods at the STPs. There are no estimates for water
                                  consumed from other sources.

Highest/preferred level           Water production is based on ‘A’ category measurement systems for

                                  other sources. Measurement of wastewater collection occurs at all
                                  inlets of STPs by flow assessment methods. Process control automation
                                  provides accurate data, for both water production and distribution and
                                  for sewage intake and treatment.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Most Indian cities have inadequate capacity for treatment of sewage that is generated in their cities.
Significant investments are under way in creating such capacities through programmes such as
JNNURM. This indicator will highlight the adequacy of available and operational sewage treatment
capacity. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.

Reliability scale                  Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   Water consumption is based on ‘D’ category systems for measuring
                                  NRW. There is no estimate of wastewater treatment capacity that is
                                  actually functional and in operation, nor for water consumed from
                                  other sources.

Intermediate level (C)            Water consumption is based on ‘C’ category systems for NRW. There
                                  is no estimate of wastewater treatment capacity that is actually
                                  functional and in operation, nor for water consumed from
                                  other sources.

Intermediate level (B)            Water consumption is based on ‘B’ category systems for NRW. Sound
                                  engineering estimates of functional wastewater treatment capacity are
                                  available, on the basis of reliable operational data that are
                                  maintained. There are no estimates for water consumed from
                                  other sources.

Highest/preferred level of        Water consumption is based on ‘A’ category measurement systems for
reliability (A)                   NRW. Reliable estimates are available for the quantity of water
                                  consumed from non-municipal sources. STP system capacity is
                                  assessed through rigorous testing and commissioning procedures
                                  (after which there have been no modifications to the plant). In case
                                  any modifications to the STP have been carried out, system capacity is
                                  reassessed through measuring peak throughput.

                                    Rationale for the Indicator
For sustainable sewage management, it is not just enough to have the infrastructure to collect and
convey the sewage, or the installed capacity to treat it. It is important that the treated water that is
discharged back into water bodies, or used for other purposes such as irrigation, meets the laid
down environmental standards. It is therefore important to monitor this indicator. Its benchmark
value is 100 percent.

For sustainable water management, it is desirable that sewage is recycled or reused after
appropriate treatment. Effluent water can be directly reused in a number of areas such as used in
parks and gardens, supplied for irrigation purposes for farmland on the city periphery, etc. To
maximise this reuse, it is important that this indicator is measured and monitored. Its benchmark
could be 20 percent.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
It is important that in essential services such as sewage, the utility has effective systems to capture
customer complaints/grievances, escalate them internally for remedial action and resolve them.
While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more work needs to
be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactorily resolving those complaints on time. As
sewage treatment is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is 24 hours or the next
working day. It is therefore important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator
will depend on a number of factors such as the size of the city, age of the network, etc. The
benchmark value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Financial sustainability is a critical factor for all basic urban services. In services such as sewerage
management, some benefits are received directly by the consumers, and some benefits accrue
indirectly through a sustainable environment and public health benefits. Therefore, through a
combination of user charges, fees and taxes, all operating costs may be recovered. Therefore, the
indicator is critical for measuring overall cost recovery, the benchmark value for which is 100 percent.

                                  system is practiced. There are no clear systems for reporting unpaid
                                  expenditure. Disclosures and reporting are not timely. Audits have a
                                  time lag and are not regular.

Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.

Intermediate level (B)            Budget heads related to wastewater are segregated. Key costs related
                                  to wastewater are identifiable, although complete segregation is not
                                  practiced. Key income and expenditure are recognised, based on
                                  accrual principles. Disclosures are complete and on time.

Highest/preferred level           In case of multi-function agencies such as municipal corporations,

                                  Cost allocation standards for common costs are in place. An
                                  accrual-based double entry accounting system is practiced.
                                  Accounting standards comparable to commercial accounting

     a. Current revenues collected         Rs crore Revenues collected for bills raised during the year.
     in the given year                    per annum This should exclude collection of arrears as
                                                    inclusion of arrears will skew the performance
                                                    reflected. Collection efficiency is in fact an
                                                    indicator of how many arrears are being built up,
                                                    and therefore only current revenues should
                                                    be considered.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
For a utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost recovery
objectives, but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also important that
the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get accumulated as
arrears. It is therefore critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for collection efficiency
may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the dues may be
delayed to the next year.

Lowest level of reliability (D)   There is no segregation of arrears versus current year revenue
                                  collection. A cash basis of accounting is followed. The accounting
                                  code structure does not enable clear segregation of
                                  water revenues.

Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.

Intermediate level (B)            There is a clear segregation of current year revenues collection versus
                                  arrears collection. However, revenue collection is not matched against
                                  the specific bill issued. Overall accrual principles of accounting are
                                  followed, and therefore deposits and advances are not included in
                                  income and expenditure, respectively.

Highest/preferred level           Collection records are maintained for each billing cycle. Collections
of reliability (A)                are clearly identified against the specific bill which has been issued.
                                  Overall accrual principles of accounting are followed, and
                                  therefore deposits and advances are not included in income and
                                  expenditure, respectively. The accounting code structure also enables
                                  monitoring of billing and collections for each ward within the ULB.

This indicator provides the coverage of door-to-door solid waste collection services. Doorstep level
collection is an essential and critical starting point in the entire chain of scientific SWM services.
Waste-free clean roads and drains, scientific treatment of waste so as to maximise treatment,
recycling and disposal can all be achieved in a sustainable manner only if door-to-door collection of
waste is sustained. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.

                                  in the ULB.

Intermediate level (B)            Estimation of coverage is based on the average daily waste collected
                                  by the ULB (in tonnes) from areas serviced by doorstep waste
                                  collection, divided by the estimated daily waste generation (in
                                  tonnes) by the entire city. Daily averages are based on the actual
                                  weighing of the waste collected on designated weighbridges,
                                  measured daily for seven consecutive days in a month.

Highest/preferred level           Calculation is based on the actual number of households and
of reliability (A)                establishments with doorstep collection as stated by the agency
                                  involved in doorstep collection. This may be verified from
                                  records of user charges collected for the doorstep collection services.
                                  The total number of households/establishments should be measured
                                  from updated GIS spatial data of the city.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
This indicator is relatively easy to measure, and has been used for a long time as an indicator of
efficiency in collection of waste. While the indicator is well understood, the reliability varies
significantly on account of different methods used for measurement. Collection efficiency should
measure waste collected in the normal course by SWM systems. Typically, the uncollected waste tends
to gradually find its way into recycling, or is strewn along the roads, clogs the drains or in case of
bio-degradable waste, putrefies and degrades. Therefore, collection efficiency is a key performance
indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent.

                                          Performance Indicator

     Extent of segregation of waste          %      Percentage of waste from households and
                                                    establishments that is segregated. Segregation should
                                                    at least be at the level of separation of wet and dry
                                                    waste at the source, that is, at the household or
                                                    establishment level. Ideally, the separation should be
                                                    in the following categories: bio-degradable waste,
                                                    waste that is non-biodegradable, and hazardous
                                                    domestic waste such as batteries, etc. In line with this
                                                    description, the ULB may further refine the criteria for
                                                    classifying waste as being ‘segregated’.

                                                    It is important that waste segregated at the source is
                                                    not again mixed, but transported through the entire
                                                    chain in a segregated manner. It is therefore
                                                    important that this indicator is based on
                                                    measurement of waste arriving in a segregated
                                                    manner at the treatment/disposal site, rather than
                                                    being measured at the collection point.

                                                    locations in an unsegregated manner should not be
                                                    considered. Waste taken away by recyclers from
                                                    intermediate points should be added to

     b. Total quantum of waste that is     Tonnes   The total waste collected from households,
     collected by the ULB or authorised      per    establishments and common collection points. This

                                                    waste, and should exclude any special drives for
                                                    waste collection, and waste generated from one-off
                                                    activities such as demolitions, desilting canals, etc.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Segregation of waste is a critical requirement for sustainable SWM systems. Segregation enables
recycling, reuse, treatment and scientific disposal of the different components of waste. Segregation
of waste should ideally be at source, and should then also be transported in a segregated manner up
to the point of treatment and/or disposal. If waste is received at these points in a segregated manner,
it can be safely assumed that it has been segregated at source and transported so, while the converse
may not be true. Therefore, segregation is being measured at this point of receipt, rather than at the
point of collection. The benchmark value for this indicator is 100 percent. In cases where the ULB is
adopting an integrated approach with various options for waste treatment where segregation is also
taken care of, compliance with this provision may not be mandatory.

                                     Reliability of Measurement
Reliability scale                 Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   Segregation is estimated by the service provider without any
                                  documentation of measurement methods adopted.

Intermediate level (C)            All households and establishments provided two separate waste
                                  containers are assumed to be ‘segregating’ waste. Then the
                                  percentage of households provided with two bins is used as the
                                  basis for estimating the extent of segregation.

Intermediate level (B)            Estimates of segregation are based on the input from agencies
                                  engaged in doorstep collection. The aggregates of estimates across all
                                  areas should be added up for the ULB-wide estimate.

Highest/preferred level           The daily total of waste arriving in a segregated manner at disposal/
of reliability (A)                treatment sites should be measured, on the basis of weighing of
                                  individual trips. Waste taken away by recyclers from intermediate
                                  points should be added to this quantum, which can be assessed from
                                  wholesale waste recycling traders (kabadiwalas).

                                  Alternately, the quantum of unsegregated waste received at the
                                  disposal point, that is, the composting yard, landfill site, or dump site,
                                  should be measured through regular weighing on a weighbridge.
                                  The daily totals should be arrived at by adding weights of all trips.
                                  The difference between the quantum collected and this quantum
                                  (unsegregated waste) should be equal to the quantity that
                                  is segregated.

                                  A daily log of waste intake at processing facilities is maintained, which
                                  is aggregated for the monthly data.

     a. Amount of waste that is            Tonnes   The total quantum of waste intake by waste
     processed or recycled                   per    processing/recycling facilities operated by the ULB
                                           month    or operator at a city/ward/locality level. Inert

                                                    to the dumping sites/landfills, should be deducted
                                                    from the intake quantities.

                                                    Waste collected at intermediate points by informal
                                                    mechanisms (rag pickers, etc.) and fed back into
                                                    the recycling chain should be included in this
                                                    quantity. This can be assessed through data from
                                                    wholesale traders of such waste at the city level.
                                                    Typically, there would be a few wholesalers at the
                                                    city level from whom data can be collected.

     b. Total quantum of waste that is     Tonnes   The total waste collected from households,
     collected by the ULB or authorised      per    establishments and common collection points.
     service providers                     month    This should be based on actual weighing of the
                                                    collected waste. This should exclude any special
                                                    drives for waste collection, and waste generated
                                                    from one-off activities such as demolitions,

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Environmental sustainability demands that the maximum amount of waste should be either recycled,
reused or processed. While the processing, recycling and reuse should be carried out without creating
any health and environmental hazards, the total quantum of waste recovered is in itself a key
performance parameter. Therefore, measurement of this indicator is critical. The benchmark value for
this indicator will depend on the amount of inert matter included in the waste collected by the ULB.
Waste composition is typically unique for each city, while being within a broad range of values for
similar cities. The benchmark value for this indicator could be 80 percent.

                                     Reliability of Measurement
Reliability scale                 Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   Recovery estimates are based on the installed capacity of waste
                                  processing facilities.

Intermediate level (C)            Estimation of waste recovery is based on an aggregate mass balance.
                                  From the total estimated waste collection, deduct moisture loss
                                  and amount disposed at landfill/dump sites to arrive at the extent of
                                  waste recovered in the ULB.

Intermediate level (B)            Recovery estimates are based on measured consumption/inputs at the
                                  large, organised waste processing facilities, such as composting yards
                                  and waste-to-energy facilities.

Highest/preferred level of        Recovery estimates are based on measured consumption/inputs at the
reliability (A)                   large, organised waste processing facilities, such as composting yards
                                  and waste-to-energy facilities. To this quantum, unorganised sector
                                  waste intake for processing is added. This will typically include
                                  community/colony level composting facilities, waste collected for
                                  recycling and reuse through the chain of waste recyclers (aggregates
                                  measured at the wholesaler level). A daily log of waste intake at
                                  processing facilities is maintained, which is aggregated for the
                                  monthly data.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Inert waste should finally be disposed at landfill sites, which are designed, built, operated and
maintained according to standards laid down in prevailing laws and manuals of nodal agencies. This
includes collection and treatment of leachate at the landfill site. The extent of compliance should be
evaluated against the total quantum of waste that is disposed at landfills. This is a critical
performance parameter from an environmental sustainability perspective. The benchmark value for
this indicator is 100 percent.

Reliability scale                 Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   Poor data and records are available at landfill sites. There is no
                                  documentation of operations. Estimates are provided on the basis of
                                  estimated number of trips of trucks to the landfill site.

Intermediate level (C)            The quantity of waste being disposed at the landfill site is estimated on
                                  the basis of mass balance, that is, the total waste collected less
                                  moisture loss and waste recovered through recycling or processing.
                                  Actual measurements are not available.

Intermediate level (B)            Records are maintained and good quality data are available on the
                                  quantity of waste being disposed at the landfill/open dumping sites.
                                  However, there are no clear records on O&M of landfill operations.

Highest/preferred level           Accurate and detailed records on the amount of waste being disposed
of reliability (A)                at landfill sites are regularly collected, and records are maintained on

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
It is important that in essential services such as SWM, the utility has effective systems to capture
customer complaints/grievances, escalate them internally for remedial action and resolve them.
While many ULBs/utilities have put in place systems to capture complaints, much more work needs to
be done to put in place back-end systems for satisfactorily resolving those complaints on time. As
SWM is an essential service, the benchmark time for redressal is 24 hours or the next working day. It
is therefore important to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for this indicator will depend on
a number of factors such as the size of the city, manpower, institutional network, etc. The benchmark
value for this indicator may be set at 80 percent.

                                  or e-mail. However, systems do not exist for aggregating, sorting and
                                  tracking the complaints. Data available for some months have been
                                  used as a trend to report the figures for some other months.

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
Financial sustainability is a critical factor for all basic urban services. In services such as SWM, some
benefits are received directly by the consumers while some other benefits accrue indirectly through a
cleaner and sustainable environment, apart from public health benefits. Therefore, costs related to
SWM may be recovered through a combination of taxes and user charges. In case of SWM, there is
potential to supplement user charges with revenues that can be gained from recycling, reuse and
conversion of waste to either compost or fuel or directly to energy. Therefore, it is critical for
measuring overall cost recovery. There is enough past precedence to reveal that the benchmark value
for cost recovery may be set at 100 percent.

Reliability scale                 Description of method

Lowest level of reliability (D)   There is no segregation of budget heads related to solid waste from
                                  other functions such as street sweeping and drainage. A cash-based
                                  accounting system is practiced. Account codes are not entered
                                  function-wise, and it is difficult to estimate SWM-related
                                  establishment, administrative and O&M costs. Disclosures and
                                  reporting are not timely.

Intermediate level (C)            Not applicable.

Intermediate level (B)            Budget heads related to SWM are segregated. Key costs related to
                                  SWM are identifiable, although complete segregation is not practiced.
                                  Key income and expenditure are recognised based on accrual
                                  principles. Disclosures are complete and on time. Accounts are
                                  finalised and closed, although the audit may be pending.

Highest/preferred level           Budget heads related to SWM are clearly separated and cost

                                  based double entry accounting system is practiced. Accounting
                                  standards comparable to commercial accounting standards with clear
                                  guidelines for recognition of income and expenditure are followed.
                                  Accounting and budgeting manuals are in place and
                                  are adhered to. Financial statements have full disclosure and are

                                     Rationale for the Indicator
For a utility, it is not just enough to have an appropriate tariff structure that enables cost recovery
objectives, but also efficient collection of revenues that are due to the utility. It is also important that
the revenues are collected in the same financial year, without allowing for dues to get accumulated as
arrears. It is therefore critical to monitor this indicator. The benchmark value for collection efficiency
may be considered at 90 percent, since it is possible that about 10 percent of the dues may be
delayed to the next year.
