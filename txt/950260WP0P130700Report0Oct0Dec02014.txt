     “Accelerating Rural Women’s Access to Agricultural Markets and Trade”
                                             PROJECT BRIEF
1) The “Accelerating Rural Women’s Access to Agricultural Markets and Trade” project is a
   three year initiative, launched in July 2012 and funded from the Japan Social Development
   Fund (JSDF) through the World Bank, Kenya Country office. The project is being
   implemented by GROOTS Kenya Association.

2) The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to contribute to women’s economic
   empowerment and improve livelihoods through enhanced agricultural production and access
   to markets. The underlying rationale is to equip women with relevant knowledge and skills as
   well as enhance their leadership and organizational capabilities to enable them become
   drivers of their own social and economic transformation. The target beneficiaries are 3,400
   rural women in two vulnerable areas in Kenya, namely 2,700 in Nakuru County in the Rift
   Valley and 700 women in Kitui County, Eastern Kenya.

3) Nakuru County is located in the former Rift Valley Province and is an agriculturally-
   oriented area, with a large number of subsistence farmers, who are mainly comprised of
   Kalenjin, Kikuyu and Kisii ethnic communities. It is the fourth largest county in Kenya and
   divided into nine (9) sub-counties. The project is being implemented in three sub-counties,
   namely Molo, Kuresoi North and Kuresoi South (for ease of reference, the 3 areas shall be
   called Molo). Historical settlement patterns, in which non-indigenous ethnic communities
   settled and farmed in the area, made this region become a conflict hotspot. Over the years,
   periodic outbreaks of inter-ethnic violence have caused deaths. Displacement of large numbers
   of people has become a common occurrence in this region. The county is traditionally known
   to be one of the high yield agricultural regions in Kenya. Nonetheless, farmers in the region
   have claimed to now experience unpredictable rain patterns characterised by unusual long dry
   spells, torrential falls and hailstorms as well as severe attack of crop diseases.

4) Kitui County is in the former Eastern Province of Kenya. Kitui County is now divided into
   eight (8) administrative sub-counties but the project is implemented in three sub-counties, namely
   Kitui Central, Kitui Rural1 and Kitui West sub-counties (for ease of reference, the areas shall be
   called Kitui). The climate in Kitui is semi-arid. A large majority of the residents belong to the
   Kamba ethnic group and are native to the area.

5) The “Accelerating Rural Women’s Access to Agricultural Markets and Trade” project is
   being implemented by GROOTS Kenya using the value chain approach with a focus on
   three enterprises, namely horticulture, dairy and indigenous poultry. Specifically, in Molo the
   selected sectors are horticulture and dairy while in Kitui, they are horticulture and indigenous
   poultry farming.

6) The project has five major components, namely:

    a) To organize women farmers to work collectively in order to economically empower and
       improve their livelihood;
    b) To enhance women farmers’ lobbying and advocacy capacities for essential services and
       factors of production;
    c) To enhance women farmers’ business capacities and facilitate market linkages;
    d) To empower women to increase access to microfinance facilities to improve enterprise performance;
    e) Project management, monitoring and evaluation.

7) GROOTS Kenya (GK), which stands for Grassroots Organizations Operating Together in
   Sisterhood, is the implementing partner of this project. Founded in 1995, GROOTS Kenya is a
   network of community-based organizations and self-help groups that are women led. It was formed
   in response to the near absence of grassroots women in development processes and decision-
   making forums, which affect them and their communities. GROOTS Kenya’s theory of change is
   to shift the perception of the role played by grassroots women in rural and urban poor communities
   from vulnerable victimized recipients of goods and services to empowered and effective leaders
   mastering development mainly through movement building, leadership and advocacy.

A. PROJECT STATUS
8) This progress report is for the period October 2014 to December 2014. Annex 1 contains the
   updated project results matrix. Annex 2 is a selection of photographs of activities carried out
   during this period while Annex 3 and 4 contain activity reports and attendance lists
   respectively (due to the size of documents, annexes 2 to 4 are sent on a CD-ROM).

9) Increased men for women support in both Kitui and Molo as evidenced by the willingness of
   men to allow women to access and control production assets such as land. Women are
   increasingly involved in decision making at the household level as men now appreciate the
   increased yields and incomes resulting from their participation in project. In Kuresoi South
   for example, women are active participants in determining how much land will be used to
   grow animal fodder and the day to day management of the dairy animal. Additionally, upon
   issuance of BNF items, men have increasingly supported women through constructing
   improved poultry houses.

10) There is continued recognition of the different capacities of the women farmers by duty
    bearers and stakeholders. As such, women farmers are involved in processes within the
    Counties such as their participation in the World Food Day celebrations in Nakuru and Kitui
    Counties on the 16th October 2014. Their increased capacities has seen women leaders
    participate in international dialogues (UN Regional Sharefair 2014, between the 15th and 17th
    October at the UN Gigiri complex) to speak as the voice of rural women on issues affecting
    their agricultural production.

11) Women farmers, market champions and lead entrepreneurs have developed strategies to
    strengthen their collective marketing to ensure that profits are enjoyed by the producer as
    well as the marketer in appreciation of one another’s roles. They have also been actively
    engaged in obtaining markets for their agricultural produce following the training received in

“Accelerating Rural Women’s Access to Agricultural Markets and Trade”                                      Page 2
    the previous quarter. During this reporting period, market champions supported by the
    project conducted a total of 10 market visits. Positive feedback from the visits indicates that
    women farmers will have contracts for supply of agricultural produce in the next quarter.

12) Lead entrepreneurs have undergone individual coaching to strengthen their enterprise
    development plans. Gaps identified will be strengthened with training in the next quarter. The
    lead entrepreneurs will provide guidance for other women farmers interested in establishing
    enterprises, even after the project period.

13) Women have continued with savings in their groups and provide small loans to their group
    members to improve their agricultural production. Moreover, eleven (11) groups in Nakuru and
    Kitui have qualified for UWEZO funds and have undergone training on its use. This will
    further increase their access to finance and growth of their farm production.

14) The project team has rolled out the disbursement of the Basic Need Fund (BNF) in both
    Nakuru and Kitui Counties. The process is almost complete in Kitui and 594 women have
    received all items as requested in the individual BNF application form. The items were
    distributed on various dates between the 27th October and 2nd December 2014. Some of the
    items distributed in the poultry value chain include: construction materials for poultry houses
    (Iron sheet, doors, nails, roofing nails, chicken wire, drinkers and feeders), chicks, pullets and
    cocks. In the horticulture value chains, some of the items distributed include: Jembes (hoes),
    water tanks, horse pipes, seeds, spraying cans, wheel barrows and agrochemicals. Most
    women farmers have utilized the BNF items to harvest water and construct improved poultry
    houses. The project will finalize on the procurement of the BNF items in Kitui in the next
    quarter. In Nakuru County, the distribution of BNF items started on the 10th December 2014,
    and is ongoing; the initial distribution was for farm inputs to support the dairy value chain;
    construction materials for cow sheds (cement, iron sheets, posts, nails, troughs, wheelbarrows
    and many more). The remaining items are largely for the horticulture value chain; seeds and
    agrochemicals.

15) The women farmers have embraced the use of the project based Management Information
    System to document their progress and track their successes. The participatory monitoring
    has provided a suitable challenge for the individuals and groups as they can easily track their
    successes. However, there is need for a refresher training to strengthen their documentation .

B. KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS
16) This section highlights the main interventions and results achieved by the project per
    component during the period October 2014 to December 2014. The project progress made
    under each of the five components to date is recorded in the Project Results Matrix as Annex
    1.

17) Under Component 1 - Organize women farmers to work collectively in order to
    economically empower and improve their livelihood: Focus in this quarter was on
    strengthening the gender relations in agricultural production and access and control of

“Accelerating Rural Women’s Access to Agricultural Markets and Trade”                                    Page 3
    agricultural resources. Another key area of focus was on collective marketing of farmers’
    produce which necessitated among other activities, group governance strengthening workshops
    in Kitui (17th and 18th November) and Nakuru (24th and 25th November 2014).

18) Men workshops were held on the 2nd and 7th October 2014, in Kitui and Nakuru Counties
    respectively. The objective of the workshops was to assess the status of men for women
    support since the project inception, as well as the role of men in decision making with regard
    to access and control of project finances. These workshops provided a platform for women
    farmers and spouses, male relatives and leaders to engage in discussions on decision making
    and support in access to and use of finances obtained for project development. Testimonies
    were shared by men who had experienced transformation in their homes and especially in
    increased agricultural production urging other men to support women to not only access but
    also control production resources. The workshops drew a total of 83 participants from across
    the 6 sub-counties, 52 men and 31 women. Following the workshops, successful local to
    local dialogues were held in all the 20 locations whereby the same message was reinforced to
    larger audiences. The local dialogues were held on various days in the months of October and
    November 2014 reaching 500 men, 178 in Kitui and 322 men in Nakuru. The local dialogues
    were organized with the support of chiefs, village and church elders present at the men
    workshop.

19) Women farmers from Nakuru and Kitui Counties participated in the annual regional
    Sharefair organized by the UN Women Regional office for Eastern and Central Africa
    supported by other partners working in the agricultural sector at the international level. The
    Sharefair was held between the 15th and 17th of October 2014 at the UN Gigiri complex in
    Nairobi. The fair attracted 100 exhibitors from 14African countries with the objective to
    promote innovations and technologies adopted by rural women farmers. Eleven (11) women
    farmers were present at the fair, 4 from Nakuru, 4 from Kitui and 3 from other GROOTS
    Kenya regions. GROOTS Kenya exhibited climate smart and affordable technologies in use
    of zai pits and biocides.

20) On the 16th of October 2014, 62 women farmers in Nakuru (25 women farmers) and Kitui
    (37 women farmers) participated in the World Food Day celebrations in their respective
    counties as organized by the Ministry of Agriculture. In line with the theme of family
    farming, women farmers and their groups organized exhibits demonstrating the use of
    sustainable technologies in food production.

21) Women farmers from Nakuru and Kitui Counties, who participated in the exchange visit in
    the last quarter (10th - 13th September 2014), held feedback meetings at the group level to
    disseminate knowledge gathered to other members. Group members appreciated the various
    project achievements and challenged each other to apply knowledge gained to their farming
    activities for greater success. One of the farming technologies adopted from Kitui is serial
    and synchronised hatching to increase the number of bird flock.

22) Under Component 2 - To enhance women farmers’ lobbying and advocacy capacities for
    essential services and factors of production: Advocacy teams in the two Counties guided their
    communities to lobby and advocate for the implementation of promises and declarations made by
    duty bearers and stakeholders. They also paid courtesy calls to their leaders to discuss the status
    of road rehabilitation in Nakuru and water projects in Kitui County. Advocacy teams also held
    monthly feedback meetings at the group level to update members on progress of advocacy in
    their Sub County.

23) There has been an increased recognition and involvement of women leaders in decision
    making platforms in the County and the Ministry of Agriculture. This is evidenced by the
    involvement of women leaders in planning and participation in agricultural events such as the
    World Food Day celebrations and agricultural stakeholders meetings in their counties. In
    Kitui County, women leaders represent their groups in poultry and horticultural value chain
    platform meetings.

24) On 24th November 2014, a member of the Nakuru advocacy team had an audience with the
    Deputy Governor and the County Economics officer and discussed the provision of market
    space at the Wakulima (Farmers) market in Nakuru town for women farmers to sell their
    agricultural produce.

25) In recognition of the leadership capacity of the women farmers, the political leadership in
    Nakuru County selected one woman leader who is also a member of the advocacy team to
    facilitate at a conflict resolution workshop organized by the County government on the 24th
    and 25th November 2014 in Nakuru County. The workshop was held in Naivasha to discuss
    mechanisms to address arising issues on sharing of benefits accrued from geothermal power
    stations between the County government and the communities in Naivasha and Mahi Mahiu.

26) The advocacy team in Kitui West paid a courtesy call to their Member of Parliament to
    remind him of his promise to rehabilitate the Matinga dam in Kitui West Sub County on the
    4th October 2014.

27) In Kitui County, the County Governor invited four women leaders to participate in a
   stakeholders meeting on the 30th October 2014 to assess the progress of projects within the
   County. He lauded the work of the women leaders and GROOTS Kenya in transforming the
   livelihoods of the Kitui people and emphasized on the need to involve grassroots women in
   policy and decision making on issues affecting them. He assured those present that his
   government would actively work towards creating space for women to undertake leadership
   roles. The meeting was attended by the senator, 5 members of the County Assembly, women
   groups’ representatives and the wider community. The political leadership reiterated his
   remarks, promising to ensure grassroots women participation in leadership.

28) In November 2014, a new law on potato packaging in 50 Kg bags was enacted in Nakuru
    County. This is a result of concerted efforts of potatoes stakeholders, including women
    farmers involved in the project to reduce farmers’ exploitation by brokers. A similar law is to

    be adopted in other 11 potatoes producing counties to ensure its implementation, and that
    none of the counties lose out to those not enforcing the rule.

29) Under component 3 - Enhance women farmers’ business capacities and facilitate
    market linkages: Capacity strengthening was enhanced for lead entrepreneurs and market
    champions were supported to access markets for their produce. Collective marketing of
    produce was also emphasised to reduce transport costs incurred when produce is sold
    individually and increase profits based on their collective bargaining power.

30) Markets consultants organized market visits for market champions and lead entrepreneurs in
    the months of October and November 2014. The potential produce markets visited were in
    Nakuru and Nairobi for poultry, dairy and horticultural produce. Women farmers received
    positive feedback during the visits, after which the focus shifted to meeting produce
    requirements of said markets.

    Initial market visits were held on the 27th, 28th and 29th of October in Nakuru town. The
    markets visited were Jumuia Hotel, Happy Cow Limited, Gilanis Supermarkets and Jomo
    Kenyatta High School. The second market visits were on the 5th, 6th and 7th November at
    Zucchini, Boma Hotels, Deepa Industries, Keitt Exporters, Fresh & Juici and City park
    hawkers market.

31) A meeting was held on 17th October in Nairobi attended by 8 women leaders, 4 from Kitui
    and 4 from Nakuru to discuss the status of Inter-county trade. It has been challenging to
    provide opportunity to the women farmers to earn decent revenues from their products as
    compared to the gate level prices by the brokers and yet deliver the same products to the
    other county for sale at a profit . Main ongoing discussion are on how to operationalize the
    trade and what produce to trade from each of the counties with a view of trade benefits to
    women.

Enterprise development consultants carried out coaching for twenty (20) lead entrepreneurs
specific to their selected agribased enterprise (29th and 30th October in Nakuru and 18th and 19th
November in Kitui). The coaching was aimed at offering insight to the entrepreneur to develop
and grow a successful enterprise that would achieve their goals and solve a problem in their
community.

The coaching approach adopted was the GROW model which looks at the Goal of the
entrepreneur, their Reality that may affect their business and in turn provide the Opportunities
for growth of their enterprise. This is then followed by a decision on what they want to do. Gaps
to the development and growth of a successful enterprise were identified and recommendations
made specific to the entrepreneur on how to address them. Coaching was done at the existing or
proposed business point of the entrepreneur. The twenty entrepreneurs coached will mentor other
women farmers interested in establishing enterprises along the three value chains. The lead
entrepreneurs have since then identified potential markets, customers and business premises in
readiness to start their business.

The identified enterprises are:

32) On the 17th and 18th and 24th and 25th of November 2014, workshops were held in Kitui and
    Nakuru Counties respectively targeting 72 women farmers, group leaders, market champions
    and lead entrepreneurs to strengthen the leadership structure of the women farmers to
    enhance their collective marketing of produce. The workshops were necessitated by the
    challenges encountered in establishing a working leadership structure that would champion
    the process as well as a conflict resolution mechanism within the groups.

33) At the end of the workshop, women farmers had come up with strategies for collection and
    supply of farm produce and profit sharing to ensure all farmers gain from the business. The
    women farmers came up with teams for marketing of horticulture and dairy produce
    consisting of group leaders, market champions and lead entrepreneurs drawn from across the
    three sub counties. Each team was mandated with sourcing for markets and giving feedback
    to their groups before any market decisions are made. They also understood the roles of the
    farmer, market champion and lead entrepreneur in market identification and linkage with the
    groups for produce bulking and marketing.
    Conflict resolution mechanisms were established to address any matters arising in their
    business relations. The different teams were urged to be transparent in the dealings, any
    issues raised should first be addressed at the group level and if unresolved, it should be
    seconded to the sub county leadership. GK staff reminded them that they could approach the
    sub county seed fund committees, local administrators as well as the GK office in resolving
    these disputes.

34) Component 4 - Empower women to increase access to finance facilities to improve
    enterprise performance: The project team worked with the seed fund committees to
    disburse various basic need fund items as requested by the women farmers. Further, a field
    assessment visit organized for Equity Bank representatives was held on the 13th October
    2014 in Kitui County. The delegation comprised of Credit manager, Kitui and Agribusiness
    Officer, Nairobi. The visit was necessitated by the failed talks on the MOU with Cooperative
    Bank. Equity Bank was impressed with the level of work and commitment of women farmers
    in agricultural production and their savings and lending processes. They therefore agreed to
    partner with GROOTS Kenya in providing loans to women farmers in Kitui. The draft MoU
    was further discussed with experts from the International Finance Cooperation (IFC) at the
    World Bank office in Kenya on 2nd December 2014. The experts strongly recommended
    hiring a short-term financial consultant to support GROOTS Kenya in the final negotiations
    with Equity Bank. IFC supported GROOTS Kenya in preparing ToR for the potential

    consultant and recruitment began in earnest. Unfortunately, GROOTS Kenya had to put on
    hold the ongoing discussions with Equity Bank.

35) Following receipt Basic Need Fund (BNF) request forms, the GK project team held meetings
    with the respective Seed Fund Committees to review their applications. The meetings were
    held on the 2nd and 7th October 2014 in Kitui and Nakuru, respectively where the committees
    gave their input on items requested and clarified the suitability of selected items especially on
    the seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizers.
    This was followed by meeting with the women groups to rectify their requests with regard to
    their impact on the environment and their suitability for their regions. These meetings were
    held on the 8th and 9th of October 2014 in Nakuru and Kitui respectively.

36) Disbursement of BNF items started in Kitui with the distribution of water tanks for women
    farmers. The disbursement was carried out in the period between the 27th October and 2nd
    December 2014. In Nakuru County disbursement started on the 10th December 2014, with the
    remaining items to be disbursed in the next quarter. The items distributed in this period include
    cement, iron sheets, pipes, poultry equipment, nails, gutters, sprayers, bricks, troughs and
    wheel barrows among others. These items were disbursed to 1,127 women farmers, 534 in
    Nakuru and 593 in Kitui at the value of Ksh 8,309,940.60.

37) All groups (89) continue with the savings and lending by table banking. The average savings in
    Nakuru is at Ksh 100,000 with the highest group savings amount at Ksh 297,000 while in Kitui
    the average savings is at Ksh 40,000 and highest savings at Ksh 136,000. Women continue to
    access these funds for small loans to meet their production needs. The highest loan amount in
    table banking ranges from Ksh 9,000 to Ksh 25,000 to be repaid in 3 to 9 months based on an
    individual’s financial capacity. The loans have been used to purchase farm inputs, build
    poultry units and cow sheds, and increase poultry stock and to increase the land portion under
    farming. So far, no major challenges have been reported in repayment of the loans with group
    members adhering to group constitutions. Small loans of Ksh 3000 and below generally attract
    shorter repayment periods.

38) A total of 11 groups in Kitui and Nakuru Counties have been awarded UWEZO funds in this
    quarter. They have undergone training on the use and relevant accounting process of the funds.
    The groups will utilize the funds to grow their production and agribased enterprises.

39) Component 5 - Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation: A project status
    meeting was held between the GROOTS Kenya and The World Bank on the 6th October
    2014 where the project team gave their updates on project activities. A similar meeting was
    held at the Embassy of Japan on the 27th November 2014 at which point, the proposed field
    visit with Japan Embassy representatives was discussed and postponed to the next quarter in
    2015.

40) 45 tablets were issued to women farmers in Kitui and Nakuru (2nd and 7th October 2014) for
    use in documenting project progress in their groups. The tablets were received by the 90

    women drawn from the groups’ monitoring committees and who were trained in the previous
    quarter on the use of the project MIS. One tablet is shared by 2 to 3 groups in a location. Using
    the tablets, the group will submit information on individual enterprise performance, visual
    photo tracking and their monthly savings and lending to a web-based common database. The
    information will be analysed by GROOTS Kenya’s M&E officer to provide further evidence
    on the progress of the project and for the project management to make corrective measures
    where necessary.

41) Two (2) project staff and one grassroots woman travelled to Kampala, Uganda between the
    10th and 12th November 2014 for a 2 day interactive workshop on project monitoring and
    evaluation. This was a learning visit organized for the purpose of sharing experiences and
    best practices in project monitoring, documentation and reporting as well as capacity
    strengthening for GROOTS Kenya (GK) staff. The visit was organized in collaboration with
    Community Integrated Development Initiatives (CIDI) with the support of HORIZONT3000
    (Austrian Development Cooperation).


C. LESSONS LEARNED
42) Women have embrace ICT and are now able to document progress in their activities. The
    ability to track their progress and monitor the change has inspired them to work harder to
    improve their livelihoods.

43) Women farmers, market champions and lead entrepreneurs have demonstrated huge capacity
    in obtaining markets for their produce and getting good prices for them by collective
    marketing. Collective marketing still poses a challenge as a result of broker interference but
    in cases where it works like in Kitui women farmers and community members have received
    better prices for their poultry compared to those offered by brokers. It has also translated to
    the development of enterprises and more income at the household level as farmers now sell
    their birds at Ksh 450 from previous price of Ksh 250. It has however emerged that there is
    need for continuous consultations with women farmers to guide them towards collective
    marketing.

44) Increased men support in agricultural processes such as building cow sheds, poultry houses
    and participation in decision making at the household level has resulted from increased
    production levels of milk and crops from uptake of best farming technologies by women
    farmers.

45) The disbursement of BNF items has given a fresh energy to the groups and communities at large
    and community members are now more willing to walk with the women farmers to learn new
    farming practices to increase their produce and income.
