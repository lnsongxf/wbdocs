Air pollution, particularly from the dust generated by the power stations and ash dumps near the capital Prishtina, has been
a critical problem. Soil and groundwater contamination from the ash dumps create negative environmental impacts but
pose less of a direct threat to public health than the direct exposure to airborne dust. The use of outdated mining practices,
an industrial infrastructure that ignored environmental impacts, and a non -functioning environmental management system
are the main factors behind the high exposure to environmental health risks. The sizable overburden dumps from lignite
mining occupy large areas near the mines, sterilizing land for other productive uses, while the former gasification plant
consists of numerous structures containing hazardous chemicals in deteriorating and risky conditions. The project seeks to
(i) address the environmental legacy problems from the open dumping of ashes on land; (ii) enable the Kosovo Energy
Corporation (KEK) to free land for community development purposes currently taken by overburden material and to
remediate Kosovo A ash dump; and (iii) support KEK and the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) to
implement continued cleanup operations and environmental good practices in the mining and energy sector. The Additional
Financing will further scale up the existing cleanup and land reclamation activities, aiming at fully removing the hazardous
chemicals found on the gasification site of KEK, as well as financing a component with MESP to fund additional act ivities
associated with an environmental and social impact assessment for the proposed Kosovo Power Project.
Results achieved. The depleted mine has been prepared to receive the sanitary disposal of ashes from power plant Kosovo
A. The conversion of the current system of dry ash transportation to hydraulic transport has been functioning since
November 2013 and was officially inaugurated in March 2014. The p roject contributed €1 million to the system. Currently,
85 percent of the projected remediation of the ash dumps has been completed and more than 650 hectares are available for
community development in the overburden dumps, where more than 150,000 plants have been planted. The removal of
the highest priority hazardous substances from the storage tanks and other containments at the gasification site (tars,
benzene, phenols, methanol, oily compounds) has been implemented. 14,775 tons of Low Level Organic Content (LLOC)
liquids were locally treated and 5,109 tons of High Level Organic Content (HLOC) materials have been exported and
disposed to licensed disposal facilities. What remains are the additional materials recently discovered in an underground
tank and the export of big bags of solid tar. The Additional IDA Credit (AF) finances efforts to (i) rehabilitate the remaining
tip of the ash dump (where the dumping of fresh ash has just stopped); (ii) plant more seedlings in the southern overburden
dump, which has already taken place; and (iii) remove hazardous waste from the recently discovered underground tan k
filled with tar sludge and solvents and repackage, transport, and treat it in a licensed treatment facility abroad, and remove
the tar deposits that have been repackaged but not yet removed due to a lack of financing; works are currently ongoing.
KEK staff is now fully responsible for cleanup and land reclamation operations in the area of ash and overburden dump
rehabilitation, while the job of removing the hazardous waste has yet to be contracted. Regarding the activities under the
AF implemented by MESP, progress has been as follows: The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for
the proposed Kosovo Power Project started in January 2014 and public consultations on its findings are planned to be
organized by May, 2015. Resettlement monitoring efforts for the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Shala
neighborhood of Hade village, as implemented by MESP, have continued with the support of an internationally recognized
resettlement consultancy firm as part of this second Additional Financing. Th e resettlement process is still ongoing .

In Kosovo, the real estate property market is constrained by its legacy. As a result of the 1999 conflict, thousands of homes were
damaged or destroyed, up to 75,000 properties were abandoned, and land records were either destroyed or moved to Serbia,
where they remain. Many citizens lost access to their properties, ownership records are incomplete or unreliable, and vacated
properties were occupied illegally (about 20,000 claims on property that was illegally occupied as a result of the conflict are still
being processed by the Kosovo Property Agency). Real property is now owned privately, socially or by the state, or one of the
publicly owned enterprises, primarily public utilities that are also being privatized. In 2006, there were an estimated 600,0 00
buildings of all types, of which 250,000 were in rural areas. There are about 2 million land parcels and an estimated 350,000
property owners. Government institutions are weak; property rights transactions often go unregistered until there is a need f or
documentation of a procedure or loan, and then the registered owner may not be available.
The Project Development Objective is to help develop Kosovo’s land and property markets and to improve tenure security.
The project addresses a range of issues by: (i) supporting improvements in the capacity of the municipal cadastral offices (MCOs)
to deliver services by rehabilitating the MCOs and carrying out systematic registration in the Kosovo Cadastre Land Informati on
System (KCLIS); (ii) financing the establishment and maintenance of a Continuous Operating Reference Network (CORN) to
provide a single source of reference points to surveyors; (iii) supporting institutional reform by upgrading the legal and no rmative
framework and promoting the greater financial self-sufficiency of the Kosovo Cadastre Agency (KCA); and (iv) training KCA
and MCO managers and staff, the project coordination office, private surveyors, and other key stakeholders in management,
planning, legal, technical, and administrative subjects.
Results achieved and expected:
   The textual component of the Kosovo Cadastre Land Information System (KCLIS) has been installed in all offices and
        the graphical component is being rolled out.
   The Kosovo Positioning System (KOPOS), which receives satellite signals and provides data for GPS equipment, is
        operational and used by both private and public sector users.
   The third round of contracts for cadastre reconstruction (CR) work have been contracted and field work beg an towards
        the end of 2014.
   Mobile gender teams have been introduced into the CR process to ensure women are registered as owners.
   The legal analysis for KCA’s sustainability and institutional reform will be completed by June 2015.
   20 municipal cadastral offices have been reengineered and four remaining offices are in the process of rehabilitation.
   The National Spatial Data Infrastructure Strategy (NSDI) is under development.
   If the Bank receives a restructuring request, the project will be extended by 18 months to January 2017.
Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, MCOs, other municipal
structures, and the KCA. The Government of Norway continues to support the KCA and a new USAID project is providing
support for legal reforms and capacity building for land administration activities. GIZ provides support to key municipal cadastral
offices.

Background: A Financial Sector Fiduciary Assessment (FSFA) conducted in May 2006 highlighted the substantial
institutional weaknesses in the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK), which is responsible for the regulation and supervision
of banks and other financial institutions. These weaknesses pertained to its institutional and financial sustainability, the
banking and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), prudential regulation, the supervision and resolution framework,
and the financial sector infrastructure. The original project aimed at strengthening (i) the CBK’s institutional capacity and
the regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and non-banks; (ii) the microfinance industry to achieve sustainability
and expand outreach; and (iii) the capacity of the Kosovo Bankers Association to provide adequate training to local
banks.
Additional Financing: Following the work under the original project, further weaknesses were identified and an
additional finance project was approved by the Board of the World Bank to expand the mandate of the original project.
As a result, the original project (called Financial Sector Technical Assistance) was combined with the Additional Financin g
and renamed the FSSMIP. The Additional Financing became effective in February 2012 with the aim of further
strengthening the infrastructure of the financial sector.

The Project Development Objectives are to (i) enhance the stability and development of the financial sector; and (ii)
strengthen the financial sector’s underlying market infrastructure. The additional components are: (i) establishment of a
Real Time Gross Settlement System; (ii) establishment of a Business Continuity Center; and (iii) provision of seed funding
to the Deposit Insurance Fund of Kosovo (a first for a World Bank investment project).

Results achieved: The CBK’s institutional strength and sustainability has substantially improved due t o the preparation
of a development strategy based on market development trends and a review of the CBK’s funding options, including (i)
a functional assessment, and (ii) the development of a medium -term staffing plan and the revision of staff incentives.
The project has also supported CBK in (i) revising the banking sector legal and regulatory framework, and (ii) providing
assistance to the insurance sector with regard to third-party liability on preparing a legal framework and providing a
detailed functional, supervisory, and technical assessment of compulsory third-party liability tariff liberalization. In
addition, the project has supported the Banker’s Association and Microfinance Association in strengthening their capacity
as well as the capacity of the banking and microfinance industry as a whole. The largest component of the Additional
Financing—providing seed capital to the Deposit Insurance Fund of Kosovo (DIFK) in the amount of US$4 million —
has been fully disbursed and has successfully achieved its objective. DIFK is now fully operational. The project has
recently been extended to June 30, 2016, mainly due to procurement delays related to the Real Time Gross Settlement
System and the Business Continuity Center.


Key Partners: The Bank team works closely with the U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the
Government of Germany through KfW.

The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government of Kosovo in promoting competitiveness
and growth in the livestock and horticulture subsectors over the next decade through the implementation of
selected measures of its agricultural strategy and institutional development. To this end, the project is
supporting the following activities: (i) transferring knowledge to the rural sector; (ii) enhancing investments to
promote sustainable rural development; and (iii) improving project management, coordination, monitoring,
and evaluation.
Under Component 1, training is being provided to farmers, agro-processors, municipal advisors, and national
extension staff, as well private advisors to help farmers and agro-processors develop sound business plans for
investment support under the project. Under Component 2, the project is assisting in building the capacity of
the Managing Authority and Paying Agency to implement the national Agricultural and Rural Development
Program in line with EU requirements. The component also supports a Rural Development Grant Program
aimed at financing investments to enhance the growth and competitiveness of the livestock and horticulture
subsectors.

Key Expected Results:
  Increased number of farmers and agro-processors trained in the development of viable business plans
     for improving their operations
  Extension staff and municipal advisors trained in relevant agricultural production and processing
     techniques in the livestock and horticulture subsectors
  Increased number of farmers and enterprises applying for rural development grant support to improve
     their operations
  Increased number of farmers and enterprises adopting improved products and/or techniques
  Increased capacity of Managing Authority and Paying Agency to implement the Rural Development
     Grant Program in line with EU requirements
Key Partners: In addition to the Additional Financing being provided by the Government of Denmark, the

Despite the considerable progress achieved in recent years, Kosovo still needs to improve public financial
management and further utilize information technology to make efficient use of scarce public resources. The
capacity of the civil service to attract, motivate, and retain qualified staff is a pressing constraint on the
effectiveness of government institutions.
The Project Development Objective is to (i) strengthen the performance of key budget organizations in
budget formulation, budget execution, and public procurement; (ii) establish the foundations for fiscally
sustainable payroll management and effective human resource management in the core civil service; and (iii)
create conditions for the further automation of government work processes and for the development of e-
government applications.
Results Achieved:
   The National Data Center was inaugurated on February 17, 2014. This investment will be the
       cornerstone of the e-government services, enabling citizens and businesses to benefit from faster and
       cheaper online services.
   Improved budget planning, execution, and monitoring will support improvements in public financial
       management, especially at the budgetary institutions that the PSMP is supporting (i.e., the Ministries
       of Health, Education, Agriculture, and Justice).
   A transparent and coherent pay and grading structure has been introduced into the civil service,
       supported by improved information and communications technology (ICT) systems, which enables
       effective fiscal and management controls in payroll administration.
Key Partners: The project was prepared in close cooperation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(public financial management reform) and the Ministry of Public Administration (civil service reform, ICT
infrastructure), which will be the key institutions responsible for project implementation.

Key Development Partners include the UK Department for International Development (DFID), which
has contributed to some of the activities related to project preparation (e.g., support for drafting the civil
service legislation and financial impact assessment of civil service pay reform). DFID, the EC, and USAID
have also supported the development of the Public Financial Management Reform Action Plan and public
procurement reform.

Background: Currently, Kosovo’s electricity system cannot meet the demand that is needed to fuel the
country’s economic growth. According to the Doing Business 2014, the unreliable electricity supply is among the
top constraints to businesses in Kosovo. Frequent power cuts are a major obstacle to day-to-day operations and
a constraint to both investment in new equipment and business expansion, in turn affecting job and employment
creation and investments. Further, power production relies on two aging, unreliable lignite-fired power plants,
one of which is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2017. This, along with the unsustainable heating of buildings,
mostly from unmanaged, unregulated firewood and lignite-based electricity, is neither economically nor
environmentally sustainable. Energy efficiency and renewable energy can help mitigate these projected power
shortfalls, while enhancing Kosovo’s energy security and environmental sustainability. This is consistent with
the Government’s National Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action Plans (NEEAP, NREAP), which
call for a cumulative energy savings of 9 percent by 2018 and a 25 percent renewable energy target by 2020,
respectively. Such targets are in line with the European Union’s energy acquis communautaire, as committed under
the Energy Community Treaty, in the areas of climate change and environmental protection, which will require
strengthening the existing regulatory frameworks and institutional capacity in support of energy-efficiency and
renewable energy investments. Recent studies found a very high energy savings potential for public buildings—
38– 47 percent in municipal buildings and up to 49 percent in central government buildings. The moderate
potential for renewable energy also exists in biomass, wind, and small hydro.
The Project Development Objectives are to: (a) reduce energy consumption and fossil fuel use in public
buildings through energy-efficiency and renewable energy investments; and (b) enhance the policy and regulatory
environment for renewable energy and energy efficiency. In order to realize these objectives, three components
will be implemented: (i) energy-efficiency and renewable energy investments in public buildings; (ii) policy and
regulatory support for renewable energy and energy efficiency; and (iii) project implementation support.
Expected Results:
    lifetime energy savings from energy-efficiency investments in public buildings (GWh)
    increased capacity of approved renewable energy regulatory licenses (MW)
    reduced fossil fuel use for heating in public buildings (toe)

At 40 percent of total health spending, household out-of-pocket health expenditures are high and contribute to
increasing the poverty headcount—7 percent in 2011—primarily by pulling more households under the poverty line.
85 percent of household out-of-pocket spending on health is on pharmaceuticals. High household out-of-pocket
health spending in Kosovo is, at least partially, a consequence of limited public spending on health, which is
approximately half the Southeastern Europe and EU average. Kosovo has some of the worst health outcomes in
Europe, reflecting both limited public spending on health and the poor quality of care.
The project will support health sector reforms to address these concerns. The cornerstone of these Ministry of
Health– proposed reforms is a mandatory health insurance scheme to reduce catastrophic health spending, particularly
for the poor. The health insurance scheme is also expected to raise additional revenues for the health sector, therefore
creating opportunities to improve the quality of care, including in primary care, through performance-based
contracting.
The Project Development Objective is to contribute to improving financial protection from health spending for
the poor and the quality of care for priority maternal and child health and non-communicable disease services.
Expected Results:
 Improved financial protection and access to health services among the poor via enrollment in mandatory health
     insurance;
 A functioning outpatient drug benefit scheme to reduce out-of-pocket spending on drugs in private
     pharmacies, which account for 85 percent of all household out-of-pocket health spending; and
 The improved quality of primary care services through performance-based contracting between municipalities
     and the Ministry of Health/Health Insurance Fund.
Key Partners: The project was prepared in close cooperation with the Ministry of Health, which will be responsible
for project implementation in conjunction with the future Health Insurance Fund and participating municipalities.
Key Development Partners: The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and Luxemburg
Development Cooperation are key health sector partners. SDC Kosovo supported technical assistance and analysis
focused on the proposed health sector reforms, therefore facilitating rapid project preparation. An SDC-supported
hybrid Trust Fund for US$2 million was established in March 2015 to support complementary health sector reforms,
including to improve drug procurement systems and poverty-targeting mechanisms. Luxemburg Development
Cooperation is involved in information systems improvements and other reforms that complement the Kosovo
Health Project’s areas of focus.

The Project Development Objectives are: to enable the creation of a renewable energy (RE) market and support the development and
financing of RE initiatives in Western Balkan countries. Through the project, IFC aims to address the market barriers in these countries in
order to enable investments in RE projects by working on legislation with developers and through financial intermediaries.
This will be achieved through a programmatic staged approach to be carried out through the following objectives:
•     Objective 1: Regulatory Level: Improve the existing regulatory framework to enable RE sponsors to develop and construct feasible
      electricity generation capacities. Although the general focus will be at small hydropower plants (SHPPs), in Serbia and Kosovo it will
      be extended to wind and biomass, respectively.
•     Objective 2: Sector/Firm Level: Work with renewable energy sponsors to improve their designs and business plans, thus increasin g
      the bankability of their projects. The program will also merge experienced international companies with local developers.
•     Objective 3: Sector/Financial Institutions Level: Work with selected banks to improve their internal capacities and knowledge of project
      financing and renewable energy and assist them in launching sustainable and dedicated renewable energy credit lines.
Expected Results:
IFC BREP supported the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) on the preparation of the following documents that will contribute to the
improvement of the renewable energy regulatory framework: Standardized Contract Agreement (SCA), Standardized Power Purchase
Agreement (SPPA), recommendation for the rule of the support scheme, and recommendation for the rule of the Certificate of Origin.
IFC BREP has also developed feed-in tariff methodology for solar power plants and trained the Client’s staff to adopt the methodology
for future use.
In December 2014, ERO started with the adoption of proposed improvements. The first ERO’s step was to improve the R ulebook on
Supporting Scheme for Renewable Energy by adding one more technology in it. Namely, based on the software tool and the report prepared
by our team, ERO included subsidies for photo voltaic (PV) technology. Interestingly, ERO started receiving requests for PV plants and
planned quota (10MW) is already fulfilled with several requests.
Other documents drafted with our technical support (standardized power purchase agreement (PPA), standardized grid connectio n
agreement (GCA) and two rules that will support certification of guarantees of origin (GoO)) expected to be adopted in the first half of
2015.
Investments in the energy sector are one of the main priorities of the Government. Despite the limited RE potential, a number of RE
projects have been identified. The lack of investments in RE projects indicates the need to improve the investment climate in the RE secto r
and this is where BREP will contribute to its program objectives.
Several RE sponsors and developers in Kosovo have met to discuss the modalities of cooperation on project preparation, environmental
and social studies, and the cross-checking of existing designs.
Only a few banks in Kosovo are offering project financing and green credit lines, such as Procredit Bank and Raiffeisen, but these are not
focused on RE financing. This indicates a market need for technical assistance services to banks to work on the capacity building of the
banking sector in order to increase the lending volume for RE projects.
BREP organized the workshop “Support to Renewable Energy Sector in Kosovo,” presenting BREP products for supporting the banking
sector in Kosovo. The workshop attracted the interest of the local banks, and it is expected that BREP will cooperate those that are
interested.
The expected impacts of BREP in the region to be achieved one– two years post-completion are:
To facilitate at least US$200 million of investment in RE construction (out of which US$20 million to be provided by IFC); to support the
construction of RE power plants with total installed capacity of 150 MW; and to directly avoid 0.3 million tons of CO 2 per year.

The goal of the Kosovo Investment Climate Project is to improve the country’s investment climate for domestic and foreign
investors. The project will link, in a programmatic manner, business regulatory, investment policy, and industry-specific work in
agribusiness to maximize impact. It is a targeted intervention building on IFC strengths and addressing government priorities and
the needs of the private sector in Kosovo.
The objectives are to:
 Reduce the administrative burden on businesses and improve the competitiveness of the Kosovo economy
 Help increase investment levels and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, in particular in employment-intensive sectors
Expected Results:
Business Regulation activities are aimed at reducing administrative compliance costs for businesses, closing the implementation
gap, and improving the competitiveness of the Kosovo. Some of the achievements include:
 The projected supported the GoK to draft the Law on Permits and Licenses and the Better Regulation Strategy 2014 - 2020;
 At the central level, an e-registry of licenses, permits, approvals, and certifications has been compiled and is ready to be
     published. This will increase transparency of regulations. As the project continues, it will focus on recommending simplification
     of regulations in the area of agribusiness.
 At the local level, the project is working with the Municipalities of Gjilan, Ferizaj, Gjakova and Prishtina. In all municipalities
     recommendations have been provided for simplification of administrative procedures. The Municipality of Gjilan has already
     implemented some of the changes while the project is supporting the rest of the municipalities. E-registers of all administrative
     procedures will be published and will be open to the public;
 A training plan for the introduction of Regulatory Impact Assessment is already in place and will be implemented in the next
     year.
Investment Policy activities aim to provide a sharper focus on the country’s economy -wide investment policy reform and FDI
attraction efforts and address key bottlenecks to attracting more and higher-quality FDI. Some of the achievements include:
 The project supported the GoK to design the Investment Reform Map, a strategic approach to attracting FDI in Kosovo;
 Support was given to draft the Law on Foreign Investment which introduced changes in line with best practices and the team
     negotiating Bilateral Investment Treaties received a series of trainings to support its capacity building;
 An of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for investors was created thus contributing to increased transparency, improved
     governance in incentives administration, and the creation of a level playing field for investors;
 An Investor Perception Survey was completed and discussed with stakeholders;
 The procedures for work permits for foreign employees were simplified and guides were publish to illustrate the new procedure.
 The Kosovo Investment and Enterprise Support Agency was supported through capacity building activities especially focusing
     on creating an aftercare program for existing investors.

    The Project’s Objective has been to reduce the number of documents and days needed for goods to cross regional borders, through
    more streamlined export, import, and transit procedures; closer and more harmonized interagency cooperation in country and between
    countries; and the wider use of electronic systems for data exchange and risk-based controls and trade logistics – related payments.
    Faster border clearance procedures will enhance the competitiveness of the private sector in the region through more efficien t access
    to regional and global markets. To date, the project, operating in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro,
    and Serbia, has generated $7m in private sector savings. .
    Project Achievements:
    Transit Agreement: The Project provided technical assistance in support of the conclusion of a trade and transit facilitation agree-
    ment between the Governments of Kosovo and Albania in January 2014. It also helped Albania Customs upgrade its version of
    Asycuda World to Kosovo’s version for greater ease of co mmunication and data exchange. As a result of these simplifications, a
    significant reduction in the time needed to transit from one country to the other, from previously up to 2 days to one half h our, is
    expected.
    Customs Brokers Reform: Technical Assistance to Kosovo Customs in support of regulating the customs brokers profession in
    Kosovo. Legal review of draft instruction, comparison of the customs brokers systems in Kosovo, Albania, Slovenia; expert su pport
    during study visit to Slovenia customs; Roadmap for implementation of customs brokers training, licensing, and continuing educa-
    tion.
Risk Management Improvements: Workshop and hands-on training with the Kosovo Food and Veterinary Agency on the develop-
    ment of risk criteria and risk profiles to imported products for the application of risk based controls on import; review of, and rec-
    ommendations for improvement of, Kosovo Customs risk management and post clearance audit procedures
Improvement in Trading Across Borders rankings: Between 2012 and 2015, Kosovo achieved reductions in time to export (17-15),
    time to import (16-15), in the number of documents required to import (8-7), and in the cost to import and export (partial project
