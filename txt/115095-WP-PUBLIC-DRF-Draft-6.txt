For Government, a key challenge will be mobilising the nec-
essary capacity to implement recovery programmes alongside
regular development programmes in a complementary fashion.
The Disaster Core Team, which has been established within the
Ministry of Finance, will provide technical and logistical support
for the DRF Steering Committee and Working Groups, and pre-
pare monitoring reports. The Team will also continue to develop
the Recovery Programmes into a set of well targeted and easily
monitored set of activities.

Government has limited resources available from domestic
revenue but will devote a sizable portion of the new nation-
al budget, currently in preparation, to recovery programmes.
Many development partners are already financing parts of the
Recovery Programmes.

However, given the size of the financing needed for the re-
covery programmes over the next two years, Government will
be seeking additional financing from donors and development
partners.

In the immediate short term, Government will:

    stablish the DRF Steering Committee and Working Groups
•	 e
   ensuring a smooth transition from the work currently being
   carried out by the humanitarian clusters;
   continue to develop the Recovery Programmes and the
•	 
   monitoring framework, including measures to address bot-
   tlenecks;
   develop and implement a communication strategy to ensure
•	 
   that all stakeholders are kept well informed of progress.
