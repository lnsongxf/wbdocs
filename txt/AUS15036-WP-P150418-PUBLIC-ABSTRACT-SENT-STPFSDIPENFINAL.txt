Preface

The Government of São Tomé and Príncipe requested assistance in developing a coordinated,
prioritized and well-sequenced roadmap for developing its financial sector. Staff from the World
Bank Group’s Finance and Markets Global Practice, with resources provided by the FIRST
Initiative, visited São Tomé on four separate occasions from December 2014 to December 2015
to support work on a Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP). A preliminary
draft of the FSDIP was discussed with the Government and Central Bank (Banco Central do São
Tomé and Príncipe - BCSTP) on July 13, 2015 followed by a stakeholder workshop attended by
representatives of all relevant public and private institutions, as well as civil society groups. A
revised FSDIP was subsequently discussed with the Government and Central Bank during a
financial sector mission to São Tomé and Príncipe December 4-8, 2015.

The main objective of this report is to contribute to the development of São Tomé and Príncipe ’s
financial sector and provide its Government and private stakeholders with a clear roadmap for
reform in key policy areas, particularly regarding efforts to strengthening financial sector
soundness, enhance financial inclusion, and upgrade existing financial infrastructure. The report
includes a sequenced implementation plan designed to enable the authorities to implement
critical financial sector reforms and interventions, designed to foster a more efficient, sound and
inclusive financial sector in São Tomé and Príncipe based on a coherent policy framework.

At the request of Governor of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe, Maria do Carmo
Silveira, the support to the development of the FSDIP focuses primarily on measures to enhance
the legal and regulatory framework. Given the size of the domestic banking sector, the primary
focus of this implementation plan is on reforms to the banking system and financial
infrastructure. Non-bank financial institutions, such as insurance and pension, are noted but not
analyzed in detail as they make up a relatively small share of financial assets.

To prepare this document the task team met with the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, the
Governor and senior staff of the BCSTP, Minister of Economy, Minister of Justice, the national
pension fund, management at the commercial banks, insurance firms and micro enterprises, the
national chamber of commerce, representatives of microfinance, youth and professional
associations, and other development partners. The team is grateful for the excellent cooperation
received from all agencies and officials, the logistical support provided, and their time so
generously provided as part of this work.1

Executive Summary

The São Tomé and Príncipe: Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP): 2017-
2019 focuses on policy reforms and actions in three key areas: (i) strengthening financial sector
supervision, (ii) increasing financial inclusion, and (iii) upgrading financial infrastructure. A key
theme that emerges from the diagnostic work undertaken to prepare this document is the need
to update or establish legal and regulatory frameworks to better connect the financial sector to
the Government’s overall priority, which is to create and bolster the conditions essential for
growth, job creation, and poverty reduction in São Tomé and Príncipe.



a. General Financial Sector Context
São Tomé and Príncipe’s financial sector development is best understood within the context of
oil and the structure of its banking sector. The discovery of offshore oil in th e 2000’s resulted in
a massive influx of capital and new entrants into the banking sector. Between 2004 and 2008,
foreign direct investment increased from 3.3 to 41.7 percent of GDP, and the banking sector grew
rapidly (spurred on by liberalization) from one state-owned bank, Banco Internacional de São
Tomé e Príncipe (BISTP), which is now partially owned by banks from Portugal and Angola, to five
new banks, all of which are international subsidiaries.2 Despite these changes, BISTP remains
predominantly state-owned and market dominant with approximately two-thirds of total
deposits, half of total assets and the bank branch network, and over three-quarters of all foreign
currency deposits. BISTP’s continued dominance ultimately provides it with a distinct adv antage
in servicing clients requiring foreign currency for financing imports and has important
implications for market competitiveness.3

Unfortunately, the prospects of commercially viable oil have diminished in recent years, which
has resulted in a significant drop in FDI, and produced lower, but steady levels of lending and
economic growth. These factors, along with high interest spreads and a weak consumer
protection framework have also resulted in non-performing almost loans doubling in the last five
years. Due to these challenges and changing economic conditions, banking is largely not a
profitable enterprise in São Tomé and Príncipe with the exception of BISTP. With the banking
sector as a whole experiencing losses since 2012 and increasing asset deterioration, capital
adequacy (which is presently above Basel and the regulatory minimum in STP) may begin to
decrease in the near future. Yet, as the home markets of the parent banks are largely oil-

Rawlins, Financial Sector Specialist (FIRST).
2 As of 2016, there are seven banks.
3 Foreign currency deposits make up 40 percent of all deposits in the banking system.




                                                              6
economies, STP banks may not be able to recapitalize as these home markets are impacted by
low oil prices.



b. Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision
The financial sector in São Tomé and Príncipe has come under some stress from the array of
challenges that it faces. This stress is evident in Banco Central do São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP)
having placed three banks under its administration since 2010 for failure to meet the minimum
capital requirements.

BCSTP’s capacity to supervise the banking system has gradually improved, but it remains limited.
The authorities, recognizing the risks in the sector, have initiated an ambitious program of legal
and regulatory reforms related to their financial sector. In particular, they have instituted a new
Bank Resolution Law, which provides a framework for prompt corrective action and resolution of
distressed institutions that moves past the previous focus on administration and liquidation.

To further address existing challenges to financial sector stability and soundness, and to prepare
for eventual contingencies, the FSDIP recommends finalizing the reform efforts associated with
core financial sector legislation, increasing the frequency of and quality of supervision (both on-
and off-site), implementing an action plan to reduce the volume of non-performing loans
following completion of the asset quality review undertaken by BCSTP, and putting in place a
financial stability committee to monitor risks in the sector and coordinate decision making.



c. Increasing Financial Inclusion
Although 48 percent of people have a savings account, there remains a significant amount of
space to increase access to savings, and even more so for credit. In São Tomé and Príncipe, only
7 percent of micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) have a bank loan, less than 5
percent of adults are clients of consumer finance firms and 4.3 percent of adults have some form
of private insurance. Limited access to finance serves as a barrier to economic development and
poverty reduction. Access to finance is constrained by high-interest rate spreads, a lack of an
understanding of MSMEs financial needs and the absence of a bank branch in every district, agent
banking and mobile money services. Increasing access to finance also requires parallel efforts in
consumer protection. At present, the consumer protection framework only applies to banking
customers and not to consumer finance or microfinance organizations, there is no standardized
method of disclosure or framework to monitor over-indebtedness, and there is little interaction
between market conduct and prudential supervision.

To address these challenges in financial inclusion and consumer protection, the FSDIP advocates:
issuing guidelines on mobile money, permitting agent banking among financial institutions by
allowing banks to partner with local firms as banking agents, bringing microfinance institutions


                                                7
and consumer lenders under central bank supervision, implementing standards for transparency
of financial products and interest rates, and conducting an enterprise survey to better
understand MSMEs financing constraints.



d. Upgrading Financial Infrastructure
São Tomé and Príncipe’s financial infrastructure is insufficient to meet the needs of a growing
and increasingly dynamic economy. Existing payments systems do not currently allow connection
to international payments networks (e.g. Visa or MasterCard) and BCSTP maintains the only
connection to the international SWIFT network. BCSTP also maintains a credit registry of all
current bank loans, yet few lenders reference the credit registry for evaluating lending decisions
given the gaps in its information, such as historical data and low periodicity. Similarly, the legal
framework for the execution of collateral is outdated and does not adequately address
borrowers’ credit needs. There is also no centralized electronic registry for security interests in
movable or immovable property or specific law on secured transactions.

To improve the payment system, it is necessary to implement a fully interoperable card payment
system with international linkages, which the authorities have prioritized and will be supported
by multilateral partners. Credit information availability would increase if BCSTP would require
the registry to maintain historical data on borrowers and provide a more consolidated view of
borrowers’ credit history in the credit report. For collateral registries, the FSDIP recommends
implementing an electronic movable and immovable collateral registry anchored in a modern
secured transactions legal framework.



e. General Financial Sector
Lastly, but related to the preceding discussion of collateral, the diagnostic work identified
broader issues related to the judicial framework for resolving commercial and financial disputes
and the overall investment climate in São Tomé and Príncipe. The process for individuals and
firms to receive judicial review of these disputes, including the execution of guarantees and
registration of collateral, is unnecessarily long and burdensome. In line with the Government’s
Private Sector Development Strategy, it is necessary to train judges on commercial and financial
adjudication techniques as well as streamline judicial review of small claims. Ultimately, poor
contract enforcement reduces financial institutions willingness to lend and investors and
companies willingness to invest in the economy.

Another issue of critical importance is the high degree of informality in São Tomé and Príncipe’s
economy. While addressing informality is outside the scope of a FSDIP, there are nevertheless
numerous measures that can be taken to improve the quality of loan applications by MSMEs, as
they are the main drivers of employment and economic growth in many countries. Chief among
these is the need to develop stronger auditing and accounting techniques and standards in São


                                                 8
Tomé and Príncipe. In light of this, the FSDIP recommends establishing a professional
accountancy organization that supports accounting and financial statement preparation for
MSMEs. Establishing this organization would help create a more sound, stable, and inclusive
financial system and thus be an important step in achieving greater access to finance.

f. Structure of the FSDIP
The FSDIP is structured as follows: Section I contains an introduction with a description of the
country context, recent macroeconomic developments, and objectives of the FSDIP; Section II
focuses on the financial sector as a whole and assess its soundness and stability, performance,
liquidity, asset quality and loan classification regime, and the quality of banking supervision;
Section III provides an overview of the legal and regulatory reforms underway, the framework
for the execution of collateral guarantees, and court adjudication; Section IV provides an
assessment of the current state of financial inclusion and consumer protections; Section V proves
an assessment of existing financial infrastructure including the credit registry, framework for
secured lending, and payments systems; and Section VI concludes with the implementation
arrangements and M&E framework of the action plan contained in the first annex. To facilitate
the implementation of the FSDIP’s recommendations, the FSDIP action plan is structured around
three key strategic areas in the financial sector: Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision (A),
Increasing Financial Inclusion (B), and Upgrading Financial Infrastructure (C), while also including
a general strategic area (D). All recommendations are categorized by priority, a corresponding
timeframe, and implementation status, and highlight the relevant government agency and
donors, both actual and potential in nature. The table below summarizes the key
recommendations of the FSDIP, and its priority and timeframe.

I. Introduction

a. Country Context
1. Located approximately 350 kilometers off the western equatorial coast of Central Africa, São
Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is one of the smallest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with a primarily
Portuguese speaking population of 197,900. STP is comprised of two main islands and four islets,
which have a total landmass of 1,000 square kilometers.

2. With a per capita income of USD $1,811 in 2014, STP is a lower middle-income country that
performs higher than the sub-Saharan average in the United Nations Human Development Index.
It has also made important strides in key social indicators, including achieving near universal
primary school enrollment, a life expectancy of over 66 years, and an infant mortality rate of less
than five per 49 live births.

3. Despite these achievements, São Tomé and Príncipe faces a number of critical challenges.
Approximately 62 percent of its population lives in poverty, it has limited resources, its export
base consists primarily of a single commodity (cocoa) and a developing tourism industry, and it
is highly dependent on external support with 80 percent of its budget financed by development
partners.

4. Approximately 90 percent of agricultural exports are cocoa. As a result, the country is
vulnerable to international commodity price shocks and climate change. Lower prices not only
affect farmers, but they also negatively affect banks exposed to the cocoa sector. Furthermore,
the capacity to repay external debt is reduced by the decline in commodity prices as foreign
exchange reserves decrease.

5. The discovery of oil in the 2000’s resulted in an influx of capital and new entrants to the
banking sector. Foreign direct investment increased from 3.3 to 41.7 percent of GDP between
2004 and 2008, and the banking sector grew rapidly (spurred by liberalization in the sector) with
the number of markets participants going from 1 to 6 banks during that period. This influx of
capital also contributed to inflation, which increased from 13.3 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in
2008.

6. As the prospects of commercially viable oil diminished, FDI fell to about 8 percent in 2014. The
real GDP growth rate almost halved from 8.2 to 4.5 between 2008 and 2014 and private sector
credit to GDP fell from 40 percent in 2010 to 28.3 percent in 2014.




                                                12
b. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
7. The economy grew 4.5 percent in 2014 in line with the sub-Saharan African growth rate of 4.3
percent. Slow growth in advanced markets, particularly Europe, could further reduce demand for
exports and tourism, aid, and investment.

8. GDP growth averaged 5 percent between 2001 and 2014, keeping it above that of sub-Saharan
Africa (4.8 percent), small states in sub-Saharan Africa (4.3 percent), and small states (3.5
percent) averages. Since 2009, GDP growth has begun to slow down. Despite strong growth in
GDP and GDP per capita, two-thirds of the country’s population lives in poverty.

9. São Tomé and Príncipe’s economy is heavily dependent on services, which comprise 66
percent of GDP with the remainder comprised of agriculture (22 percent) and industry &
manufacturing (12 percent). In 2012, services accounted for 46.9 percent of employment, while
agriculture accounted for 26.1 percent and industry 21.4 percent of employed.4

10. Foreign direct investment to São Tomé and Príncipe averaged 13.5 percent of GDP from 2001
to 2013, but with wide oscillations year-to-year. Offshore oil discoveries drove FDI up to 41.7
percent of GDP in 2008, which fell to a low of 1.9 percent in 2013 as investment in the oil sector
receded. The FDI trend in sub-Saharan Africa, small states in sub-Saharan Africa, and small states
has been much more consistent than in STP. Inflation is historically high in STP, averaging 22.9
percent from 2007 to 2009. However, since pegging its currency to the Euro, inflation has been
falling year after year to reach the historical low of 4 percent in 2015. The Inflation differential
between STP and the Euro area has produced a real exchange rate appreciation. This, however,

has not significantly impacted STP’s external competitiveness due to its narrow export base
concentrated on commodities and niche markets.

11. Not only is São Tomé and Príncipe’s economy vulnerable to massive FDI inflows, outflows,
and fluctuations due to the prospects of oil, but it is also highly exposed to changes in global
commodity prices, particularly cocoa and oil. As noted above, STP’s export base is primarily
cocoa, meaning significant changes to the price of cocoa have large financial implications for the
country. In terms of the exposure to fluctuations in oil prices, the key issue is that the home
markets of the foreign banks that operate in STP and which partially own BISTP, are all oil-
economies. As a result, changes in the price of oil (see chart below) have large consequences for
net FDI flows. For example, when the price of oil crashed during the 2008 global recession (see
chart below), FDI plummeted. This exposure is particularly concerning considering that
commercial banks control 98 percent of the financial sector’s assets.

12. Remittances to São Tomé and Príncipe have increased significantly in recent years. In 2009,
remittances made up just over one percent of GDP and reached a high of 8.7 percent in 2013. As
a result, STP’s average remittances rate of 2.6 percent of GDP for th e period of 2001 to 2014
surpassed the sub-Saharan African average of 2.4 percent. In aggregate terms, Sao Tome and
Principe received USD $26.8 million in international remittances in 2014 equivalent to 8.1 percent
of GDP. While small in aggregate terms, as remittances grow and if properly harnessed, they have
the potential to increase financial inclusion by promoting stimulating demand for savings
accounts and to increase the resource base of firms, as is the case in countries such as Cape Verde
and Morocco.

13. Given these challenges, São Tomé and Príncipe’s Cabinet approved the second Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) in July 2012. The PRSP-II is the successor to the Government’s
previous development strategy, the PRSP-I, and furthers the country’s commitment to promoting
sustainable poverty reduction through broad-based growth. PRSP-II focuses on four key areas: 1)
promoting good governance and public sector reform, 2) supporting sustainable development
and extending basic social services, 3) enhancing human capital and social service delivery, and
4) strengthening social cohesion and social protection. PRSP-IIs efforts are continued in the
Government’s comprehensive reform agenda, called “2016-2018 National Strategy Document”
(NSD). NSD has the same four key objectives as PRSP-II.

14. Recognizing the challenges specific to financial sector development, the Government of São
Tomé and Príncipe requested assistance from the World Bank and FIRST Initiative in developing
a coordinated, prioritized and well-sequenced roadmap for developing its financial sector; which
is in line with the broader economic reform agenda discussed in PRSP-II. The FSDIP provides a
roadmap in key policy areas for financial sector development, particularly in the areas of
strengthening financial sector soundness, inclusion and infrastructure.

15. Developing an effective national financial system can be a challenge for small countries and
island nations due to an array of factors unique to their context, such as the size of the financial
sector. To overcome issues relating to the economies of scale and others, some countries choose


                                                       15
to create regional linkages, such as with currencies and national payment systems. Although,
integration is an important topic, it is not the focus at this early stage in São Tomé and Príncipe’s
financial sector development, but it will be an important one to review as the sector develops.
That said, it is important to explore the possibility of building upon regional or Lusophone
approaches to financial sector development, such as the compatibility and feasibility of adopting
effective laws and practices, so as to ensure best practices are informed by the local context and
lessons learned from other countries. Furthermore, given the extent of cooperation with
Lusophone countries like Brazil and Portugal, there is also a need to assess the potential for
further cooperation on implementing the FSDIP’s recommendations.



c. FSDIP Objectives
16. The overall objective of the FSDIP is to establish a framework for the development of São
Tomé and Príncipe’s financial sector and provide the Government and private sector
stakeholders with a clear roadmap to sequence reforms in financial policy. The expected
outcome is a more sound, efficient and inclusive financial sector achieved by a series of reforms
and interventions implemented by the Government and relevant financial sector authorities
based on a coherent policy view. The ultimate goal is to increase the contribution of the financial
sector to the reduction of poverty and promotion of shared prosperity in São Tomé and Príncipe.

17. Specifically, the vision for financial sector development in São Tomé and Príncipe is that of a
stable, competitive and inclusive financial system that provides access to affordable quality
financial services based on healthy competition among strong financial institutions capable of
providing diverse and appropriate services and products. A competitive financial sector increases
the provision of credit and lowers costs and an inclusive financial sector increases access to
finance for smaller enterprises and low-income households.

18. A stable, competitive, and inclusive financial system is an essential precondition to long-term
growth. A stable financial sector is necessary to promote long-term investor confidence, the free
flow of credit to the private sector and sustained FDI flows to finance long-term growth. A
competitive market ensures access to affordable and consumer-demanded financial services,
which are long-term in nature and can more easily adapt to innovations in the sector.
Furthermore, increasing access to credit is critical to ensuring that MSMEs have the requisite
resources to invest in their enterprises, without which growth will continue to be highly
susceptible to massive fluctuations in FDI and commodity prices.

19. The FSDIP is organized around four themes, which were discussed with the Government,
Central Bank, private sector stakeholders, and civil society and is documented in a series of
background notes prepared by the World Bank.5 The first theme supports a modern legal and

5At the request of Governor of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe, FSDIP focuses on measures to upgrade the legal and
regulatory framework related to the financial sector. Given the size of the domestic banking sector, the primary focus of this
implementation plan is on reforms to the banking system and financial infrastructure.



                                                             16
regulatory framework that establishes clear rules and boundaries for financial market
participants, including mechanisms for entry and exit. A modern legal and regulatory framework
contributes to the second theme: a sound and stable financial system supervised by capable and
competent authorities. This contributes to the third theme, which is a robust and efficient
financial infrastructure that reduces information asymmetries by providing timely and accurate
data on credit and collateral usage in order to allow for appropriate risk management and credit
allocation. Together these three themes contribute to the fourth theme of broadening the quality
and affordability of financial services available to individuals and enterprises, particularly MSMEs
and low-income households as outlined in the figure below.

II. Financial Sector Context

20. São Tomé and Príncipe is one of the smallest independent financial systems in the world.
Total banking sector assets were 4.7 trillion dobras (USD 214 million) in 2015 equivalent to 77
percent of GDP, up from 26 percent of GDP in 2001. The financial sector is comprised of seven
commercial banks with 98 percent of financial sector assets, two insurance firms that specialize
in property and casualty business and four small consumer lenders.

21. Following independence from Portugal in 1975 until 1993, only one bank, Banco Nacional de
São Tomé e Príncipe (BNSTP), operated in the country as an agency within a centrally directed
economy where the state owned or controlled most of the means of production. In 1993, the
Government divided BNSTP into the Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipe (BCSTP), responsible
for monetary and regulatory functions, and the BISTP, for commercial banking.

22. Government liberalization of the banking sector in the early 2000s led to three new market
entrants in 2004 and the potential for offshore oil attracted four additional banks from nearby
Angola, Cameron, and Gabon by 2008. Afriland Bank from Cameroon entered the market in 2003
followed by Banco Equador and National Investment Bank in 2004, Commercial Bank in 2005,
Ecobank in 2007, Oceanic Bank from Nigeria in 2008 (Energy Bank after 2011), Island Bank in
2010, and BGFI from Gabon in 2012.

23. The rapid expansion of the banking sector proved to be a challenge for the central bank,
which did not have in place the systems or staff to review requests for licensing and
authorizations of new banks as well as effective supervision of the industry. The central bank’s
decision to place three banks under administration within a decade of granting their license
underscores some of the weaknesses in the initial licensing and subsequent supervision.

24. Although, the number of banks operating in the system increased rapidly in a short period,
this did not result in a significant shift in market shares. The largest bank, BISTP, is market
dominant with approximately two-thirds of total deposits and half of total assets. BISTP also has
the largest branch network (half of total branches) and holds 70 percent of all foreign currency
deposits, which provides them with a distinct advantage in servicing clients requiring foreign
currency to finance imports.6 Together, these factors have important implications for market
competitiveness. BISTP is primarily owned by the Government (48 percent) followed by Caixa
Geral de Depósitos in Portugal (27 percent) and Banco Africano de Investimentos in Angola (25
percent). There are, however, discussions of the Government selling off its shares in BISTP. All
other banks are foreign owned (see: Summary of Banking System table below).


6   Foreign currency deposits make up 40 percent of all deposits in the banking system.

25. The sector began to consolidate in 2014 when Energy Bank assumed control of Island Bank
(both predominately owned by shareholders from Nigeria). Most market participants and
observers expect further consolidation or market exits over the coming years due to low oil
prices, the small size of the financial sector, and the financial position of some of the foreign
banks.

26. The sector is highly concentrated, which is typical of small financial systems and presents
certain unique challenges.7 The provision of financial services is often more expensive and more
limited in small financial systems compared to larger ones. Small financial systems lack
economies of scale. As many costs in the provision of financial services are essentially fixed, fewer
transactions and fewer customers make it more expensive for financial institutions to operate as
they face a number of costs including branch network, computer systems, and corporate
governance structures that are largely independent of the number of customer served. Similarly,
the costs of regulating and supervising a financial system and the cost of payments systems and
other financial infrastructure are also largely independent of the number of institutions that
make up the financial system. Moreover, it is often difficult for small financial system to diversify
risk, which can further constrain the size of the financial system in small markets and contribute
to financial stability risks (for additional discussion on this topic, see: Small Financial Systems
Annex).

27. Private sector credit to GDP in São Tomé and Príncipe fell from a peak of 40 percent in 2010
to 28.3 percent in 2014, paralleling a decline through Sub-Saharan Africa (58.3 to 51.7).
Conversely, from 2010-2014 private sector credit to GDP increased from 35.6 to 37.7 in small
states and 31.6 to 35.5 in SSA small states. From 2001 to 2014 private sector credit to GDP
averages 25.6 percent in São Tomé and Príncipe, 59.9 percent in SSA, 27.3 percent in SSA small
states, and 34.6 in small states (see: annex on Small Financial Systems). Relative to a sample of
peer countries, São Tomé e Príncipe has a high spread between its lending and deposit rates in
banks (13.3 percentage points) and more banks in its market.

28. The decrease in credit is due a confluence of factors that largely stem from the prospects of
commercially viable oil diminishing, which saw FDI decrease from a high of 41.7 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 8 percent in 2014. As a result, the economy began to slow, with real GDP growth rate
almost halving from 8.2 to 4.5 between 2008 and 2014. At the same time, NPLs have increased
from 15.6 in 2011 to 29.8 in 2015 and provisions as a percentage of NPLs increased from 77
percent in 2014 to 90 percent in 2015

is a 4.8 percent decrease from 2011 when gross credit was 1.8 trillion dobras (USD 80.8 million).8
At the same time, non-performing loans have increased by 68 percent from 278 billion dobras
(USD $12.6 million) in 2011 to 571 billion dobras (USD 26 million) in 2015.

30. Some of the key sectors that contribute the most to domestic GDP growth could potentially
benefit from additional loans. There is currently no demand-side survey on the banking sector,
so ascertaining the demand for existing and prospective financial products is difficult to assess.
Traditional sectors such as construction, with assets to pledge as collateral, receive more
domestic credit than sectors such as agriculture, which experiences seasonal credit demands and
operates on Government-owned land.

31. The market in Government securities commenced in January 2015 with a debut issuance of
USD 3 million. The six-month bonds, purchased by three banks, yield 6.2 percent equivalent to
100–250 basis points spread over interest paid on savings accounts. With this issuance, the
Government seeks to create an interbank market of tradable securities available to serve as
guarantees for short-term loans.

evidenced by the three banks that the central bank has placed under administration since 2010.

negative 27 percent), high non-performing loan rate (NPL: 29.8 percent) and a decline in capital

33. BCSTP placed the third largest lender (Banco Equador) under administration in January 2015
for repeatedly failing to meet minimum capital requirements.10 This is a more complex resolution
challenge than when BCSTP intervened in one of the smallest banks (Island Bank) in 2013 after it
failed to comply with supervisory requirements and arranged its sale to a competitor.11 BCSTP
also attempted to resolve another bank in 2010, but shareholders were able to successfully
contest the resolution actions in court and reverse the decision.

34. The experience in resolving these three banks led BCSTP to reassess its resolution powers
and authorities. BCSTP requested technical assistance from the IMF to draft a new Bank
Resolution Law, which Parliament is considering for approval. In addition, BCSTP has directed
three banks to raise their capital above the minimum required to operate by end-December 2015
(see: annex on Select Financial Soundness Indicators). These issues also highlight the importance
of conducting an annual financial stability report, which would include an analysis of over-
indebtedness.

35. São Tomé and Príncipe faces a challenge in developing and regulating a financial market that
can serve the broader financial services needs for the economy and maintain an international
standard for the breadth and robustness of regulation and supervision. BCSTP’s technical
expertise and productivity provide it the capacity to be an effective supervisor in certain areas by
international standards, e.g., the production of their internally developed credit registry. BCSTP
has also benefited from technical assistance from credible partners, notably the IMF, Bank of
Portugal and the Central Bank of Brazil. Nevertheless, on-site supervision of financial institutions
is infrequent and corrective actions and enforcement often occur with significant delays.

36. Structural issues limit the scope of financial sector development in São Tomé and
Príncipe. The size and advantage of the largest bank (handling government salary payments,
access to foreign exchange, and limit future credit to borrowers that do not repay) may be leading
to market practices that are inefficient and make the market unprofitable for smaller rivals. The
limited investment horizon leads entities like the national pension fund to make investments that
do not discriminate in terms of quality, time profile, or return requirements, which reduces the
pressure on market participants to perform.

37. Minimum capital requirements are 12 percent of risk-weighted assets, which is above
international standards and practice in many countries although in practice only three quarters
of banks have been able to achieve this standard since 2013 (see: annex on Select Financial
Soundness Indicators, 2011-2015). The average capital to risk-weight assets for the banking
sector is 24.1 percent in December 2015, but there is significant variability among banks.


10 Banco Equador held 12.5 percent of total deposits (the second largest share) at the time of intervention and its primary term
depositors are the national oil importation company and the national pension.
11 Island Bank held 1 percent of total deposits at the point of intervention.




                                                               22
b. Performance
38. The interest rate spread between what banks charge for loans and what they offer to
depositors is high relative to the Sub-Saharan average, small states in Sub-Saharan African and
small economies, but it is also decreasing (see figure below). The interest rate spread must also
be seen in light of the high NPL rate. The cost of intermediation in São Tomé and Príncipe has
improved, particularly since the Government pegged the currency to the Euro in 2010.
Nevertheless, interest rate spreads (12.5 percent in 2014) continue to be well in excess of
comparable country groups such as small Sub-Saharan Africa states (8.02 percent in 2014),
Caribbean small states (7.1 percent in 2014), and the average in sub-Saharan Africa (8.6 in 2012
percent). In terms of what customers actually pay in interest, banks charge 23 percent on loans.12
This limits the willingness of firms to finance growth and consumers attitudes towards financial
services.

39. Sector wide returns on assets and equity were negative 5.2 percent and negative 27.1 percent
respectively as of December 2015, which is worse than the average returns for 2011 to 2014
(ROA: negative 1.4 percent; ROE: negative 6.75 percent). This is due to the cost of increased
provisioning against non-performing assets as a number of banks entered the market in hopes of
oil discoveries that never materialized.13 Negative returns are also a result of the high cost of
funds for some of the smaller banks. In contrast to most banks in the market that are losing
money, the largest bank had a positive return on assets, which was high by international
standards.

13   NPLs have been high for years and ranged between 16 and 44 percent from 2006-2014 according to BCSTP.



                                                             23
40. Smaller banks generally are not profitable but the largest payday lender, Credial is profitable
(ROA: 0.7 percent; ROE 2.4 percent). Despite having a self-reported NPL rate of 35 percent,
Credial is able to generate a profit (albeit not a real rate or return considering inflation).14 This is
the result of having low operating costs, zero marginal cost of funds as its only lending its own
funds and interest rates, which are three to four times what banks charge. Interest rates charged
by the largest payday lender are 50 to 75 percent per year compared to 23 percent at banks. 15

41. Another indicator of the efficiency of the banking sector is its ability to transform savings into
loans (the loan to deposit ratio). In São Tomé and Príncipe, the overall trend has shown that while
deposits continue to increase, lending has fallen and the transformation ratio has subsequently
declined from 119.5 percent in 2011 to 68.3 percent in 2015. São Tomé and Príncipe’s
transformation ratio is characteristic of other small countries in Africa and around the world. The
trend, which is likely due to increases in non-performing assets and accumulated losses (i.e., NPL
rate of 24.9), a decline in private-sector credit, and economic growth slowing, continues to show
a decline reflecting the fall in investments in credit operations. At the same time, there has been
a rise in deposits, which also reinforces the importance of financial sector soundness. To that
end, the central bank is also exploring the feasibility and requirements for implementing a
deposit insurance scheme. Deposit insurance, which is an important feature of the overall
financial safety net, is uncommon in small financial systems, particularly those characterized by
a high degree of concentration.



c. Liquidity
42. Liquidity in the banking system is high due to slow credit growth, the increase in non-
performing assets, and the absence of liquidity management tools. This is evident in the liquid
assets to total assets ratio of 52 percent and the liquid assets to short term liabilities ratio of 73
percent in December 2015. Furthermore, the IMF estimates that excess liquidity in the financial
system is 24 percent of deposits or 5 percent of GDP. It is distributed asymmetrically among
banks, with the majority of liquidity concentrated in the largest bank, while two banks struggle
to meet the minimum required reserve levels. Excess liquidity has built up mainly from net
inflows and despite NPLs partially leveling off (but still relatively high from past years), banks
continued to decrease the amount they allocate to their credit portfolios. This has had the net
effect of increasing liquidity levels in banks as is evident in the liquid assets to total assets ratio
increasing from 20 to 52 percent between 2011 and 2015, and the liquid assets to short term
liabilities ratio increasing from 37 to 73 percent. Additionally, as highlighted in the previous
section the transformation ratio has decreased significantly, which contributes to the decreasing
loans to total liabilities ratio from 83 percent in 2011 to 46 percent in 2015. The persistence of
excess liquidity in the system indicates that it may have become a structural feature of the
banking sector. In addition, there only a few local investment options, as domestically issued

securities are limited and have only been available since January 2015 and excess reserves at the
central bank generate no interest.

43. The limited depth of the domestically issued securities market contributes to the challenge
of managing liquidity as well as cash management for the national pension fund and banks, which
are subject to a 30 percent reserve requirement. An important obstacle for the development of
long-term financing in Sao Tome is the absence of capital markets. While Sao Tome may not need
fully-fledged capital markets, having an established Government securities market is
nevertheless an important feature of its long-term development.

44. Development of a domestic debt market will also reduce the Government’s reliance on
external concessional financing, which currently contributes 80 percent of the budget. Moreover,
excess liquidity and the absence of viable investment options increases financial institution
demand for government securities. Domestic debt markets also perform an essential function,
such as a benchmarking prices and providing a risk-hedging instrument, which facilitates the
development of corporate bond markets, housing finance, and long-term finance. Government
securities are the foundation of most fixed-income markets in developed and developing
countries. Additionally, deep and liquid money and debt markets are important for monetary
stability and greater financial intermediation. Although, economic context implies the
development of a small and limited government bond market, nonetheless its development is
crucial to the reduction of the Government’s reliance on external concessional financing,
providing a risk-hedging instrument, and promoting the benchmarking of prices, monetary
stability and greater financial intermediation.

45. The Government is aware of the importance of developing the domestic debt market for both
public debt management and financial sector development purposes and has undertaken a
number of reforms in this area. Among those is the adoption of a Medium Term Debt Strategy
(MTDS), which covered the period until 2015 by the Cabinet following a new legislative
framework for debt operations and the publishing of debt data in budget documents. In July
2015, the Treasury issued the first T-bills, called Bilhetes do Tesouro (BT). The first bills were
intended to smooth Government consumption patterns and relieve cyclical revenue shortfalls.
The interest rate offered was 6.2 percent annually. The BTs represents an opportunity for the
central bank to influence the market interest rate, since currently the benchmark interest rate
set by the BCSTP has served more as an indicative price rather than the primary cost of money.
However, to fully benefit from these reforms much additional work remains to be done,
particularly efforts to improve debt reporting and monitoring, T-Bill auction and pricing
mechanisms, and regularly updating and implementing the debt management strategy.



d. Asset Quality and Loan Classification
46. NPLs system-wide increased to 29.8 percent in December 2015 from 19.1 percent in 2014.
The NPL rate has doubled since 2011, but put in a historical context is still better than the low



                                               25
point in 2006 when 44 percent of loans were non-performing. However, the current NPL rate is
above international standards for financial sector soundness and a significant source of concern,
particularly given the weakness in collateral execution and court adjudication, discussed in detail
below. Provisions as a percentage of NPLs increased to 90.4 percent in 2015 down from 105
percent in 2011. As banks are not profitable, many will likely see their capital erode from negative
earnings and provisioning costs.

47. NPLs also vary significantly by sector (see figure below). As of October 2015, the sector with
the largest share of NPLs is commerce with 44.5 percent of all NPLs. The increase in commerce
NPLs is significant, but also concerning in light of 2010 commerce NPLs were just 3.9 percent of
all NPLs. Between 2010 and 2015, consumption’s share of NPLs rose from 21.1 to 35.2 percent.
At the same time, industry’s shares of NPLs have decreased, while construction and services have
risen moderately. The increase in NPLs by sector is reflected in the aggregate format (see figure
below).

48. The current arrangements for gathering data on the status of the banking system appears to
be well established as the data gathered by the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) at the
central bank is comprehensive and timely. However, it is less clear that the BSD is taking full
advantage of the information contained in the reports in its discussions with commercial banks.
For example, a key area in which data collection and analysis could be expanded to inform policy
is through an asset quality review of banks. Such data usage may be particularly relevant in
BCSTP’s efforts to be more effective in its supervision of the banking sector. BCSTP faces
constraints in its scope for implementing actions for the resolution of problem banks, so it is
advisable that advisory actions be undertaken at an earlier stage and that BCSTP also takes
advantage of all available information so as to be fully informed about the possible emergence
of future issues.

49. In particular, it is noteworthy that the largest bank held provisions across all categories in
excess of regulatory requirements. It is important that BSD understands the rationale for this


                                                           26
approach (whether driven strictly by banking operations, or other considerations). It would be
helpful if BSD could have detailed discussions with banks on the trajectory of their loan portfolio
quality to identify factors that would affect the banking system overall. As the loan portfolio
dynamic continues to be negative (and the overall volume of lending is decreasing), it would still
be useful to have this understanding. It is also important to note that if loan portfolios do not
increase, the NPL rate will naturally rise.

50. According to a survey of banks, the average NPL rate for loans varies depending on its
collateralization. Unsecured loans have a higher average NPL rate than loans secured by movable
property and those secured with immovable assets such as real estate.16 Many of the foreign
banks operating in São Tomé and Príncipe principally lend outside the country, which is likely due
to the banks being primarily foreign-owned with connections abroad and possibly due to an
increasing NPL rate within STP. At the same time, lending outside of the country is not a
significant factor in constraining access to finance, as the banking sector is currently faced with
excess liquidity from a reluctance to lend in an environment with an increasing NPL rate and
economic growth slowing.

e. Banking Supervision
51. The capacity of BCSTP to supervise the banking system has gradually improved, but remains
limited. With technical assistance from development partners, such as the IMF, Bank of Portugal,
and Central Bank of Brazil, BCSTP has developed its professional competency as a regulator; such
as, the development of their internally developed credit registry. While capacity has improved,
on-site inspections remain inconsistent and infrequent and corrective enforcement actions merit
improvement. To address this shortcoming, BCSTP is undertaking efforts to improve its
supervisory and regulatory oversight capacity of the financial sector by adding staff and

16NPL figures are from early 2015 and do not include all banks. As such, due to timing and cohort differences in the overall NPL
information between these figures varies. What is instructive about the survey data is that better secured loans have lower NPL
rates.



                                                              28
increasing the rate of both off- and on-site inspections. Conducting a detailed assessment of
banks compliance with Basel Core Principles would also enable BCSTP to enhance its supervisory
capacity. At present, there is no prompt corrective action framework requiring supervisory action
or automatic triggers associated with capital, liquidity, and asset impairment indicators.

52. The legal framework for the resolution of distressed institutions only contemplates
liquidation and does not provide adequate legal protection for supervisors. The resolution
method most commonly employed by the BCSTP has been the appointment of an individual or
team to replace management and try to turn around a bank in an effort to restore the financial
position and minimize losses for depositors and other creditors. This is typically a drawn-out
process as evidenced by one bank, placed under curatorship in January 2015 and not resolved by
December 2015. In addition, resolution processes are subject to legal challenges by owners (and
other parties), which puts a stay in the process until these are resolved, often years later. As a
result, the value of assets in banks under curatorship tend to deteriorate further and creditors,
primarily depositors, face the risk of significant losses. Moreover, the current legal framework
does not provide adequate legal protection for resolution authorities. BCSTP is undertaking a
review of its laws related to crisis planning and legal instruments for the resolution of distressed
financial institutions with technical assistance from the IMF and has presented a draft resolution
law to Parliament. This review should also include assessing the prospects of new guidelines on
resolution methods, such as the establishment of a workout approach and bank workout
departments, revised write-off procedures and timeframe for writing off back logged NPLs.

53. Many of the FSDIP’s recommendations aim to address the issue of high NPLs in São Tomé and
Príncipe (see figure below). By strengthening financial sector supervision, increasing financial
inclusion, and upgrading financial infrastructure, the FSDIP’s multi-dimensional approach to
financial sector development provides a comprehensive approach to address many of the factors
that contribute to a high NPL rate. Ultimately, by strengthening financial stability, the FSDIP will
contribute to more resilient economic growth, which is a key contributor to loan repayment
rates.

III. Legal and Regulatory Framework

54. The Government has made significant progress reforming the financial sector’s legal and
regulatory framework. The Government has submitted to Parliament new laws on: (i) bank
resolution (developed with IMF support); (ii) microfinance; and (iii) the central bank organic law.
In addition, the BCSTP has enacted new microcredit regulation and is in the processes of drafting
a new Financial Institutions Law with World Bank Group support. The UNDP is also supporting
judicial reforms and may include training for judges on commercial and financial issues.17

55. Two laws regulate the financial sector: (i) the Financial Institutions Law (FIL) and; (ii) the
Central Bank Law (CBL) both passed in 1992. FIL covers various entities including: a) special credit
institutions, b) commercial banks, c) investment banks, d) financial companies, e) credit
cooperatives, f) companies for real estate credit, and g) any other credit institution the Central
Bank decides to regulate as providing financial services. Despite this long list of institutions, their
respective activities are not fully articulated and the general provisions contained in the FIL only
cover very basic issues such as the constitution and administration of a financial institution.
Operational rules and obligations for BCSTP to oversee the banking and payment system are only
covered to a limited extent in the existing FIL.

56. BCSTP is revising the Financial Institutions Law to reflect the economic, financial, and
technological changes in the country. The original law, from 1992, was drafted with banks and
insurance companies in mind and without consideration for other financial institutions like
investment banks, brokerages, savings and loans, credit unions, and asset management
companies. The new law, currently in a preliminary draft stage, is intended to provide a thorough
review of instruments, tools and operating mechanisms for the full range of financial institutions
found in other countries. The key characteristics of the draft FIL are: a) clear distinction between
credit institutions, financial companies and insurance companies; b) expansion of economic and
financial concepts; c) restructuring of permitted organizational structures; and d) provision for
more types of companies, thereby increasing the range of options available for investors. With
these changes, BCSTP will be responsible for licensing all financial institution and supervision of
the financial system, as a whole.

57. As discussed above, very few and incomplete provisions are devoted to the right of the BCSTP
to intervene in case of risk of insolvency by a financial institution. For example, according to the
FIL, BCSTP must submit a request to the Court to declare the bankruptcy of a bank and suggest
the receiver to be appointed. At present, there is no specific law that regulates the liquidation of
a bank. The CBL lists the competences of BCSTP as monetary policy, foreign exchange, and
supervision of the financial sector. However, these are not further articulated. Moreover, the CBL

17   Additional analysis of the legal and regulatory environment is included in Annex IX.



                                                                  31
does not recognize the independence of the BCSTP from the Government and contains no
provisions to safeguard its autonomy.

a. Legal Reforms in Process and Needed
58. The current Central Bank Law does not recognize the independence of BCSTP from the
Government and contains limited provisions to safeguard its autonomy.

59. Government intends to upgrade the existing regulatory framework in order to strengthen the
surveillance of the sector and ability to resolve distressed institutions. BCSTP, with technical
assistance from the IMF, submitted a new draft CBL to Parliament, which would strengthen the
autonomy of the central bank in line with international standards. The new law would also
provide the BCSTP with the authority and instruments necessary to monitor financial markets
and act as needed, as well as better articulate its competencies and tools, including in case of the
default of financial institutions. There are currently ten draft laws or regulations related to the
financial sector that have been prepared and are at different stages of approval.

60. Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework in the financial sector is necessary to better
define the scope of activities for different financial institutions and to regulate those that are
currently unregulated (i.e., microfinance/financial cooperatives and pensions). BCSTP has already
elaborated a preliminary draft of the FIL and is working on a number of other draft laws and
regulations. The Central Bank will also soon start a full revision of existing Normas de Aplicação
Permanente (NAPs). In particular, in addition to a new draft of the FIL (see below), BCSTP is
working on a separate law on microfinance, as well as on draft regulations on microcredit,
pension funds, pension funds for BCSTP staff, and the establishment of a Commission for Pension
Funds for BCSTP staff.

61. The draft FIL is more in line with international best practice and covers main areas of concern;
however, there are still a number of inconsistencies in the draft legislation. The draft of the FIL



                                                     32
contains more detail provisions for the regulation of individual institutions than the law currently
in force. It separates financial institutions into three categories, i.e., institutions that provide
credit, other non-credit financial institutions, and insurance companies, and lists permitted
activities by type of institution. It then regulates the procedures for authorization, ownership and
conflict of interests, administration and behavioral duties, prudential and supervision
requirements, and procedures for reorganization. Insolvency procedures are contained in the
draft Bank Resolution Law.

62. The draft Microfinance Law is still at a very early stage and its adoption could help promote
financial inclusion. It covers micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance and other forms of
financial intermediation. The draft FIL includes microcredit companies within the category of
credit institutions but does not discuss other micro financial activities. The draft Microfinance
Law potentially conflicts with the draft FIL at least as for some requirements for microcredit
institutions. BCSTP is working to clarify whether entities subject to the Microfinance Law – which
are obliged to be cooperatives, saving and credit banks or financial companies for microcredit –
should also comply with the general rules in the FIL on those specific institutions.

63. A separate law will govern insurance intermediation. Although the draft FIL includes
insurance among financial services, it intentionally does not regulate insurance intermediaries,
as they will be the subject to a separate legal framework. Work on this new legal instrument for
insurance service providers has not yet commenced. In drafting this law, it is necessary to clarify
the institutional organization of supervisory and oversight powers over the insurance sector,
currently supervised by BCSTP.

64. An effective legislative and regulatory framework would also need to cover electronic
transactions and electronic transfers including mobile money and payments. Modernization of
the financial market requires the digitalization of many services. This also affects financial
inclusion, since digital financial instruments could serve a large component of the unbanked or
under banked population. This would require an adequate legal basis that would recognize full
enforceability to electronic data collection and storage, transactions, authorization, and
transfers. These provisions would also benefit investments in the country and the efficient
establishment of centralized registries for credit and other financial purposes. BCSTP still needs
to formulate rules on electronic transactions and transfers, which can be the basis for additional
technical assistance based on existing models and international best practice.



b. Collateral Framework
65. The legal framework for the execution of collateral in São Tome and Príncipe dates back to
the Napoleonic era and does not adequately address the needs of borrowers for credit,
particularly those secured by movable collateral. There is also no specific legal framework
regulating lending devices or asset based finance involving movable collateral. Financial
institutions in STP rely on general laws – mainly the Civil Code and Commercial Code – for



                                                33
performing their daily-secured credit transactions. The most popular secured lending
instruments are mortgages and simple pledges, mainly on vehicles. Leasing and factoring services
are non-existent.

66. São Tome and Príncipe does not have a specific law on Secured Transactions. The purpose of
having a modern and functional secured transactions system is to provide access to credit for all
economic sectors, and all types of economic actors. Secured transactions systems (the use of
movable property as collateral for a loan) enable businesses and consumers to use their assets
as security to generate capital. Secured transaction loans are typically secured by a company’s
accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and they primarily benefit start-ups and small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) that do not have real estate or land to mortgage – from the
farmer pledging his crop as collateral for an agricultural loan, to the manufacturer of consumer
or industrial goods pledging his raw materials and finished products for working capital, to the
seller of goods or services pledging the cash flow from its customer accounts as collateral for
business expansion. In short, an effective secured transactions framework expands the base of
assets, which can be used as collateral for a loan and thus access to capital.

67. São Tome and Príncipe’s secured transactions system is characterized by a fragmented legal
framework with scattered provisions on financing secured lending with movable property in
different parts of the legislation, included mostly in the Civil and Commercial Codes.
Furthermore, there is no centralized electronic registry for security interests in movable or
immovable property. The system is based on the civil law tradition and reforms in this area have
never been introduced. Thus, there is need to pass a modern legal framework for secured
transactions and train businesses and lenders on this and on suitable collateral guarantees.

68. The Civil Code regulates the pledge (“penhor”) and the mortgage (“hipoteca”). According to
the Civil Code, a pledge grants the creditor the right to obtain payment from the value of a
movable asset or from any asset that cannot be subjected to mortgage belonging to the debtor
or a third party with preference over other creditors. The pledge is only effective when the debtor
transfers possession of the encumbered asset or of the property title to the creditor.18

69. As in many countries with a civil law tradition, in São Tome and Príncipe many contracts
require the intervention of notaries public to be valid. Some commercial transactions require the
form of a public deed performed by the notary public. Other acts require authenticity by the
notary, which means that the notary has revised and recognizes the document prepared by the
parties; and other acts require the sole recognition of the parties’ signatures by the notary.

70. All institutions interviewed during the diagnostic reported that existing land and property
registries are inefficient, expensive, and unreliable with a fee schedule that is difficult to
understand. The General Direction for Registries and Notaries (Cartorio), which is administered
by the Ministry of Justice, oversees the land registry (Registo Predial), property registry (Registo



18   See Article 699 and subsequent Articles of the Civil Code.



                                                                  34
de Propiedade) and the vehicles registry (Registo Automóvel) among others. Mortgages
(hipotecas) are registered at the property registry and pledges (penhor) at the vehicles registry.

71. Existing land, property, vehicle and mortgage registries of São Tome and Príncipe are
currently paper-based and are manually performed (although there is an upcoming project to
digitalize it). Registrations of titles, mortgages, pledges and searches are also manual and the
officers must consult the existing paper books. Therefore, registering and consulting takes a long
time and overall, current processes are cumbersome and not efficient.

72. A key part of a modern secured transactions law is an efficient centralized electronic (web
based) registration system based on notices and not on document registration. Unlike title
(ownership) registries such as a real estate registry, a secured transactions registration registry
does not create or transfer property rights. Such movable collateral registration serves two
functions: (1) it notifies third parties of the existence of the security interest and (2) it establishes
the priority status of a security interest based on the date of registration. Establishing a moveable
collateral registry is critical to leveraging the potential of the secured transactions law by
increasing access to information on assets and thus potentially a creditor’s willingness to provide
loans based on these assets.



c. Court Adjudication
73. Courts play a key role in the enforcement of contracts by enabling banks to recover assets
(both movable and immovable in nature) vis-à-vis judicial rulings in the event of a debtor’s
default. Without the ability to properly enforce these contracts through the judiciary, financial
institutions are less incentivized to lend and, thus, collateral is not leveraged as extensively as
possible to promote lending to the private sector. Yet as highlighted above, there is no
comprehensive framework for secured transactions to more effectively guide judges in their
rulings on contract enforcement commercial and financial matters.

74. The judiciary’s lack of specialization and training in commercial law and financial matters
preclude the effective enforcement of contracts. As a result, the judicial system is highly
unreliable in resolving commercial matters, which makes it difficult for financial institutions to
collect from delinquent borrowers. Financial institutions state that the enforcement procedures
for loan contracts are a significant problem that impedes their ability to rely on collateral to
secure credit or willingness to engage in unsecured lending. Further complicating the process is
the lack of transparency in the judicial process. The result is excessive cost and delays that
prevent recovery of possession while the collateral still has its full value. Realization of the
collateral after possession is recovered is problematic as the secondary market for selling
collateral is practically non-existent for most assets.19



19   Interview with different stakeholders, including some of the banks and the bar association.



                                                                 35
75. Significant delays and uncertainty in collecting on past due loans serves as a deterrent for
banks to lend. Repossession of collateral is in fact very difficult and expensive. Enforcement
procedures generally take two to three years for salary-based lending and up 10 years for loans
secured by home. Some institutions reported out of court settlement in exceptional cases. Some
institutions have developed mechanisms (i.e., including out of court enforcement clauses for
movable collateral in their credit agreements), which allow them to seize collateral without
judicial intervention – while efficient this is potentially not in consumer’s interest. These
processes are not commonly used since the creditor and the debtor must agree on all terms of
execution or otherwise must follow the lengthy judicial procedure.

76. As result of the critical role collateral plays in promoting access to finance and yet the
challenges to collateral execution, there is a need to not only pass a modern legal framework for
secured transactions, but to also revise the judicial review process for commercial and financial
transactions and train judges on commercial and financial adjudication techniques.

77. At the same time, however, not all contract enforcement cases and disputes require or merit
the same degree of adjudication as cases involving larger amount of money or which are more
complex in nature. Consequently, there is also a need to streamline adjudication for small claims
and institute alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and arbitration.



d. Comprehensive Review of Regulatory Framework
78. In light of the array of issues facing the financial sector and the various reforms under
development, it becomes necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of the regulatory
framework, including crisis planning and legal instruments for the resolution of distressed
financial institutions. It is also imperative to establish a coherent, comprehensive and
harmonized legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector by identifying gaps and
inconsistencies in current and draft legislation, and amending and creating new legislation where
pertinent. All relevant laws, rules and regulations should also be available on government
websites.




                                               36
IV. Financial Inclusion

a. MSME Access to Finance
79. Reliable data on the number of MSMEs and constraints in terms of accessing finance in São
Tomé and Príncipe does not exist. In the absence of an Enterprise Survey, and with the aim of
providing estimations and an approximate picture of the financing gap for MSMEs in developing
economies, the IFC has developed the Enterprise Finance Gap Database.20 Based on available
enterprise surveys in the region, IFC estimates that only 7 percent of MSMEs have a bank loan.
Competitiveness and growth is supported when local businesses (particularly MSMEs) have
access to credit to finance their activities. Despite the dominance of MSMEs in the private sector
(in terms of numbers), their access to finance is limited.

80. The Framework of Businesses Law provides a classification of firms’ size by number of
employees and maximum annual income (see: Table below). Stakeholders nevertheless seem
unaware of this definition and banks do not have data disaggregated by firm size.

Table 7: Classification of Firms by Size
     Firm size     Number    of      Maximum annual income
                   employees         (millions of dobras)
     Micro         1-3               90
     Small         3-12              90-900
     Medium        12-30             900-2,250
     Large         >30               >2,250

81. MSME access to finance is also constrained based on weak auditing standards and accounting
records, which make credit analysis difficult. In June 2014, the World Bank conducted a study on
the Observance of Standards and Codes – Accounting and Auditing (ROSC A&A). The report
indicates that the country is at an infant stage of development of the institutional pillars that
support the accountancy profession. This has been primarily attributed to minimal understanding
of the role and contribution of the accountancy profession to the economy, lack of any legislation
stipulating auditing standards to be used, out dated chart of accounts and no official organization
to establish and adopt accounting and auditing standards. The Minister for Planning and Finance
has worked to establish a professional accountancy organization called Ordem dos Tecnicos
Oficias de Contas e Auditores (OTOCA). OTOCA drafted and submitted to the Minister of Planning
and Finance an accountancy law on establishing OTOCA in April 2014. The Minister has
committed to presenting the law in National Assembly for enactment.

                                                       37
82. In August 2015 the IFC and BISTP announced a US$3 million risk-sharing facility to provide
working capital and loans to small businesses, support their expansion and modernization, and
drive job growth in which they will share an equal amount of the lending risk. Effectively
designed, partial credit guarantee schemes that follow best practices, such as the ones in Chile
are associated with a 14 percent higher probability for small firms to get a loan. Such mechanisms
may be able to help fill the finance gap that MSMEs are currently experiencing while not
distorting the functioning of credit markets.



b. Savings
83. Supply-side data from BCSTP’s National Financial System Report 2014 indicates that 48
percent of the population has a savings account at a bank.21 Despite low levels of income in São
Tomé and Príncipe and dispersion of the population these admirable levels of account ownership
are the result of relatively low financial, documentation and physical barriers to enter the
financial system. While account ownership figures in STP compare favorably with other countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa where just 23 percent of adults have a savings account, there is significant
room for improvement.22 A major constraint in assessing the potential for making the financial
system more inclusive is that no demand-side surveys exist on the usage of financial services.
Thorough demand-side surveys have recently been conducted in other markets in sub-Sahara
Africa and proven to be effective at helping policymakers and financial institutions identify the
opportunities for improvement.23

84. There are 27 bank branches in 5 of the 7 districts of the country where 86 percent of the
population lives (see figure below). The documentation requirements to open a savings account
include a national ID, which is widely accessible, the minimum opening deposit is between USD
$10-25 and there are semi-annual or annual fees.

85. The average amount of savings by individuals is US$57 or 3.5 percent of per capita GDP
indicating a moderate degree of financial vulnerability among households. With a gross savings
(i.e., gross national income less total consumption, plus net transfer) to GDP ratio of just 18
percent in 2013, Sao Tome and Principe lags behind other lower-middle income countries that
average 29 percent and even lower income countries at 25 percent.

Figure 11: Geographic Distribution Bank Branches: Two Circled Districts Lack Access




21 This is calculated based on data provided by commercial banks. These estimates are the best available data given that no
demand side surveys have been completed. The World Development Indicators show that in 2013 there were 720 depositors in
commercial banks for every 1,000 adults or 72% of adults. This is before taking into account the estimated number of
consumers that have more than one bank account.
22 Demirguc-Kunt, Asli Leora Klapper, Financial Inclusion in Africa: An Overview. World Bank, June 2012.
23 Although a demand side survey is an important tool to promote financial inclusion, the limited and focused scope of the STP

FSDIP necessitates such a survey taking place at a later point in time.



                                                             38
86. Access to bank accounts can also be promoted through government-to-person (G2P) other
bulk and recurrent payments, such as all government salaries, via deposits in bank accounts,
which necessitates account ownership. Additionally, providing customers the option to choose
their bank for these payments will increase competition in the banking sector.



c. Credit
87. Supply-side data indicates that less than 5 percent of adults are clients of consumer finance
firms. There are three privately owned consumer finance organizations that are primarily payday
lenders in STP. The largest of these institutions has 3,300 clients, three offices and 12 million
dollars in assets. While these organizations are considered microfinance institutions in the local
context they appear to be primarily payday lenders (i.e., 60 percent of their loans) to salaried
persons that have been turned down by banks. These loans are generally 1 day to 7 months in
duration with interest rates of 55 percent and higher. While the largest consumer lender
discloses the loan payment that is due, the interest rates on the loans are not included in the
loan agreement. The largest of these organizations is lending its own funds, does not collect any
type of mandatory or voluntary savings and has non-performing loans of 35 percent of total
loans. Based on interviews with the organization it is profitable and it does a limited amount of
collateral based lending.

88. None of these consumer/microfinance organizations are subject to prudential regulation or
market conduct supervision and they do not contribute data to or receive data from the central
bank’s central credit registry.24 Although over 100 countries have financial cooperatives and/or
other socially oriented microfinance institutions which aid in serving lower-income groups
neither type of institution is not currently found in São Tomé. In many markets, financial
cooperatives are able to effectively serve a lower and moderate income segment of the
population that commercial banks find unprofitable or only marginally profitable. It is imperative


24There are not any microfinance institutions that appear focused on serving microenterprises and/or that have a double
bottom line of measuring their social and financial impact. As such, the term consumer finance institution is referenced as
opposed to microfinance institution.



                                                              39
that microfinance institutions and consumer lenders come under central bank market conduct
and prudential supervision.

89. In a context, where 7 percent of MSMEs have a bank loan, less than 5 percent of adults are
clients of consumer finance firms, yet 48 percent of population has a savings account, it is clear
that there space to enhance financial inclusion beyond savings account ownership. The lack of
access to credit reduces individuals and MSMEs capacity to stimulate their incomes and smooth
consumption, which ultimately contributes towards the poverty rate of 62 percent.



d. Mobile Financial Services
90. The main telecommunications firm, CST, indicates that there are 146,000 mobile lines in STP
and 86 percent of the total population has a mobile phone. CST has 250 primary agents (and 300
subagents) in all districts of the country. There are two telecommunication companies in STP.
The largest, CST, has a 90 percent market share and is 49 percent government-owned and 51
percent by a Portuguese telecom company. With mobile phone penetration significantly above
the level of adults that have bank accounts, an opportunity exists to expand the frontiers of
financial services via digital financial services.

91. Currently CST subscribers can transfer airtime among each other as a form of airtime
payment/compensation. However, CST agents do not offer “cash-out” services where a client can
convert airtime into cash and take it out of the system thus severely limiting the usefulness of
the service as a savings or payment instrument. In addition, consumers and businesses are not
accepting CST airtime as a form payment. CST does not appear to have any plans to introduce an
e-money product and there is no explicit legislative or regulatory framework for it. It is imperative
to permit agent banking among financial institutions by allowing banks to partner with local firms
as banking agents.



e. Insurance
92. Supply side data indicates that 4.3 percent of the adult population, or 4,800 persons above
15 years of age have some form of private insurance. Although this is a small number of
policyholders, overall it is only slightly below the average in other lower or lower-middle income
countries in Africa (i.e., Mozambique and Zambia) where 5 percent of the population uses
insurance products. Premium income for auto insurance accounts for 50 percent of all insurance
premiums according to BCSTP’s 2014 data. It is widely believed by insurers that the mandatory
auto insurance requirement is not followed and that a review of the current auto insurance
requirement needs to be undertaken. There are only two locally registered but foreign-owned
insurance companies in STP. Similar to the higher-end credit needs of the market, the higher-end
corporate insurance needs seem to be met primarily through foreign insurance providers. This
could also be a result of the relatively small and limited lines of business offered by the two


                                                 40
insurance companies. The limited role of insurance highlights the space for growth and
diversification of products.



f. Consumer Protection and Financial Education
93. In 2011, BCSTP issued a regulation on consumer protection that applies to banks, insurance
providers and exchange houses – it does not apply to consumer finance or microfinance
organizations. The 2011 regulation establishes a complaint and re-course mechanism that is
presently utilized.25 Under this framework the BCSTP receives complaints and can sanction banks,
insurance providers and exchange houses. The consumer protection framework, however, is
incomplete as neither the 2011 consumer protection regulation nor other regulation/legislation
establishes a standardized method of disclosure, there is no general data privacy law, there is not
a framework in place to monitor over-indebtedness and there is little interaction between market
conduct and prudential supervision. With increasing NPLs, having a framework to assess and
monitor complaints and other critical issues, such as over-indebtedness, is increasingly critical.

94. An educated consumer is also much more likely to be a well-protected consumer. However,
it is difficult for the consumer to be educated and/or protected on these issues when there are
no standards for the transparency of financial products and interest rates. Neither BCSTP nor
private banks have any organized programs on financial education for consumers. As the
availability of financial services and credit has grown in São Tomé and Príncipe, there is ample
evidence based on the high-level of non-performing loans that many consumers did not
understand or misjudged their capacity to repay loans. As a result, there is a need to conduct a
base-line financial literacy study for consumers on a gender-disaggregated basis in order to help
better understand their different challenges and a financial literacy campaign based on the
study.26 Furthermore lenders should be obliged to consider a borrower’s capacity to repay and
existing debts in loan decisions. Providing suitable education to consumers at teachable
moments can be beneficial to both providers of financial services and consumers. Understanding
how to mitigate financial vulnerabilities through various forms of insurance can also help
consumers.



g. Doing Business
95. In Doing Business 2016 report, out of 189 countries, São Tomé and Príncipe ranks 185 on the
Getting Credit indicator and 166 on the Ease of Doing Business.27 The Getting Credit indicator has
two components: the Legal Rights Index measures the protection of creditor and debtor rights in

25 There were 12 complaints filed in 2014 with the Central Bank.
26 Although a baseline financial literacy study and campaign are key concerns, the scope of this project dictates their
undertaking at a later period in time.
27 The Doing Business rankings are a World Bank initiative, which provides an objective measure of business regulations for

local small and medium firms in 189 economies and selected cities at the subnational level.



                                                              41
collateral and bankruptcy laws, while the Credit Information Index captures the depth and
breadth of credit information. On the Legal Rights Index, São Tomé and Príncipe scores zero out
of a possible 12 points, indicating that creditors do not enjoy the same degree of predictability,
certainty and protection that creditors in other economies do to secure loans using a variety of
moveable assets. São Tome and Príncipe lags behind other sub-Saharan African countries in the
ease of small and medium business access credit ranking.

96. São Tome and Príncipe could potentially improve its overall position in the Doing Business
ranking and its Getting Credit indicator, if it reforms its framework for secured transactions.
Making such reforms could greatly improve the availability and access to credit for enterprises
and individuals. A legal reform only would improve the ranking, but would have no impact on the
ground in terms of improving access to credit, since those results would only materialize when
there is a functioning movable collateral registry and the secured transactions law has been
implemented.

V. Financial Infrastructure

97. A country’s financial infrastructure enables financial institutions, consumers and business to
conduct transactions securely and efficiently. Components of the financial infrastructure within
Sao Tome and Principe include the credit registry (central de riscos), the collateral registry system
and the payments and settlement systems.



a. Credit Registry
98. BCSTP maintains a credit registry of all current loans by banks. While this initial effort by
BCSTP to improve the credit information system is helping, more work is needed to improve the
utility of the credit registry. Banks share their list of outstanding loans of over 4 million dobras
every 30 days to the registry. BCSTP could improve this system by requiring historical data on
borrowers – not just active loans – providing a consolidated view of a borrower’s loans, arrears,
and overdraft amounts in the credit report. In addition, the credit analysis could also be improved
by adding multi-borrowing, overall borrower credit quality indicators and ensuring that all
lenders, not just banks, are contributing data and can utilize it. Utilities and telecom providers
are an important source of data. It would also be important to first research the potential impact
of making data contributions mandatory to the credit reporting system.

99. Few lenders are referencing the credit registry for lending decisions today given gaps in its
information. The existing credit information system does not provide consolidated credit
concentration information by institution and borrowers, which is necessary for lenders to assess
loan repayment capabilities of potential borrowers. Only some banks and none of the
microfinance institutions and consumer lenders provide information to the credit registry. Those
that do only provide information on a monthly basis instead of in real time. The credit registry
does not utilize an algorithm to produce a credit score that could standardize credit risk analysis.

100. There are single points of failure without sufficient back-up equipment and no disaster
recovery plan for the central bank and its IT communications infrastructure with banks. Although
stable and well managed, the communications infrastructure has several hardware, software,
and capacity limitations that present undue risk to the banking system. Improving server and
back-up capacities, having duplicate routers, a disaster recovery site and plan (that is tested), and
improved physical and data security are strongly recommended for the central bank and the
platforms it operates including the central credit registry.

101. Credit reporting and collateral registries are crucial components of the financial
infrastructure as they promote access to finance and financial stability. Comprehensive and well-


                                                 44
functioning credit reporting systems reduce information asymmetries, support efficient credit
allocation and strengthen risk management. If the BCSTP decides to implement the necessary
upgrades of the credit registry (both in terms of security and upgrades of the process, functions,
reports and resources) there will be a big potential for building economies of scale and potentially
host the Collateral Registry within the same technology platform. In other jurisdictions, both
systems share the same premises, hardware and resources, even when the software systems as
well as the databases should be treated separately. (See annex on Credit Registry Gap Analysis).



b. Secured Lending
102. Most financial institutions in São Tome and Príncipe consider both movable and immovable
property risky when securing credit, but in general they prefer immovable property as
collateral.28 The value of immovable property is more stable and easier to establish than movable
assets. In addition, financial institutions see various problems inherent with movable property,
including its quick depreciation, difficult re-possession and final sale of the collateral in such a
small market.

103. The average interest rate for loans secured by movable assets is high at 18.5 percent based
on the surveys. However, for immovable assets it is 15.5 percent showing that most banks
consider the use of movable property as collateral riskier than using immovable collateral. For
the unsecured loans, the average interest rate is around 26 percent.

104. Future assets and proceeds are not considered part of the security interest. The current
legal framework does not regulate the possible use of any future assets as security interests.
Conceptually and practically, it is not possible to take a possessory pledge over an asset that the
debtor has not yet acquired. In countries with a modern collateral registry, however, movable
assets with frequent turnover like inventory, farm products and accounts receivable are sold and
collected regularly, changing their nature into cash. If the law does not extend the lender’s
security interest to future assets and proceeds, lenders are forced to execute new security
agreements or modify existing ones, the cost of which is eventually borne by the borrowers.

Box 1: Collateral Registries and Moveable Assets as Security
 Reforming movable collateral frameworks contributes to increasing levels of credit at decreasing costs. In
 countries where security interests are perfected and there is a predictable priority system for creditors in case
 of default, credit to gross domestic product (GDP) averages 60 percent compared with 30-32 percent averages
 for countries without a clear creditor protection system.

 Experience from industrialized countries shows that borrowers using collateral get nine times the level of
 credit, repayment periods up to 11 times longer, and interest rates 50 percent lower than borrowers without
 collateral. World Bank research shows that the introduction of movable asset registries has a positive effect
 on firm financing, with: (i) an increase in access to finance by 8 percentage points; (ii) an increase in access to
 a loan by 7 percentage points; (iii) an increase in percentage of working capital financed by banks by 10
 percentage points; and (iv) an increase in loan terms by 6 months and a reduction in interest rates by 3
 percentage points.

105. A World Bank diagnostic survey of commercial banks, which sought to obtain baseline data,
secured lending by banks found that banks in São Tomé and Príncipe rarely take movable
property as collateral.29 The most common forms of security in movable assets are: (i) purchase
money for vehicles; (ii) interests in account receivables; and (iii) pledges on machinery and
equipment. Based on the volumes, however, these types of security are not common. In addition,
for vehicles there is a prerequisite of transferring the title and the car’s insurance to the name of
the bank before obtaining a loan.

106. The strong preference of lenders for security in real estate restricts access to finance for
MSMEs, which in most cases, do not have real estate to pledge as collateral. As a result, lenders
will either not lend or lend only on unfavorable terms and in amounts that are inadequate.30 The
potential credit gap for MSME lending is further explored in the section on Financial Inclusion.



c. Payments and Remittances
107. The payments infrastructure is lacking making international transactions. There are 27 bank
branches, 26 ATMs and 59 Point-of-Sale devices in the country. The lack of an international
connection to Visa or MasterCard means that local banks cannot offer credit cards and foreign
visitors with such cards cannot use them widely on the islands. The local payments company, São
Tomé Príncipe Automated Payments (SPOUT), is jointly owned by BCSTP and banks, operates the
country’s Dobra24 ATM network and has the exclusive rights to operate all POS devices. To
service tourists and foreign visitors many international hotels have developed a relationship with
an overseas bank to accept international credit cards. This keeps domestic banks out of a
potentially important fee-income source (i.e., interchange fees), limits their ability to offer
revolving credit via credit cards and limits the tourism infrastructure.

108. BCSTP maintains the country’s only connection to the international SWIFT network but
banks do maintain international correspondent relationships. Check payments are presented

manually to a single clearing company (Sequioy) and settlement occurs the same day. All civil
servants are required to have a bank account and the Treasurer’s office, wi thin the Ministry of
Finance, manually provides local banks with lists of salaries to be credited. While still including
manual processes, the requirement to have an account for receiving government payments
reduces government expenses, leakages from cash payments and promote the usage of formal
financial services.

109. Sao Tome and Principe received USD 26.8 million in international remittances in 2014
equivalent to 8.1 percent of GDP. The source of remittances include, in order of importance:
France, Portugal, Luxemburg, Angola, Belgium and the United States. Western Union is a key
market participant yet it has just six points of service in the country.

VI. Implementation, Monitoring and
Evaluation of the FSDIP

110. A Financial Sector Development Committee (FSDC) will be responsible for executing the
FSDIP. The governance structure of the committee will be comprised of the Minister of Finance
as Chair, the Governor of the BCSTP as vice chair, and the Ministers of Economy and Justice, or
their representatives, as members. A technical team comprised of Directors and Staff from the
Ministry of Finance, BCSTP, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Justice, and other line ministries as
needed, will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the FSDIP. The technical team will
oversee thematic working groups established to focus on particular sub-sectors. The working
groups will be comprised of public and private sector representatives that will be working to
support and execute the recommendations in Annex I. Potential examples of their activities could
include drafting or commenting on rules, regulations or bills, holding trainings or conducting
research. A secretariat will support the work of the technical team working groups and report to
the FSDC.

a. Monitoring and Evaluation
111. The Secretariat and the Technical Committee will be responsible for the oversight,
coordination and implementation of the strategy. Much of the work will require the active
participation of private and public sector, financial institutions as well as other public and private
non-financial entities. These institutions will be an essential part of the thematic working groups
and implementation of the strategy.

To facilitate progress each working group should report its progress semi-annually to the FSDIP
Secretariat. The Financial Sector Development Committee will prepare an annual report on its
activities and progress towards the KPIs, which will be based on the action plan below (and
developed at a later stage in this project cycle). In addition to this reporting on activities
completed, a strong measurement and evaluation system is needed to track progress relative to
the objectives and KPIs of this strategy. This will aid in the identification of successful programs
that can be replicated, obstacles that need to be removed, unintended consequences that result
and/or tactical re-adjustments of the strategy as needed.



b. Action Plan
112. The four objectives: I - Modern Legal and Regulatory Framework; II - Sound and Stable
Financial System; III - Robust and Efficient Financial Infrastructure; IV - Broader Financial Inclusion
will be achieved through a multi-stakeholder action plan coordinated by the FSDIP Secretariat.
The action plan incorporates key performance indicators based on a gap analysis of the supply-
side and legal/regulatory reviews completed in 2014/15.

113. To achieve these four objectives, the FSDIP action plan is structured around three key
strategic areas in the financial sector: Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision, Increasing
Financial Inclusion, and Upgrading Financial Infrastructure, while also including a general
strategic area. Strategic Area A, Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision, centers around
establishing a coherent, comprehensive and harmonized legal and regulatory framework for the
financial sector, enhancing oversight capacity and resolution. Strategic Area B, Increasing
Financial Inclusion, concentrates on microfinance consumer protection, non-banch banking,
assessing MSMEs financing constraints, and reviewing other legislation related to access to
financial services. Strategic Area C, Upgrading Financial Infrastructure, focuses on establishing a
card payment and a secured transaction system, improving credit registry and reporting, and
analyzing government bonds. Strategic Area D focuses on interventions outside the scope of the
Strategic Areas A to C, including enhancing the judicial review process for commercial and
financial transactions and develop strong auditing and accounting infrastructure and standards.

114. All recommendations are categorized by priority, a corresponding timeframe, and
implementation status. Prioritization levels include high, medium, and low. Timeframes provide
the recommended window of time within which to undertake the recommendation. These



                                                  49
timeframes vary across prioritization levels due to the particular nature and thus requisite time
of each reform. The timeframes range from 1-6 to 36-60 months. Within each Strategic Area, the
recommendations are sequenced by priority and the corresponding timeframe to strategically
sequence the reforms in a manner that permits, recommendations to be promote simultaneously
across strategic areas. The matrix in Annex I provides a more detailed and complete list of actions
needed. The action matrix is prioritized, identifies the timeframe for actions, and outlines the
status.

Annex 3: Consultation & Dissemination
Plan
The São Tomé e Príncipe Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan is the product of
extensive consultations with local stakeholders. Between September 2014 and December 2015,
the World Bank undertook four missions to STP (September 2014, January 2015, July 2015, and
December 2015) to provide implementation support for the FSDIP, including consultations with
stakeholders.

The main objectives of September 2014 mission were to: engage with the Ministry of Finance,
BCSTP and other stakeholders to discuss FSDIP objectives, collect the relevant information for
the necessary analytical work, take stock of previous activities related to financial sector
development in São Tomé and Príncipe, and develop a preliminary work plan. At the conclusion
of this mission the team delivered a presentation to the Central Bank Governor and senior
officials containing the main conclusions and proposed implementation plan for the project.

A mission team returned to STP in January 2015 to: (1) engage BCSTP, Ministry of Finance and
other stakeholders on the main issues relevant to financial sector development; (2) conduct a
diagnostic of the banking sector, financial inclusion environment and the legal and regulatory
framework of the financial sector; and; (3) carry out a technical review of the existing credit
registry and the potential for a movable collateral registry.

The December 2014 mission set in motion the creation of a governance framework to aid in the
drafting and development of the Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP). The
framework is led by a Financial Sector Development Council. The Council is comprised of the
Minister of Finance as chair, the Governor of the BCSTP as vice-chair, and the Ministers of
Economy, Justice and other line ministries. A technical team comprised of these same
organizations are represented at the National Administrator level are then responsible for
managing the implementation of the FSDIP and will oversee thematic ad hoc working groups
focused on particularly themes established by the Council. The Council also appoints a FSDIP
Secretariat to support the work of the technical team and working groups.

In July 2015, a World Bank mission returned to São Tomé and Príncipe to advance preparation of
the FSDIP. The mission discussed the draft FSDIP and participated in a stakeholder workshop with
Government, Central Bank, private financial institutions, and civil society. The mission also
delivered technical trainings on credit information collection, analysis and quality control for the
credit registry and private financial institutions. The mission also met with the Prime Minister,
Minister of Finance, BCSTP Governor and senior staff, and representatives of various private
financial institutions, investors, associations, and NGOs. After the mission, the team incorporated
client feedback and the results of the stakeholder workshop, and also held a quality review of
the FSDIP in October 2015.

In December 2015, a mission returned to STP to finalize preparation of the FSDIP. The mission
discussed the draft FSDIP with the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economy and International
Cooperation, BCSTP Governor and senior staff, representatives of private financial institutions,
and foreign investors. A complete mission agenda is attached.

Since the December 2015 mission, the FSDIP has undergone an initial review at the World Bank
and the team is in the process of incorporating the comments. This draft will then undergo a
management review scheduled for early March 2016 before it is then sent to the requisite STP
stakeholders for additional comments. After this review process is completed, the World Bank
aims to disseminate FDSIP in STP in June/July 2016.

Annex 5: Small Financial Systems: Some
Stylized Facts and Evidence from Sao Tome
and Principe
Prepared by: Dorothe Singer31

The challenges of small financial systems are well known. The provision of financial services is
often more expensive and more limited in small financial systems compared to larger ones. At
the root of those challenges are economies of scale, which can be found both at the level of
financial institution and at the level of the financial system as a whole. Many costs in the provision
of financial services are essentially fixed. This means that the cost of financial intermediation
decreases as the number of transactions, customers, and institutions increases. Fewer
transactions and fewer customers thus not only sustain fewer financial institutions and less
competition, they also make it more expensive for financial institutions to operate as they face a
number of costs including branch network, computer systems, and corporate governance
structures that are largely independent of the number of customer served. Similarly, the costs of
regulating and supervising a financial system and the cost of payments systems and other
financial infrastructure are also largely independent of the number of institutions that make up
the financial system. Moreover, it is often difficult for small financial system to diversify risk,
which can further constrain the size of the financial system in small markets and contribute to
financial stability risks.

Bossone, Honohan, and Long (2002) provide a discussion of how small financial systems differ
from larger ones and propose policies that can help small financial systems overcome some of
these challenges. In particularly, they show how openness can help offset some of the
disadvantages of being small. Work by Beck and De La Torre (2007), Barajas et al. (2013), and
Beck and Feyen (2013) benchmarks the size, depth, and performance of financial systems relative
to structural characteristics of countries such as size in terms of economic activity and population.
They find that poorer countries and countries with smaller populations have smaller, shallower
and poorer performing financial sectors.

Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to take stock of how key financial sector
indicators vary by financial sector size and summarize policies that can help small financial
systems address some of the challenges they face. Given that the financial sector of small
financial systems are typically dominated by banks, the analysis here focuses on the banking
sector.

The first part of the paper provides an overview of the characteristics of small financial systems
and how they differ from larger financial systems along a number of key financial system

indicators. The second part of the paper takes a closer look at the structure of one small financial
system, Sao Tome and Principe, and factors driving the interest rate spread in this small financial
system. The paper concludes with a summary of policy implications for small financial systems.

Countries with small financial systems

In 2013, 19 countries—out of 170 reporting countries—had a financial system whose total size
as measured by M2 (currency outside of banks and demand deposits) is less then USD 1 billion
(Figure 1, Table 1). As Bossone, Honohan, and Long (2002) point out, this is no larger than a small
bank in a developed country.32

Countries with small financial systems are, not surprisingly, characterized by small populations.
Among the 19 countries, population size ranges from less than 100,000 in Dominica and the
Seychelles to 10 million in Burundi and is on average less than 2 million. They are also, not
surprisingly, typically found in small economies as measured by GDP. In terms of GDP per capita,
the group of countries varies widely, from low income countries to upper middle income
countries. About half of the countries are located in Sub-Saharan Africa (10), followed by East
Asia Pacific (6) and Latin American and the Caribbean (3). (Given that a disproportionate number
of countries with small population and low GDP per capita do not report M2, the true number of
countries with small financial systems is higher than 19.)

USD 1 billion is a low threshold. 70 countries out of 170 countries had a financial system of less
than USD 10 billion in terms on M2. By comparison, 63 banks in the United States had more than
USD 15 billion in average assets at the end of 2013 (US Federal Reserve Bank, FRED database).
The average population size for countries with financial systems in terms of M2 between USD 1
billion and USD 10 billion is 7.5 million if excluding Congo, Dem. Rep., which with a population of
72 million is twice as large as the next populous country in this category.
Compared to 10 years ago, the number of countries with financial systems with M2 smaller than
USD 10 billion (in 2013 dollars) has decreased from 104 in 2003 to 70 in 2013 (Table 2). As their

economies have grown and their financial sectors have expanded, some countries moved from
having financial systems with M2 below USD 1 billion (in 2013 dollars) to financial systems with
M2 between USD 1 billion and USD 10 billion (in 2013 dollars) while in other countries the
financial sector now clears the threshold of USD 10 billion. The latter category includes countries
with relatively larger population such as Kenya, which have been able to expand the size of their
financial system as their economies grew and their financial sectors were liberalized. However,
many countries with small financial systems are too small in terms of population to develop large
financial systems serving their domestic economy.33

system size of less than USD10 billion in 2013.

Smallness and the issues facing small financial systems are of course not limited to countries
falling below some thresholds. Rather, as some of the analysis below shows, the issues facing
small financial systems are also relevant to relatively small systems beyond those thresholds
along the continuum of size, albeit to a lesser extent.

1. Stylized facts of small financial system (compared to non-small
financial systems)
This section documents how the banking sectors of small financial systems compare to larger
financial systems on key financial indicators for financial depth, structure, capitalization, asset
quality, profitability, efficiency, and access. Data for these indicators come from a number of
different data sources with varying country coverage, not just across databases but also across
variables within the same database. For best coverage, data it typically reported for 2013.
Whenever possible, tables that report key indicators by financial system size distinguish between
very small (M2 less than USD 1 billion in 2013) and small (M2 between USD 1 and 10 billion in
2013). For a number of key indicators coverage among “very small” countries is poor; in these
cases countries with “very small” and “small” financial systems are reported in one single
category. Smaller countries are often more likely to be among non-reporters of indicators;
keeping this in mind, reported averages for small financial systems might be biased upwards
(biased favorably).

1.1 Absolute Financial Sector Size and Financial Depth


33 Some countries with small population have developed large financial sectors through the provision of offshore financial
services. However, it is not clear that offshore financial services contribute to the quality of depth of on-shore financial services
in small developing economies (Bossone, Honohan, and Long, 2002).



                                                                 62
Given the presence of economies of scale, the absolute size of financial system matters. But are
small financial systems also small in relative terms? Two common relative measures of the depth
of the financial sector are the ratios M2 as a percentage of GDP and private credit extended by
the financial systems as a percentage of GDP. A simple scatter plot of private credit as percentage
of GDP against size and a tabulation of financial depth by size shows that small financial systems
are not only small in absolute terms as measured by M2, but also in relative terms (Figure 2 and
Table 3). And while the financial depth of countries with small financial systems in 2013 in
absolute terms have increased over the past 10 years, so has the financial depth in countries with
larger financial systems. In 2013, very small and small financial systems on average reported a
private credit to GDP ratio of around 30 percent. This compares to an average ratio of 45 percent
in other developing countries and 101 percent in high-income OECD countries. However, as
reflected by the scatter plot of private credit as percentage of GDP against M2, factors other than
the absolute size influence financial depth and policy can play a potential role in further
deepening financial sectors even for a given absolute size.

1.2 Financial System Structure and Size

Compared to countries with larger financial systems, small financial systems are characterized by
fewer financial institutions and a higher share in the number of foreign institutions and the
percentage of total bank assets held by foreign banks (Figure 3).34 Given the typically smaller
market size of countries with small financial systems in terms of overall population and often also
in terms of income, the smaller number of banks is expected. On average, very small and small
financial systems have 9 banks compared to 32 banks in other developing countries and 52 banks
in high-income OECD countries. The share of foreign banks in the financial system in very small
and small financial systems is with 62 percent (number) and 75 percent (assets), respectively,
about twice as large as in other developing and high-income OECD countries. The higher share of
foreign banks in small financial systems might just be a reflection that any given number of
foreign banks leads to very different shares of foreign bank ownership depending on the number
domestic institutions. But it can also point to the fact smaller systems are more open because
the presence of foreign financial institutions can help small financial systems address some of the
challenges they face such as making the system more competitive and efficient by importing
knowledge, risk-management skills, governance, access to capital and economies of scale.
However, the presence of foreign banks can also raise questions in terms of foreign banks
crowding out the market instead of introducing competition, increasing contagion risk, and
overwhelming supervisory capacity.35

Asset concentration among the three largest banks is highest in very small and small financial
systems at 82 percent; it is 55 percent in other developing countries and 70 percent in high-
income OECD countries. The scatter plot of asset concentration among the largest three banks
and M2 shows there is a large variation in the concentration ratio across financial systems, again
pointing to other influencing factors and the potential role of policy in determining the level of

34 Data on those characteristics for large number of countries (136) is available in Claessen and van Horen’s (2014) Bank
Ownership Database. The most recent year for which this data is available is 2009.
35 For an overview of the benefits and risks of foreign banks see for example Beck et al (2014) and for a specific overview as

relevant to small financial systems see Bossone, Honohan, and Long (2002).



                                                                64
concentration (Figure 3). Highly concentrated systems are typically thought to be less
competitive; however, in small financial systems there might be a trade-off between competition
and size given the prevailing economies of scale in finance, which might make relatively higher
levels of concentration desirable.

1.3 Capital and Asset Quality and Financial System Size

On average, financial systems across all sizes appear to be well-capitalized. Asset quality in small
financial systems is on average somewhat lower than in countries with larger systems (Table 4).


                                                          65
In 2013, average non-performing loans as percent total gross loans stood at 8.7 percent in
countries with very small or small financial systems compared to 7 percent in other developing
countries and 5.8 percent in high-income OECD countries. While variation across countries along
the size continuum does exist, this relationship is also illustrated in a scatter plot (Figure 4). One
factor that might explain higher NPL ratios in very small and small financial systems might be
relatively scarcer risk management skills both at the level of banks and at the level of regulation
and supervision. It might also be a reflection of the generally greater difficulty to diversify risk in
small financial systems.

1.4 Efficiency and Financial Sector Size



                                                             66
The profitability of banks varies by financial sector size. Return on assets and return on equity in
very small financial systems is on average higher than in high-income OECD, but about half that
in countries with small financial sectors, which have the highest, average profitability (Table 5).
This indicates that contestability remains overall limited especially in small financial systems
despite the large share of foreign banks in these countries as documented above.

Operational efficiency in countries with small financial systems is typically lower compared to
countries with larger financial systems (Table 5). Given the presence of economies of scale, it
comes as no surprise that countries with smaller financial systems have higher cost to income
and overhead costs to assets ratios (Figure 5). Interest rate spreads – the difference in lending
rate minus deposit rate – are also higher in smaller financial systems and decrease as financial
system size increases (Figure 6). Higher interest spreads might reflect higher lending risk, but also
the higher overhead costs typically found in smaller financial system. Other factors, including
statutory reserve ratios and provisioning requirements, also explain differences in interest rate
spreads. More detailed data is needed for an interest rate spread decomposition than is readily
available at the international level. The case study of Sao Tome and Principe below sheds light
on the main drivers of the interest rate spread in one small financial system.

Higher interest rate spreads in small financial systems might also explain at least in part average
higher net interest margins in small financial systems. In contrast, the ratio non-interest income
to total income does not appear to vary systematically with financial system size.

Another measure of efficiency is the rate at which the banks are able to transform savings into
loans. The private credit to deposits ratio is lower in countries with very small financial systems
compared to the ratio in countries with small financial systems and other developing countries.
This might be a reflection that banks perceive lending exposure as relatively more risky in these
countries, but it could also be a reflection of more limited supply of projects to invest in or a
combination of both.

1.5 Access

In terms of access to financial services, smaller financial systems typically have lower account
ownership rates among adults and fewer bank branches and ATMs per 100,000 adults (Table 6).
A simple average of account ownership rates across countries shows that countries with very
small or small financial systems show an account ownership rate of 33 percent among adults
compared to one of 48 percent in other developing countries. Data on financial access points
show that while differences in bank branches by financial system size in developing countries are
relatively small, they are more pronounced for ATMs with on average 22 ATMs per 100,000 adults
in very small financial systems, 30 in small financial systems, and 38 in other developing
countries.36

1.6 Other structural information

There are a number of other structural indicators that would be interesting to compare across
different financial system sizes but for which no data is readily available for such comparison:
-          Branches vs. subsidiaries

-          Currency regime (float, peg, etc.)

-          Credit registry

-          Presence of informal institutions

-          Mobile money presence




36Data on firm access to financial services is available from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys but country coverage among
very small and small financial systems is too poor to calculate meaningful averages.

2 The case of Sao Tome and Principe
Sao Tome and Principe has one of the smallest financial systems in the world (see Table 1), which
is dominated by commercial banks. In 2013, the banking sector consisted of 8 banks, one
(majority) domestic owned bank and seven foreign owned banks (Table 7).37 The domestic bank,
BISTP, came into being in 1993 when the government split the National Bank of Sao Tome and
Principe into a separate commercial bank (BISTP) and central bank (BCSTP). BISTP had a
monopoly on banking operation in the country until 2003. Banking sector liberalization and the
potential for offshore oil led to the entry of foreign banks, however, BISTP remains the dominant
institution in the market. BISTP accounts for almost half of Sao Tome and Principe’s banking
system assets and loans and two-thirds of deposits.

Asset concentration among the three largest banks in the country is high at 73 percent in 2013
and driven by BISTP, the largest bank. This is lower than the average of 82 percent reported above
for very small and small financial systems. In contrast to other small financial systems where
foreign banks account for 75% of banking system assets on average (Table 3), in Sao Tome and
Principe almost half of assets are under majority domestic control and indeed under the control
of a single bank.

The performance of banks in Sao Tome and Principe varies widely. System-wide, a combination
of a high rate of non-performing loans, decline in capital adequacy, and a sustained lack of
profitability as well as the fact that BCSTP has placed three banks under administration between
2010 and 2015 point to some distress in its system (IMF 2015). In terms on earnings, only two

banks – BISTP and one of the larger foreign banks, Afriland – reported a positive return on assets
in 2013 (Table 8). All other institutions reported an operational loss and indeed one of the banks,
Island Bank, has gone bankrupt in June 2014 and was acquired by Energy Bank. In January 2015
Banco Equador was placed under administration for repeatedly missing capital requirements.
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that common measures of efficiency provide a mixed
picture at best.

As mentioned above, interest rate spreads are one frequent outcome measure of efficiency and
their decomposition, which can be derived from a straightforward accounting identity (see Annex
I) can give insights into the extent to which of its components – profits, provisions, overheads,
and reserves – contribute to the spread. The interest rate spread in Sao Tome and Principe is at
12.9 percentage points overall higher than the average for countries with very small financial
systems (see Table 5) but varies widely across institutions (see Table 9). While the interest rate
spread is about 18 percentage points for BISTP, it is less than 1 percent point for Afriland and
even negative for Energy Bank. A decomposition of the ex-post interest rate spreads by bank
show that profits are the largest component of spreads for BISTP (and for BGFI) while all other
banks show significant losses. Overheads are a significant components of interest rate spreads
for many banks.

3 Policy implications for small financial systems
Small financial systems face a number of challenges. As summarized in more detail by Bossone,
Honohan and Long (2002), openness can help address some of the challenges but at the same
time also increases other risks, including contagion. Openness for countries with small financial
systems can take different forms and include foreign-owned financial institutions, shared or
imported financial infrastructure, and open capital accounts:




                                                         72
Foreign-owned financial institution. Opening the financial sector to foreign-owned financial
institutions can lower the cost of financial intermediation in small financial systems by making
the financial system more competitive and efficient by importing knowledge, risk-management
skills, governance, access to capital and economies of scale. However, the presence of foreign
banks can also raise questions in terms of foreign-owned banks crowding out the market instead
of introducing competition, increasing contagion risk, and overwhelming domestic supervisory
capacity.

The presence of foreign-owned financial institutions can also help small financial systems address
weak domestic regulatory and supervisory capacity by outsourcing these functions, at least in
part, to the home regulator and supervisor of the foreign-owned institution. However, this comes
at the cost of relinquishing some control and requires trust in the capacity of the home country
regulator and supervisor. Moreover, given that the operations of foreign financial institutions in
small financial systems are likely not of systematic importance to the home countries of these
institutions, conflicts of interest may arise.38

Shared or imported financial infrastructure. Sharing or importing financial infrastructure has the
potential to significantly reduce per unit costs of some financial infrastructure components,
including regulation, supervision, payments and settlement systems, and credit registries.
Financial infrastructure can be shared through regional integration of financial systems or by
importing financial infrastructure components from countries with larger financial systems. This
comes at the expense of dependence on the external provision of these services. It is also worth
noting that regional integration comes with its own set of challenges, especially if such
integration is among countries with different legal and regulatory systems and policy
preferences. 39

Open capital account. Access to international capital markets can provide financing for large and
lumpy projects that might otherwise been not possible or too risky. However, this also increases
the risk for contagion and may lead to a decrease in size of the domestic financial system overall.

The appropriate type and level of openness for small financial systems of course depends on the
exact challenges faced.

Advances in technology and related innovations in business models might also help small
financial systems overcome some of the challenges they face. Innovations in automation and
innovations such as mobile money and agent banking make it more cost-efficient to deliver
financial services not only to existing customers but also to segments of the population that could
previously not be served on a sustainable basis. At the same time, advances in technology and
automation may exacerbate economies of scale: while they may lead to significant cost savings,
they may also require high upfront investment costs.

Annex 7: Evaluation of Current Legal
Framework in STP
Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework in the financial sector is needed to better define
the scope of activities for different financial institutions and to regulate those which are currently
unregulated (i.e., insurance, microfinance/financial cooperatives and pensions). The Central Bank
has already elaborated a preliminary new draft of the FIL and is working on a number of other
draft laws and regulations, and will soon start a full revision of existing Normas de Aplicação
Permanente (NAPs). In particular, in addition to a new draft of the FIL (see below), the Central
Bank is working on a separate law on microfinance, as well as on draft regulations on microcredit,
pension funds, pension funds for Central Bank staff, and the establishment of a Commission for
Pension Funds for CB employees.

Decrees are in the process of being drafted, on agency insurance, compulsory automobile
insurance and insurance contracts. Once this package of measures is adopted, the country will
have a more comprehensive regulation of financial sector. Since these drafts, although each at a
different level of development, are still at an early stage, and taken jointly will undertake a full
reform of the financial markets, it is recommended that this exercise is done in the light of a
general strategy on development of the sector and having in mind also the need to foster the
country’s financial infrastructure.

The draft FIL roughly mirrors Portuguese legislation. However, it departs from it in particular as
for categories of activities included within one of the three mentioned categories.

First, it is difficult to exactly distinguish which entities/activities would follow under the category
of “credit institutions” as opposed to “financial institutions”, since a number of activities seem to
overlap (as for instance in the area of investment activities, or of payments) or are defined very
generically.

In the second place, although it is understood that credit institutions are gathered under the
same category because of their credit activities, these are not necessarily their main activities
under current article 4 of the draft law: this produces the effect that when capital and other
prudential requirements need to be identified for credit institutions at large, it becomes very
difficult to exactly define relevant parameters.

Finally, although it is correct that in the past Portugal had followed the model of distinguishing
between credit institutions at large and financial institutions, the law was amended in 2014 to
limit the scope of credit institutions to basically deposit-taking. This amendment was due to the
new EU measures adopted in 2013 to better articulate prudential requirements in the financial
sector according to international standards.40 As a consequence, the change made in Portugal

40 Decreto-Lei n.o 157/2014 (24/10/2014): “Embora não se introduza qualquer alteração na definição de «instituição de
crédito», que consta do Regulamento (UE) n.º 575/2013, nos mesmos termos em que constava da Diretiva n.º 2006/48/CE,



                                                            76
                                                                     Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe:
                                                       Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

could be taken into consideration to evaluate on what basis categories of institutions in the
financial markets should be separately taken into consideration.

According to the Law on Financial Institution, the central bank must submit to the Court a request
to declare the bankruptcy of a bank and suggest the receiver to be appointed. No specific law
regulates the liquidation of a bank and; consequently, the process must comply with the
commercial law. The central bank will have to work closely to the Court to set all procedures for
the bank’s liquidation, especially, the notice and registration of the bankruptcy, powers and
duties of the receiver, the priorities in payment of claims and the receiver compensation policy,
among other issues.

The draft microfinance law should clarify whether micro-credit as such deserves a special
treatment as being mentioned in both draft laws. If the provision of micro-credit is also covered
under the FIL it must balance consistency in approaches to avoid regulatory arbitrage while at
the same time ensuring proportionality for smaller institutions. In addition, criteria shall be
clearly defined to distinguish entities providing financial services at a small scale (“micro -
services”) from those providing the same kind of services to the general public. Finally, it shall be
evaluated how these entities be allowed to participate into the financial infrastructure of the
country. For instance, in the light of the financial inclusion strategy of the country, it shall be
considered to what extent these entities can provide payment services to their clients, 41 or
become agents for credit institutions as for certain services.

There are several significant weaknesses in the legal framework with respect to prioritization of
competing security interests in the assets of debtors.

         While the general rule that priority follows the sequence of registration of the security
          agreements is applicable,42 it is difficult in practice to rely on the rule because of the
          significant defects in the registration regime, as described in the following section on
          registration.




a necessidade de assegurar uma aplicação mais harmonizada no plano europeu desta definição e da nova
regulamentação prudencial justificou que se introduzisse tal ajustamento. Com efeito, até à data, os Estados-Membros
adotaram diferentes interpretações do conceito de «instituição de crédito», podendo distinguir-se entre aqueles que
optaram por uma interpretação mais abrangente de modo a incluir neste conceito um vasto conjunto de entidades
habilitadas a captar recursos provenientes do público - seja através de depósitos, seja por meio da emissão de obrigações
ou de outros instrumentos equiparáveis -, e aqueles Estados-Membros que restringiram o conceito de «instituição de
crédito» apenas às entidades habilitadas a captar depósitos do público. Procede-se, por isso, à redução do elenco de
entidades consideradas como «instituição de crédito» mediante, por um lado, a extinção de atuais tipologias de
instituições de crédito que deixaram de ter atualmente acolhimento prático pelos agentes económicos e, por outro lado,
a qualificação da maioria das demais como sociedades financeiras. As sociedades financeiras não ficam sujeitas, por
conseguinte, a todo o acervo de normas prudenciais aplicáveis às instituições de crédito decorrentes da Diretiva n.º
2013/36/UE e do Regulamento (UE) n.º 575/2013, ficando outrossim sujeitas às normas que vierem a ser definidas pelo
Banco de Portugal. Deste modo, esta alteração permite a redução para aquelas entidades dos custos de contexto criados
pela regulação europeia, tornando-as mais competitivas no mercado interno.”

           In the absence of a comprehensive bankruptcy reform, different rules may apply to
            different types of debtors with respect to priority in distribution.

           The Civil Code provides for super-priority of claims for delinquent taxes, wages and
            salaries, and certain other claims.43 These claims have priority over all other claims
            against the debtor’s property after the expenses of enforcement. While these claims
            affect existing interests in both immovable and movable collateral, they are more likely
            to adversely affect prior claims in movables because the value of movable collateral is
            generally less than the value of immovable collateral and, hence, more likely to be totally
            consumed by satisfaction of a preferred claim. Experience has shown that according such
            claims absolute priority over the claims of lenders, even if properly registered before the
            super-priority claim arises, causes a dramatic reduction in the willingness of lenders to
            rely on movable property to secure their loans, as shown in the following figure. So these
            provisions of the Civil Code are a significant deterrent to reliance on interests in
            movables.

The existing legal framework for lending secured by movable property in São Tomé and Príncipe
is outdated and in need of substantial reform. The deficiencies include the following:
           There is no single set of rules that comprehensively covers all types of assets and legal
            interests, so lenders must look to different rules and standards for different types of
            assets.
           The law requires a specific description of collateral in all cases meaning that there is no
            effective way to lend against inventory, receivables and other types of future property,
            notwithstanding that some financial institutions do take such interests as secondary
            security in very few cases.
           Consensual security interests have no assurance of priority, even if all possible measures
            are taken to assure priority, because statutorily preferred claims such as those for taxes
            and wages may trump a registered security interest of any type.
           For creation and registration of mortgages and pledges, it is mandatory to pay various
            costly fees at the Notary Registry including stamp duties, which will be passed on to the
            borrowers increasing the cost of accessing credit.
           By requiring registration of the agreement as a condition of effectiveness against third
            parties, the law introduces an element of arbitrariness and an opportunity for error into
            the registration process, as well as adding a burden of delivery of documents to a registry
            office. It also adds an implicit risk of liability for error into the registry, as in the case of an
            error that causes a person who searches in the registry to fail to find a registration.
           Enforcement in the event of default is made unacceptably slow and expensive by the
            existing law, both with respect to seizure of collateral and with respect to disposition.

Annex 8: Secured Lending in São Tomé and
Principe
The following report presents the finding of a diagnostic mission that the Finance and Markets
Global Practice undertook in São Tomé and Principe on January 26-29, 2015 to conduct
preliminary assessments of the existing legal and institutional frameworks for secured
transactions and to meet with public and private sector stakeholders to understand the extent
to which there is potential for the implementation of a movable collateral registry (schedule of
meetings attached in Annex XIII).

The assessment is part of the World Bank Group´s Financial Sector Development Implementation
Plan (FSDIP), which aims to enable the authorities to implement key financial sector reforms in
order to achieve a more efficient, sound and inclusive financial sector. The present report
analyzes the current secured transactions system in Sâo Tomé and Principe. The diagnostic
mission conducted aimed at identifying the needs of access to financing for local economic
actors, identifying deficiencies in present legal mechanisms and current registries, and collecting
any additional inputs needed to write this report as well as to propose recommendations for a
potential future reform in this area.

The ultimate objective of a modern and functional secured transactions system is to provide
access to credit for all economic sectors, and all types of economic actors. Secured transactions
systems (the use of movable property as collateral for a loan) enable businesses and consumers
to use their assets as security to generate capital. These systems are an important alternative to
traditional lending because they serve borrowers with characteristics that can fall outside a
bank’s typical business lines and allow banks to further develop th eir commercial banking
products. Secured transaction loans are typically secured by a company’s accounts receivable,
inventory, and equipment, and they primarily benefit start-ups and small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) that do not have real estate or land to mortgage – from the farmer pledging
his crop as collateral for an agricultural loan, to the manufacturer of consumer or industrial goods
pledging his raw materials and finished products for working capital, to the seller of goods or
services pledging the cash flow from its customer accounts as collateral for business expansion.

São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) has not yet been able to reap the rewards of a well-structured and
modern secured transactions system, largely because (1) the legal framework is fragmented,
obsolete and non-compliant with international accepted standards, based on outdated
provisions in the Civil and Commercial Codes, and (2) the institutional framework, i.e. the
registration system for security interest in movable assets, is dysfunctional.

A general overview of the financial sector points to: (i) too many commercial banks for such
small economy with one of them dominating with 50% of the market share; (ii) very high NPLs
due to lack of loan repayment culture making lending a risky activity; (iii) even when Banks have

                                            Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

high liquidity they are not willing to lend and when they do is at very high interest rates; (iv) cash-
based economy with a high degree of informality; (v) inefficient judicial system and inadequate
bankruptcy laws that make it very difficult for a lender to recover in the event of default.

Lending is mostly secured by real estate, which is the preferred type of collateral in São Tomé
and Príncipe. According to the information provided during the interviews, movable assets are
rarely taken as collateral due to the weakness and uncertainty of the legal framework and the
lack of capacity of the banks to do this type of financing. In addition, the leasing and factoring
industries have not been developed in the country.

The existing legal and institutional frameworks for secured transactions are incomplete. There
are gaps in the scope of assets that can be used as potential collateral and in the registry system.
Both the legal framework and the institutional framework (the registry system) are fragmented.
There is no law on secured transactions per se in STP. The provisions relating to secured
transactions are scattered in the outdated Civil Code and the Commercial Code covering both
mortgages on buildings and land and pledges (“penhor”) on movable property. However, these
texts have not been reformed since the colonial times to adequately include modern commercial
loan transactions.

The main shortcomings identified in the existing legislation include:

   -   Excessive complexity, burdensome requirements and considerable cost for the creation
       and registration of mortgages and pledges. It is mandatory to pay various costly fees at
       the Notary Registry including stamp duties, which will be passed on to the borrowers
       increasing the cost of accessing credit.
   -   Lack of clear priority provisions governing priority among secured and unsecured
       creditors. For this reason banks are reluctant to lend not knowing if their security rights
       will be protected vis-à-vis other creditors.
   -   Complex enforcement process that could take several years (from 5 to 10 years) and lack
       of specialization and training among judges in commercial matters make the judicial
       system highly unreliable. All stakeholders would welcome extra-judicial remedies to
       expedite these processes.

Because the deficiencies are so fundamental, piecemeal reform is unlikely to be sufficient to
significantly improve the environment for lending secured by movables. Therefore, a
comprehensive reform of the legal framework is needed in order to improve access to finance
for businesses and consumers in STP. The proposed recommendations for reform would include:

       1) Adoption of a modern standalone secured transactions law that should include
          provisions on five major substantive features and will abrogate any previous related
          provisions in the Civil Code, Commercial Code or any other law that is in conflict with
          the new law:

                                          Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019


        A broad scope that will apply to all rights in movable assets created by agreement that
         secure payment or other performance of an obligation, regardless of the form of the
         transaction, the type of the movable asset, the status of the grantor or secured
         creditor or the nature of the secured obligation.
        A simple process for creating an enforceable security interest by agreement of the
         parties
        A clear and comprehensive scheme for determining the priorities of competing
         interests in movable property
        A simple and effective means of publicizing interests in movables to facilitate
         assurance of a creditor’s priority
        A quick and effective enforcement process upon default of the debtor

       2) Approval of registry regulations that will implement the law by setting out the rules
          for operation of a movable collateral registry.

       3) Alignment of Central Bank directives on eligible collateral and provisioning with the
          new secured transactions system in line with Basel II recommendations.

       4) Design, development and establishment of an electronic centralized collateral
          registry for security interests on movable property. The only purpose of the notice
          registry would be to publicize the security interests and thereby to establish the
          priority of secured creditors.

       5) Awareness raising and Capacity building. It will be needed to raise stakeholder
          awareness on the need for reform using different communication mechanisms. In
          addition, it will be necessary to train financial institutions, businesses and the legal
          community on the existence, use and operation of the new system.

1. Role of Collateral Laws and Registries in Increasing Access to Credit
        Effective secured transactions laws and collateral registries are a crucial component of a
healthy financial sector and business climate. In their absence, entrepreneurs are unable to
leverage current assets into capital for investment. Modern secured transactions systems allow
the use of movable assets (both tangible and intangible) such as equipment, inventory, accounts
receivable, cash flows, livestock, crops and others as collateral in exchange for loans. Economic
analysis also suggests that small and medium-sized businesses in countries that have stronger
secured transactions laws and registries have greater access to credit, better ratings of financial
system stability, lower rates of non-performing loans (Djankov, McLiesh and Shleifer, 2005), and
a lower cost of credit (Lago, Lopez, Saurina 2007). In emerging market countries, for lack of
appropriate secured lending regulations and collateral registries, the assets owned by most firms
are a poor match for the assets that lenders accept as collateral.

1.1. Economic benefits of having a modern secured transactions system

A well designed secured transactions system can help create more robust financial systems by
promoting credit diversification, allowing non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to provide
credit (thereby reducing dependence on bank credit and dominance by commercial banks), and
relying less on real estate as collateral. Allowing for natural synergies in commercial lending by
banks and NBFIs can provide significant advantages to production enterprises, agricultural
enterprises, retailers and SMEs, by: (i) enabling financial institutions to diversify their portfolios
to accept movable assets, including more liquid security (such as receivables or investment
instruments); (ii) providing critical information on existing security interests in movable assets
and assuring the creditor’s priorities over those assets; (iii) enabling financial institutions to make
more informed credit decisions on collateral lending, thereby strengthening their risk
management practices; and (iv) establishing better reporting mechanisms on collateral lending
practices to the supervision authority or regulator.


 Collateral Registries and Moveable Assets as Security

 Reforming movable collateral frameworks contributes to increasing levels of credit at
 decreasing costs. In countries where security interests are perfected and there is a
 predictable priority system for creditors in case of default, credit to gross domestic product
 (GDP) averages 60%, compared with 30 - 32 % averages for countries without a clear creditor
 protection system.

 Experience from industrial countries shows that borrowers using collateral get nine times
 the level of credit, repayment periods up to 11 times longer, and interest rates 50% lower
 than borrowers without collateral. Recent research by the World Bank’s Development
 Economic (DEC) group, in collaboration with the IFC Secured Transactions team, shows that
 the introduction of movable asset registries has a positive effect on firm financing, with:

      An increase in access to finance by 8 percentage points
      An increase in access to a loan by 7 percentage points
      An increase in percentage of working capital financed by banks by 10 percentage
       points
      An increase in loan terms by 6 months and a reduction in interest rates by 3
       percentage points


Despite the logic of using movables as collateral, lending in many countries concentrates
almost exclusively on real property, which is preferred to movable collateral because there is a
legal and registry framework that supports rights in real property. Conversely, due to the
weakness and uncertainty of the movable property legal framework, movable collateral and in
particular working assets of an enterprise, is rarely taken as security. As a result, while secured
lending is the preferred form of lending in formal credit markets, movable property valued at

trillion of US$ in developing countries is classified as “dead capital” b ecause of non-existing or
poorly functioning collateral laws and registries. While 78% of the capital stock of a business
enterprise is typically movable assets such as machinery, equipment or receivables and only 22%
immovable property (see Figure 1), financial institutions are reluctant to accept movable
property as collateral. Banks heavily prefer land and real estate as collateral. One of the Solutions
to Increase Access to Credit Lies in Reforming Secured Transactions Laws and Registries.
Providing legal structures through which movable assets (both tangible and intangible) such as
equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, vehicles, shares and stocks, intellectual property
rights, livestock, etc., can be effectively used as collateral will significantly improve access to
finance by those firms that need it the most.

Without the benefit of a modern secured transactions system, the banking relationship tends
to be more inflexible for the debtor, and riskier for the creditor. To cover the higher risk, banks
respond by lending less or by increasing the cost of credit to cover the additional uncertainties,
especially as related to higher-risk borrowers (such as small firms and low-income households).
Conversely, secured transactions systems based on international standards and best practices
have been shown to increase the credit capital in the local economy, creating a virtuous
legal/economic environment through increased legal certainty, which in turn reduces the risk of
a loan, thereby reducing the cost of credit. Economic analysis in countries studied by the World
Bank Group demonstrates that reforms, which increase the effectiveness of secured transactions
law and registries considerably, improve a country’s lending markets. Countries that score higher
on the Legal Rights Index have greater access to credit, better ratings on financial system stability,
lower rates of non-performing loans, and a lower cost of credit. This results not only in facilitating
access to finance, but also in increasing the competitiveness of domestic economic actors.

There is strong country evidence about the impact that this type of reform can have in increasing
access and improving the credit environment in a number of jurisdictions. The following table is
an example of some of the results of specific reform projects implemented in several jurisdictions
with the support of the IFC (World Bank Group).

                           channel for lenders to reach SME borrowers. Within the first year of pilot launch,
                           the A/R Platform has attracted 25,396 registered users (lenders, buyers/suppliers)
                           with US$6.7 billion of receivables loans facilitated.
             Vietnam       Since its official launch in March 2012, the Vietnam secured transactions registry

                           registry, 30 lenders have registered as users and 33 loans secured with movables
                           have been registered for a value of US$ 226 million.



1.2. The need for a modern legal and regulatory secured transactions framework

Key features of a modern secured transactions law must include:

A Broad Scope of Collateral: A secured transactions law is effective when it broadly defines the
scope of permissible collateral to include tangible and intangible property of any nature, assets
that do not yet exist or are owned by the debtor (future assets), and a changing pool of assets. A
single, unitary concept of security interest should be adopted for granting a real right in any
movable property from the debtor to the creditor in order to secure an obligation of the debtor.
Finally, the system must offer the option for the collateral to be described generically to allow

the possibility of creating security interests in future assets and fluctuating assets, a prerequisite
for modern inventory and receivables financing.

Publicity of Security Interests in Movable Property: A key part of a modern secured transactions
law is an efficient centralized electronic (web based) registration system based on notices and
not on document registration. Unlike title (ownership) registries such as a real estate registry, a
secured transactions registration registry does not create or transfer property rights. Such
movable collateral registration serves two functions: (1) it notifies third parties of the existence
of the security interest and (2) it establishes the priority status of a security interest based on the
date of registration.

Priority Scheme: Priority of claims, such as security interests in property, determines the
sequence in which competing claims to the collateral will be satisfied from the proceeds of its
disposition when the debtor defaults on one or more of the claims. An effective priority system
is based on two main components; (i) a clear public policy underlying each priority; and (ii) a clear
set of rules regulating the order of priorities to facilitate the implementation of these public
policies. The general priority rule used in modern secured transactions systems is based on notice
and on the “first to register rule". There are exceptions to this rule and therefore it is important
to clearly enumerate those in the law.

Enforcement of Security Interests: A modern secured transactions law will need to include
provisions related to the following enforcement principles: (i) Possibility for the secured creditor
to seize the secured asset in case of default without court assistance. (ii) Out of court
enforcement mechanisms can include the execution through the financial institutions and other
specialized institutions or through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanisms, such as
arbitration or mediation. (iii) Easy disposition of the asset by the secured creditor by either
private sale or public auction. (iv) Debtor's protection during enforcement proceedings - While
execution proceedings are designed to allow secured creditors to enforce their rights efficiently,
protection of debtors' rights shall also be included to prevent abuses.

1.3. The need for an electronic collateral registry system

Developing a functioning collateral registry is a critical part of secured transactions reform. Not
having a functioning collateral registry defies the purpose of modern secured transactions systems.
A legal reform in itself will not be sufficient to maximize the benefits of secured transactions
systems. The main principles that apply to modern secured transactions registries are indicated in
the table below.
 Features of a state of the art registry system
 1. Notice based system: no documents need to be submitted and the registry is designed as a
 notice based system
 2. Information required: limited information related to creditor, debtor, description of collateral
 and maximum amount of obligation

3. Electronic, internet-based platform: both for registrations and searches functioning 24/7
(except for system updates)
4. Range of services must include registrations, amendments, cancellations and searches.
5. Centralized registry: all information is available in one single database for the whole country
6. Single registry for all security interests in movables: all existing security interests can be
searched through a single registry (does not matter if all the info is in one registry or if the registry
has real time links to other registries)
7. Flat and reasonable fees for registrations and searches: the registry charges a reasonable flat
fee (to cover the costs administering the transaction) for registrations and for searches (charging
for searches is optional)
8. Registration done by creditors or their legal representatives: creditors or their representatives
are responsible for registering the security interests in the registry
9. Debtors can be legal or natural persons: both individuals or businesses (any type of business)
might appear as debtor in the registry
10. Unique identifiers for both creditors and debtors: a unique alphanumeric identifier is used to
enter information about creditors and debtors
11. User accounts are established for regular users: creditors will be allowed to open a user
account to register security interests and conduct searches
12. Searches: any person can conduct a search in the registry from any place without a need to
justify the search
13. Real time data: registrations will be part of the system immediately and available for searches.
Information on searches will be provided immediately after the search (in real time)
14. Security of data: security devices such as tokens or passwords will be required for users when
doing registrations, amendments and cancellations
15. No verification of information by the registrar: the registrar is not allowed to verify the identity
of the registrant or the information contained in the notice
16. Indexing for searches: searchers will be able to conduct searches by at least three possible
indexes: debtor identifier, serial number goods and registration number
17. Type of debtor: debtor information is disaggregated by type of debtor such as individual,
business (type of business), foreigner
18. Maximum amount of the obligation secured: a maximum amount of the obligation secured
must be entered by the registrants when doing the registration
19. Registration of non-consensual liens: registration of non-consensual liens (like taxes, judgment
liens, etc.) is required if established by law
20. Disaster recovery sites: the registry will have redundant servers in secured locations in case of
system failures or disasters that affect the information contained in the registry

 21. Statistical capabilities: the registry is designed so that statistical information can be easily
 retrieved and produced in reports (number of registrations, searches, volume of credit, types of
 assets used, types of debtors, etc.)
 22. Methods of payment: the registry does not accept cash payments and allows for at least two
 methods of payment such as pre-paid accounts, electronic transfers, and credit or debit cards.
 23. Limited role of registrar: the registrar will not be allowed to modify or change any registrations.
 Only registrants are allowed to do changes to existing registrations
 24. Claim procedure for erroneous information and liability of registry: the registry will establish
 the rules for claims against erroneous information contained in the registry, but will not be liable
 for any misleading or erroneous information entered by the registrants.

1.4. The need to create awareness among stakeholders and provide training on the functioning
of the new systems.

An element of reform that is usually neglected, but that will be a critical key contributor to the
success of a reform in this area. The awareness of the reform and the new system in place should
be a continuous exercise during the whole implementation and following the completion of the
reform. With regard to training, the target groups that should receive training on the new system
include both public and private sector stakeholders: creditors, the business community, lawyers
and notaries, judges, enforcement or execution officers, registry operators.

Secured Transactions Framework and Practice in São Tomé and Principe

São Tomé and Príncipe, like most countries in Sub Saharan Africa, has not yet been able to reap
the rewards of a well-structured and modern secured transactions system because the legal and
institutional frameworks are clearly insufficient. The legal framework is incomplete, though it
does permit lending against movables in some cases. The institutional framework, i.e. the
registration system, is inadequate and incomplete in many respects as well.
The following sections examine the existing lending practices related to movable collateral, as
well as the current legal and institutional frameworks. That examination is followed by
recommendations for modernizing these frameworks.

Lending Practices in São Tomé and Principe: Financial Sector Overview

São Tomé and Principe´s financial sector is dominated by commercial banks that account for
98 percent of total assets in the system. The banking system is highly concentrated with the
largest bank, Banco Internacional de São Tomé and Principe (BISTP)44 holding half of total assets
and credit, and two-thirds of deposits. Seven commercial banks have 27 bank branches in five of
seven districts of the country where 86% percent of the population is located. All banks (except
BISTP) are predominately foreign owned from Angola, Cameroon and Nigeria primarily.

44   The Government has a 48 percent controlling share with the remaining shares held by banks from Angola and Portugal.



                                                               88
                                                       Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe:
                                         Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019



Non-performing loans (NPLs) are high at 16.3 percent in December 2014, albeit lower than the
22.5 percent registered in 2013. Provisions increased to 17.4 percent of NPLs in 2014 relative 7.5
percent in 2013. With the exception of the largest financial institution, banks are not profitable
limiting their opportunities to recapitalize from earnings. The combination of a high NPL rate,
decline in capital adequacy, and absence of profitability in the banking sector increase the risks
in the banking system.

Credit to the private sector is 20 percent below the peak registered in May 2013 and loans to
assets (34 percent) are at their lowest level in over a decade. Despite a slight decline in asset
impairment banks continue to decrease the amount they allocate to their credit portfolios, which
increases liquidity. The absence of domestically issued securities, scarce foreign exchange, and
central bank reserves that pay zero interest create a challenging operating environment for most
banks. With weak prospects domestically several banks are looking outside of the country for
investments and lending opportunities.

Access to finance remains one of the main constraints for private sector development. Demand
side data indicates that 14.4 percent of businesses and/or adults above 15 years of age have an
active loan. Following the entry of several foreign investors and banks in the mid-to late 2000s
bank lending to the private sector began to increase. Access to credit continues to decline from
a peak in 2011.

Non-banking finance is largely unexploited (only two local insurance companies in the market)
or non-existent given the absence of capital markets. It is also limited by weak capacity and
small scale. Only 4.3 percent of the adult population above 15 years of age has some form of
private insurance and less than 5 percent of adults are clients of consumer finance firm
(equivalent to 4,800 policyholders). Although vehicular insurance is mandatory, industry
estimates suggest that only 5 percent of drivers purchase insurance. There is no interbank market
and microfinance system is still nascent and not regulated.

Getting Credit and Secured Transactions in São Tomé and Principe

São Tomé and Principe does not have a specific law on Secured Transactions . Instead, the
secured transactions system is characterized by a fragmented legal framework, with scattered
provisions on financing secured with movable property in different parts of the legislation,
included mostly in the Civil and Commercial Codes. There is not a centralized electronic registry
for security interests in movable property in São Tomé and Principe. The system is based on the
civil law tradition and nationwide reforms in this area have never been introduced.

São Tomé and Principe ranks 185th in the world on the Getting Credit indicator in Doing
Business 2015 (see Table 2). The Getting Credit indicator has two components: the Legal Rights
Index measures the protection of creditor and debtor rights in collateral and bankruptcy laws,
while the Credit Information Index captures the depth and breadth of credit information. On the
Legal Rights Index (see Table 3), São Tomé and Principe scores 0 out of a possible 12 points,


                                               89

                                         Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

indicating that creditors do not enjoy the same degree of predictability, certainty and protection
that creditors in other economies do to secure loans using a variety of moveable assets. In fact,
São Tomé and Principe has one of the worst scores in the world in the Legal Rights Index, with
only 8 other countries in the world scoring the same.

Table: Getting Credit in São Tomé and Principe




São Tomé and Príncipe is clearly lagging not only behind Sub-Saharan African countries but also
most economies in the world in this area. There is plenty of room for improvement. Even though
none of the countries in the SSA region score particularly well in this indicator, some countries
like Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Malawi and Zambia have already reformed or are engaged in reform
processes in their secured transactions systems.

If the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe undertakes a full-fledged reform of their secured
transactions system, it will see a higher impact both on the Legal Rights Index indicator but most
importantly on the current estate of business financing in the country. The Doing Business
simulator tool (see Table 4) can illustrate the impact that a potential reform of the Secured
Transactions System would have in São Tomé and Príncipe.

As illustrated by the graph below, São Tomé and Príncipe could significantly improve its overall
position in the DB ranking as well as of course in the Getting Credit indicator, going from 185 th
to 52nd worldwide if the full reform is implemented. The World Bank Group strongly

recommends undertaking both a legal and registry reform, not only to achieve the intended
improvement in the DB ranking but also to be able to reap the rewards of increased access to
credit for the business community in São Tomé and Príncipe. A legal reform only would improve
the ranking but would have no impact on the ground in terms of improving access to credit, since
those results would only materialized when there is a functioning movable collateral registry and
the secured transactions law has been implemented.

Collateralized Lending and Types of Assets Preferred as Collateral

Financial institutions stated that they consider both movable and immovable property risky
when securing credit but that in general they prefer immovable property as collateral .45 The
value of immovable property is more stable and easier to establish that those for movable assets.
In addition, they see various inherent problems with movable property, including its quick
depreciation, difficult re-possession and final sale of the collateral in such a small market.

Future assets and proceeds are typically not considered part of the security interest. The
current legal framework does not regulate the possible use of any future assets as security
interests. However, in countries where there is a modern collateral registry, movable assets with
frequent turnover like inventory, farm products and accounts receivable are sold and collected
regularly, changing their nature into cash and bank deposits that are then eventually used to
acquire new inventory, farm products and accounts receivable. If the law does not extend the
lender’s security interest to such future assets and proceeds, lenders are forced to execute new
security agreements or modify existing ones, the cost of which is eventually borne by the
borrowers.

The average interest rate for loans secured by movable assets is high at 18.45% based on the
surveys. However, for immovable assets is at 15.5% showing that most banks consider the use
of movable property as collateral riskier than using immovable. For the unsecured loans the
average interest rate is around 26%.

The most common forms of security in movable assets are: (1) purchase money for vehicles,
(2) interests in account receivables and (3) pledges on machinery and equipment. However,
based on the volumes these types of security are not very common. In addition, for vehicles there
is a pre-requisite of transferring the title and the car´s insurance to the name of the commercial
bank before obtaining a loan.

The strong preference of lenders for security in real estate restricts access of the critical MSME
sector to finance. MSMEs in most cases do not have unencumbered real estate that can be
mortgaged, so lenders will either not lend or will lend only on unfavorable terms and in amounts
that are inadequate.46

MSME lending

“Lei de enquadramento empresarial” (Lei Nº 11/2005) provides a classification of a firm’s size
by the number of employees and maximum annual income (see table 7). However, during the
interviews none of the stakeholders seems to be aware of the existence of this definition, what
means that in practice it is not being applied. In addition, the banks do not have data
disaggregated by firm size and according to the chamber of commerce all the firms in São Tomé
and Principe are micro given the very small size of the country.

Data on number of MSMEs and access to finance in São Tomé and Príncipe does not exist. It
would be necessary to conduct a World Bank Enterprise Survey analysis in the country to obtain
rigorous data. However, with the aim of providing estimations and an approximate picture of the
financing gap for MSMEs in developing economies, IFC has developed and made publicly
available the IFC Enterprise Finance Gap Database. In the case of São Tomé and Príncipe, because
data is not available, it was necessary to extrapolate using regional averages. Therefore,

according to these estimations, there are 9,602 MSMEs in the country, which play an essential
role in national employment and macroeconomic indicators. Notably, even though nearly 45
percent of MSMEs have checking accounts, only 7% percent have a bank loan. Competitiveness
and economic growth requires that local businesses (particularly MSMEs) have access to the
credit they need to finance their economic activities. Despite the absolute dominance of MSMEs
in the private sector (in terms of numbers), their access to finance is limited. They lack physical
assets of the types that financial institutions will accept as collateral. MSMEs are therefore often
relegated to using informal sources of financing in many circumstances.

Notably, even though nearly 45 percent of SMEs have checking accounts, only 7% percent have
a bank loan. Furthermore, 43 percent of MSMEs are not served, 5 percent are underserved (with
only 2 percent well served). Access to finance is the most significant concern that faces MSMEs
in São Tomé and Principe, with 49 percent of all firms citing the lack of access to finance top
obstacle to their local growth and competiveness (as shown in Table 7). In conclusion, these
figures translate into a financing gap in the country of approximately US$ 47 million.

Analysis of Legal Framework: Existing Legal Framework

General:

The current legal framework of São Tomé and Principe is based on laws that were inherited
from Portugal and that do not adequately address the use of credit secured with movables.
The laws related to lending secured with movables, are outdated and have never been
modernized to correspond with financing tools that are available today in many jurisdictions
around the world

Currently, there is no specific legal framework that regulates movables financing where
movable assets are taken as collateral. Therefore, financial institutions in São Tomé and Principe
rely on general laws—mainly the Civil Code and Commercial Code—for performing their daily
secured credit transactions. The most popular secured lending instruments in Sao Tomé e
Príncipe are mortgages and simple pledges, mainly on vehicles. When other types of movable
assets are used as collateral these loans are unperfected because they are not publicized via
registration against third parties, therefore lenders may lose their priority in case of default. In
addition, the industries of leasing and factoring have not been developed yet.

The Civil Code regulates the pledge (“penhor”) and the mortgage (“hipoteca”). According to the
Civil Code, a pledge grants the creditor the right to obtain payment from the value of a movable
asset or from any asset that cannot be subjected to mortgage belonging to the debtor or a third
party with preference over other creditors. The pledge is only effective when the debtor transfers
possession of the encumbered asset or of the property title to the creditor.47

As in many countries with civil law tradition, in São Tomé and Principe many acts or contracts
require the intervention of a public notary to be valid in certain cases and in others to gain
effectiveness as to third parties. According to the laws in São Tomé and Principe, some
commercial transactions require the form of a notarial deed, which means that the act was
performed by the notary public. Other acts require authenticity by the notary, which means that
the notary has revised and validates the document prepared by the parties; and other acts
require the sole recognition of the parties’ signatures by the notary. Likewise, acts required to be
registered need to be notarized first to be accepted by the registries.

Article 669 of the Civil Code states that a pledge is constituted after the asset or the property tittle
is transferred to the creditor. To complete a pledge by a transfer of ownership, the creditor becomes
a joint owner (or sometimes the only owner) of the asset. This mechanism is different to the regime
for a non-possessory pledge where the debtor remains the owner and retains possession. According
to best practice, the borrower should continue being the owner and using the asset for commercial
purposes to be able to repay the loan.

Priority issues:

There are several significant weaknesses in the legal framework with respect to the priority
scheme of competing security interests in the assets of debtors.

While the general rule is that priority follows the sequence of registration of the security
agreements,48 it is difficult in practice to rely on the rule because of the significant defects in the
registration regime (i.e. searches cannot be conducted in real time), as described in the following
section on registration. These deficiencies contribute to lenders being reluctant to increase
lending secured with movables.

In the absence of a comprehensive bankruptcy reform, different rules may apply to different
types of debtors with respect to priority in distribution of the asset upon default.

The Civil Code provides for super-priority of claims for unpaid taxes, wages and salaries, and
certain other claims.49 These claims have priority over all other claims against the debtor’s
property after the expenses of enforcement have been paid. While these claims affect existing
interests in both immovables and movables, they are more likely to adversely affect prior claims
in movables because the value of movable collateral is generally less than the value of immovable
collateral and, hence, more likely to be totally consumed by the satisfaction of a preferred claim.
Experience has shown that granting such claims absolute priority over the claims of lenders, even
if properly registered before the super-priority claim arises, causes a dramatic reduction in the
willingness of lenders to rely on movable property to secure their loans, as shown in the following
figure. Therefore, these provisions of the Civil Code are a significant deterrent to reliance on
interests in movables.

All institutions interviewed during the mission reported that existing registries are inefficient,
expensive, and unreliable and the fee schedule is difficult to understand. The General Direction
for Registries and Notaries (Cartorio), which depends on the Ministry of Justice, oversees the land
registry (Registo Predial), property registry (Registo de Propiedade) and the vehicles registry
(Registo Automóvel) among others. Mortgages (hipotecas) are registered at the property registry
and pledges on vehicles (penhor) at the vehicles registry. However, if a creditor wants to pledge
an asset other than a car it is not clear where it should be registered but it seems it should be at
the property registry. In any case, there is not a practice on the registration of other types of
movable assets.

Existing registries of São Tomé and Principe are currently paper based and are operated
manually (although there is an upcoming project to digitalize it). Registrations of titles,
mortgages, pledges and searches are also manual and the officers must consult the existing paper
books. Therefore, registering and consulting takes a long time and overall, current processes are
cumbersome and not efficient.

Enforcement:

Most stakeholders highlighted that lack of specialization and training in commercial law among
judges make the judicial system highly unreliable in resolving commercial matters. All financial
institutions stated that the enforcement procedures are a major problem that impedes their
ability to rely on collateral to secure credit. Further complicating the process is the significant
lack of transparency in the judicial process. The result is excessive cost and delays that prevent
recovery of possession while the collateral still has its full value. The second major problem is in

disposition of the collateral after possession is recovered as the secondary market is practically
non-existent for most assets. 50

Repossession of movable collateral is in fact very difficult and expensive. According to the
stakeholders that were interviewed, in practice enforcement procedures generally take from 5-
10 years, with some institutions reporting out of court enforcement in exceptional cases. Some
institutions have developed mechanisms (i.e. including out of court enforcement clauses for
movable collateral in their credit agreements) based on article 675 of the Civil Code that allows
them to seize collateral without judicial intervention. However, these processes are not
commonly used since the creditor and the debtor must agree on all terms of execution or
otherwise must follow the lengthy judicial procedure.

Analysis of Legal Framework: Evaluation of Current Framework

The existing legal framework for lending secured by movable property in São Tomé and
Príncipe is outdated and in need of substantial reform. The deficiencies include the following:

There is no single set of rules that comprehensively covers security interests in all types of assets,
so lenders must look to different rules and standards for different types of assets.
The law requires a specific description of collateral in all cases meaning that there is no effective
way to lend against inventory, receivables and other types of future property, notwithstanding
that some financial institutions do take such interests as secondary security in very few cases.
Consensual security interests have no assurance of priority, even if all possible measures are
taken to assure priority, because statutorily preferred claims such as those for taxes and wages
may trump a registered security interest of any type.

For creation and registration of mortgages and pledges, it is mandatory to pay various costly fees
at the Notary Registry including stamp duties. Although there is no clarity on the costs associated
to the notarization process, it will presumably be passed on to the borrowers increasing the cost
of accessing credit.

The fact that the security agreement must be registered to make it effective against third parties
introduces a burden of physically delivering paper documents to an office. It can also cause
human errors since the information is entered manually and the registry can be liable for it.
Enforcement in the event of default is made unacceptably slow and expensive by the existing
law, both with respect to seizure of collateral and with respect to disposition.

Recommendations

Unify all forms of security in movables and adopt best practice legal framework for secured
transactions.

                                           Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

The existing legal framework should be replaced by a comprehensive and integrated
framework that treats all types of non-possessory interests in movables of all types of debtors
on equal terms. That is, there should be no hidden interests in movables that could defeat a
secured creditor’s interest in movable collateral. With respect to priority and publicity, the
interests in movables covered by the new framework should include, in addition to interests that
secure obligations, other interests such as long-term operating leases, finance leases and the
interest of a buyer of accounts receivable and secured sales contracts, in order to protect
subsequent secured creditors and buyers from undisclosed senior interests. It may also be
necessary for the new legal framework to be aligned and coordinated with other sets of law such
as: (a) the laws governing immovable assets; (b) laws governing statutory interests such as taxes
and wages to assure that priorities are preserved and consistent between laws; and (c) laws
governing bankruptcy and insolvency.

Modern laws provide for a single unified security interest in movable property that subsumes
all of the traditional legal security devices such as the pledge, retention of title and others. A
modern secured transactions legislation generally has four major substantive features, as
follows:

A simple process for creating an enforceable security interest by agreement of the parties.

A security interest is created by an agreement between the secured creditor and the debtor. The
security interest so created is a generic property right that secures an obligation, and it subsumes
all of the traditional forms of security in movable property, e.g. pledge, sale with retained title
and others. It eliminates distinctions between types of security interests. While the property used
as security may include future assets or a floating pool of assets, there is one set of rules for all
such interests; i.e. rights secured by a floating pool of assets are treated on the same basis as
rights secured by a fixed asset.

The agreement identifies the property that secures an obligation of the debtor to the secured
creditor, and provides for enforcement against the property in the event that the debtor defaults
on the obligation. The agreement creates all the rights between the parties, and is not dependent
for its effectiveness on registration of either the agreement or a notice of the agreement in a
registry.

The security agreement is one of three elements necessary for the security interest to attach to
the collateral so as to become enforceable. The agreement may exist before the property exists
and before the secured creditor has given any value to the debtor. But until the property exists
in some form and the secured creditor has given value, the secured creditor has no right or ability
to enforce the agreement. Therefore, the interest attaches only when there is a security
agreement, the property exists and value has been given.

A clear and comprehensive schema for determining the priorities of competing interests in
movable property.



                                                 99
                                                          Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe:
                                            Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

A secured creditor must be confident of the priority of its security interest in the collateral if it is
to lend at a reasonable rate. Therefore, the system of prioritizing interests in movable property
must be comprehensive in its coverage of all types of interests, predictable in how it operates
and transparent to all users.

In modern secured transactions practice, both true security interests and certain interests of non-
possessory owners are subject to priority ranking. Thus it does not matter whether an interest is
a pledge, a finance lease, a long-term operating lease, a sale of accounts or any other similar
interest. That is, all interests in movables that would otherwise be hidden from a subsequent
potential secured creditor must be publicized to protect subsequent secured creditors from
undisclosed prior interests. All are subject to priority determination. For purposes of discussion
of priority, publicity and enforcement, all will hereinafter be referred to as security interests.

Certainty of priority is provided by having one firm set of rules by which any person can determine
priority at the time of creation of the security interest. In modern secured transactions practice,
the concept of perfection of the security interest is used. Perfection occurs when the security
interest attaches and one of three other conditions exists. Those conditions are: (1) Perfection is
automatic by operation of law, as in the case of security interests in consumer goods, proceeds
or other classes defined by law; (2) Perfection is by possession or control by the secured creditor
or its agent, as in the case of instruments, documents, cash, deposit accounts or goods; and (3)
Perfection is by registering a notice of the security interest in the registry. Priority is determined
by the first to occur of (a) perfection of the interest or (b) registration of a notice in the registry,
whether or not the interest has attached; that is, priority can pre-date perfection when
perfection is by registration in the registry.

Transparency in priority determination refers to the ease of determination of the existence of a
perfected interest or registered notice. In the case of notices registered in the registry, the
secured creditor can search the records of the registry to determine if there are any effective
notices of security interest in the collateral. In some jurisdictions, the notice is considered
effective at the moment of delivery to the registry, but that does not provide full transparency if
there is a delay between the time of delivery to the registry and the time when the notice can be
found in a search of the records. The better practice is to make the notice effective to perfect the
interest when the notice becomes discoverable to a person who searches the records.

A simple and effective means of publicizing interests in movables to facilitate assurance of a
creditor’s priority.

The registry is an essential element of an effective secured transactions regime. The registry has
two purposes, as follow: (1) To provide notice to potential secured creditors of prior security
interests in movable property possessed by the debtor, and (2) To permit a secured creditor to
establish the priority of its security interest in movable property of a debtor.

A quick and effective enforcement process upon default of the debtor.

                                            Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

Modern secured transactions laws provide for quick and simple enforcement of the secured
creditor’s rights in the event of a default by the debtor. Enforcement generally consists of
obtaining possession and disposition of the collateral in some manner to realize its value.

Possession is obtained in different ways for different types of collateral. If the collateral is
accounts receivable or other rights to payment, the secured creditor may notify the account
debtors to make payment to the secured creditor. If the collateral is a deposit account, the bank
or controlling secured creditor may apply the account balance to the debt it secures. In the
common case of goods of any type, the security agreement may provide for return of the
collateral to the secured creditor upon default, or if such a term is not included, the secured
creditor may take possession or control of the collateral if it can be done without a breach of the
peace. If the collateral cannot be peaceably repossessed or controlled, the secured creditor may
make use of an expedited judicial procedure for repossession that is limited to the issues of
existence of a security agreement covering the collateral and the breach of the agreement.

Disposition of the collateral by the secured creditor requires that notice be given to the debtor
and any other secured creditor before the disposition. The debtor should have the right to
redeem the collateral by paying the obligation in full, plus the expenses the secured creditor has
incurred in its action to recover the property and give notice. If the collateral is not redeemed,
the secured creditor may sell, lease or license the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner,
or may agree with the debtor for the secured creditor to retain possession of the collateral in full
or partial satisfaction of the underlying debt. If the collateral is sold, the order of distribution of
the proceeds is, in sequence, to the costs of enforcement, obligations that are senior to the
secured creditor’s debt, the debt owed to the secured creditor, debts of other secured creditors
in order of priority and, if there is a remaining balance, the debtor. If the proceeds are insufficient
to cover the costs of enforcement and the debt of the secured creditor, the debtor is liable to the
secured creditor for the deficiency unless otherwise agreed.

Provide the legal framework for a best practice movable collateral registry.

The registry under a modern law is known as a “notice” registry. That is, it is a registry in which
the secured creditor registers only a simple notice of the essential facts of the secured
transaction, i.e. the identity of the debtor, the identity and contact information for the secured
creditor, and a general or specific description of the collateral. A number of best practice
principles for registries have been developed from the experiences of countries that have
successfully implemented modern secured transactions systems. The provisions of the legal
framework concerning publicity of security interests should enable the implementation of a
registry that is characterized by these principles. The principles are as follow:

Accuracy: Accuracy refers to entry into the registry archive exactly the information that is
provided by the registrant, who is the secured creditor or its agent. It does not refer to the
accuracy of the information with respect to the true state of the facts. The burden is on the
registrant to provide correct information. If the registrant provides inaccurate information, the



                                                 101

                                           Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

secured creditor risks losing its priority if the error makes the notice undiscoverable. The burden
of the registry is only to accurately capture the information that is provided.

Speed and timeliness: It is important that the archive reflect all effective notices as soon as they
become effective, because a searcher must be able to rely on a search to reveal all effective
notices of security interest in order to make financing decisions. A secured creditor must know
that its notice is effective at the time it is registered so its priority is assured.

Accessibility: The registry must be accessible to both registrants and searchers from widely
available access points, and without undue delay. The registry should be accessible at hours other
than normal business hours of the registry.

Unity: The registry should include notices of all types of security interests in all types of movable
property of all kinds of debtors, without regard to the location of the collateral within the
country.

Cost effectiveness: The transactional cost of registration and searching should be limited to the
level required to recover the costs of operation of the registry. The transactional cost must not
deter users from registering.

Simplicity: Registration requirements must be kept as simple for the user as possible in order to
eliminate errors and to encourage use.

Limited to purposes of registration: Registration information must satisfy the purposes of
providing notice of potential security interests and securing priority, but should not provide
information that is not relevant to those purposes. To add extraneous requirements
unnecessarily burdens the true purpose of the registry and detracts from its utility.

Rule-based decision-making for acceptance of notices: The registry should apply a fixed,
consistent set of rules to make decisions to accept or reject notices and to identify notices in
response to a search request. Registration rules should be enforced by using automated edits at
the time of data entry, so that decisions are made immediately upon submission of a notice.

Annex 9: Secured Transactions Registry -
Analysis of Institutional Framework
1. Existing Institutional Framework
1.1 Property and Vehicles Registries (Cartorio):

There is no legal framework and, hence, no institutional framework to support lending secured
by movables with the narrow exception of title transfer to secure financing for motor vehicles.
The two most important characteristics of the registration structure are:

Location: there is only one place where pledges and mortgages can be registered. There is no
other option but to go to the capital and register it at the Cartorio. People from small towns or
even from Principe have no possibility to do it at any government branch or other institution.
This situation is far from ideal since most of the population have no access or means to get to the
capital in Sao Tome so they are excluded of the system.

Document registration: the requirement to present all documentation causes delays and
inconvenience. By requiring examination of the agreement for legal sufficiency, the document
registration system introduces the potentials for arbitrary rejection of the registration and for
error in indexing the registration.

1.2 Registering property:

According to the Doing Business report 2015, globally São Tomé and Príncipe stands at 148 in
the ranking of 189 economies on the ease of registering property. The rankings for comparator
economies and the regional average ranking provide other useful information for assessing how
easy it is for an entrepreneur in São Tomé and Príncipe to transfer property. As shown in Table 9
the time, cost and procedures for registering a property are lengthy, very expensive and
cumbersome.

Registration of mortgages requires the form of a notarial deed in the property registry, which
means that the act was performed by the notary public. Individuals and companies do not own
any land; the government owns all the land and that grants them the right to use. These rights,
rather than the right of ownership, is registered in the land registry. However, registration of
mortgages is mandatory for the creation of a security interest. If the real estate is already
registered and all documentation is complete, then the registration of the mortgage takes about
3-4 days according to the property registry.

1.3 Vehicles registry:

The device that they use is a transfer of title to the lender, which has to be registered as a
pledge (¨penhor¨). As noted previously, there is no legal framework in Sao Tomé and Principe
to support non-possessory interests in the movable property of individuals. Therefore, lenders
must look to other devices to meet the demand for financing the purchase of vehicles by both
businesses and individuals. It is straightforward, though not without risk.

A lender may simply do a title transfer by registering it with the Vehicles Registry for a fee that
is based on the type of vehicle, and difficult to understand. It also needs to submit a power of
attorney that provides the recognition of the parties’ signatures by the notary (and its cheaper and
faster than the public deed). The lender then keeps title until the obligation is paid by the
borrower, and then transfers the title to the borrower, again by registering with and paying the
fee to the Vehicles Registry.51

While title transfer may seem simple, it takes up to 8 days, but it’s the only option available for
such financing. It also has some serious drawbacks, the most apparent is the expense of
registering two title transfers, once when transferring to the lender and once when transferring
it back to the borrower.

1.4 Fees:

Fees for registration of mortgages and pledges are published in the Despacho Conjunto nº
13/2011 (Article 47). In this same document are also included the fees for title registration of
vehicles and property as well as notaries fees. There are different fees depending on the
transaction and are calculated based on the secured amount. For vehicles some fees are flat and
depends on the type of vehicle. Most institutions interviewed complained about the complexity
to understand the table of fees and that most of the times there is no transparency in the process.

Another important observation is the lack of capacity and resources within the Cartorio. There
are very few registry staff and they have to hire retired people to be able to perform their
services. 52

1.5 Public Credit Registry (Central de Riscos de Crédito)

The current Credit Registry (CRC) managed by the Central Bank of Sao Tomé and Principe
(BCSTP) has a solid and modern interface, a well-versed and skilled BCSTP CRC managing staff
and the potential availability of a relevant amount of data and good quality of the contributors
Management Information Systems. However, according to the gap analysis performed by
Microfinanza as part of the mission, the CRC is today largely underutilized in Sao Tomé mainly

due to: (i) imperfect quality of the information of the CRC; (ii) lack of some relevant information
in the data contribution and (iii) lack of functions/reports in the consultation platform.

Financial infrastructure is the foundation of a country’s financial system including the legal and
regulatory framework for financial sector operations. Credit reporting and collateral registries
are crucial components of the financial infrastructure as they serve access to finance and financial
stability. Comprehensive and well-functioning credit reporting systems reduce information
asymmetries support efficient credit allocation and strengthen risk management. Effective
collateral registries enable entrepreneurs to leverage their movable property as collateral for
both business and consumers credit.

If the Central Bank decides to implement the necessary upgrades of the CR (both in terms of
security and upgrades of the process, functions, reports and resources) there will be a huge
potential for building economies of scale and potentially host the Collateral Registry within the
same technology platform. In other jurisdictions, both systems share the same premises,
hardware and resources, even when the software systems as well as the databases should be
treated separately. It would also be very beneficial to the financial sector if Pass a modern legal
framework for secured transactions and electronic collateral registry in place.

1.6 Companies Registry (Guiche Unico de Empresas):

The Guiche Unico de Empresas (GUE) is the one stop shop for businesses registration. It was
developed with the technical support of IFC in 2010. Currently, new companies are registered
with GUE and businesses registered under the old system are transferred to GUE whenever the
business undertakes an activity at GUE´s one-stop shop such as an update or modification. As of
December 2014, 1,225 new companies have been registered in GUE and 1,335 businesses have
been transferred from the old system.

would impede to do it in the GUE, it could be done in presence bringing the necessary documents,
although it has not been done in practice. 53


1.7 Evaluation of Institutional Framework

The existing registry structure, therefore, fails to conform to the best practices set forth in
previous sections. The process for registration of pledges is evaluated against each best practice
as follows:

Accuracy: In the existing process, a registrar reviews and indexes information manually from the
agreement and the registration form into a paper book. Whenever an intermediary, e.g. registrar,
exercises discretion and keys in information, there is a serious risk of error that may make the
information ineffective as notice. Therefore, the existing process does not assure that
information is accurately entered as received.

Speed and timeliness: While the turn-around time for registration is not excessive for a system
in which data must be entered by a registrar, there is still a gap during which a searcher would
not find a notice that has been received by the registry. Further, it seems searches are not
performed often given that the pledges are only done on vehicles and the transfer of title is
required and therefore no need for a search.

Accessibility: Registrants must come to the registry during business hours, so there is inevitable
delay in getting to the registry. The existing system is not, therefore, easily accessible either as to
place or time.

Unity: The registry does not include registrations of interests other types of movable property
such as accounts receivable, inventory, etc. In addition, registrations can only be done at the
premises in Sao Tome, there is no other registry for mortgages and pledges.

Cost effectiveness: The fees are based on the loan value and are higher than would be required
for a modern electronic registry. With respect to loans to commercial entities, double registration
is necessary, thereby doubling the registration fee expense. The greater costs of the existing
registry are the costs of preparation and delivery of the information form and the documents.
So the existing registry is not as cost effective as it could and should be.

Simplicity: The existing registration process is both an information and document registration
system, meaning that the parties must ensure that the agreement complies with the outdated
requirements of the Civil Code including the stamp duties. It is unnecessarily complicated and
inconvenient, far removed from simple notice registration.

                                           Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

Limited to purposes of registration: Registration is mandatory, and failure to register is an
offense, so it goes well beyond simply providing notice. Further, the information that is entered
in the books goes far beyond what is necessary to give effective notice to third parties.

Rule-based decision-making for acceptance of notices: The registrar examines the
documentation for compliance. Therefore, the process requires the exercise of judgment by the
registrar, so results may be uncertain. The process is not, therefore, based on objectively applied
rules.


2. Recommendations
2.1 Designate an entity responsible for the collateral registry.

If the Government of Sao Tomé and Principe decides to embark on a secured transactions
reform, should start considering who could be the potential host for the collateral registry.
Reluctance of local stakeholders to take responsibility for the establishment of a collateral
registry has negatively affected many other projects in other regions. In Kenya, a similar project
has never taken off for this reason. The designation of the entity to operate the collateral registry
may be made at any moment during the implementation process. Most countries designate the
responsible entity in their secured transactions law (e.g. Ghana, Liberia, and Mexico) so it is
recommended to designated in the law.

Countries have implemented various models. In some, the collateral registry is hosted by the
Central Bank itself, such as in Ghana and Liberia. In others, an already existing agency that has
some experience with the registration of rights and interests, such as PACRA in Zambia and the
Registrar General’s Office in Malawi, have been designated as the hosts. A third possible model
is where the Government itself, typically the Ministry of Justice (e.g., in Slovakia) or the Ministry
of Economy (e.g., in Mexico) is in charge. Finally, in a handful of countries, the private sector has
been charged with the establishment and operation of the collateral registry (e.g., the
Confederation of Chambers of Commerce in Colombia and the Chambers of Commerce of
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula in Honduras). It is important that the host is a reputable entity
that has both the professional and technical capabilities to operate a registration system.

2.2 Based on the diagnostic mission, there are three potential options in terms of where the
collateral registry could be hosted at:

Credit Registry (Central do Risco): as previously noted, there are multiple synergies between a
credit reporting system and a collateral registry. They manage similar data and have same
beneficiaries. In addition, they can share the same technology platform to have economies of
scale by sharing IT resources (hardware, disaster recovery site, etc.), premises or even
information. However, in order for this to happen the credit registry would need serious
upgrades in technology and resources as already highlighted.

                                                         Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe:
                                           Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019



Outsourced private sector solution: there are international vendors who can provide this service
at a reasonable monthly fee by managing and hosting all the data in the cloud. This is the solution
that various islands in the Pacific had adopted and other countries such as Haiti or the Dominican
Republic are exploring.

 Business registry (Guiche Unico para Empresas): the one-stop shop online system for the
creation of companies has been operating for a few years already. The institution has the know-
how and capacity to run a modern electronic system like the collateral registry. As mentioned
previously, this is the model that some countries in Africa as well as Latin America are using as it
also facilities the exchange of information between both registries and brings economies of scale
to the county.

Ultimately, in order to consider a possible designation of the entity responsible of operating the
collateral registry, it should be assessed if it indeed possesses the necessary technical capability,
the human resources for operative and technical matters, such as the technical support of users,
etc. Nevertheless, São Tomé and Principe could designate other entities to operate the collateral
registry from the public and the private sector. If a non-governmental office is designated, it is
still important that the government assumes ultimate responsibility for the data recorded in the
collateral registry.


3. Potential Action Plan
3.1 Objective

The objective would be to increase access to credit to the private sector in São Tomé and Príncipe
by improving secured lending framework, strengthening lenders' rights in movable assets and
raising awareness about secured transactions among local stakeholders.

3.2 Project Scope/Description

The reform can be implemented in there phases:

Conducting Comprehensive Legal Reform– 12 months
The first phase should focus on supporting the drafting and the enactment of the necessary
laws/amendments into laws governing secured transactions. This work will start by conducting a
comprehensive legal diagnostic/assessment with the support from the locally hired legal advisor
who will work in close collaboration with the international expert. The legal diagnostic will help
identify the most appropriate form of implementing the reform and will be used as a basis for
drafting necessary laws/amendments into laws.

Developing and establishing the electronic Collateral Registry– 9 months



                                                109

                                         Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan: 2017-2019

Upon enactment of the relevant legislation, the reform will focus on developing the on-line
Collateral Registry, which will replace the less effective existent paper based registry

Work on development of the registry can start once the secured transactions law and
coordinating amendments have been enacted or when there is a high degree of certainty that
they will be passed. The reason for this is that the collateral registry will not be effective to
establish the priority of competing interests in collateral without the legal framework being in
place, but the law cannot function without a registry up and running.

3.3 Capacity building of stakeholders– continuous activity

Thirdly, once the legal, regulatory and institutional framework is in place, the Project will work
with relevant stakeholders on raising awareness about new tools and will conduct capacity
building programs for financial institutions, businesses, judges and lawyers.

3.4 The reform should also:

   -   Support the public awareness campaign, targeting stakeholders with information on the
       new secured transactions law, registry system and their economic benefits.

   -   Train managers and staff of the government entity that manages the registry.

3. 5 Expected Outcome

   -   Law on secured transactions and necessary by-laws that conform to the best practice are
       enacted;

   -   The Secured Transactions Registry is operational;

   -   Banks and other finance institutions expanding the lending operations where movable
       properties such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment are used as collateral.
