summary
The environment in Morocco, like many other
low- to high-income countries, is particularly
vulnerable to climate change. However, unlike
other countries facing similar struggles, the
Moroccan government has responded to these
challenges and imbalances through a green
growth agenda. This agenda is firmly oriented
toward climate change mitigation and
adaptation. Further motivated by concerns not
only about energy security — but also about
economic development and poverty reduction —
the Moroccan government invested more than
US2 billion in clean energy technologies and
installed 166 megawatts (MW) of capacity
between the years 2009 and 2013.1 The primary
goal of this investment was to drastically reduce
the energy dependence on foreign sources and
become increasingly more energy self-sufficient.
However, self-sufficiency begins at home. It requires           but specifically climate entrepreneurship, have

INTRODUCTION
                                               Introduction

A World Bank Group (WBG) team, together with the support of Cluster Solaire’s and the
Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), undertook a climate entrepreneurship
ecosystem diagnostic in Morocco. The purpose was to shed light on the complexities of the
country’s climate entrepreneurship ecosystem. This was part of the preparation of an International
Finance Corporation (IFC) advisory service activity.

Climate-smart development is a rapidly growing area in Morocco, and indeed much of the world. It
has simultaneously been proven to boost economic development and contribute to more sustainable
economic development by reducing emissions and energy costs, creating jobs, and increasing
economic opportunity.1 Climate entrepreneurship2 offers a good opportunity to promote climate-
smart development and help countries transition to a green economy. Opportunity entrepreneurs,
who are the main focus of this report, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can play a key role in
propelling the industry through the creation and adaptation of green technologies and solutions, as
well as attendant job creation. However, there is currently a knowledge gap as to how to utilize
existing resources to design solutions to promote future entrepreneurial activity in the green sector.

billion) for climate-smart buildings, transportation,
industrial energy efficiency, electricity transmission and

the market (made before the 2016 Paris Agreement)
suggested that a quarter of this investment potential is
accessible to SMEs. This translates into a similar but
substantially larger opportunity for green entrepreneurs
operating in this space.21

Strengthening targeted support of the country’s climate
entrepreneurship ecosystem will boost job creation,
sustainability, and the formation of a stronger knowledge-
based economy.22 As the government already recognizes,
working with the private sector, civil society, and other
parts of the ecosystem is fundamental for climate-smart
development. Indeed, these partnerships could help mobilize
more investment to facilitate unique technology solutions
for the country.

  with other strong regional players. For example, the ease of doing business is on par with the other middle-income
  countries on the continent, such as South Africa. In fact, the statistics show that Morocco is considerably stronger
  than other Middle East and North African countries. However, access to finance remains more problematic.

    MAIN
FINDINGS
The exact formula for what generates a “mature” or “thriving”
entrepreneurship ecosystem is conditional on the many
intersecting factors of its origin, and how they relate to each
other within a specified context. Thus, this diagnostic analysis is
rooted in the six-pronged Babson Entrepreneurship Ecosystem
model. It aims to reveal insights into the challenges that hamper
the creation, development, and existence of enterprises in any
given country.

Since the 2014 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Morocco,
investment in the various facets of the country’s entrepreneurship
ecosystem have become a focal point of both the public and
private sectors. During this time, the foundation of Morocco’s
ecosystem solidified, and all the structures necessary for nurturing
climate entrepreneurship have reached a ‘start-up’ stage.
Nonetheless, the overall support environment requires more
targeted support. In particular, it will require favorable policies,
additional resources, and a resilient, entrepreneurial-minded
culture to inspire future growth.

There are a variety of reasons for the existence of these structural
barriers, as well as the fact that the gap in knowledge and access
persists. The following section aims to delve into these issues,
exploring the current situation of the Moroccan green
entrepreneur. It also brings to light the factors that have
contributed to Morocco’s current entrepreneurship ecosystem.
The holistic findings are based on the primary data collected,
including interviews with over 40 key stakeholders and a survey
of 334 individuals.

                              Entrepreneurs
The Moroccan green entrepreneur surveyed is young, educated, and started their business
because they wanted to be their own boss. These entrepreneurs are innovative and are
creating technologies and solutions to solve some of Morocco’s greatest environmental
challenges. This is occurring at a time when investment in solutions to combat the country’s climate
challenges is high — as well as a public necessity. Morocco is not their only target market, as many
have clients or customers in over 40 other countries (see figure 4 below). Indeed, many of these
entrepreneurs work in diverse sectors — from green IT to desalinization. Yet, broad recognition of
their ideas, and further participation in the field is limited due to a variety of social and operational
barriers common in a growing entrepreneurship ecosystem. These barriers include, among others, a
lack of mentors and/or market accessibility.

Box 1.2 Misconceptions about Green Entrepreneurs

There are several misconceptions about green entrepreneurs that limit the support they are currently receiving — and thus
their ability to scale up and make a lasting and larger impact on the green economy. First, green entrepreneurs do not always
identify themselves as such (nor do they necessarily receive support from “green”-focused incubators). As such, they not
being embraced by ‘green’-focused support organizations. They also sometimes lack the necessary recognition and
credibility for their pursuits.

A common misconception about green entrepreneurship is that the types of technologies or services they innovate are
mainly hardware in nature. However, based on the analysis for this report, more than 40 entrepreneurs claim to be
developing companies focused on Green IT, for example.

Second, of concern is the “new-to-the-world” or “cutting-edge” bias that currently exists in the Morocco’s climate
technology entrepreneurship ecosystem. Moroccan green entrepreneurs tend to be focused on creating new solutions to
climate challenges instead of using existing and proven technologies with clear models applied to a local country. The latter
can be an easier path to scale in developing contexts, not least because funders tend to be reassured when investing in these
types of businesses. Some support organizations are supporting entrepreneurs that have a new-to-the-world idea/technology
and an unproven business model — rather than actively plugging into global networks and resources for existing
technologies, and using validated and scalable business models that could then be replicated and adapted in Morocco by local
high-growth entrepreneurs.23

The final misconception is that all Moroccan green entrepreneurs are in the start-up stage. In fact, many existing mature
companies are also introducing new green products and spinning off new ventures. These have as much, if not more,
potential to grow green sectors overall. However, without recognition of green entrepreneurs beyond the start-up stage,
there has not been the kind of dedicated thought and calibration to the types of support needed beyond quite limited
initiatives, for the time being (such as those being undertaken by the Fast-Track-to-Market (FT2M) program of the Cluster
Solaire).

Box 1.4 Acceleration Support can Help Businesses Scale
While acceleration programs often provide funding, mentorship, and other essential services to help entrepreneurs scale their
businesses beyond the startup stage, it is not a guaranteed ticket to success. Whether an entrepreneur works in the
technology, fashion, or food science field, the core benefit of acceleration is the boost it can provide, initially for funding —
and, over time, in terms of exposure to relevant influential players, mentoring, and knowledge in an ecosystem. There are
various types of acceleration programs in countries around the world, each consisting of the same central tenets of support.
However, each are uniquely designed to the contexts in which they provide support.

Climate KIC Accelerator, the European Union’s only acceleration program focused on climate impact and clean technology
commercialization, offers a three step, 18-month program to provide cleantech entrepreneurs/startups with the knowledge,
resources, tools and coaching necessary for success, including:

Step 1: Fundamentals, that is, finding a market niche, and developing a financial model to scale a business.
Step 2: Validation in terms of grant funding, often up to €25,000 to talk to customers and verify any business assumptions.
Step 3: Take-off in which entrepreneurs can receive up to €50,000 in seed funding; find launch customers, development
partners, and investors; and form partnerships that can help an entrepreneur scale.

In addition, KIC requires an equity percentage in return for grants and all other services received through the program.
Finally, this sort of acceleration program can be applied in more developing country contexts. For example, the Ghana
Climate Innovation Center applied innovation models from Silicon Valley to encourage the growth of firms working in the
green technology space in the country, and in the developing world more broadly.

 Deductions on income tax (Impot sur le Revenu): deduction of up to 18 percent of the amount subscribed to the capital
  of unlisted companies.
 Deductions on the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF): deduction of up to 50 percent of the in-kind or cash contributions

British Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS)
In order to stimulate entrepreneurship and kick-start economic growth, the British Seed Enterprise Scheme was
implemented in 2011 by Chancellor George Osborne. It offers tax efficient benefits to investors in return for investment in
small and early stage star-tup businesses in the United Kingdom. A few details about the scheme include:
 SEIS investors can place a maximum of 拢 100,000 in a single tax year, which can be spread over a number of companies.
 Investors can receive up to 50 percent tax relief in the tax year the investment is made, regardless of their marginal rate.

working in the green technology space, produces market intelligence reports about the green economy. This includes
sector-focused information, market opportunities and challenges, and a general overview of investment opportunities for
both investors and businesses interested in, or already operating in, the green space.55 This information is accumulated
through engagement with various facets within the country’s ecosystem, including businesses, investors, government, and
academia. GreenCape aims to play a key role in removing barriers to the growth of green entrepreneurs and the green
economy as a whole.

Over the past three years, GreenCape has written annual market intelligence reports about: utility-scale renewable energy;
energy services; sustainable agriculture; the waste economy; and water.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Morocco’s potential for climate
entrepreneurship is high, and the country’s
dynamic high-growth entrepreneurs are helping
lead Morocco toward its green growth goals. By
scaling innovative business solutions to local
climate challenges, these entrepreneurs are
benefiting not only Moroccans, but Africans across
the continent as well.

Morocco has a young and highly educated
workforce, and bountiful natural assets. It has a
potentially big economic opportunity to play a
leading role in climate change adaptation and
mitigation both in Morocco, as well as abroad.
Moreover, many young Moroccan entrepreneurs
have already started their businesses with an
international mindset, and are working in various
countries throughout the world.

Although the potential for climate
entrepreneurship is high, as the findings in the
report demonstrate, there are various constraints
weakening the momentum for entrepreneurship.
These constraints hamper Morocco’s potential to
create jobs and increase overall economic growth.
However, these are not unsurmountable
challenges.

                                                     63
                     Recommendations

Improving the overall ecosystem will require investment in several key areas, such as policy,
financing, markets, and culture. In particular, a coherent and pro-active national entrepreneurship
policy would set the tone for dynamism throughout the sector. Furthermore, this would help lay the
official foundation for entrepreneurship, while ideally easing the culture of risk around securing funding
for the earliest stages of activity. Executing a well-crafted policy is often a lengthy and difficult cross-
governmental process. However, the benefits of achieving this would have a lasting effect across all
entrepreneurial sectors, especially with regard to green entrepreneurship. For example, countries such as
Italy have been pioneering entrepreneurship policy, through the Start-Up Act.56

Pending this reform, Morocco may wish to explore the following pragmatic areas of thematic focus,
some of which are being explored as part of IFC project implementation.

provide support for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Additionally, as a key component of Morocco’s
National Sustainable Development Strategy, a National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development was adopted
in 2012. The Charter strengthens integration of the environment in all public and sectoral strategies, and a framework law
(99-12 Model Law on the Environment and Sustainable Development Charter) was enacted in 2014 to help operationalize
the Charter’s efforts.
