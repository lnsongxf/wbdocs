Public Expenditure & Institutional Review
for ARMM Basic Education

A JOINT REPORT BY
AUSTRALIA DFAT AND THE WORLD BANK
Preface


T      his ARMM Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) resulted from a request
       by the Governor Mujiv Sabbihi Hataman for assistance in improving public resource
use and basic educational outcomes in the region. We would like to thank the Governor and
his office for their openness to carry forward a frank and forward looking effort to improve
governance and performance in the region’s basic education sector. In particular, Executive
Secretaries Attys. Anwar Malang and Laisa Alamia provided support and guidance during
the process. ARMM Secretary of Education Jamar Kulayan, Assistant Secretaries Noor
Mohammad Saada and Maisara Latiph, Alfadar Pajiji (Chief of Staff ), Mosbicak Ibrahim
(Budget Chief ), Analee Biruar (Accountant), Rosana Hassan (Cashier), Virginia Besana
(Planning), and Marjuni Maddi (SPCO Managing Director) all spent a great deal of time
assisting the team. In addition, many other officials from DepEd ARMM, school division and
district administrators and individual staff and teachers gave their time and enthusiasm during
both research and workshop activities.
      In DepEd National Under-Secretary Francisco Varela, Assistant Secretary Jesse Mateo, and
Assistant Secretary Armando Ruiz participated in the project workshop on strategic budgeting
and offered their time and expertise on DepEd National policies and procedures. In DBM, special
thanks are due to Director Tina Rose Marie Canda (BMB – D), Grace de los Santos (Division
Chief in charge of ARMM), and Assistant Director Dante de Chavez (BMB-B in charge of
DepEd National) for their participation and provision of key data.
      The Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society (CBCS) ably implemented the schools
survey under challenging circumstances. Without the efforts of Guiamel Alim, Wahab Guialal,
Tarhata Sambutuan, Amier Dodo and over 90 dedicated enumerators from all parts of the
ARMM, the study would have been impossible. We also thank all the respondents in individual
schools who gave their time during the survey.
      The BE-PEIR project is overseen by Teresita Felipe (Education Specialist, Australian
Embassy Manila), Kai Kaiser, Lynnette Perez, and Matthew Stephens (WB). The report
was produced by Hamish Nixon, Alma Mariano, Futoshi Yamauchi, Roy Tordecilla, Pinky
Esguerra, Miro Capili, Carole Belisario, and Lea Neri. The following reviewers gave helpful
comments: Samer Al-Samarrai, Elizabeth King (Sector Director, HDNED), Yongmei Zhou
(Manager, Fragile and Conflict-affected Countries Unit (OPCS)), Daan Pattinasarany (Senior
Economist, EASPI), Francisco Varela (Undersecretary for Finance, Department of Education),
Bruce Stacey (Advisor, Performance Informed Budget (PIB), DBM), Prof. Paul Hutchcroft
(Adviser, Australian Embassy Manila), Sam Chittick (Adviser, Australian Embassy Manila),
Evelyn Daplas (Portfolio Manager, Australian Embassy Manila), and Assistant Secretary Noor
Mohammad Saada (DepEd-ARMM).
      Financial support for the exercise came from a joint Australia WB Philippines
Development Trust Fund and the World Bank State and Peacebuilding Fund.

   Provinces that voted against inclusion in the ARMM either in 1990 or 2001 are Cotabato, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Palawan, South
Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur; and the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos,
Koronadal, Iligan, Pagadian, Puerto Princesaand Zamboanga. A key element of the opposition to the Memorandum on Ancestral Domain
(MOA-AD) signed in 2008 and annulled by the Supreme Court was its inclusion by fiat of some areas that had twice voted against inclusion.
Under the FAB some of these areas will hold a plebiscite on membership in Bangsamoro should 10% of residents request it.

   Though the causality is still unclear, the data suggests that teachers’ presence rates hypothetically rise from 65 percent to 80 percent as
students’ attendance rate moves from 40 percent to 100 percent. This finding, as with all absence rates reported, includes only students in
classes in session on the day of the visit.
