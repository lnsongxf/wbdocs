THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

       The following documents need to be notarized:
       (1) agreement for establishing a company (or articles of association) (2
       copies – one for the company records and one for the Central Registry);
       and (2) signature specimen of the manager (or ZP obrazec in
       Macedonian). The notary fee is charged based on the number of
       signatures being notarized. The cost per signature is 100 MKD + 50
       MKD court tax. Since there are 5 co-founders, the fee for the first
       document is 5x150=750 MKD. The second document needs to be
       prepared in three copies: one remains with the notary, one for the
       signatory (to present to the bank) and one for the Central Registry. The
       notary fee for this document is 150 x 2 copies = 300 MKD. The total
       cost is 1050 MKD.

       The manager should also deposit a specimen of his signature, certified
       by a notary public (2 notarized copies). Though the law permits for
       foreign citizens to be appointed as managers, it is necessary to point
       out that his presence will be necessary in order to sign the documents
       in the bank, as he will be the authorized signatory of the bank account
       of the Company.
       Supporting documents and statements that should be enclosed with

      Company founders can prepare registration documents themselves. A

      Central Register of Republic of Macedonia is the single institution for
      registering LLCs and other forms of trade companies, foreign
      representative offices, and other entities. This registration process
      includes registering the company with the Trade Register, providing the
      LLC statistic number, opening the LLC bank account, registering the
      company in the Public Revenue Office–Tax Office, and publishing the
      LLC formation notice on the Central Register’s Web site

        Request and obtain proof of land ownership from the Real Estate
        Cadastre

        BuildCo must obtain proof of ownership of the land where construction
        will take place. This document must be obtained at least 6 months
        before the beginning of the process. The Municipalities of Skopje
        update their tariff for fees associated with surveying and geodetic data
        for real estate on an annual basis. Obtaining proof of land ownership
        cost can vary from municipality to municipality. BuildCo pays an
        administrative fee of MKD 50 and a fee of MKD 125 for one parcel. If          1 day           MKD 175

        the land includes more than one parcel, the cost would be MKD 125 for
        the first parcel and MKD 25 for additional parcels.

        Property list can be obtained within the municipality as well and from
        the nearest notary public office. In this case the applicant would have to
        pay also the notary fee, which is additional MKD 300.

        Request and obtain the extract of the detailed urban plan from the

        The requested extract of the detailed urban plan is issued by the
        respective office of the Municipality. This detailed urban plan identifies
        the location/positioning of the plot of land where the warehouse will
        be built.

        Together with the request for obtaining an extract of a detailed urban
        plan, BuildCo must submit the proof of land ownership and an extract
        from a cadastre plan obtained by the Real Estate Cadastre. The extract
        of the detailed urban plan can be obtained within 5 working days after
        submission of the request.

      * Obtain the hydro-technical conditions

      The hydro-technical conditions are needed to obtain the account of
      numerical data study. In theory, the Municipality is supposed to obtain
      the hydro-technical conditions for the applicant. But in practice, the
3     applicant must still visit the water company (JP "Vodovod i                 7 days       no charge

      Hire a private cadastre office and obtain account of numerical data

      The account of numerical data study is necessary to identify the
      measures of the plot of land on which the warehouse will be built. The
      cost of this study is approximately MKD 6,000.00 -- MKD 10,000.00. In
      Skopje there are a number of private cadastre offices that can be hired
      by BuildCo. The private cadastre office shall then obtain approval and      1 day       MKD 6,000

      approval.


      Agency: Private Company



      Pay municipal tax, obtain proof of payment, and obtain relevant
      approvals

      Before the building permit can be issued, BuildCo must pay a tax for
      the preparation of the spatial plan and the urban plan. The tax for the
      Doing Business case study warehouse would be around EUR 70 per
      square meter (1,300.6 sq * EUR 70 = EUR 91,042).

      BuildCo must visit the Municipality to find out the fees to be paid. The
      Municipality sends the request to the Urban Planning Department and
      they calculate the tax. Then the Municipality calls BuildCo to notify
5     them that the tax fees have been calculated. BuildCo must then visit the   15 days     MKD 682,815
      Municipality to obtain the amount to be paid and pays the fees at a
      commercial bank. The bank then issues proof of payment. The proof of
      payment is submitted back to the Municipality.

      After that, BuildCo signs the contract with the city of Skopje - the
      signatures of the applicant and the Mayor must be on the contract.

      Hire a third-party supervisor for the construction work

      Before construction starts, BuildCo must hire a private company or an
      engineer licensed to perform construction supervision. The supervisory
      party would oversee construction from beginning to end, perform the
      technical inspection after construction, and prepare the final report. A
      company would usually charge between 1% and 2% of the value of
      construction.

      According to the According to the article 10 of the Law on Amending
      the Construction Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia         1 day      MKD 164,903
6
      br.144/12), supervisor of construction works for facilities intended for
      storehouses and warehouses cannot define a price higher than 0.5% of
      the value of the facility. However, in practice, supervisory firms still
      charge 1-2% of the construction value, because it is a free market
      interaction and the building companies prefer paying the market price
      in order to obtain a high quality service.

      Request and obtain approval for construction (building permit)
      from the Municipality

      The Law on Amendments and Modification of the Law on Spatial and
      Urban Planning was adopted on June 8, 2008 and enforced on June 16,
      2008. Under these changes, the Municipality must notify the relevant
      bodies that the documents are ready for their review and approval. The
      relevant bodies include the water and sewage company, electrical utility
      company and the Civil Defense. These bodies must provide their
      approval within 5 days (silence-is-consent rule applies) and the
      Municipality must issue the permit within 5 days after the
      documentation has been completed.

      The building permit requires the investor to start construction work
      within 6 months from the issuance date. In practice it takes on average
      1.5 months to obtain the building permit.

      The building permit fee was increased in January 2010 following the
      amendments to the Law on Administrative Taxes (Official Gazette No.
      06/2010).

        * Request and obtain water and sewage installation

        To obtain water and sewage installation, an application must be
        submitted along with the following documents:
        • Hydro-technical conditions issued by JP "Vodovod i Kanalizacija"
        • A directive from the construction company, issued by the State

       "With the Law on Amendments and Addenda to the Law on Real Estate
       Cadastre (‘Official Gazette of RM’ No. 74/12 - 13.06.2012) all the
       information on encumbrances over land and property are included in the
       Title Deed. Thus, parties need to obtain only a copy of the Title deed in
       order to check for encumbrances. The Title deed except from the
       Cadastre Agency, also can be obtained at the notary offices,
       municipalities and geodetic companies. This procedure can be done
       simultaneously with procedure 3.



       Starting from January 2013 the Agency no longer issues data from the
       encumbrances certificates nor it deletes any mortagages register in
       them. All undisputable data from the Registration Books have been                               MKD 125 (Title
       transferred in the corresponding property sheets.                                              deed) + MKD 50

       This novelty has simplified the procedure for transfer of property, since it
       is no longer required for the seller to obtain a Certificate from the
       Registration Book in order to confirm whether there is or not an
       encumbrance over the property. A Title Deed obtained either from the
       Agency or the authorized subjects (which have conlcuded agreements
       with the Agency) is sufficient for the conclusion of the sale and purchase
       agreement.

        According to the Article 186 from the Law on Real Estate Cadastre
        (Official Gazzete of RM 55/2013), the time limit for Real Estate Cadastre
        to register required application is set at 15 working days. The

        notary (obtained in Procedure 3).



        E-lodging is now being introduced in Macedonia: the E-Counter
        application for professional users (available at www.katastar.gov.mk ),
        enables submission of applications for data and changes electronically,
        using electronic signature. The fee for the service and the administrative
        tax can be paid by credit card via the virtual POS terminal. In order to use
        this service, the professional users must sign a contract with the AREC
        and must have internet access, scanner, digital signature issued by an
        authorized body, and payment card. With the E-Counter, the citizen via
        the Notaries can conduct purchase or sale of the property and can
        quickly record a mortgage, without coming to the AREC front desk in
        person.



        By January 2014 the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre has connected with
        all 174 notaries in the country. Moreover from 01/01/2014 the two
        systems of electronic cadastre ( E - counter and E- floor counter) for the
        city of Skopje has been merged, that has allowed notaries to submit
        electronically all notarial documents governing the transfer of ownership
        or other real rights, in order the changes in the titular/s, the transmission
        of right and etc to be recorded. During this year these two systems will
        be merged across all the regional offices of the Agency for Real Estate
        Cadastre in Republic of Macedonia.

                     FYR Macedonia strengthened investor protections by
                     introducing regulations on the approval of related-party
 DB2010              transactions, increasing disclosure requirements in the annual
                     report and making it easier to sue directors in cases where
                     related-party transactions harm the company.
                     FYR Macedonia strengthened investor protections by allowing
                     shareholders to request the rescission of unfair related-party

                     The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia strengthened

                   permanent tasks and reduced mandatory paid annual leave. In
