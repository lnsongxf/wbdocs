THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

Lithuania is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new               Legal form: Small Partnership
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through

Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,          Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

       Reservation of the new company name is compulsory for online
       registration of business. Checking of the name is free of charge, and
       reservation costs LTL 56.
       As of May 2013, the changes of the Regulations of the Register of legal
       persons came into effect. Now the State Commission of the Lithuanian
       Language must check every new company name and give its consent
       on the use of a particular name.

       of Lithuanian words, therefore sometimes it is not possible to use
       foreign words.

      Register with the Land and Real Property Registry

      Upon completion and approval of construction, the building must be
      registered with the Land and Real Property Registry. The general term
      for the registering of warehouse is 10 working days, but it is possible to
      register it in 1 working day if a supplementary fee is paid. The price for
      the building registration depends on whether natural or legal person
      registers the building and on the average market value of the building.
      As the approximate value of the building is LTL 2,601,200.00, the cost
11    for the registering of the warehouse is estimated as follows:                 1 day        LTL 2,272

      LTL 505.00 (constant price) + 0.055% of the sum, which is obtained
      after subtraction of 800,000 from the average market value of the
      building. Therefore, LTL 505.00 + 0.055% * (LTL 2,601,200.00 -- LTL
      800,000.00) = LTL 1,459.9. The supplementary payment for registration
      in one day is 100% of the price. So in total the registration costs are:

        been signed and after the utility receives the Certificate from the State
        Energy Inspection which indicates that the internal wiring is successfully
        completed and that the utility works up to the meter are completed as
        well. The meter is installed by AB Lesto and by the same department that
