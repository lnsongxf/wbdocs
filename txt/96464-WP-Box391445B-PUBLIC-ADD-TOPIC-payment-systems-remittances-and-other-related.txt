Cross-border financial activities continue to intensify worldwide, keeping pace with the liberalization of trade and
finance and with the growth of regional economic communities and free-trade zones. This scenario has prompted
authorities and private sector stakeholders in various countries to pursue the integration of their financial infrastruc-
tures. Operators, participants and customers of financial systems, along with regulators and oversight bodies, are all
aware that such initiatives have the potential to produce significant benefits such as cost reduction, improved risk-
management, and extended reach of services. Financial infrastructure integration supports the expansion of trade
and investment flows and ultimately contributes to the deepening and broadening of regional financial and capital
markets.

Yet, several efforts to integrate financial infrastructures across borders have failed to provide many of their expected
benefits and other projects remain non-operational despite the significant amount of time and money invested in
them. Observing that flawed projects are often repeated, even in vastly different country contexts, led the World
Bank to convene an international group of regulators and practitioners - the “G25 Panel of Experts” - to share and
help codify the lessons learned from many experiences of regional, cross-regional, and global integration of financial
infrastructures.

Their first-hand insights are reflected in this report, complemented by the observations of World Bank staff and
others. We hope that they will provide valuable factual and anecdotal input for addressing the challenges to achieve
successful regional integration. The Guidelines for the Successful Regional Integration of Financial Infrastructures
presented in this report have been derived directly from those experiences and insights. They provide a set of practical
steps to assist stakeholders who are considering the merits of regional financial infrastructure integration, as well as
those who are already involved in such efforts.

In publishing this report, I would like to thank the Payment Systems Development Group team led by Massimo
Cirasino, part of the World Bank’s Financial Inclusion and Infrastructure Global Practice. I would particularly like to
recognize the efforts of World Bank staff members Jose Antonio Garcia, Marco Nicolì and Ceu Pereira. Special thanks
go to Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, the Chairperson of the G25 Panel of Experts, and to each of the members of that
panel for their efforts in putting together these guidelines.

1.3 ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT

38. The remainder of the report expands upon the ba-
sic elements and issues covered in this introductory
chapter with regard to the key elements of regional
FI integration and the approaches used in practice to
deal with them. Chapter 2 describes in further detail
the drivers for FI integration and the potential benefits
that may stem from an effort of this kind. Chapter 3
provides an overview and a basic taxonomy of differ-
ent types of regional FI models and actual projects and
initiatives undertaken worldwide. Chapter 4 discusses
the lessons learned from a variety of actual regional
and cross-regional FI integration experiences as to
the barriers, challenges and risks to effective, efficient
and safe FI integration. These lessons form the basis
of the Guidelines for Successful Regional Integration
of Financial Infrastructures, which are then presented
and discussed in detail in Chapter 5. The main report
is supported by a number of annexes providing more
details on several FI projects and initiatives, global
harmonization efforts with regard to the legal and reg-
ulatory framework, an overview of technical standards
relevant for regional FI integration, and a glossary of
selected terms.

come from two different sources: i) a reduction in the                        51. Essentially, liquidity-cost savings are related to the
direct operational cost of a transaction, achieved at                         settlement asset for cross-border transactions and the

             BOX 4: A CURRENCY FOR FINAL SETTLEMENT IN CROSS-BORDER FI ARRANGEMENTS

      In cross-border FI arrangements, the choice of the settlement currency or currencies is crucial for at least two reasons: liquidity
      management and foreign exchange (FX) risk management.

      In general terms, using a single currency for final settlement facilitates the management of these two elements. In a monetary union,
      potential liquidity savings in the cross-border FI arrangement are the greatest as the same currency is used to settle all domestic and
      cross-border regional payments - and even more so if the same FI is used to settle both payment types. Clearly, for all intra-regional
      payments there are no FX risks or FX conversions costs.

      Where there is no single regional currency, a global reserve currency like the US dollar or the Euro will normally be chosen as the
      currency for final settlement, mainly because at least one of these two currencies is highly available in most world regions. FX risk
      and the cost of conversion are typically borne by the originating and beneficiary end-users in the transaction rather than by the direct
      participants in the FI(s) which act as their agents in the value transfer.

      In a somewhat similar arrangement, the settlement scheme of the regional FI can involve a single settlement currency, but that of
      one of the participating countries. Usually, this currency is significantly involved in cross-border trade and financial flows within the
      region and may also be often used as a parallel currency to the local currency in these countries. FX risk and conversion costs tend
      to be borne also by end-user originators and beneficiaries of the cross-border payments – except those domiciled in the country that
      issues the settlement currency.

      In other cases, settlement is denominated in U.S. dollars and/or other global reserve currencies, but it is actually performed in the
      local currencies of the member countries of the cross-border FI. The U.S. dollar (or other) is used only to define the local currency
      value sent from one participating country and the local currency value received in the other member country. FX risks in relation to
      the cross-border FI are minimized where there is a “hard peg” between the local currencies and the reference currency. Where the
      exchange rates are variable, sometimes an applicable rate is announced prior to the opening of settlement and prevails through the
      day. In other cases, real-time or near real-time market-based exchange rates can be assigned to each transaction upon intra-day
      submission and acceptance for settlement. FX risk and conversion costs are still generally passed through to the originating and
      beneficiary end-users.1

         1
           It should be noted that some national payment settlement systems accommodate settlements in one or more foreign currencies under the same platform used for
      settlements in the domestic currency. However, this feature is not related to regional FI integration unless it is associated with the settlement of cross-border transactions.
      Indeed, in some countries this feature has been developed solely for settling purely domestic payments.

130. Although not yet applied in practice, two addi-
tional links models could be the “meta-CCP” and the
“subsidiary CCP”. The “meta-CCP” would be a con-
struction where a third-party acts as a CCP and net-
ting agent to all inter-CCP positions created by the
interoperable link. This model could fit in situations
where there are already more than two CCPs serving a
single market. The “subsidiary CCP” would be an ar-
rangement in which a CCP sets up a subsidiary unit to
operate as a CCP in a jurisdiction in which the CCP
would not otherwise have access. The two CCPs would
then be linked on a peer-to-peer basis. The implemen-
tation of this model may have the potential to reduce
costs for establishing a CCP in a region that is cur-
rently not served, and a reduction of the complexity of
setting up the link since, by definition, many of the key
features between the two CCPs would be harmonized
from the start.

                          BOX 5: MAIN TYPES OF STANDARDS RELEVANT FOR REGIONAL FI INTEGRATION

      The policy standards that promote and facilitate the strengthening of the clearing, settlement and recording mechanisms of monetary
      and other financial transactions. A prime example of global policy standards are the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for FMIs.

      The legal/regulatory standards or regime between the scheme participants covering the multi-lateral or bilateral relations of the scheme
      participants. All trading, clearing and settlement platforms use a rulebook, owned by a scheme management organization or by the plat-
      form involved. Examples of the rulebooks for payments are the SEPA Credit Transfer Rulebook, the SEPA Direct Debit Rulebook, NACHA
      Rulebook, IPF Rulebook and CLS Rulebook, and for securities the LCHClearnet Rulebooks for their clearing arrangements. In addition to
      rulebooks, also master agreements are available, like the ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives transactions. In most regional integra-
      tion projects it is possible to re-use available rulebooks or master agreements.

      The technical standards between the scheme participants and/or the customers of the scheme participants (in the case of end-to-end
      standards), or for the reporting to the public authorities.1 The choice of the technical standards is important to ensure the efficiency of
      processing between the FI and its participants, and with the customers of those participants. Many vendors already have technology
      solutions available based on global standards.2 The choice of a (global) technical standard that suits the purpose of the new FI avoids that
      technical barriers are created for an amendment of the scope or number of participating countries in the FI. In some regional integration
      projects an upgraded (or additional) standard may be required.


        1
           An overview on the relevant technical standards is presented in Annex 7 of this report.
        2
           Product and service solutions are often coordinated around core standards such as ISO 20022, ISO15022, International Bank Account Numbers - IBAN (ISO 13636), and
      International Securities Identification Numbers – ISIN (ISO 6166). Mapping interfaces have been created between their service products, allowing, for example, for STP between
      FIs that use different messaging solutions. Mapping interfaces between proprietary messaging systems into standardized international formats can provide similar benefits.

A. 	 PAYMENT SETTLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURES AND MECHANISMS

ALADI Reciprocal Payments and Credits Agreement


The Reciprocal Payments and Credits Agreement of ALADI was created in August 1982, although its origin can
be traced back to 1965 in the Multilateral Netting System of Reciprocal Payments and Credits. The objective of the
Agreement is to facilitate cross-border payments and trade between member countries, minimizing the use of global
reserve currencies.

In essence, the Agreement consists of a multilateral net payment mechanism supported by a system of reciprocal
credits between the central Banks of the 12 participant countries.113 The clearinghouse is operated by the central bank
of Peru. The multilateral net mechanism is executed every four months: debits recorded in the mechanism – which
correspond to exports made from country A and paid to the exporter by the central bank of country A - are settled
at the end of April, August and December. The Agreement is also supported by a system of guarantees: Convertibility
(of the various domestic currencies into US Dollars, the latter being the sole legal tender to settle transactions in the
Agreement); the Transferability of underlying US dollars through the mechanism; and, Reimbursement between the
participating central banks of all transactions channeled through the Agreement.

During the 1980s, nearly 90% of all intraregional trade was channeled through the ALADI Agreement. This share
started falling since the early 1990s and currently it is a one-digit figure. However, the ALADI Agreement is still con-
sidered relevant as it able to support the continuity of intra-regional trade in cases where one or more of the partici-
pating countries face uncertain economic or political conditions, or other unanticipated upheavals.

Arab Payment System


The Arab Payment System will be specifically designated to clear and settle intra-regional cross-border payments
among the willing participating Arab Monetary Fund member countries. The system will complement, and to a large
extent utilize, the facilities already available in the national payment systems of its participating countries.
This system will not, however, clear and settle purely domestic payments in any of these national systems, nor will it
clear and settle cross-border payments destined to beneficiaries outside the participating countries.

CHATS (www.hkma.gov.hk)


The Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s RTGS systems for Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, Euro and Renminbi Yuan
(RMB) settlement operate on a common CHATS platform that has technical links with the RTGS systems of other
central banks to enable safe and efficient settlement in any of these currencies. For example, the CHATS has been
linked with the Bank Negara Malaysia’s RENTAS and Bank Indonesia’s BI-RTGS to allow PvP settlement between
these national currencies and the USD through the HKMA’s RTGS USD service.

With respect to the link between CHATS RMB and the CNAPS RTGS system operated by the Peoples’ Bank of China,
a real-time technical interface between the two systems is supplemented by a cross-participation account arrange-
ment in which the commercial bank Bank of China (Hong Kong) has settlement accounts in both the CHATS RMB
and CNAPS and acts as settlement agent between the two settlement schemes.

CHATS USD and CHATS EUR use global commercial banks as the settlement banks for payments in these currencies.

CLS Bank International (www.cls-group.com)


The impetus behind the creation of CLS came from regulatory concerns regarding the potential for FX settlement risk
to be a major source of systemic risk. CLS was established in 2002 as a private sector initiative to deliver and operate
a service to mitigate this risk. This is achieved through CLS’ PvP service, which links to the RTGS systems of each
currency CLS settles.

CLS now settles payment instructions in 17 currencies:114 Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, euro,
Hong Kong dollar, Israeli shekel, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone,
Singapore dollar, South African rand, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, British pound sterling and United States dollar.

The CLS community includes the central banks of each participating currency, Settlement Members (direct partici-
pants in CLS) and their third party customers (indirect participants in CLS), nostro agents and Liquidity Providers
(banks that commit to providing liquidity to CLS in a CLS Eligible Currency in certain circumstances). CLS has over
60 Settlement Members from 24 jurisdictions, which in turn have customers in over 80 jurisdictions.

CLS settles payment instructions relating to a variety of FX transactions, including FX spot, FX forwards, FX option
exercises, and FX swaps. Settlement Members submit payment instructions relating to their own FX transactions, or
they may submit payment instructions on behalf of third parties. Once received, payment instructions are authenti-
cated and matched by CLS and stored until the settlement date.115

CLS holds an account at each of the central banks of the 17 currencies it settles. Settlement across the books of CLS
and funding in each of the 17 currencies is final and irrevocable. CLS funding obligations (Pay-ins) are multilaterally

  114
     Currencies have to fulfill the eligibility criteria established by CLS
  115
     Although Settlement Members can submit instructions at any time prior to the settlement date, they generally submit payment instructions to CLS within 30 minutes
of execution of the underlying FX transaction.

netted to significantly reduce the value of required Pay-ins: each day prior to settlement in each currency, CLS cal-
culates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis for each currency, after taking
into consideration all payment instructions of the Settlement Member that are due to settle that day in that currency.
The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all payment instructions is reduced by an average of 96%.

CLS settlement service is supported by a robust and resilient infrastructure within a comprehensive and well-estab-
lished legal framework. At the operational level the settlement service maximizes the benefits of STP processing and
minimizes operational errors and their associated costs. Real-time information on the status of payment instructions
is provided to, and therefore easily monitored by, Settlement Members. Unmatched payment instructions can be fol-
lowed up promptly and corrections made as necessary before settlement.

Gulf Cooperation Council Payment Systems Connections


The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Payment Systems Connections Strategy is a new project between all six GCC
countries,116 expected to be completed by late 2015 or early 2016.

At the current stage, the project will study distinct system options which will be defined on the basis of different levels
of integration between national systems and on the amount of new applications/intelligence required to be built at,
and/or required for implementation into, existing national systems.

For example, this approach may lead to the following system models: i) one fully integrated GCC RTGS system; ii) a
semi-centralized GCC RTGS system, and, iii) a fully distributed system with national systems linked multilaterally.
In this work, the GCC representatives intend to continue studying and adopting proven international experiences in
this area.



B. 	 PAYMENT CLEARING INFRASTRUCTURES

STEP2 (www.ebaclearing.eu)


STEP2 is a centralized Pan European ACH (PE-ACH) for bulk payments in EUR. Established in 2003 to clear cross-
border EUR credit transfer payments for its participating member-banks, it has expanded its services to include clear-
ing of domestic EUR payments for participating banks –primarily in Luxembourg and Italy at present, while Estonia
is in the pipeline – and to include direct debit payments. STEP2 also developed clearing services for SEPA credit
transfer (SCT) and direct debit (SDD) schemes in 2008-09 and replaced its original XCT technical platform, which
was based on MT103+, with an upgraded SEPA-compliant platform in 2011.

STEP2 is a tiered connectivity system involving both direct and indirect participant on its processing platform so it
provides direct routing to beneficiary banks with straight-through processing and automated settlement connectivity,
for settlement, to TARGET2 for its SEPA services and also to Euro1 for certain of its original bulk payment services.

SICA-UEMOA (www.bceao.int)


SICA-UEMOA, which was inaugurated in 2008 by the Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), is a regional
retail payment clearing infrastructure for the West African Economic and Monetary Union. It represents a single
regional scheme with a centralized technical platform in “hub-spoke” form that services a central regional clearing
facility and 8 national clearing facilities in member countries, with many “clearance access” points available across
the region.

SICA-UEMOA clears domestic and intra-regional cross-border payments denominated in West African CFA francs,
including batch files of digitized paper items such as cheques, for all participating banks within the region. Payment
obligations are netted multilaterally, with settlement on BCEAO’s regional RTGS system, STAR-UEMOA.



C. RETAIL PAYMENT TRANSACTION SERVICES

GCC Net (www.gcc-net.net)


The GCC NET is a single ATM network linking all the GCC National Switches. It offers numerous features based on
standards similar to those of other international networks.

A notable aspect is the availability of this ATM switching facility at a reasonable fee. It has also helped lower the ex-
change rate margins between GCC currencies. Further, account settlement between member countries is conducted
directly in those countries’ own currencies, without the need for opening a non-GCC currency account - or even
referring, for settlement purposes, to a non-GCC currency.


D. 	 OTHER INITIATIVES FOR CROSS-BORDER RETAIL PAYMENTS

SEPA (www.sepa.eu)


By the time national currencies in the euro zone were about to be replaced by euro banknotes and coins, it was recog-
nized that despite the launch of European Monetary Union (EMU) and single currency in 1999, the cost of transfer-
ring money across borders remained too high. This absence of progress led the European Commission to call for a
“concerted approach” involving the ESCB, EU institutions and the private sector “to deliver a technically secure and
operational solution as a matter of utmost urgency.” 117

Despite the “concerted effort approach” proposed initially, the European Commission decided to go for a price-fixing
Regulation which was supported by Member States.118 The Regulation established the principle of equality of charges
for payments initially up to €12,500 within Member States (national) and between Member States (cross-border).

60	                                                                                                           REGIONAL INTEGRATION GUIDELINES




The obligation to apply the same charges to national and cross-border payments created the need for the banking
industry to deploy EU-wide plans and infrastructures in order to cut the costs and improve the service levels. In order
to respond to this challenge, the banking industry created the European Payments Council (EPC). The preamble of
the EPC charter states the industry’s vision of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in 2002.119

During the five years which followed the coming into force of the price-fixing Regulation and the creation of the EPC,
European instances and the EPC worked in parallel to pave the way for SEPA. From 2002 to 2007, the EPC estab-
lished the rules and practices for the new payment schemes and selected the standards to be applied. It also created
and tested the new SEPA products. The European Commission supported the work of the EPC by adopting a legal
framework underpinning an integrated retail payments market.120 Member States also started their preparations for
SEPA, by setting-up national implementation and migration bodies, tasked to prepare the roll-out of the new SEPA
instruments, standards, and infrastructures.

The EPC launched the SEPA Credit Transfer Scheme in January 2008 and the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme in November
2009121, allowing banks to gradually offer these SEPA products to their customers. It also adopted the SEPA card
framework to enhance interoperability, improve transparency and remove other barriers to the development of a
SEPA for Cards.

The adoption of SEPA products had been nevertheless very slow: By August 2010 only 9.26% of all credit transfers
processed in the euro area were SEPA credit transfers, while SEPA direct debits remained at a share well below 0.1%
of all direct debit transactions processed in the euro area. Taking this into account and the need for the banks to of-
fer both SEPA products, the industry called upon policy-makers to adopt an “end date” for national schemes and
standards.

The “end date Regulation”, Regulation 260/2012 was adopted in March 2012, requiring that banks and payment in-
stitutions and their customers and CSMs should have implemented the standards (IBAN as account identifier and
ISO20022 for the messaging) of the SCT and SDD Rulebooks for euro payments at the latest before 1 February 2014.
All schemes which do not offer their customers the possibility to do “SEPA compliant” transactions will have to
disappear.122

The pace of adoption of SCTs has now accelerated considerably, representing 64.1% of all credit transfers processed
in the euro area as at end-November 2013. Adoption of SDDs remains somewhat slow though, at 26.0% of all direct
debit transactions processed in the euro area as at the same date.


   119
       The preamble says that members “share the common vision that Euroland payments are domestic payments; join forces to implement this vision for the benefit of cus-
tomers, industry and banks and accordingly launch our Single Payments Area.”
   120
       The Commission issued a legislative proposal in 2005 (Proposal for a Directive on Payment Services, December 2005), which was adopted by Member States in November
2007 and came into force in December 2007.
   121
       The EPC is responsible for the development and maintenance of SEPA payment schemes as defined in the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) and SEPA Direct Debit (SDD)
Rulebooks. The rulebooks can be regarded as instruction manuals which provide a common understanding on how to move funds within SEPA. The schemes are based on
technical standards defined by bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization.
   122
       On January 9, 2014, the European Commission proposed an additional transition period of 6 months for those payment services users who are yet to migrate. In practice
this means the deadline for migration remains February 1, 2014 but payments that differ from a SEPA format could continue to be accepted until August 1, 2014. For additional
information see: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-6_en.htm

Today, SEPA already enables customers to make cashless euro payments to anyone located anywhere in Europe, us-
ing a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments as easily, efficiently and safely as they make
payments in the domestic context.123 About 4500 banks joined the SEPA CT Scheme. For the SEPA Core DD Scheme
more than 3800 banks have signed up, and about 3400 banks for the SEPA Business to Business Direct Debit Scheme.




   123
       Customers can make electronic euro payments within and across 33 countries under the same basic rights and obligations. SEPA consists of the 28 EU Member States,
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco.

A. 	 SECURITIES TRADING INFRASTRUCTURES

ASEAN Trading Link (www.asiaetrading.com)


The first stage of the ASEAN Trading Link began operations in 2012 by linking the stock exchanges in Malaysia and
Singapore, with the exchange in Thailand soon to link-up. Exchanges in the Philippines, Indonesia and Viet Nam are
also scheduled to participate in the Trading Link.

The ASEAN Trading Link is an electronic hub-spoke arrangement with SunGard providing the central operating
facility – the Intra-ASEAN Network (IAN) – for the Trading Link. There are sponsoring brokers in each member ex-
change that facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-exchange orders that are submitted directly from the originating
broker to the executing exchange through the Trading Link. The IAN also provides an entry point for non-ASEAN
investors and for FIX-based infrastructures and the SunGard Global Network.

There are two ways to connect. For cross-exchange orders placed with a local member dealer, that dealer uses its ex-
change’s interface, called ASEAN Common Exchange, to IAN to route orders to the order matching system of another
ASEAN exchange, which then acknowledges and fills the order, confirms the trade and provides relevant market data
back through the ACE and IAN interfaces. Interfaces use the FIX protocol and standards. Another interface, available
to international clients seeking to connect directly, called Neutral Access Point, is intended as another gateway. The
connection is via Singapore, but still requires designation of correspondent dealers and custodial accounts in each
securities jurisdiction

CEESEG (www.ceeseg.com)


The Central and Eastern Europe Exchange Group (CEESEG) is a holding company owned jointly by the Vienna Stock
Exchange and Austrian banks that, in turn, owns stock exchange in Vienna (Austria), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Prague
(Czech Republic) and Budapest (Hungary).

While each exchange operates separately within its own jurisdiction, CEESEG Holding is responsible for strategic and
financial management and joint administration. Organized in 2009, the operational plan is to harmonize trading and
service schemes, establish a common trading platform (i.e., XETRA), provide cross-membership among all member
exchanges, and introduce a common clearing system and CCP service. Listed securities on each member exchange
will be registered in the respective national CSDs as required by law with links to the common clearing CCP. CEESEG
also has links to exchanges in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Romania.

MILA (www.mercadoointegrado.com)


The Latin American Integrated Market (MILA), which began operations in mid-2011, links together the stock ex-
changes in Colombia, Chile and Peru. The project involved a two-stage process that began in late 2010 with an auto-
mated router model – the FIX message routing network - providing participants on one member exchange with access
to securities listed on another of the member exchanges. Phase two, finalized at the end of 2011, allows individual
investors direct access to the market information in all 3 countries through their local brokers.

Although networked together at the broker and infrastructure levels, the trading infrastructures are not merged into a
single regional entity, nor do they operate on a common or even uniform trading platform or scheme. However, there
are common trade transparency protocols and standards via the FIX solutions, for cross-border pre-trade, trade and
post-trade information. Also, the member countries do not have uniform regulatory, tax or foreign capital regimes.
There are agreements on the need to achieve some harmonization in these policy areas, but with no firm deadlines as
of yet for their implementation.

With no regional currency, trades settle in the local currency of the securities’ custody accounts, which is also gener-
ally the same location of the exchange on which the securities are transacted.

Costa Rica, Mexico and Panama have also indicated an interest in joining MILA.



B. 	 CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORIES AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT 		
	SYSTEMS

Euroclear (www.euroclear.com)


The Euroclear group comprises the national CSDs of Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and
the UK, together with Euroclear Bank which specializes in cross-border settlement and related activities; Euroclear
Bank is known as an international CSD. The parent company is owned and governed by users of the FI and the group
seeks to meet the needs of the users for efficient and low-risk post-trade services.

The merger of Euroclear Bank with various European CSDs offered both the opportunity to take advantage of econo-
mies of scale by sharing activities and costs, and the prospect of moving towards a more consolidated settlement
structure in Europe. The first objective has been achieved, but the second has been only partly achieved. Three suc-
cessful forms of integration within the group can be distinguished:125 the sharing of common services; the integration
of CSDs through the use of a single settlement platform while retaining separate governance arrangements; and, a
fully integrated approach for CSDs in two countries.




    Euroclear also provides some of the benefits of integration by offering links and services with other parties, such as the Hong Kong/Malaysian service

64	                                                                                                  REGIONAL INTEGRATION GUIDELINES




The Euroclear group shares as much of its services as possible across the group’s individual CSDs. In particular,
IT development and IT operations are common to most entities.126 This allows the development of highly robust
systems. For example, the group operates two fully synchronized live data centers and a third live, but distant, data
center to provide protection against a regional disaster. This level of protection would be likely to be uneconomic for
a single CSD in the group. In addition, common services like finance, human resources, audit and risk are fully or
partly shared.

A higher level of integration has been achieved in the “ESES” CSDs.127 The three CSDs of Belgium, France and the
Netherlands jointly developed a single settlement platform, which provides a common technical approach in those
three separate jurisdictions supported by common operations teams. The platform covers settlement, custody, asset
servicing and issuer services. To achieve this, it was necessary to increase the degree of harmonization of market
practices and rules across the three markets. The fact that local equities were traded on the same exchange (Euronext)
provided added incentive to find common solutions. Settlement is fully harmonized from a process point of view, and
other services are becoming more harmonized through changes in law and in market practice. Although the three
CSDs share a common management team and have board members in common, they retain separate governance and
regulatory arrangements. They have, however, been able to capture many of the synergies and client benefits of a full
merger.

The UK and Ireland, by contrast, share a single CSD operating a single settlement system offering settlement, corpo-
rate actions and related services. This is possible because of the near equivalence of market practice and legal struc-
tures between the two countries.128 Although transfers of title to Irish securities are governed by Irish law and those of
British securities by English law in the system operated by Euroclear UK & Ireland (EUI), they can each be effected by
the same technical system. Ireland’s users are able to have a highly robust CSD with low unit costs by sharing the UK’s
infrastructure. The UK’s users gain access to euro settlement in central bank money. Both countries and their users
gain from the arrangement. While EUI has a single board, management and operating system it maintains separate
Market Advisory Committees in Ireland and the UK, consisting of representatives from each local market, which help
determine the strategy and prioritization of service developments for each country.

Euroclear has sought to develop common solutions whenever possible but found that this is constrained by the degree
of harmonization achievable. It developed a single platform program which offered the vision of a common techni-
cal platform across all group entities, which might also have been made available to all European CSDs. The internal
positioning engine, the Single Settlement Engine (SSE), was delivered first. The SSE does the core booking activity of
identifying the securities which can settle on a DvP basis, but is not directly visible to clients. The single settlement
platform for ESES, which includes the “front end” interface with market participants, was delivered next in the three
markets mentioned earlier. However, the ambition to deliver a single platform to cover all custody and corporate ac-
tions aspects of securities management however, was stopped because there was insufficient harmonization of law and

   126
       The Nordic CSDs of Euroclear Sweden and Euroclear Finland share IT and other resources and use fewer of the group’s shared services, although
the degree of sharing is increasing over time.

   128
       EUI, in fact, also acts as the CSD for securities issued in, and under the laws of, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The same argument applies
that the market practices and laws in the relevant jurisdictions are sufficiently similar to be able to use the same technical solution for securities transac-
tion settlement.

practice which created too much complexity in design to be cost effective. Similarly, the idea that the single settle-
ment platform might be extended to all CSDs in the group and beyond was dropped because there was no reasonable
prospect of sufficient harmonization in a commercially viable timeframe. The current approach therefore is to pursue
regional integration where the market environment gives sufficient chance of success and to seek to provide local
services in as harmonized a way as possible where full integration is not feasible.

HKMA’s Pilot Platform for the Settlement of Cross-Border Securities Trades


Early in 2012, under the auspices of the Pan Asian CSD Alliance, which was formed under the ASEAN +3 initiative
to further the development of Asian bond markets (Asia Bond Market Initiative, ABMI), the HKMA launched a ‘pi-

Euroclear, the HKMA CMU, and BNM’s RENTAS.129 The scheme calls for a common centralized securities database
operated by Euroclear and technical operating links among the three systems through Euroclear as the connectivity
hub. The scheme also incorporates the technical links between the HKMA CMU and HKMA CHATS USD, Euro and
RMB and a link between BNM’s RENTAS and CHATS USD.130 The structure is illustrated in Figure 6.

force to examine the feasibility and benefits, costs and risks relating to different regional integration and settlement
architectures as an alternative to a region-wide distributed bilateral CSD (spaghetti) network model.

One variant could be a distributed network model with a centralized regional operations hub linking national CSDs
of participating countries, which would not involve regionally centralized settlement of cross-border bond transac-
tions. The other model is similar to the HKMA’s pilot platform but would involve a regional Asian CSD interlinking
the various national CSDs in a common platform, to provide common pre-trade, trade, post-trade and settlement
services. These CSDs would still be separate legal entities in their respective countries. Yet another variant would
be a single regional CSD in which custody banks and broker-dealers participate directly rather than through their
national CSDs. Another variant of this model under consideration is a truly regional ICSD in which custody banks
and broker-dealers may participate directly rather than through a local CSD. The implications of various barriers that
would affect any or all of these models are also examined in the feasibility study.

SADC Cross-Border DVP Settlement for Public Debt Securities (www.sadc.int)


The cash leg of financial markets instruments issued in SADC countries and traded across borders within the region
is being analyzed in the context of overall strategic framework of the SADC Payments Project, as per the instruction
of the SADC Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG).

The business model and process flows for DVP-based settlement of intra-SADC cross-border trading of public debt
securities will be based on the following principles, developed together with the Committee of SADC Stock Exchanges
and the CCBG Financial Markets sub-Committee:

•	    Settlement in central bank money (SIRESS)

•	    Cash and debt instrument exchanged at the same instance

•	    Settlement accounts at SIRESS must be pre-funded

•	    All buyers and sellers appoint settlement agents (banks)

•	    Central banks provide custodial services, but this can be provided by the private sector

•	    Current domestic processes are maintained

•	    International policy and regulatory standards (CPSS/IOSCO) are adopted

•	    International messaging standards are applied

•	    The complete model is depicted in Figure 7:

T2S (www.ecb.europa.eu)


Target 2 Securities (T2S) is a project of the Eurosystem aiming at creating by 2015 a single securities settlement plat-
form in Europe and providing European CSDs with a centralized service for delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settle-
ment of transactions in central bank money. T2S will operate as an integrated model, thereby holding on the same
platform both cash and securities accounts. Therefore, CSDs which join T2S will be “outsourcing” their settlement
processes to T2S, but will retain all their other functions and relations with their clients, including keeping securities
records and undertaking corporate actions according to the relevant local rules and regulations.

Market participants will need to have a legal relationship with a CSD in order to use T2S and only CSDs enter into a
legal relationship with T2S. The national central banks (NCB) will hold central bank money accounts for CSD cus-
tomers on the T2S platform, so that the DVP settlement of securities transactions will exclusively take place in central
bank money. T2S will therefore connect any securities account at any participating CSD with any cash account at any
participating central bank. All changes in the balances of cash and securities accounts, regardless of which CSD or
NCB they belong to, are made in real time.

The NCB accounts held on the T2S platform will be dedicated to settlement purposes only and will be linked to the
cash accounts in the respective RTGS systems. For the settlement in euro, the T2S platform will be linked to the
TARGET2 system, also operated by the Eurosystem.




                                                                                                                Annex 3
68	                                                                                                           REGIONAL INTEGRATION GUIDELINES




While initiated by the Eurosystem, T2S will be a multicurrency system. Therefore, it will not be limited to the euro but
also be open to process DVP settlement in non-euro currencies if non-euro central banks are interested to connect to
the platform. Danmarks Nationalbank signed the Currency Participation Agreement on 20 June 2012 and will make
the Danish krone available in T2S as of 2018. 131

T2S will not only foster the integration of the settlement market in the Eurosystem but also beyond by introducing
a single set of rules, standards and tariffs for all the transactions processed by contrast to the current fragmented
European environment composed of over 30 different SSSs. Thus, T2S will prompt the adoption of a common set of
rules for intraday settlement finality and a harmonized daily timetable and calendar.

Regarding standards, T2S will be based on the use of a common interface and common message standards. T2S will
consequently contribute to reduce the Giovannini Barriers 1 (national differences in information technology and
systems), 2 (national clearing and settlement restrictions that require the use of multiple systems), 3 (differences in
national rules relating to corporate actions, beneficial ownership and custody), 4 (absence of intraday settlement
finality), 5 (practical impediments to remote access to national clearing and settlement systems) and 7 (national dif-
ferences in operating hours and settlement deadlines).

Liquidity Alliance
(http://www.clearstream.com/ci/dispatch/en/kir/ci_nav/3_gsf/045_liquidity_alliance)


The Liquidity Alliance is an example of an industry-led FI cross-border integration initiative which aims to deliver
common solutions to industry-wide collateral management issues. The network was established in January 2013 by
Australian financial market infrastructure group ASX, Brazilian CSD CETIP, Clearstream, the Spanish CSD Iberclear
and the South African CSD Strate. These five market infrastructures have decided to use the same collateral technol-
ogy system and to share their expertise, experience and efforts in creating a sustainable global response to growing
demands for sophisticated collateral management without introducing new systemic risks to the industry.

The fundamental goal of the solution is to strengthen local markets by enabling financial infrastructure providers to
offer their market participants sophisticated, state-of-the-art collateral management services. Synergies, cost efficien-
cies and a short time-to-market (12-18 months until the launch of a collateral management system for any given
domestic market) can be achieved through the use of the common collateral technology system.

The collateral remains on local domestic accounts of the market participants (i.e. in the books of the Liquidity Alliance
members) and is governed by local rules and regulations. This avoids the introduction of new systemic risks and en-
sures the liquidity remains in the local market (i.e. it is not transferred to other intermediary providers). Due to the
common collateral system, the Liquidity Alliance members have the option – not the obligation – to easily pursue
joint opportunities where business, legal and regulatory circumstances are favorable. For example, this is the case for
cross-border collateral (inbound and outbound) because the common collateral technology can identify collateral
availability as well as collateral needs on a real-time basis across all connected markets.

   131
       The Currency Participation Agreement is the contractual basis for non-euro central banks’ participation in T2S. The central banks having signed the Currency Participa-
tion Agreement will be involved in the T2S governance to ensure that they retain control over their currency.

The use of collateral can thereby be optimized and fully tracked across markets, time zones and exposure types.
Market participants benefit from these fully automated allocation processes as they help overcome issues resulting
from fragmentation.132

The open architecture of the system means that the Liquidity Alliance is set to grow. The Canadian CSD CDS and
the Singapore Exchange SGX have publicly announced their intention to leverage the same collateral management
platform and, accordingly, to follow the path of the Liquidity Alliance. Further market infrastructures are expected
to follow this example.

       The fragmentation of holdings across several locations itself cannot be changed much as it is a result of business, legal and regulatory requirements.

                         ANNEX 8: GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS

This glossary includes only those terms deemed especially relevant in the context of integration of financial infra-
structures across borders. Definitions were taken from CPSS, A Glossary of Terms used in Payment and Settlement
Systems, March 2003, and the European Central Bank’s glossary of payments and markets available at www.ecb.int.
Terms marked with “*” were defined by the Secretariat. For general definitions of terms not found in this glossary
please refer to the CPSS and ECB documents/websites.

Central counterparty link: An arrangement between two central counterparties (CCPs) that allows the provision of
central counterparty services for trades performed by the participants of those two CCPs, without requiring those
participants to become members of both CCPs.

Central securities depository link: A set of technical and legal arrangements between two central securities deposi-
tories (CSDs) for the cross-system transfer of securities.

Collateral management: Collateral management includes the process used to control the correspondence between
the market value of the relevant collateral and the required value of that collateral. It generally also includes the gen-
eration and processing of collateral transfers.

Correspondent banking: An arrangement whereby one bank (the settlement or service-providing bank) makes or
receives payments (potentially performing other banking services in addition) on behalf of another bank (the cus-
tomer or user bank).

Cross-border payment: A payment where the financial institutions of the payer and the payee are located in different
countries.

Cross-border settlement: Settlement that takes place in a country (or currency area) in which one or both parties to
the transaction are not located.

Cross-margining agreement: An agreement among CCPs to consider positions and supporting collateral at their
respective organizations as a common portfolio for participants that are members of two or more of the organizations.

Currency peg*: A mechanism in which a country’s financial and/or monetary authorities try to maintain the coun-
try’s currency value constant in terms of another asset, like another currency, a basket of currencies or a fixed weight
of gold, for example. In a hard peg, a currency’s price is held permanently at a fixed level. In a soft peg, a currency’s
price is returned to the predefined parity at regular intervals (e.g. monthly, weekly). In a crawling peg, a currency’s
price is fixed based on prescheduled changes.

Direct link: An account opened by a CSD, referred to as the “investor CSD”, in the books of another CSD, referred to
as the “issuer CSD”, in order to facilitate the transfer of securities from participants in the issuer CSD to participants
in the investor CSD.


                                                                                                                Annex 8
82	                                                                           REGIONAL INTEGRATION GUIDELINES




EMV: An acronym describing the set of specifications developed by the consortium EMVCo, which is promoting
the global standardization of electronic financial transactions – in particular the global interoperability of chip cards.
“EMV” stands for “Europay, MasterCard and Visa”.

Financial infrastructure*: A legal or functional entity organized to provide multilateral transaction and post-trans-
action services for payments, securities, derivatives and other financial transactions. The definition of an FI is con-
ceptually similar to a financial market infrastructure, but is functionally broader in scope, referring also to trading
systems for securities, derivatives and foreign exchange as well as shared transaction systems for payments, such as
traditional ATM and POS card payment networks and more modern on-line payment and mobile-payment networks.

Financial infrastructure scheme*: A common framework for transacting, clearing and settling transactions, includ-
ing operating rules, business practices and standards, participation requirements and funding schemes, among others.

Financial market infrastructure: A multilateral system among participating institutions including the operator of
the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial
transactions.

Gap analysis*: A technique that businesses use to determine what steps need to be taken in order to move from the
current state to the desired, future state. Also called “need-gap analysis”, “needs analysis”, and “needs assessment”.

Global custodian: A custodian that provides its customers with custody services in respect of securities traded and
settled in several countries around the world.

Horizontal integration*: A set of contractual and operational agreements connecting two or more FIs in parallel
roles. For example, a CSD with a CSD, or a payment settlement infrastructure with another payment settlement
infrastructure.

Hub-spoke arrangement*: An arrangement in which all transaction traffic moves along spokes connected to the hub
at the center. The hub is a single centralized operation center. The nodes are the points of delivery and the spokes are
the communication routes between the nodes and the hub. There are variations, but in its most simple form, there
are no point to point routes directly between nodes and all transaction traffic must go through the hub and then out
again.

International Bank Account Number (IBAN): An International Organization for Standardization (ISO) technical
code that is an expanded version of the basic bank account number (BBAN). Intended for use internationally, the
IBAN uniquely identifies an individual account at a specific financial institution in a particular country. The IBAN
also includes the bank identifier of the financial institution servicing that account.

International central securities depository (ICSD): A CSD which was originally set up to settle Eurobond trades
and is now active also in the settlement of internationally traded securities from various domestic markets, typically
across currency areas. At present, there are two ICSDs located in EU countries: Clearstream Banking in Luxembourg
and Euroclear Bank in Belgium.

Interoperability: The set of arrangements/procedures that allows participants in different systems to conduct and
settle payments or securities transactions across systems while continuing to operate only in their own respective
systems.

Link*: A set of contractual and operational arrangements between two or more financial infrastructures that connects
them directly or through an intermediary.

Oversight: The oversight of payment systems is a typical central bank function whereby the objectives of safety and
efficiency are promoted by monitoring existing and planned systems, assessing them against the applicable standards
and principles whenever possible and, where necessary, fostering change. Oversight activities increasingly relate also
to securities clearing and settlement systems.

Pan-European automated clearing house (PE-ACH): A business platform for the processing of euro payment in-
struments which is made up of governance rules and payment practices and supported by the necessary technical
platform(s).

Payment versus payment (PvP): A mechanism which ensures that the final transfer of a payment in one currency
occurs if – and only if – the final transfer of a payment in another currency or currencies takes place.

Regional integration*: A process in which states enter in a region enter into an agreement in order to enhance
regional cooperation through regional institutions and rules. The objectives of the agreement can range from eco-
nomic to political, environmental and several others Typically, commercial interests have been the focus for achieving
broader objectives.

Remote access: Direct access by an institution established in one country to a system (e.g. a payment system, a securi-
ties settlement system or a CCP) established in another country.

Settlement agent (settlement institution): The institution across whose books transfers between participants take
place in order to achieve settlement within a settlement system.

Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA): A process initiated by European banks and supported, inter alia, by the
Eurosystem and the European Commission with a view to integrating retail payment systems and transforming the
euro area into a true domestic market for the payment industry.

WOT analysis: Is a structured planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and
Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or
project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving that objective.
Trade repository: An entity that maintains a centralized electronic record (database) of transaction data.

Vertical integration*: A set of contractual and operational agreements connecting two or more FIs in sequential
roles. For example, an ACH with a payment settlement infrastructure, or a trading system with a CSD-SSS.
