THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Obtain legal certificate of ownership

        Before the Finance Law of 2006, it was not possible to obtain a property
        title for undeveloped lands. A legalized copy of the deed of transfer
        (acte de cession) was required. In addition to the owner's copy, two
   1    additional copies are usually kept at the mayor's office. The site plan is    2 days          XOF 1,500
        not usually attached to the deed of transfer.

        Obtain site plan (plan de situation)

        The site plan is also required by the water (SEEN) and electricity
        (NIGELEC) companies. The site plan costs FCFA 1,000.00 and must be
   2    accompanied by a FCFA 100.00 stamp.                                           2 days          XOF 1,100

        Obtain building permit from the Municipality

        The application file for a building permit is reviewed by the nine
        members of a commission that meets twice every month. If the
        commission meets the day after the file was submitted, authorization
        may be given that same day. Members of the commission include
        representatives from the tax authorities, the Ministry of Urban Planning
        (Ministère d’Urbanisme), the fire and safety agency (Service Sapeurs-        30 days        XOF 675,300

        Pompiers), and the cadastre.

        According to Article 17 of Order No. 59-113 (Ordonnance 59-113,
        Article 17), 3 copies of the following documents must be submitted:
        applicant's identity card; copies of the property title duly stamped; site
        plans (plan de situation); ground plan (plan de masse); plumping plans;
        and electrical plans. Thirty days is the legal time limit for issuance. In
        reality, however, the waiting time depends on the degree of follow-up.

      Most practitioners contact each member of the committee separately
      to expedite the process. Without follow-up, the permit might be
      obtained within 6 months or longer (if at all). With connections, it can
      be obtained in one week.

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to
