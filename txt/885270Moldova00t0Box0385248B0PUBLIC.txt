I. Objectives

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Moldova
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Moldova regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Moldova;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Moldova;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Moldova; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Moldova.

       Use data to help inform the Moldova country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In July-August 2012, 378 stakeholders of the World Bank in Moldova were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs, including
community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 303
stakeholders participated in the country survey (80%).

Respondents received questionnaires via post, courier, or email and returned them accordingly,
or completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Moldova; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World
Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the
Bank’s future role in Moldova; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in
Moldova.

A. General Issues facing Moldova: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Moldova is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, which areas would contribute most to economic growth and better
   standards of living in Moldova, and which sectors should the Government prioritize in order
   to help reverse the migration of citizens out of Moldova.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Moldova, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Moldova, with which groups the Bank should
   collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Moldova, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Moldova’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across twenty-two development areas, such as economic growth,
   governance and anti corruption, job creation, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Moldova’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Moldova: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Moldova’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Moldova.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Moldova, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 194 respondents (78% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2008 and the 251 respondents (84% response rate) who completed the survey in FY
2003. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the Prime
       Minister were combined with respondents from the office of Minister;
       consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects were combined with
       respondents from PMUs; respondents from trade unions were combined with those from
       NGOs and CBOs; and the few respondents from the office of Parliamentarian and local
       government officials were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no

       Responses across both geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in the Appendix (see page 81). Only significant differences between geographic locations
        in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
     Across all respondents, familiarity with the World Bank received a mean rating of 6.8; this
      was significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’03 country survey (7.3) and
      statistically similar to the mean rating received in the FY ’08 country survey (7.1).
            Respondents from independent government institutions and PMUs/consultants/
             contractors on Bank supported projects indicated the highest levels of familiarity
             whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and NGOs/CBOs/trade
             unions indicated significantly lower levels.
            It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
             significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
             effectiveness in Moldova, the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and

       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across fifteen of these twenty-two areas. For the most part, respondents from independent
        government institutions, PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank supported projects, and
        private sector organizations/financial sector/private banks had the highest ratings across
        these areas whereas respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks and
        “other” organizations tended to have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness across these areas. Those areas with significant stakeholder group
        differences were:
             “Information and communications technology”;
             “Gender and equality of opportunities”;
             “Agriculture and rural development”;
             “Economic growth”;
             “Education”;

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across two of these
        twenty-two areas. In both instances, respondents from Chisinau had significantly lower
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas than respondents from other
        locations. Those areas with significant differences were:
             “Climate change and environmental sustainability”; and
             “Research and development”.

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Moldova, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Moldova. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Economic growth;
             Business environment deregulation and private sector development; and
             Trade and exports.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Moldova, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Economic growth;
                Job creation/employment;
                Poverty reduction;
                Trade and exports; and
                Education.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates
The World Bank’s Work in Moldova
        Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
         that the World Bank’s programs and strategies are realistic for Moldova compared to
         respondents from the FY ’08 country survey.
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement
         regarding all of these aspects of the Bank’s work in Moldova. For the most part,
         respondents from independent government institutions, PMUs/consultants/contractors on
         Bank supported projects, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the private sector tended to
         have the highest levels of agreement with these statements, whereas respondents from
         “other” organizations tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.
        There were significant differences between two geographic locations. Respondents from
         Chisinau had significantly lower levels of agreement that the Bank currently plays a
         relevant role in development in Moldova and treats its clients and stakeholders with

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
Overall Perceptions
         Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher levels of agreement
          that working with the Bank increases Moldova’s institutional capacity compared to
          respondents from the FY ’08 country survey. Respondents in this year’s country survey
          also had significantly higher levels of agreement that the World Bank disburses funds
          promptly compared to respondents from the FY ’03 country survey.
         There were significant stakeholder group differences in their levels of agreement across
          all of these aspects of how the Bank operates, except that the Bank provides effective
          implementation support and makes appropriate use of country systems. Respondents
          from independent government institutions and PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank
          supported projects tended to have the highest levels of agreement with these statements
          whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and “other” organizations
          tended to have significantly lower levels of agreement.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
       Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly higher ratings for the Bank
        being an effective development partner in terms of straightforwardness and honesty and
        staff accessibility compared to respondents from the FY ’03 country survey.
       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across five of these
        aspects: straightforwardness and honesty, following through over time, responsiveness,
        inclusiveness, and collaboration with groups outside of the Government. Respondents
        from independent government institutions and the private sector tended to have the
        highest ratings for these five aspects whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral
        agencies and “other” organizations tended to have significantly lower ratings.
       There were significant differences between two geographic locations. Respondents from
        Chisinau gave significantly lower ratings for responsiveness, inclusiveness, collaboration
        with groups outside of the Government, and flexibility (products and services; changing
        country circumstances) than respondents from other geographic areas.
