Foreword
Many IFC clients, including those highlighted in this report, are directly
impacting low income people. These clients have incorporated the
‘base of the economic pyramid’ into their value chains in a variety
                                                                             Shared
of ways. IFC has committed over $11 billion to more than 400 such
companies in just the past ten years and is proud to help them grow.
                                                                             Prosperity
What our inclusive business clients have achieved is even more
remarkable given that the world is increasingly being shaped by
                                                                             through
demographic dynamics and slow growth. Overall economic and
income growth sharply decelerated following the global financial crisis
                                                                             Inclusive
of 2008-9 and the pace of structural reform has since been uneven.
Rising inequality in many countries is now a serious concern, while the
unprecedented pace of poverty reduction over the last three decades

                                                                             COMPANIES REACH
Against this macroeconomic backdrop, however, there remain                   THE BASE OF
plenty of untapped growth opportunities, especially given current            THE PYRAMID
technological advances. These advances could enable billions of
people at the base of the economic pyramid to join the modern global
economy. At IFC, we believe in the critical role that the private sector
can play to realize people’s dreams by creating jobs and markets
where these did not previously exist and by making goods and services
accessible to low-income customers, often for the first time.


More work is needed. Our mission will not be complete until people
everywhere have the opportunity to achieve the same levels of
productivity and life satisfaction. Narrowing the gap in economic
conditions between the most advanced countries and emerging
markets is critical to achieving the goals that we have laid out as the
World Bank Group — ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 
IFC is committed to achieving these goals and to accelerating the
spread of inclusive, commercially viable business models.

          economic pyramid” (BOP) at various points along the value chain for strategic reasons.
          IFC has invested in hundreds of such companies, which we call “inclusive businesses.”
These companies have achieved commercial sustainability and growth while benefiting the poor.

Dairy farming is a fragmented, home-based industry in
Pakistan. Approximately eight million families, spread
across hundreds of thousands of square kilometers,
earn their livelihoods through dairy farming. Each farm
has an average of 2 to 5 cows or buffalo.


Engro Foods Limited (EFL), Pakistan’s second-largest
producer of processed milk, has brought 300,000 of
these farmers into its supply chain by creating a
vast village-level direct procurement infrastructure.
EFL aggregates 85 percent of its suppliers through
1,800 milk collection centers (MCCs). The MCCs
are situated within an average of 2 kilometers from
farmers’ homes, so that they can be reached by foot
or by local transport. Around 300 square feet in size,
the MCCs contain chilling tanks, basic laboratories,
and geysers. Each MCC collects approximately 400
liters of milk every day.                                     management information system. The magnetic

KENYA TEA DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (KTDA),
KENYA


Kenya Tea Development Agency Ltd. (KTDA) is one
of the largest tea companies in the world. It is made
up of over 550,000 tea farmers, typically working
on less than half-acre plots. Established in 2000,
KTDA procures tea from the farmers, processes it,
and supplies it to Europe, Asia, North Africa, and the
Middle East.


KTDA offers comprehensive services for its
tea farmers including training, provision of
inputs, transportation, processing, marketing,
and access to finance. KTDA’s training activities
are designed to enhance the sustainability of
farmers’ production practices and contribute to the
sustainability of the overall value chain. KTDA uses
two training methods: farmer field schools (FFSs) and
a lead farmer approach.                                       conduct farm-level inspections prior to farm audits.

Solution: Facilitating Access to Finance
Farmers may need short-term loans or cash advances to pay for inputs, labor, or transportation,
and longer-term financing for capital improvements to enhance productivity and quality. Loans
can be made to individuals or to groups. In areas where social ties are strong, producer groups
may guarantee individual loans. Companies can facilitate access to finance through the following
mechanisms:


DIRECT LENDING:                                                  THIRD-PARTY FINANCING:

BANKAOOL, MEXICO


Bankaool was created in 2005 when Agroindustrias
Unidas de Mexico (SA AMSA), the Mexican subsidiary
of ECOM, an international commodity trading
company, decided to spin off its supplier financing
division. Before this, SA AMSA had financed suppliers
directly for more than 50 years.


Bankaool offers farmers short-term working
capital loans and medium-term loans for capital
expenditure. Bankaool’s rates are lower than those
offered by traders and processors who finance their
suppliers directly, and much lower than those of most
microfinance institutions. Almost 99 percent of its
clients have monthly incomes of less than $1,200,
and 80 percent have not previously had access to
formal financial services.
                                                                Bankaool has relationships with 15 buyers, enabling

Insight: Finding the Right Mix of Solutions

             ompanies working with BOP suppliers must understand differences across their supplier
             bases and develop the right mix of solutions to optimize their supply chains. Developing
             a deeper understanding of the company’s suppliers boosts business efficiency, improves
decision-making, reduces risk, promotes loyalty, and enhances a firm’s overall ability to compete
and innovate. To do this, companies use surveys, focus groups, and other methods to gather
insights and improve operations, tailor supplier services, identify new service areas, and test
delivery approaches — and then start the process all over again in ongoing feedback loops. In
agriculture, these feedback loops can help companies identify farmers who are ready to adopt
new agricultural techniques or leverage financing, design relevant offerings, and continuously
improve them over time. These insights include:

Solution: Reducing Costs
Affordability is the most important issue for BOP customers; the price of a product or service is
a critical hurdle for customers with limited incomes. However, reducing the cost of a product
or service must be done while maintaining a strong value proposition. Companies can develop
lower-cost products and services through:

Engaging BOP Customers:
Product and Service Development




Solution: Matching Customer Cash Flows
In addition to value and cost, a third consideration for companies that develop products and
services for BOP markets is customer cash flow. BOP customer incomes are relatively low, and
also fluctuate, sometimes in unpredictable ways. This can make large purchases and long-term
commitments especially hard. Companies can design products and services that account for cash
flow fluctuations.1 They can do this in two primary ways:


AFFORDABLE SIZES:                                                 INCREMENTAL ITEMS:

Solution: Leveraging Retailers
BOP customers need access to products and services in their own communities as they lack
the time and money to travel long distances. Building dedicated new storefronts and hiring
sales staff can be prohibitively costly for a company, and it is common for companies to instead
leverage existing retailers, sometimes retailers who are at the BOP themselves.

distribution costs and maximizing efficiency. In addition, as access to technology continues to
spread throughout BOP communities, companies are able to deliver products and services virtually.

Before BOP customers spend on a new product or service, they need to understand its value,
how it works, and also have any perceived risk associated with it reduced. This hurdle is

received for free, or were previously provided by the government. Inclusive businesses
communicate the value of their products and services to BOP customers through:

Solution: Facilitating Access to Financing
Facilitating access to financing is necessary to help BOP customers make significant investments,
as well as small purchases that need to be made daily or weekly, regardless of cash flows. BOP
customers typically do not qualify for loans or credit cards from commercial banks, because they
lack formal credit histories or proofs of income. Companies facilitate access to financing for BOP
customers in two primary ways:

companies offering products or services on credit or on a recurring basis, where payments need
to be made regularly over time. Such companies use a variety of tactics:


MOBILE PAYMENTS:                                                   USING SOCIAL CONNECTIONS:
