Foreword




Efficient and effective road transport is central to the economic growth and develop-
ment of all African countries, this mode accounting for about eighty to ninety percent
of the continent’s total trade in goods and services. For this reason countries need
adequate road infrastructure management policies, strategies and institutions to man-
age this crucial asset in an optimal manner including systematic means of measuring
the performance of the road agencies as a basis for determining those factors that aid
or impede the attainment of their desired results.

In an endeavor to deepen the understanding of the factors that affect the performance
of road agencies in road asset management, two evaluations of road agency perfor-
mance using two different approaches have been conducted in Africa during the past
five years. The first approach is the Commercialized Road Management (CRM)
framework of assessment explained in the SSATP Working Paper No. 92. In this
study, the criteria were defined so as to allow for quantitative measurement and com-
parison of road sector performance across countries. The CRM approach is a broad
approach of performance evaluation in that it focuses on the extent of an agency’s
compliance with the requirements of the four Building Blocks of the Road Manage-
ment Initiative (RMI) pertaining to Responsibility, Ownership, Financing and Man-
agement that are believed to critically affect its ability to operate in an efficient and
effective manner. It is based on an analytical study of practices and performance of
road agencies in seven countries (Botswana, Cameroun, Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania,
Namibia and South Africa).

The second approach is the British Standards Institution’s Publicly Available Specifi-
cation (PAS55:2008) for the Optimized Management of Physical Assets as developed
by the UK Institute of Asset Management, which applies to all types of infrastructure.
It was recently used by the Association of Southern Africa National Road Agencies
(ASANRA) in the Peer Review Benchmarking Study of Road Asset Management prac-
tices in nine countries, i.e. South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimba-
bwe, Namibia, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The PAS55 approach recognizes that the
management of physical assets is inextricably linked to the management of other as-




                                                                                      vii

sets types, such as Human Assets, Information Assets, Intangible Assets and Financial
Assets. However, PAS55 is more focused as these assets are only considered where they
have a direct impact on the optimized management of the physical assets.

The outcome of the two evaluations has provided valuable information to the road
sector stakeholders in Africa in terms of the differing analytical approaches that may
be used to quantitatively evaluate road agency performance in asset management. To
provide an in-depth insight of the CRM and PAS55 approaches an analysis was under-
taken to compare them based on results of road asset management capacity in four
countries that participated in both studies, namely South Africa, Namibia, Botswana
and Tanzania. The analysis has provided indication on how complementary elements
of the two approaches could possibly be used to improve the framework of assessment
of road agency capacity and performance based on key benchmarks and indicators for
efficient road asset management. The analysis has also highlighted that such evalua-
tions, whilst useful, need to be supplemented by the application of performance indica-
tors to benchmark the agency’s operations, report objectively to management, and iden-
tify areas for improvement. Performance management using these indicators should be
viewed as an integral part of the overall road asset management process and is an area in
need of further development.

This working paper is intended to strengthen the knowledge base and awareness on
road management good practices that is important for continuous advocacy on road
sector reforms in African countries. It provides opportunity for road sector managers,
decision-makers and professionals in Africa to broaden consultation for understand-
ing the underlying principles of road asset management performance assessment. The
information provided is fundamental for improving existing evaluation frameworks
taking into account the contexts in which the road agencies operate. Notably, building
on the strengths of both evaluation approaches, succinct recommendations have been
given to incorporate the elements of PAS55, essentially the asset management aspects, in
the more broadly based CRM evaluation approach in order to come up with a more
comprehensive common framework for performance assessment within and across
countries in Africa.

ASANRA acknowledges the support provided by both the Africa Transport Policy
Programme (SSATP) and the UK Department for International Development
(DFID), through its Africa Community Access Programme (AFCAP), in undertaking
the road agency performance evaluations. In recognition of the need to improve effi-

tutionalization of good road management practices through continuous advocacy on

road sector reforms in its member countries. This is important to rebuild the institu-
tional memory on the basic principles of road sector reforms and commercialization
of road management, particularly for the new generation of policy and decision mak-
ers in the road sector. Also, ASANRA will encourage its member countries to deter-
mine optimal strategies for improvement of road asset management, based on appro-
priate performance monitoring frameworks with refined indicators for standard
benchmarking. Such strategies will take into account institutional aspects that are pre-
requisite for efficient and effective road institutions, and consider all elements im-
portant for policy and decision-making processes.

Equally, the African Development Bank has a long experience of road projects in sup-
port of both development and maintenance. Good management is critical for the suc-
cess of these projects, on one side for their sustainability and on the other side for
their impact in terms of poverty and economic growth. The present document pro-
vides a good foundation for governments and road agencies and departments to iden-
tify areas of improvement. Merging the two approaches compared in the document
provides the flexibility to adjust performance evaluation to the actual performance
and capacity of road institutions, from a broad assessment based on the principles of
commercialized road management to the more specific assessment of road asset man-
agement. The African Development Bank is committed to continue this work initiated
by SSATP and ASANRA to provide an evaluation tool available to all African coun-
tries and beyond. This will be an essential complement to the efforts to bridge the re-
maining road infrastructure gap on the continent.

Executive Summary




The potentially catalytic role of road transport in the socio-economic growth and de-
velopment of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa has not yet been fully realized
despite the enormous investments that have been made in the road sector. In fact,
backlogs in maintenance and inefficiencies in road sector operations in a number of Afri-
can countries continue to impact adversely on many other sectors of their economies with
coverage of routine and periodic maintenance averaging 65% and 54% respectively
(SSATP RMI Matrix, 2012).

The perceived poor results of road agencies have called into question their capacity for
undertaking road asset management in an effective and efficient manner. This has led
to various initiatives to evaluate such performance as a basis for determining those
factors that aid or impede the agency’s achievement of their desired results. This
would, in turn, provide a better understanding of what the agencies can or should
change to improve their ability to perform in a more effective and efficient manner.

Two organizational assessments of road agency performance have been undertaken in
Africa in the past five years. The first assessment was based on the extent to which a
road agency has been reformed in line with the Road Management Initiative (RMI)
concept of commercialization of the roads sector (the Commercialized Road Man-
agement (CRM) evaluation approach, the outcome of which is documented in SSATP
Working Paper No. 92, 2012 – Progress on Commercialized Road Management in Sub-
Saharan Africa). The second assessment was based on the extent to which a road agen-
cy complies with the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) for the Optimized Man-
agement of Physical Assets (the PAS evaluation approach as developed by the UK In-
stitute of Asset Management and documented in PAS 55-1:2008). The outcome of this
evaluation is documented in a report entitled Peer Review Benchmarking: Steps to The
Future which was undertaken by the Association of Southern African National Roads
Agencies (ASANRA) in 2014.

The main objective of the present document on Road Management Policy: An Ap-
proach to the Evaluation of Road Agency Performance is to analyze the CRM and PAS
evaluation approaches for assessing road agency performance in road asset manage-
ment. The document also considers how the two approaches could be amalgamated to
enhance the evaluation of roads agency performance in terms of key benchmarks for




                                                                                      xv

good road asset management practice. Finally, the document reflects on indicators
that could be incorporated in an appropriate asset management evaluation framework
to: (1) measure the progress being made towards commercialization of road admin-
istrations; and (2) monitor the performance of roads agencies in terms of the efficien-
cy and effectiveness with which they undertake their responsibilities in the road sub-
sector.

The evaluation of the CRM and PAS approaches has been guided by the International
Development Research Centre (IDRC)-Universalia framework for conducting an In-
stitutional and Organizational Assessment (IOA) which has been successfully field
tested in a number of developing countries (Lusthaus et al, 1999). In this approach,
the performance of an organization is believed to hinge critically on the key dimen-
sions pertaining to organizational capacity, organizational motivation and external
environment, as illustrated schematically below.

                   Institutional and organizational assessment (IOA) model




The IOA model presented above implies that certain contextual forces drive perfor-
mance, namely: the capacity of the organization, e.g. strategic leadership, human and
financial resources, programming and process management and inter-institutional
linkages); forces in its external environment, (e.g. the policy and regulatory environ-
ment; and the internal motivation of the organization (e.g. organizational culture,
history, mission, incentive systems). Largely, and maybe not surprisingly, these very
forces are recognized to varying extents in both the CRM and PAS evaluation frame-
works.

Key Findings and Conclusions

Based on the above generic approach to organizational performance assessment, the
following findings, conclusions and recommendations emerge from the evaluation of
the CRM and PAS approaches.

Comparison of CRM and PAS approaches for assessing road agency asset man-
agement capacity

    i.   The PAS and CRM frameworks for assessing road agency capacity in asset
         management have been developed in quite different ways, against quite dif-
         ferent environmental and cultural backgrounds and are quite differently fo-
         cused.

   ii.   The CRM framework is the product of the RMI concept of commercializa-
         tion which was initiated in response to chronic shortcomings in the ability
         of road agencies in SSA to manage their road network in an efficient and ef-
         fective manner. The framework addresses key aspects of road asset man-
         agement that are perceived as being of critical importance for achieving pro-
         ficiency in this activity. The framework considers that reforms in the road
         sector, in line with the commercialization concept, are a necessary pre-
         requisite for achieving sustainable improvements in road asset manage-
         ment. Moreover, follow-up studies have shown that compliance with the
         requirements of the commercialization concept have generally resulted in
         improved conditions on the ground.

  iii.   In view of its relatively broad focus, the CRM framework provides a com-
         prehensive basis for undertaking an overall evaluation of a road agency’s
         performance in asset management in that it addresses all those organiza-
         tional elements (the 4 Building Blocks pertaining to Responsibility, Owner-
         ship, Financing and Management) that affect the ability of roads agency to
         operate in an effective and efficient manner.

   iv.   The PAS framework is an internationally recognized benchmark for road
         asset management that has been developed by the UK Institute of Asset
         Management and the British Standard Institute in response to demands
         from the industry in Europe for a standard for road asset management. This
         standard is based on compliance with an international specification for the
         optimized management of physical assets and the main focus is on man-
         agement of physical assets largely through the use of an asset management
         system including a supporting asset management strategy and related asset



                                                                                  xvii
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




             management objectives and plans. Its application, so far, has been in rela-
             tively mature and developed road agencies in developed countries.

        v.   In view of its relatively narrow focus, the PAS framework provides a neces-
             sary, but limited, basis for undertaking an overall evaluation of a road agen-
             cy’s performance in asset management. Indeed, many of the problems with
             road asset management stem from fundamental institutional and organiza-
             tional weaknesses, often inter-related. Consequently, although some im-
             provements result from addressing asset management issues, this limited
             approach is unlikely to improve overall performance unless other critical is-
             sues central to the concept of commercialized road management such as er-
             ratic funding and inadequate quality of staff are also addressed.

Comparison of findings from application of the CRM and PAS frameworks
    i.       The CRM framework has probed in some detail the factors associated with
             the achievement of the RMI commercialization concept as included in the
             four inter-related Building Blocks. Thus, it has pin-pointed fairly specifically
             the extent of an agency’s non-compliance with, for example, those elements
             of organizational structure, planning, management and financing of roads
             that critically affect the ability of the agency to fulfil its mandate in an effi-
             cient and effective manner.

   ii.       As a result of the approach embedded in the CRM framework, it has been
             possible to not only indicate areas of weakness but, also, how to address
             them in terms of the required improvements/reforms in line with the four
             Building Blocks.

  iii.       The PAS framework has probed quite extensively those elements of road
             agency operations related to the establishment of a road asset management
             system, including asset management strategy, asset management objectives
             and asset management plans. Coincidentally, one of the findings of the
             CRM study was that "Most road agencies are unable to operate their Road
             Asset Management Systems to produce reliable outputs in terms of optimal
             network strategies and programs”. South Africa and Namibia were the no-
             table exceptions to this finding.

  iv.        As a result of the approach embedded in the PAS framework, it has been
             possible to pinpoint what needs to be done to achieve the PAS specification
             for road asset management, but not how to go about achieving this, which
             must be determined by the agency in accordance with its assessed needs. For
             example, the PAS identifies maintenance funding gaps as a major challenge

                                                                        Executive Summary




             faced by road agencies but the root cause of the problem in most countries –
             insufficient, erratic, unsustainable funding –the manner of addressing the
             challenge, as detailed in the RMI commercialization concept, and the need
             to attain the elements of Providing Stable Financing, the third building
             block of the RMI concept, have not been identified as key issues.

Assessments outcome based on application of CRM and PAS frameworks
  i.         The CRM framework addresses a much more extensive set of parameters
             that are likely to affect road agency asset management capacity than is the
             case with the PAS framework. The CRM framework provides a very broadly
             based approach to determining road agency capacity in road asset manage-
             ment. The framework addresses not just the asset management system as-
             pects, but also other related aspects associated with the institutional ar-
             rangements, planning, management and financing aspects of roads, all of
             which critically affect road agency asset management capacity. In contrast,
             the PAS framework is more narrowly focused on the road asset manage-
             ment system aspects and much less so on other factors that affect road agen-
             cy asset management capacity.
 ii.         From the strict point of view of asset management, both the CRM and PAS
             frameworks provide very similar results in terms of the overall rating of
             road agency capacity in road asset management.

Scope for improvement of CRM framework
       The CRM and PAS frameworks offer complementarity in assessing road agency
       capacity in road asset management in that the more broadly based CRM frame-
       work can be refined by incorporating the more specifically focused asset manage-
       ment system aspects of the PAS framework.

Performance Indicators
i.           Both the CRM and PAS evaluation outcomes are quantitatively based and
             can be used as performance indicators that measure progress in commer-
             cialized road management.

             Transport Governance Indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa, together with the
             CRM and PAS indicators, offer valuable inputs to the development of a
             measurement framework and related indicators for measuring and report-

           However, they need to be supplemented with other indicators to cover oth-
           er aspects of road agency performance including institutional effectiveness,
           sectoral effectiveness and provision efficiency. Moreover, the indicators
           need to be defined and specified in a unique manner and the supporting da-
           ta for calculating them need to be harmonized to ensure consistency in their
           use.

 Key Recommendations

 The following key recommendations emerge from this review.

 i.       The CRM evaluation framework should be improved (primarily in its aspect
          of promoting commercial management) by incorporating those elements of
          the PAS evaluation framework that are not currently captured so as to pro-
          duce an enhanced framework for evaluating road agency performance in as-
          set management as illustrated below. Such a framework would incorporate
          the strengths of the individual frameworks, including all four Building Blocks
          embedded in the RMI commercialization concept.

ii.       The various elements of both the CRM and PAS evaluation frameworks
          should first be reviewed by key stakeholders as a basis for improving the
          CRM framework. This process will enable stakeholders to reach consensus on
          the structure of the new framework. By so doing, it will engender their full
          buy-in and ownership of the final product and, as a result, is likely to lead to
          more widespread use in future.

iii.    The RMF and relevant SSATP indicators proposed in Working Paper No. 95:
        Transport Governance Indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa, should be developed
        into a performance measurement framework that measures not only progress
        with commercialization, via the four Building Blocks, but also looks beyond
        at other performance indicators, as listed below, each with their own perfor-
        mance indicators:

        a.   Performance Indicator 1. Measures Progress with commercialization

        b.   Performance Indicator 2. Measures Institutional effectiveness

        c.   Performance Indicator 3. Measures Sectoral effectiveness

        d.   Performance Indicator 4. Measures Provision efficiency
        e.   Performance Indicator 5. Measures Infrastructure provision

iv.     In order to ensure successful integration of the PIs into road agency man-
        agement processes, a number of measures should be observed, including in-
        volving all stakeholders in their development, identifying the need for addi-
        tional data collection, data management, and analytic tools to support the se-
        lected indicators, estimating the cost of operating and maintaining the meas-
        urement framework and securing a matching budget.

1.       Introduction




Context

Road transport is the most pervasive of all transport modes in Africa and is central to
the socio-economic growth and development of all countries in the region. To be ef-
fective as a catalyst for development, road provision must be institutionally, economi-
cally, financially, socially and environmentally sustainable. This remains a challenge in
most African countries despite the enormous investments that have been made in the
provision of road infrastructure over the past few decades. Indeed, backlogs in
maintenance and inefficiencies in road sector operations in a number of countries
continue to impact adversely on many other sectors of national economies with cov-
erage of routine and periodic maintenance needs averaging 65% and 54% respectively
(SSATP RMI Matrix, 2012).

The ways for the road sector to achieve its potentially catalytic role in national eco-
nomic development are now well known as a result of the Road Maintenance Initiative
(RMI) undertaken as long ago as 1987 by the Africa Transport Policy program
(SSATP). The RMI initially perceived lack of maintenance as the overwhelmingly im-
portant constraint to the development and sustainability of road systems in SSA and,
within that aspect, stability of financing was perceived as the central problem.

In 1997, the name of the RMI was modified to Road Management Initiative – a change
that represented the realization that stable financing in itself is not sufficient for en-
suring proper maintenance of the road network, and that aspects of institutional
structure, planning, management, and the external environment all strongly influence
a road agency’s ability to manage the road asset in an effective and efficient manner.

This approach was in full recognition of the main factors that adversely affected the
efficiency of road agencies in the 1990s, as more recently re-stated by Queiroz and
Kerali (2010):
              outdated management structures
              lack of clear responsibilities
              human resource constraints
              weak management information systems



                                                                                        1
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




                 inadequate financing
                 perception of roads as a public good

In view of the above, the RMI focused on finding ways and means of reversing the
process that was trapping governments in the cycle of road building, roads deteriorat-
ing prematurely and roads being rebuilt long before the end of their design life. The
key concept to emerge from the RMI program was that of commercialization of the
road sector (Heggie, 1995; Heggie and Vickers, 1998), i.e. using market concepts and
discipline in road management and introducing a fee-for-service element in the fi-
nancing. However, since roads are a public monopoly, and ownership of most roads
will remain in government hands for the foreseeable future, commercialization re-
quires complementary reforms in four key areas – the so-called four Building Blocks
(BB) (Figure 1).

        Figure 1 – Four Building Blocks necessary for commercialized road management




Essentially, the RMI defines a number of regulatory essentials and provides guidelines,
which have to be accommodated to ensure effective and efficient road management
and funding irrespective of what the institutional framework will ultimately look like.
These regulatory essentials may be summarized as follows:

                 a clear demarcation and allocation of authority and responsibility for
                  road financing and management;
                 significant private sector participation, and in particular from transport
                  users, in road financing and management decision-making forums;
                 adoption of appropriate financing principles and practices in order to
                  secure:
              -      adequate and stable sources of funding through road user charges;
              -      arrangements to allocate funds in an unbiased and transparent
                     manner to relevant road authorities/agencies;




2
                                                                                          Introduction




                   -     performance-based fund allocation; and
                   -     adoption of sound commercial management principles and practices.

The RMI vision was developed on the basis of extensive discussions between stake-
holders and sector specialists. It recognizes from historical experience that many of the
problems with road management are caused by institutional and organizational
weaknesses, which are often inter-related. Thus, although some improvements are
likely from addressing a particular aspect of a road agency’s operations, much greater
benefits are likely to occur by ensuring that each change fits within a consistent and
broader structure of improvements, as represented by the four BBs.

The RMI vision has been widely accepted as a basis for policy reform in many coun-
tries. In Africa, it is embedded, for example, in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Protocol on Transport, Communications and Meteorology
(SADC, 1999) as well as the SADC Model Legislative Provisions on Road Network
Financing and Management (SATCC, 1999). Over the past two decades, a number of
countries have embarked on wide-ranging road sector reforms largely in accordance
with the RMI vision. This has included the establishment of independent road funds
and, to a somewhat lesser extent, autonomous or semi-autonomous road authorities.
Table 1 shows the status of road sector reforms that have taken place to date in Africa.

              Table 1 – Countries with established Road Funds and Road Authorities in Africa

Subsequently to the long involvement of the SSATP in promoting the RMI principles,
three regional road associations were mandated to advocate the RMI principles and
monitor their application. These associations are:
   i.        The Association of Southern Africa National Roads Agencies (ASANRA) was
             established in 2001 and is comprised of representatives of national road
             agencies, educational institutions, industry/private sector and other interest-




                                                                                                    3
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




           ed parties. The organization’s main goal is enhancing regional policy coordi-
           nation and road transport systems integration in order to improve intra-
           regional road transport efficiency and lower transport costs.
     ii.   The African Road Maintenance Funds Association (ARMFA) was established
           in 2003 and is comprised of the heads of national Road Funds in West, Cen-
           tral, Southern and Eastern Africa. The organization’s main goals include de-
           veloping an information sharing network on best road maintenance financ-
           ing practices in Africa and on the functioning of Road Funds; supporting the
           promotion and strengthening of links between African Roads Funds; and,
           ensuring the medium term sustainability and harmonious development of
           Road Maintenance Funds.
    iii.   The Association of African Road Managers and Partners (AGEPAR) estab-
           lished in 1994 is comprised of the heads of road departments and agencies in
           West Africa. The organization’s main goals include: promotion of the inte-
           gration of road networks, harmonization of standards for construction and
           maintenance and performance improvement in the road sector.

From the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic study undertaken in Sub-Saharan
Africa, (Gwilliam et al, 2008), it was found that the RMI suite of reforms had had a
discernible impact on outcomes. Countries with well-financed road funds were found
to do significantly better at capturing resources for maintenance. Moreover, countries
with road funds and road agencies do significantly better at converting resources into
road quality. The study concluded that the advance of institutional reforms, though
impressive, was incomplete in many cases – a finding that is corroborated by the
SSATP as reported in its Working Paper No. 92, which concluded that progress in the
institutional reforms may best be described as “a road partially travelled”. Moreover,
it has become increasingly apparent that lack of continued advocacy of the principles
of the RMI in the Africa region has resulted in loss of institutional memory as a result
of which the current generation of road sector stakeholders is largely unaware of the
rationale behind the initiative.

In view of the far-reaching and often costly reforms that have taken place in the road
sector of many African countries during the past two decades, it is important that an
evaluation of the organizational performance of road agencies be carried out to better
understand the impact of the reforms, learn lessons from these experiences and identi-
fy how agencies can or should change to improve their ability to perform. To this end,
two major studies, based on somewhat different approaches to assessing road agency
asset management capacity, were undertaken.

Objectives

With both studies having been carried out in the same geographic area in Africa and
having used two different methodologies, ASANRA and the SSATP took the oppor-
tunity to learn from the dual exercise with the objective of providing guidance for the
evaluation of the performance of road agencies. Against this background, the main
objective of this working paper is as follows:

   i.    To compare and contrast the approaches adopted in the above studies to as-
         sess roads agency performance in road asset management including aspects
         of complementarity and divergence.

  ii.    To identify how the approaches could possibly be amalgamated to enhance
         the evaluation of road agency capacity and related performance in terms of
         key benchmarks for good road asset management practice.

 iii.    To propose indicators that could be incorporated in an appropriate asset
         management evaluation framework to: (1) measure the progress being made
         towards commercialization of road management, and (2) monitor the per-
         formance of roads agencies in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness with
         which they undertake their responsibilities in the roads sub-sector.

2. A Holistic Approach to Assessing Road Agency Performance




Challenges faced by Road Agencies in Africa

African governments are placing increasing pressure on road agencies to improve
the efficiency of, and accountability for, the management of their road networks.
In most African countries, the road network constitutes one of the largest public
assets and is generally wholly government-owned. Typically, roads agencies are
entrusted with maintaining, operating, improving, replacing and preserving the
road asset while, at the same time, carefully managing the scarce financial and
human resources needed to achieve these objectives. This must be accomplished
under the close scrutiny of the public who pay for, either via general taxes or road
tariffs, and are regular users of the road network, and who increasingly demand
improved levels of service in terms of safety, reliability, environmental impact and
comfort.

Road agencies face significant external, internal institutional and technical chal-
lenges that affect their ability to operate in a commercialized manner. In general,
these challenges relate to the following:
   i.    Governance issues
  ii.    Weak legislative framework upon which RMI reforms can be based
 iii.    Fragmented approaches to planning of road sector programs
  iv.    Poorly developed commercial sector
  v.     Lack of vibrant and competitive domestic consultant and construction
         industries, which limits the extent to which non-core activities can be
         contracted out to the private sector
  vi.    Problems with retrenchment of large numbers of in-house staff

Of the above challenges, governance is arguably the most important one. Good
governance, or the lack of it, can have a profound effect on the ability of road
agencies to operate in a commercialized manner. Good governance in the
transport sector is now widely recognized as being crucial for attaining sustainable




                                                                                  7
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




improvements in road asset management. In a recent study commissioned by
SSATP (Christie, Smith and Conroy, 2012 in SSATP Working Paper No. 95), the
following transport governance issues were identified across four pilot countries:
      i.   Political interference in projects and in key governing board appoint-
           ments
     ii.   Limited or non-existent integrated transport sector policy
    iii.   Identification of new and strengthened institutional and regulatory ar-
           rangements, together with continued evidence of on-going blurred
           boundaries, unrealistic budgets, and no objective criteria for prioritiza-
           tion
    iv.    Long-term under investment and prioritization in maintenance

The above issues all reflect a poor governance environment, which is not condu-
cive to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of road agency operations. These
issues were identified in the process of developing the RMI vision more than two
decades ago! They indicate clearly that poor performance in the road sector is due
to far more than mere proficiency in asset management practice and, as a result,
any evaluation framework should address all factors that affect the ability of a road
agency to operate in an efficient and effective manner.


Factors Affecting Road Agency Performance

Capacity is a critical factor for a road agency to perform efficiently and effectively.
Connolly and Lukas, 2002, identified the following components of capacity that
are deemed to be critical for high performance in any agency:

      i.   Mission, Vision and Strategy: Need for vital mission and clear understand-
           ing of its identity
     ii.   Governance and Leadership: Need for a board of directors, with defined
           governance practices to effectively oversee the organizations’ policies,
           programs and operations
    iii.   Finance: Need for the organization to successfully secure support from a
           variety of sources to ensure that its revenues are diversified, stable, and
           sufficient for achieving its mission and goals
    iv.    Internal operations and management: Need for efficient and effective op-
           erations and strong management support systems with financial opera-
           tions responsibly managed and reflecting sound accounting principles

                                               Approach to Assessing Road Agency Performance




   v.      Program Delivery and Impact: Need to operate programs that demonstrate
           tangible outcomes commensurate with the resources invested
  vi.      Strategic relationships: Need to engender respect and maintain strong
           connections with its constituents including participation in strategic alli-
           ances and partnerships that significantly advance their goals and expand
           their influence

Several international studies of road transport infrastructure and financing (Heg-
gie and Vickers, 1998; Queiroz and Kerali, 2008; Pinard, 2012) have identified fac-
tors that impact on efficiency and effectiveness of road agencies, all of which are in
accordance with the RMI commercialization concept:
    i.     Establishing appropriate institutional structures and relationships with
           stakeholders
   ii.     Separating the client and supplier functions
  iii.     Separating the client and supplier organizations
  iv.      Privatizing the supplier organizations
   v.      Establishing an executive agency or a commercialized (client) organiza-
           tion
  vi.      Ensuring user participation through oversight boards
 vii.      Improving management information systems
viii.      Seeking additional, sustainable sources of financing

Attainment of the above requirements has been shown from other studies (e.g.
Brooks, Robinson and O’Sullivan, 1989) to be insufficient to ensure satisfactory
performance in a road agency. Instead, Robinson, Danielson and Snaith, 1998,
argue that successful performance depends on three fundamental, hierarchically




                                                                                          9

interrelated factors that take the form of a pyramid as in Figure 2. What the pyra-
mid indicates is that institutional development should be undertaken from the
bottom up. Thus, for technical improvements to be successful, sufficient institu-
tional capability must exist. Furthermore, unless the external context (e.g. govern-
ance) is supportive, sustainable improvements in the organization are unlikely to
be achieved (Stankevich and Guillossou, 2008).


Road Asset Management

Within their broad mandate, road agencies face a complex, multi-faceted array of
operational issues related to road asset management. At each turn, crucial deci-
sions must be made, and each involves expenditure of valuable resources. For
example:

      i.   What is the level of maintenance and rehabilitation funding required to
           maintain the road network in an optimal condition and what is the corre-
           sponding level of road user charges that should be levied?

     ii.   What will happen to road surface conditions and structural capacity if an
           optimum budget is not available and what will be the resulting excess us-
           er costs?

  iii.     What choices of maintenance and rehabilitation actions and budgets will
           most effectively bring pavement conditions to an optimal level?

  iv.      In short, what should be the highway budget for various activities, where
           should the money be spent, and what exactly should be the road im-
           provement action?

The technical issues posed above are difficult but important ones. They are diffi-
cult not only technically, but also because of the sophistication of the road
transport system, the extent of the road network, the complexity of relationships,
and the political realities which are always present in road system management
and decision-making, and which all pose a major challenge for any roads agency
manager to grapple with.

Because of this complexity, road agency managers are placing increased reliance
on the use of an appropriate “systems engineering” approach in combination with
modern day “management” techniques which, in practice, combine to produce a
tool which has become almost, if not, indispensable to today’s generation of road
managers – a Road Asset Management System.

The term “asset management” is used differently by different practitioners. For the
purpose of this paper, the definition given by the British Standards Institution for
their Publicly Available Specification (PAS) (IAM, 2008) which applies to all types
of infrastructure is as follows: “systematic and coordinated activities and practices by
which an organization optimally and sustainably manages its assets and asset systems,
their associated performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles for the pur-
pose of achieving its organizational strategic plan”. This definition recognizes that
asset management is related to delivering business goals through a combination of
management, financial, economic, engineering and other related activities with the
objective of providing the required level of service in the most cost-effective man-
ner Therefore asset management can be viewed conceptually as the central overlap
of the key activities shown in Figure 3.

As outlined in Section 2, the performance of a road agency is dependent on a wide
range of factors that affect the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. This
suggests that the assessment of road agency performance should be undertaken in
a holistic manner and should evaluate all the factors that are likely to affect such
capacity and related performance. In this regard, the Institutional and Organiza-
tional Assessment Model (IOA Model) developed by the Institutional Develop-
ment Research Centre - IDRC), provides a well-tested framework for organiza-
tional performance assessment that has been successfully applied by the IDRC in a
number of developing countries (Lusthaus, et al, 1999).
In the IOA evaluation framework, the performance of an organization is viewed as
a multi-dimensional balance between its effectiveness, relevance, efficiency, and
financial viability. The framework also presumes that the organizational perfor-
mance should be examined in relation to the organization’s capacity, motivation,
and external environment. In the schematic representation of the IOA framework
in Figure 4, performance is defined in terms of effectiveness (mission fulfilment),
efficiency, ongoing relevance (the extent to which the organization adapts to
changing conditions in its environment), and financial viability. The framework
implies that certain contextual forces drive performance, namely: the capacity of
the organization, forces in its external environment, and the internal motivation of
the organization.

Against the above generic approach for evaluating the performance of an organiza-
tion, the next section considers two frameworks, based on somewhat different
approaches, used recently to evaluate the asset management capacity and related
performance of a number of roads agencies in the SADC region. These frame-
works are:
       i.      The CRM framework

       ii.     The PAS framework


The CRM Framework for Assessing Road Agency Performance in Asset
Management

The CRM framework is based on the extent to which the agency has been re-
formed in line with the RMI concept as discussed in Section 1. The underlying
premise is that such reform is a necessary pre-requisite for establishing institution-
al arrangements that are conducive to effective and efficient service delivery as
outlined in the Sourcebook on Institutional Development for Utilities and infra-
structure (Heggie and Kerali, 2000). The evaluation framework is based on a
checklist for examining road agency performance and, in so doing, includes the
basic elements of the four Building Blocks (BB) that cover all aspects of road ser-
vice delivery normally expected of a road agency, each with a specific aim related
to good practice.

Based on the broad framework for assessing road agency asset management capac-
ity presented above, a survey questionnaire was developed to cover all the elements
of the four BB associated with commercialized road agency operations. Each ques-
tion asks whether a particular feature of road management in the evaluated agency
corresponds to a good practice as promoted by the RMI through the four BB.
Most questions offer several potential answers, which move progressively from
“Unsatisfactory” through to “Excellent” in terms of prevailing practice. When a
particular feature of the road sector is checked against the checklist, the answer
provides two sets of information:

  i.        How does the road sector in this country score on this feature, measured in
            terms of Rating 1 (unsatisfactory practice) to Rating 5 (Excellent practice)

     ii. If less than Rating 5, what progressive reforms are required to take this fea-
         ture from where it is towards a higher-rated good practice.

Measurement of road agency capacity in asset management
Following completion and analysis of the outcome of the CRM evaluation ques-
tionnaire, the capacity of a road agency to undertake efficient and effective asset
management is determined by the extent to which it complies with the require-
ments of the BB. This approach assess road agency capacity and related perfor-
mance through a set of performance indicators (see Section 5) in which the rating
is expressed on a chosen graduated scale ranging from Unsatisfactory (rating 0-20)
to Excellent (rating 80-100) as illustrated in Figure 5 1.
             Figure 5 – Example of CRM measurement of road agency performance




By way of example, the following broad conclusions may be drawn from Figure 5
regarding progress on commercialization of a road agency’s operations in terms of
the extent of implementation of the reforms embodied in the three BB. (Note: The
approach is equally applicable to evaluating all four BB).

The PAS Framework for Assessing Road Agency Performance

The Publicly Available Specification (PAS) was developed by the UK Institute of
Asset Management (IAM) and the British Standards Institution in 2004 in re-
sponse to demands from the industry for a standard for asset management (Insti-
tute for Asset Management, 2008). In order to ensure consistency with other relat-
ed management system standards, it was considered that asset management would
best be standardized as a specification, with the information on implementing
asset management distilled into key requirements. The criterion for including such
requirements has been that, without them, the asset management system would be
regarded as deficient. The Specification is applicable to any organization where
physical assets are a critical factor in achieving its business.

The PAS is primarily designed to support the delivery of an organizational strate-
gic plan in order to meet the expectations of a variety of stakeholders. Thus, the
plan becomes the starting point for developing the organization’s asset manage-
ment policy, strategy, objectives and plans. These, in turn, direct the optimal com-
bination of life cycle activities to be applied across the diverse portfolio of assets.
Figure 6 presents an overview of the asset management system and its relationship
to the organizational strategic plan and stakeholder expectations.

The PAS framework is essentially a measurement/compliance tool, which, as indi-
cated in Figure 6, focuses on the management of physical assets and asset systems
in accordance with an over-arching asset management policy. The framework
measures the extent to which a road agency complies with the PAS Specification for
the Optimized Management of Physical Assets. This specification provides key per-
formance indicators across 28 aspects of good asset management (Figure 7). It is
important to note that the requirements of PAS are prescriptive only to the extent
that they define what has to be done, not how to do it. The method of achieving
each requirement is for the requirements of PAS are prescriptive only to the extent
that they define what has to be done, not how to do it. The method of achieving
each requirement is for the organization to determine in accordance with its as-
sessed needs.

PAS 55 recognizes that the management of physical assets is inextricably linked to
the management of other asset types, such as Human Assets, Information Assets,
Intangible Assets and Financial Assets. However, these assets are only considered
where they have a direct impact on the optimized management of the physical
assets. As is apparent from Figure 7, the main requirements within PAS call for the
organization to establish an asset management system, including asset manage-
ment strategy, asset management objectives and asset management plans. Other
organizational requirements that could affect performance, e.g. institutional
mandates and responsibilities, financial sustainability, human resources, or the
external environment, e.g. stakeholders such as road users or service providers, are
not addressed.

to an aspect of road asset management, PAS 55 developed a questionnaire which
covers all 28 aspects of the PAS requirements indicated in Figure 7. A typical ex-
ample of the questions pertaining to asset management strategy (Item 4.3.1 in Fig-
ure 7) is presented below in terms of the requirements to be met by the organiza-
tion for various maturity levels.

                                                                                                              21
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




Following completion and analysis of the outcome of the PAS evaluation ques-
tionnaire, a road agency’s asset management capacity can then be measured in a
quantitative manner as illustrated in Figure 8.
     Figure 8. Example of PAS measurement of road agency performance in asset management




By way of example, the following broad conclusions may be drawn from Figure 8
regarding the level of Asset Management (AM) maturity of the roads agency.

Overall, in this example, the shape of the radar graph indicates a relatively imma-
ture organization as regards to asset management as defined by PAS.

4. Outcomes of Alternative Approaches for Assessing Road
       Agency Performance in Asset Management




Introduction

This chapter compares the alternative approaches that were both used for assessing
road agency capacity in asset management, as described in Section 3, in a number
of countries in the southern African region as follows:

  i.    The CRM framework: The assessment was undertaken by a consultant who
        discussed and rated each of the questions contained in each of the four BB,
        as illustrated in Table 2, based on detailed discussions with a cross-section
        of senior staff of the road agencies. The countries surveyed are shown below
        whilst the outcome of the assessment is contained in SSATP Working paper
        No. 92 (Pinard, 2012).
                             Botswana                 Namibia
                             Cameroon                 South Africa
                             Ethiopia                 Tanzania
                             Ghana


  ii. The PAS framework: The assessment was undertaken initially on a self-
      assessment basis by road agency staff after undergoing training in the PAS
      55 assessment methodology. The outcome of the assessment was then veri-
      fied by an independent review panel and adjusted, where appropriate,
      through joint panel interviews in each country. The countries surveyed are
      shown below whilst the outcome of the assessment is presented in a report
      entitled: Peer Review Benchmarking: Steps to the Future. I.E.S Management
      BV (January, 2014).

Road Management Policy – Road Agency Performance




Outcomes from Application of CRM and PAS Frameworks

The outcomes of the application of the CRM and PAS frameworks used to evalu-
ate road agency capacity in road asset management are compared at two levels:

        First at the level of the general findings of each evaluation of all the coun-
         tries surveyed.

        Second at the level of the detailed findings of the evaluation for three of
         the countries surveyed (South Africa, Tanzania and Botswana).

General findings and recommendations emanating from application of the
CRM framework
The general findings derived from the application of the CRM framework are
summarized as follows:

        Progress on commercialization of road management practices varies con-
         siderably from just satisfactory to excellent.

        There is generally lack of genuine autonomy of Roads Authorities from
         parent ministries.

        Roads Boards are still predominantly public sector dominated and road
         user interests are not adequately articulated.

        Good governance mechanisms in many Roads Boards operations are
         generally inadequate.

        Board members are often not abreast of the fundamentals of commercial-
         ized road management and financing.

        Many road agencies fulfil aspects of the “supplier” function and under-
         take varying amounts of non-core activities.

        Lack of Procedures Agreements between some Road Authorities and
         Road Funds adversely affect the implementation of Road Network Man-
         agement Plans.

        Performance measurement is not carried out in most road agencies.

        There is significant over-staffing in traditional Government roads institu-
         tions in terms of the number of staff responsible for managing 100 km of
         roads compared to more commercially oriented agencies.




26
                              Alternative Approaches for Assessing Road Agency Performance




        Salaries are still not market based in most road agencies, which often find
         it difficult to attract and retain competent staff.

        Most road agencies are unable to operate their Road Asset Management
         Systems to produce reliable outputs in terms of optimal network strate-
         gies and programs.

        Some Road Authorities tend to consider maintenance and rehabilita-
         tion/upgrading as separate interventions.

        Road Fund allocations to Road Authorities are inadequate for the
         maintenance needs of the networks with an over-reliance on the fuel levy
         compared to other road user charges.

        Road funds are not always used for road maintenance.

        Procurement and tendering processes are very time consuming and inef-
         ficient in Government road institutions and a lot less so in commercially
         oriented agencies.

        The capacity of local consultants and contractors is still limited in a num-
         ber of countries.

        Technical auditing of maintenance projects is generally carried out but
         the process is sometimes more superficial than rigorous. Auditing of de-
         velopment projects is seldom carried out.

The positive impacts of the reforms so far, despite the challenges faced, indicate
that the pursuit of the reforms promoted under the RMI is justified and beneficial.
However, from the application of the CRM framework it can be concluded that for
more agencies to realize the full benefits of commercialization, the following issues
must be addressed in what may be termed “second generation roads agencies”:

        More institutional autonomy should be given to Roads Authorities for
         accountability and improved efficiency through the amendment of exist-
         ing Road Acts, where necessary;

        Road Boards should be constituted with majority private sector represen-
         tation and should introduce appropriate mechanisms for promoting
         good Board governance; including adherence to a code of ethics, and:

        Board members should be adequately remunerated, should be required to
         be abreast of commercialized road management practices and to adhere
         to a code of ethics.




                                                                                       27
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




        Road Authorities should focus only on their “client” functions and
         should outsource all non-core functions.

        Inter-agency (Road Authority/Road Fund) Procedures Agreements
         should guide the implementation of Road network management Plans
         and programs.

        All Road Authorities should move to an integrated network management
         approach for managing their road networks, making good use of road as-
         set management systems.

        Performance measurement of all Road Authorities should be undertaken
         on the basis of appropriately chosen performance indicators.

        Where necessary, Road Authorities should contract appropriately experi-
         enced local consultants to take responsibility for the data collection, op-
         eration and management of Road Asset Management Systems.

        The revenue collection base for Road funds should be widened and
         mechanisms should be put in place for automatic adjustment of road user
         charges in relation to road demand.

        Road Authorities should undertake technical auditing of both mainte-
         nance and new construction/rehabilitation/upgrading projects at all stag-
         es of the project cycle.

        Further, locally driven institutional reform is required in many road
         agencies in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their road
         management operations based on implementation of the four Building
         Blocks with particular emphasis on the first – Creating Ownership – tak-
         ing due account of the examples of good practice that have emerged from
         this study.

General findings and recommendations emanating from application of PAS
framework
The general findings derived from the application of the PAS framework are
summarized as follows:

        There is a general drive towards road asset management.

        Member States have different perception about road asset management.

        Risk related aspects of asset management (“thinking the unthinkable”)
         are underdeveloped.




28
                            Alternative Approaches for Assessing Road Agency Performance




       There are funding gaps leading to vicious circle (no funds → no mainte-
        nance → degradation of the roads quality and value → need for more
        funds, etc.).

       Maintenance is not politically attractive, leading to short term decisions
        instead of Life Cycle Costs.

       There are generally fuzzy responsibilities between asset owner, asset man-
        ager and service provider.

       Standard of performance measurement is moving from PAS 55 to
        ISO 55000.

The general recommendations derived from the application of the PAS framework
are summarized as follows:

       The Member states’ top road agency management should demonstrate
        commitment with respect to asset management by:

            -    Ensuring that an asset management policy that is aligned to ISO
                 55000 and compatible organizational objectives is established.

            -    Ensuring that the asset management system requirements are in-
                 tegrated into the organization’s business processes.

            -    Ensuring that the resources (financial, software, people, equip-
                 ment, training) for the asset management system are available.

            -    Promoting cross cutting collaboration within the organization.
       The Member states’ top road agency management should ensure that as-
        set management related risks are considered in the organization’s man-
        agement approach including contingency planning.

       The Member states should perform self-assessment on annual basis and
        submit to ASANRA Secretariat by end of November each year.

       Another asset management peer review process should be performed in
        2017 to review progress made.

       Road Fund Agency representatives should be permanent members of the
        Road Network Management and Financing Committee of ASANRA.

       The impact of super single tires on regional road networks should be in-
        vestigated and appropriate policies recommended.

Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




Comparison of outcome of assessments based on application of CRM and PAS
frameworks
A detailed comparison of the outcome of the assessment of road asset manage-
ment capacity based on the application of the CRM and PAS frameworks for
South Africa, Tanzania and Botswana is presented in Annexes A, B and C and is
summarized in Table 9.

Framework rating    Legend: U=Unsatisfactory (0-20);           Legend: 0 = Unsatisfactory, 0.1-1.0 =
                    P=Poor (21-40); S =Satisfactory (41-60);   Poor; 1.1-2.0 = Satisfactory; 2.1-3.0 =
                    G=Good (61-80); E=Excellent (81-100)       Good; 3.1–4.0=Excellent


As is apparent from Table 9, both frameworks rate the three countries in a relative-
ly, but not absolutely, similar manner. This difference in absolute terms is due to
the dissimilar scales used in the frameworks in that the PAS framework includes a
scale (Maturity Level Excellent: rating 3.1–4) surpassing the standard required to
comply fully with the PAS 55 requirements considered to be achieved at the level
Good of maturity (rating 2.1-3). Thus, if the scales of CRM and PAS were to be
“standardized” by assuming that attainment of the PAS Maturity Level Good,
which complies largely with all of the requirements of PAS 55, is rated as excellent,
then this rating would be similar to the CRM scale of Excellent (rating of 81-100)
which complies largely with all the requirements of the 4 BB of the RMI. Thus,
with such standardization, both frameworks would produce the same results.

Although both the CRM and PAS frameworks provide very similar results in terms
of the overall rating of road agency capacity in road asset management, the under-
lying implications of such an outcome are very different. This is due to the fact
that the CRM framework addresses a much more extensive set of parameters that
are likely to affect road agency asset management capacity than is the case with the
PAS framework. While the PAS rating is determined by a set of PAS-specific pa-
rameters, these parameters are influenced by additional parameters which are not
included nor rated by the PAS approach but are taken into account in the CRM
approach. For example, the PAS framework rates the South African road agency as

                             Alternative Approaches for Assessing Road Agency Performance




“Good”. The reason for this rating is more than likely not only because the agency
is compliant with the PAS requirements but, also, because it is, more broadly, also
RMI compliant in terms of meeting generally the requirements of the four BB and
as a result is rated Excellent by the CRM framework.

In summary, the CRM framework evaluates all the key elements contained in the
four RMI BB which, collectively, have been shown to influence the overall efficien-
cy and effectiveness of a road agency’s performance. In contrast, the PAS frame-
work focuses primarily on the asset management system aspects (BB4) within an
agency which, unless complemented by other factors affecting road agency per-
formance, is unlikely to provide a comprehensive assessment of road agency asset
management capacity. In other words, the application of the PAS framework is a
necessary, but not sufficient requirement, for fully assessing road agency asset
management capacity.


Scope for Improvement of CRM Framework

From the outputs of previous diagnostic studies on road agency performance, it is
apparent that without achievements of the four BB, lasting improvements in road
asset management are unlikely. Thus, an “ideal” framework for assessing road
agency capacity and performance should evaluate at least those factors included in
the four BB. That being a necessity, the CRM framework would seem logically to
provide a sound basis for refinement by incorporating the various elements of the
PAS framework that focus more specifically, than does the CRM framework, on
the asset management system aspects of a road agency’s operations. To this end,
the conceptual framework in Figure 9 is proposed.

The proposed amalgamated framework would also capture the organizational ca-
pacity, external environment and organizational motivation components that af-
fect road agency performance, as presented in the IOA framework in Figure 4.
Nonetheless, it is recommended that this proposed new framework is closely re-
viewed by all stakeholders, including ASANRA, ARMFA and road agencies in SSA
countries before it is finalized.

Need for Performance Indicators

The absence of an adequate framework of performance indicators (PIs) to measure
and report upon on a continuing basis road agency performance in asset manage-
ment is a drawback, which can have adverse consequences in terms of:

        Uncertainty as to what progress is being made in achieving the reforms
         that have generally been accepted as a minimum requirement to facilitate
         commercialization of the road sub-sector

        Inability of road agencies administrations to gauge the efficiency and ef-
         fectiveness of their operations
        Tendency for policies and interventions to be made in a vacuum and to
         be re-active rather than pro-active

In view of the above, there is a need to enhance the proposed amalgamated CRM-
PAS framework indicated in Figure 9 by linking the outputs to appropriate PIs, as
discussed in the next section.

5. Performance Measures and Indicators




Introduction

One way of measuring the progress being made by SSA countries towards the
achievement of the more autonomous, accountable and business-like agencies
envisaged by the RMI is through the use of appropriate Performance Indicators
(PIs). As illustrated in Figure 10, the use of PIs has multiple dimensions and PIs
can be used by stakeholders, such as governments, service providers and road us-
ers, to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency’s operations against
targets or a baseline position, as a basis for taking adjusting action.

Road Management Policy – Road Agency Performance




With the use of PIs, monitoring and evaluation becomes more objective and is no
longer rooted in personal judgment and narrative descriptions. Moreover, its use
would enable road agencies to assess their performance and also enable peer com-
parison between agencies in other countries – thereby providing a strong motiva-
tion for improvement. Such self-assessment also has the advantage of enabling a
fair and open assessment by removing the tendency of agencies to over- or under-
rate themselves when being compared with similar agencies (Mihai et al, 2000).


Existing Performance Indicators

RMF Matrix
The RMF Matrix of transport sector performance indicators has been developed as
part of the SSATP/ARMFA Partnership program. This matrix consists of a number
of performance indicators as shown in Table 10.

                        Table 10. RMF matrix of performance indicators

        Area of Measurement                            Performance Indicator

 operational framework                     Whether a board exists
                                           Whether the board has a private sector majority
                                           Whether a road management system is used
                                           % value of maintenance work contracted out
 Road network condition                    % of primary roads in good or bad condition


SSATP Transport Indicators
SSATP also developed two sets of key transport sector performance indicators for
Africa (SSATP, 2004) as follows:
     i. High level indicators. These have been developed for four focus areas,
        one of which is Road Network Management, in terms of:

                   Road condition: Percentage of the road network in good and fair
                    condition.

                   Network standard appropriateness: Percentage of road carrying
                    traffic less than the economic threshold of their type (50 vpd for a
                    gravel road and 250 vpd for a paved road).

       ii.       Secondary indicators. These have been developed for six sectors, in-
                 cluding Transport Sector Management Sustainability and Road
                 Transport in terms of the following relevant indicators.

                      a.     Costs – 6 No. indicators
                      b.     Financial autonomy – 9 No. indicators

                      c.     Institutional Development/Governance – 2 No. indicators

                      d.     Transport sector impact – 2 No. indicators

                      Road Transport

                      a.     Road network – 3 No. Indicators

                      b.     Road Usage – 4 No. Indicators

                      c.     Road Sub-Sector Management – 1 No. indicator

                      d.     Road Safety – 1 No. Indicator

 More recently, transport governance indicators have also been developed by
 SSATP in order to demonstrate the quality of governance in a particular country,
 sector or sub-sector (Christie, Smith and Conroy, 2012 – SSATP Working Paper
 No. 95). The scoring framework adopted in SSATP Working Paper No. 95 allows
 the indicators to be base-lined and then targets to be set as the basis for action. The
 scoring system is founded on a simple four-level RAG (red–red/amber–
 amber/green–green) rating approach, allowing assessment of performance along a
 continuum. An example of the RAG ratings is presented in Table 11.

 Both the RMF and SSATP indicators and the evaluation framework of the latter
 offer valuable inputs to the development of a measurement framework and related
 indicators for measuring and reporting progress in the efficiency and effectiveness
 of road agency performance as discussed in the next section.




                                                                                                             35
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




Proposed Performance Indicators

When compared with the more comprehensive set of performance indicators for
assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of road administrations that are available
(Humplick and Paterson, 1994), it is apparent that the RMF matrix and the SSATP
Transport Governance Indicators should be expanded, where necessary, to ensure
that the following areas of measurement are all linked to appropriate indicators:

     i. Performance Indicator 1. Commercialization of road management

         Measures the extent to which the road agency has progressed with the re-
         forms required to commercialize the management of roads.

         Indicators
         Indicate the extent to which progress has been made with regard to the var-
         ious policy, legislative, institutional, regulatory and administrative changes
         required to commercialize the management of roads.

     ii. Performance Indicator 2. Institutional effectiveness

         Measures the performance of the agency in terms of meeting institutional
         goals.

         Indicators

         Indicate the effectiveness of long-term network preservation strategies in-
         cluding resource lag, research and training.

  iii. Performance Indicator 3. Sectoral effectiveness

         Measures how closely the condition and operation of the network match
         the optimal state.
         Indicators

         Indicate technical and functional qualities as evidenced by the physical con-
         dition of the network and quality of service provided to road users.

  iv. Performance Indicator 4. Provision efficiency

         Measures the productivity and efficiency of the agency in providing the in-
         puts into the road system.

       Indicators

      Indicate how much resource was required to produce a unit of output in
      terms of such aspects as maintenance expenditure and staff productivity.

  v. Performance Indicator 5: Infrastructure provision

       Tracks the amount of the largely public asset, the size of the demand and
       the adequacy of the road system for the demand environment

      Indicators

       Provide information on demography and macro-economy, road network
       size and asset value, road network availability and utilization.

The proposed framework for monitoring and evaluating the performance of road
agencies is presented in Table 11 and includes the five measures described above
and about 30 related PIs including relevant ones that have been retained from
both the RMF matrix, the SSATP Transport Governance Indicators and the PAS
evaluation framework. However, in order to harmonize these approaches, it will
be necessary to adopt a similar rating scale. For ease of conformance, it is proposed
to adopt the four level RAG system embedded in the SSATP Working Paper 95, as
described above. Accordingly, it will be necessary to amend the CRM framework
from a five level scale to a four level scale. This will make it possible to produce
indicators that will be the outcome of a quantitative evaluation procedure and will
fall into any one of the four rating scales. On this basis performance can be moni-
tored both within and amongst road agencies.

As indicated in Table 12, Performance Indicator 1 – Progress with Commercializa-
tion, provides the means of tracking progress made by a road agency in the com-
mercialization of road management practices. The rating system illustrated in Ta-
ble 11 and embedded in Table 12, also allows the agency to gauge what reforms are
required to take a particular feature of its performance from where it is towards
where it should be. Performance Measures 2, 3 and 4 provide the means of track-
ing progress in the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure provision. The
outcome of the performance evaluation process can be presented in the form of a
histogram (e.g. Figure 5) or a radar diagram (Figure 8).

Data requirements
Much of the data required to generate the PIs listed in Table 12 would be readily
available either from national statistics (e.g. those pertaining to demography and




                                                                                    37

macro-economy) or from the regular monitoring procedures normally undertak-
en by most road administrations and held in the database of a road or pavement
management system. Some of the PIs are contained in the current RMF matrix
(road condition) while a few are generated by external organizations (e.g. vehicle
fleet size and motorization).

Harmonization of Performance Indicators

In order to ensure that the PIs proposed in Table 12 are used in a consistent man-
ner in all SSA countries, it is important that they are defined and specified in a
unique manner and that the supporting data for calculating them is collected in a
harmonized manner. In particular, to focus on performance evaluation, many
indicators proposed for the measure of infrastructure provision should be trans-



                                                                                                      39

formed to fit within the format of the RAG framework where actual performance
is measured against targets. This will require the preparation of a specification for
each PI as illustrated in Table 13.

                                P = 1,700,000
                                RD = 8,700/(1,700,000/1,000)
                                  = 5.1


The approach outlined above should be undertaken for each indicator. However,
it is outside the scope of this study to define all the indicators to this level of detail
as the final selection of indicators and buy-in from stakeholders should be part of
an implementation strategy aimed at engendering ownership of the performance
monitoring and evaluation framework outlined in this section.


Integrating Performance Measures and Indicators into a Road Agency

The following actions would be required to ensure successful integration of the PIs
into the road agency management processes. These include (TRB, 2006):

          Engage all stakeholders to achieve buy-in and commitment to use
           the measures

          Integrate the performance measures into existing processes and decision-
           making forums
          Agree on clear ownership and responsibility for each measure and associ-
           ated data and tools

          Identify needs for additional data collection, data management, and ana-
           lytic tools to support the selected measures and indicators

          Design communication tools with formats appropriate to rget audiences

6. Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations




The following is a summary of the conclusions and recommendations arising from
the review of the CRM and PAS frameworks for assessing road agency capacity and
performance in road asset management.


Main Findings and Conclusions

Comparison of CRM and PAS approaches for assessing road agency
asset management capacity
    i.   The PAS and CRM frameworks for assessing road agency capacity in asset
         management have been developed in quite different ways, against quite
         different environmental and cultural backgrounds and are quite differ-
         ently focused.

   ii.   The CRM framework is the product of the RMI concept of commerciali-
         zation of road management, which was initiated in response to chronic
         shortcomings in the ability of road agencies to manage their road net-
         work in an efficient and effective manner. The framework addresses key
         aspects of road asset management that are perceived as being of critical
         importance for achieving proficiency in road asset management. The
         framework considers that reforms in the road sector, in line with the
         commercialization concept, are a necessary pre-requisite for achieving
         sustainable improvements in road asset management. Moreover, follow-
         up studies have shown that compliance with the requirements of the
         commercialization concept have generally resulted in improved condi-
         tions on the ground.

  iii.   The PAS framework is an internationally recognized benchmark for road
         asset management developed by the UK Institute of Asset Management
         and the British Standard Institute in response to demand from the indus-
         try in Europe for a standard for asset management. This standard is based
         on compliance with an international specification for the optimized
         management of physical assets and the main focus is on management of
         physical assets largely through the use of an asset management system in-
         cluding a supporting asset management strategy and related asset man-




                                                                               43
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




            agement objectives and plans. Its application, so far, has been in relatively
            mature and developed road agencies in developed countries.

     iv.    In view of its relatively narrow focus, the PAS framework provides a nec-
            essary but limited basis for undertaking an overall evaluation of a road
            agency’s capacity and related performance in asset management. Indeed,
            many of the problems with road asset management are caused by funda-
            mental institutional and organizational weaknesses which are often inter-
            related. Thus, a good road asset management system will make little dif-
            ference to the quality of roads in a country if the level of funding is erratic
            or the quality of staff inadequate.

Comparison of findings emanating from application of the CRM and PAS
frameworks for assessing road agency capacity in road asset management
      i.    The CRM framework has probed in some detail the factors associated
            with the achievement of the RMI commercialization concept as included
            in its four inter-related Building Blocks (BB). Thus, it has pin-pointed
            fairly specifically the extent of an agency’s non-compliance with, for ex-
            ample, those elements of organizational structure, planning, management
            and financing of roads that critically affect the ability of the agency to ful-
            fil its mandate in an efficient and effective manner.

     ii.    As a result of the approach embedded in the CRM framework, it has been
            possible to not only indicate areas of weakness but, also, how to address
            them in terms of the required improvements/reforms in line with the
            four BB.

  iii.      The PAS framework has probed quite extensively those elements of road
            agency operations related to the establishment and operation of a road
            asset management system, including asset management strategy, asset
            management objectives and asset management plans. Ironically, one of
            the findings of the CRM study was that "Most road agencies are unable to
            operate their Road Asset Management Systems to produce reliable out-
            puts in terms of optimal network strategies and programs”.

  iv.      As a result of the approach embedded in the PAS framework, it has been
           possible to pinpoint what needs to be done to achieve the PAS specifica-
           tion for road asset management, but not how to go about achieving this,
           which must be determined by the agency in accordance with its assessed
           needs. For example, maintenance funding gaps have been identified as a
           major challenge faced by road agencies but the root cause of the problem



44
                                                 Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations




           in most countries – insufficient, erratic, unsustainable funding – and the
           manner of addressing the challenge, as detailed in the RMI commercializa-
           tion concept, and the need to attain the elements of BB3: Providing Stable
           Financing, have not been identified as key issues.

   v.      In summary it can be concluded that the CRM framework provides a
           broader approach to determining road agency capacity in road asset man-
           agement. The framework addresses not just the asset management system
           aspects, but also other related aspects associated with the institutional ar-
           rangements, planning, management and financing aspects of roads, all of
           which critically affect road agency asset management capacity. In contrast,
           the PAS framework is more narrowly focused on the road asset manage-
           ment system aspects and much less so on other factors that affect road
           agency asset management capacity.

Comparison of outcome of assessments based on application of CRM and PAS
frameworks
       Both the CRM and PAS frameworks provide very similar results in terms of the
       overall rating of road agency capacity in road asset management. However, the
       underlying implications of such an outcome are very different in that the CRM
       framework addresses a much more extensive set of parameters that are likely to
       affect road agency asset management capacity than is the case with the PAS
       framework.

Scope for improvement of CRM framework
       The CRM and PAS frameworks offer complementarity in the assessment of
       road agency capacity in road asset management in that CRM as broader
       framework can be refined by incorporating the more specifically focused asset
       management system aspects of the PAS framework.

Performance indicators
  i.        Both the CRM and PAS evaluation outcomes are quantitatively based and
            can be used as performance indicators that measure progress in commer-
            cialized road management.

 ii.        The RMF and SSATP indicators proposed in Working Paper No. 95:
            Transport Governance Indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa, together with
            the CRM and PAS indicators, offer valuable inputs to the development of
            a measurement framework and related indicators for measuring and re-



                                                                                       45
Road Management Policy– Road Agency Performance




         porting progress in the efficiency and effectiveness of a road agency.
         However, they need to be supplemented with other indicators to cover
         other aspects of road agency performance including institutional effec-
         tiveness, sectoral effectiveness and provision efficiency. Moreover, the in-
         dicators will need to be defined and specified in a unique manner and the
         supporting data for calculating them will need to be harmonized to en-
         sure consistency in their use.

Main recommendations
The following key recommendations emerge from this study.

  i.     The CRM and PAS evaluation frameworks should be amalgamated so as
         to produce a consolidated framework for evaluating road agency capacity.
         Such a framework would incorporate the strengths of the individual
         frameworks, including all four BB embedded in the commercialization
         concept. In so doing, the various elements of both frameworks should
         first be reviewed by key stakeholders, including ASANRA, AGEPAR and
         ARMFA, to engender full buy-in and ownership of the new framework.

 ii.     The RMF and relevant SSATP indicators proposed in Working Paper No.
         95: Transport Governance Indicators for Sub-Saharan Africa, together with
         the CRM and PAS indicators should be expanded in a harmonized man-
         ner to ensure that the following performance measures are all catered for.

         a.   Performance Indicator 1: Measures Progress with commercialization

         b.   Performance Indicator 2: Measures Institutional effectiveness

         c.   Performance Indicator 3: Measures Sectoral effectiveness
         d.   Performance Indicator 4: Measures Provision efficiency

         e.   Performance Indicator 5: Measures Infrastructure provision
