Final Report: Results-Based Financing for Clean Cookstoves in Uganda



Executive Summary
The fundamental idea behind results-based financing (RBF) is that payments to a service provider
are made contingent on the delivery of a pre-agreed result, with achievement of the result being
subject to independent verification.
An RBF approach is feasible as part of a broad package of measures to scale up the efficient and
clean cooking sector in Uganda – the larger goal being to achieve a range of benefits, including
health, in coordination with the government and key stakeholders. Results-based incentives should
be combined with robust monitoring and verification arrangements, institutional strengthening, and
awareness-raising campaigns to support progress in the sector over time.

What is the context for the design of an RBF approach?
There is an emerging market for improved cookstoves (ICS) in Uganda featuring multiple
producers, distributors and technology solutions. We estimate that the combined market size for
wood and charcoal ICS in Uganda is about 1.2 million units per year. This compares with current
annual ICS production (including imports) of around 0.24 million units. These estimates are based on
forecast population data,1 national survey data and interviews with the main producers of ICS
products that are aiming to serve the Uganda market.
The supply of ICS is dominated by one national supplier, Ugastoves, which is currently responsible
for around 50 per cent of all sales. Like most of the other larger suppliers, Ugastoves benefits from
carbon finance revenues that act as a subsidy for ICS products in the range of 20–40 per cent of the
full cost price. They also focus mainly on manufactured ICS products for the charcoal sector, where
there is relatively good access to urban and peri-urban markets and where consumers face high fuel
costs. They use a mix of approaches for sales and distribution, including “aggregators” such as
farmer cooperatives or health service agents. There are some indications that these aggregators will
be crucial in the emergence of a larger-scale market over time, particularly when targeting new
markets.
Although the sector is expanding thanks to carbon finance incentives, important barriers remain.
These barriers in particular impede higher-performance products and fuels that could achieve
significant health benefits in future through reduced pollutant emissions. Through close consultation
with active market participants in Uganda and internationally, this report identifies the main
barriers; Table 1 provides a breakdown by business model.

What is the policy objective?
The policy objective is to stimulate the uptake of efficient and clean cooking solutions that deliver
a range of benefits, including health, with an emphasis on facilitating the emergence of a
commercial market at scale.2

  A commercial market at scale is defined as a market in which (a) multiple actors serve multiple consumer
segments and (b) consumers purchase ICS without intervention.

There are three reasons for setting this objective. First, this approach is geared to generating long-
term benefits, including health, after any intervention has finished by resulting in a self-sustaining
commercial market. Long-term health benefits arise through the deployment and continued use of
high-quality ICS which have lower pollutant emissions. Second, by focusing on the uptake of efficient
and cleaner ICS, we can use proxy measures to quantify the actual health, environmental and other
benefits of ICS deployed, rather than realised or actual benefits – which can be challenging, and for
which new tools are being developed. A well-designed RBF scheme of this kind can attach greater
financial incentives to ICS that may deliver greater health benefits. Third, it does not prescribe a
particular business model, therefore providing the greatest incentive for innovation and sustainable
business development in the Ugandan ICS sector.
It is our assessment that to achieve commercial sustainability of the ICS market a focus on the
relatively well developed urban and peri urban (and higher end rural) consumers (who purchase
rather than collect fuel) is required. A subsequent programme that focuses on poorer consumers
(typically collecting fuel wood) could follow once the artisan model (or an alternative model) has
been validated. The emerging commercial urban and peri urban market may form the basis for
addressing more challenging market segments over time.

Which options will best address the identified barriers?
We have screened a long list of possible RBF options against two “pre-condition” criteria and five
further screening criteria. Figure 1 shows the four options we consider most likely to be effective.

How would results be defined?
Assessing the relative performance of ICS products is crucial to determining eligibility for all the
shortlisted RBF types. Although many different conceivable “results” could be set, any RBF scheme
must not only increase the scale of the market, but also address the question of ICS quality
standards if lasting benefits to health, environment and economy are to result.
RBF options targeting different tiers of ICS quality will achieve different outcomes . For instance,
placing an emphasis on emerging ICS technologies that have very low emissions will only attend to a
small (and typically better off) consumer group with limited potential for achieving
commercialisation at scale. A pilot, however, may draw new products into the market and provide a
platform for market transformation and longer term health benefits. A scheme that focuses on mid-
range technologies that are more widely available might achieve sustained ICS market growth and
the desired commercial market at scale; however, is likely to require additional initiatives to attain
long-term public health benefits from reduced household air pollution.
The International Standards Organization (ISO) has developed an International Workshop
Agreement (IWA) for ICS, which is a first step on the way to establishing ISO global standards. The
IWA defines five tiers of performance, ranked from zero (worst) to four (best) in the areas of
emissions, fuel efficiency, indoor emissions, and safety. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves
(GACC) has subsequently suggested minimum thresholds as tier 2 for efficiency, tier 3 for indoor and
total emissions during Phase 1 (2012–14) of its 10-year plan. In Uganda, the existing national
standard is being revised and may adopt IWA aspects. Work is also underway through the World
Bank ACCES Quality Assurance/Technical support programme4 to test existing ICS technologies that
are available in Uganda. This will help define performance characteristics for ICS products that may
subsequently be eligible for RBF support. For the purposes of this report RBF incentives are assumed
to be attached to agreed ISO IWA tiers.

What are the main considerations for RBF design and implementation?
The potential market size for a commercial market at scale is approximately 2.5 million
households. This is based on 100 per cent of urban and 29 per cent of rural population being in the
commercial segment for cookstoves and assumes an ICS penetration rate of 80 per cent. This
translates into a yearly demand of 1.2 million ICS.5
The high-level estimate of the cost of implementing a full RBF scheme to achieve this market scale
is between US$8 million and US$16 million plus administration costs. Scheme costs are based on
an incentive level from US$5 to US$10 per ICS and a total number of incentive ICS sales of 3.6 million
during the five years of the RBF intervention.6 In turn, this RBF level is based on an estimated7
current willingness to pay a price of below US$10 and an average charcoal ICS price of US$12 to
US$20.
Other RBF options to address the base-of-the-pyramid market, or higher-tier stoves, can be run in
tandem and are not mutually exclusive.
Using these RBF rates, a commercial market at scale should be achievable more quickly. Figure 2
shows one possible trajectory of ICS penetration, with and without the RBF.3
The assumption should be against restricting the list of potential agents for an RBF instrument.
When more agents are able to participate in an RBF, the likelihood of achieving the desired
outcomes increases. The RBF should potentially be open to all participants in the Ugandan ICS
market, including ICS suppliers currently engaging in any carbon finance scheme.
The design considerations must address a range of further issues : the trigger or condition for RBF
payment; the structure of any RBF payment; the size of the RBF payment; the duration of the RBF
intervention and the appropriate exit strategy. Each of these points is considered in turn in the
report. In addition, a number of complementary initiatives will be required to ensure that the
results-based incentives succeed; the most important will be the establishment of quality standards
(and testing arrangements) that will set the level against which the RBF payments will be made.
Other complementary measures include national awareness campaigns, policy changes to lower
costs and encourage investment, improving access to finance, and technical assistance including
business development support services.
The duration of the RBF program is flexible and depends on the market conditions, the size of the
payment and the ability of suppliers and consumers to respond to the RBF incentive – but is
approximated at five years. This is based on the use of RBF mechanisms to incentivise up to two-
thirds of the full potential ICS market and to double the current ICS market growth rate from 20 per
cent to 40 per cent.
Initial calculations suggest that the total potential value for money of the RBF intervention is
approximately US$64 million to US$147 million over the five years of RBF intervention and up to
approximately US$90 million to US$199 million over the seven years.

The government of Uganda and development partners have previous experience that can support
a detailed design and implementation process. The government has run a series of output-based
aid programs across different sectors, most notably in health and water supply but also in energy.
Previous modern energy access initiatives include the solar PV program under the Ministry of Energy
and Mineral Development (MEMD) Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) program, with the
involvement of the Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU), Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and
other partners. Our assessment is that international partners or government agencies could act as
Principal for an RBF program and that a detailed institutional capacity assessment will help
determine the optimal arrangements. International partners should take forward their existing plans
and integrate aspects of the RBF options following a detailed design and implementation process.

Final Report: Results-Based Financing for Clean Cookstoves in Uganda



1. Introduction
This report sets out the opportunity for implementing results-based financing (RBF) to support the
clean cookstoves sector in Uganda. Commissioned by the World Bank’s Africa Energy Unit (AFTEG)
under the Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES) Initiative, the report has been produced to
help the ACCES program and other development partners design and implement relevant RBF
approaches. Its findings are based on a review of relevant literature and close consultation with
relevant international and local stakeholders. The report builds on previous work relating to RBF for
the Energy Sector (World Bank, 2013a) and is part of a broader World Bank effort to examine the
potential for greater use of results-based approaches in the energy sector in developing countries.
Results-based financing (RBF) approaches are becoming an increasingly popular way to support
development objectives and wider public policy goals. The fundamental idea is that whoever is
responsible for implementing a development program (a ”principal” in the language of this report)
makes payments to service providers (an ”agent”) only upon the delivery of pre -agreed results, with
achievement of the results being subject to independent verification. Although RBF approaches have
been pioneered in the health sector, there has been increasing interest in whether and how they
could be used within the energy sector, and especially on how they might promote private sector
investment in low carbon energy sector opportunities (ESMAP, 2012). Previous research has shown
that, when applied in the right circumstances and designed appropriately, RBF approaches can
deliver strong development outcomes in a cost-effective manner as they (a) transfer risk to those
who are most able to control it and (b) leave the market open to respond as it chooses, enabling
innovation in markets and service delivery. However, the research also indicates that in the wrong
circumstances, or with poor design, RBF can be costly or ineffective, or both (World Bank, 2013a).
The World Bank is exploring RBF as a means of sustaining impact through market-level
development. Clean cooking interventions in Uganda are often focused at the project level, such as
transitioning cooking solutions at schools. A broader, market-stimulation approach might lead to a
sustainable transformation in energy access, reduce environmental pollution and generate health
and other benefits.
This study focuses on cookstoves rather than the full value chain (including cooking fuels) because
the disconnect between cookstove suppliers and final customers is a key bottleneck in the supply
chain. We have focused our analysis on economic agents that might be expected to respond best to
incentives, and on the part of the value chain where measurable economic, health and other
benefits might be most efficiently achieved. The report does not include, for instance, assessment of
the largely informal charcoal and wood product supply chains, including related RBF incentives to
support development outcomes, as this level of the supply chain is further away from the disconnect
between improved cookstove (ICS) suppliers and final customers and has been judged during
stakeholder meetings to be less likely to help overcome the barriers holding back development
objectives.
 Financing is one of many tools available to support development of the sector. Although the
report focuses on RBF in the ICS sector in Uganda, it also considers complementary measures that
are likely to be appropriate, such as improved certification and maintenance procedures. These
complementary measures could be incorporated into a conventional or RBF approach.

The main body of the report is structured as follows:
        Chapter 2 examines the innovation ecosystem for cookstoves in Uganda. This includes the
         main actors and activities, the market segments for improved cookstoves and the current
         penetration of ICS into different geographical zones of the country. It also looks at the
         different products and business models as well as the barriers to scaling up.
        Chapter 3 identifies various policy objectives and grades various RBF options against a set of
         screening criteria. The result is a shortlist of RBF options that could usefully be incorporated
         into future program design.
        Chapter 4 explores initial design considerations for RBF in this context including eligibility,
         trigger, payment structure, size of payment and exit strategy, as based on the ESMAP report
         (World Bank 2013b). It covers the possible market responses to the shortlisted RBF
         approaches and makes a preliminary assessment of value for money. Finally, it considers
         ways in which RBF approaches might best be implemented on a practical level.
        Chapter 5 outlines the recommendations, summarizing key constraints to scale-up and
         noting the complementary measures needed to ensure successful RBF implementation.

2. Innovation Ecosystems: the ICS sector in Uganda
In assessing the ICS market and its potential for scale-up, we take an Innovation Ecosystems
approach. This approach assesses the full value chain of the ICS, from production through
distribution and sales to the end consumer. It also considers co-innovators—other participants that
affect the value chain both directly and indirectly, such as fuel agents—and the enabling
environment, such as the policy and regulatory regime, financial markets, and the socio-political
status of the country.
Up to 30,000 ICS are currently produced each month in Uganda. Because the estimated commercial
market (see Annex 1) is approximately 90,000 per month, however, there is considerable potential
for scaling up. This is consistent with research by USAID under the TRAction Project (USAID, 2012a),
which indicates a high willingness to pay among rural communities when presented with the right
marketing messages and appropriate financial packages to support purchase—while noting that
these are lacking in the current market.

2.1 Main Actors and Activities
The main actors in the ICS sector are divided in to six group types:
    1.   Government agencies
    2.   National and international non-government organizations (NGOs)
    3.   Donors and international organisations
    4.   National research and testing centres
    5.   Stove manufacturers and distributors (the private sector and community groups)
    6.   Financial intermediaries including banks, community-based savings and credit cooperatives
         (SACCOs) and carbon finance agencies.
The main actors in the six groups identified above are listed in Annex 3, while ongoing activities
relating to ICS are detailed in Annex 2.
The nascent Uganda National Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (UNACC) is beginning to play a
coordinating role between these actors. UNACC has the objective, as defined in its National Country
Platform, to promote clean cooking in Uganda, maximising the benefits of clean cooking among its
members and the populace in general.

2.2 Market Segmentation
Consumers of ICS are not a homogenous group. Market segmentation for the sector in this report is
based on the World Bank’s 2013 report State of the Clean and Improved Cooking Sector in Sub-
Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2013b). This is summarised in Figure 3.

         The 2010 National Census for Uganda puts fuel mix at 73 per cent for wood and 22 per cent for
         charcoal.8 Although this is broadly similar to the East African averages shown in Figure 4) of 78 per
         cent for wood and 15 per cent for charcoal, the sizes in Uganda are slightly smaller for wood and
         modern fuels and slightly larger for charcoal.

                       The two need not be mutually exclusive. A step-oriented approach to building an economic market would
                    start with targeting those consumers best able and most willing to pay while business models are evolving and
                    strengthening. Targeting BoP would follow as part of a longer-term strategy of an established and viable
                    business.

             2.2.1 Market Size
As discussed in Section 3, we believe RBF schemes should focus on building a sustainable market at
scale so as to support the long-term realisation of health benefits. In this analysis we identify the
potential commercial market to be those households that currently pay for fuel as indicated in Figure
5 above. This includes a mix of wood, charcoal and modern fuel buyers.
Table 2 shows our estimate of market size, by stove fuel type, made on the basis of calculations
provided in Annex 1. This is the potential market size assuming no change in fuel use. Because
consumers are known to switch between fuel types or use more than one fuel type (often known
as “fuel stacking”), it is best to consider the market size as one figure of just over 103,000 ICS per
month.

             2.2.2 Cooking Behaviour
There is a significant disease burden associated with household air pollution (HAP). This includes
acute lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in young children; and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and lung cancer in women (and to a lesser degree men). In terms of disability-
adjusted life years (or lost healthy life years), HAP is the most important risk factor for women and
girls in most of Sub-Saharan Africa.11 The extent to which health is affected by the use or non-use of
ICS in Uganda depends on the fuel and cooking technology used as well as consumer behaviour.
Although there is no scientific consensus on how it affects health, “behaviour” includes where the
cooking takes place and thus who might be most affected by smoke produced. Data on this are
provided in Table 3.

2.3 Geographic Penetration of Current Cookstove Programs
Although there is limited information in the literature on the sources and regional distribution of
the ICS market in Uganda, Maps 1-3 illustrate the data we collected from local manufacturers in
mid-2013:
        Map 1: Cookstove manufacturers in Kampala and surrounding areas.
        Map 2: Districts in which cookstoves are currently sold.
        Map 3: Population by district.
As Map 1 shows, there is a clear concentration of stove manufacturers and importers in Kampala,
with only the International Lifeline Fund manufacturing cookstoves outside of the capital. This does
not include small-scale artisanal production of cookstoves through programs such as the Promotion
of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Programme (PREEEP) detailed in Annex 2.
As Map 2 shows, distribution is also concentrated in a few key districts around Kampala and
Eastern Central Uganda with the exception of Arua and Lira. While other districts to the west and
north are represented, the number of manufacturers targeting them is low (three or less).
As would be expected, the population clusters shown in Map 3 indicate some correlation with
Map 2, but exact figures on the numbers of stoves distributed by district are unavailable.

2.4 Existing Business Models
We have identified nine different interventions currently operating in Uganda in support of the ICS
market, as detailed in Annex 2. These interventions support two main types of business model – Artisanal
and Manufacturing.
In both cases the business models are propped up by considerable external support from donors or
carbon finance. Neither model can be considered self-sustaining or independently viable. Two further
business models exist based on biogas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); for ease of analysis, these have
been grouped into one model entitled Modern Fuels.
To help with targeting the RBF types and assessing the potential response to RBF incentives, we aim to
detail each market system both as it is and as it could be. This includes an understanding of (a) the barriers
to getting to scale, (b) the factors affecting the wider market ecosystem, and (c) how far along the market is
in terms of the four stages of development outlined in the Monitor Group’s 2012 report From Blueprint to
Scale: The case for philanthropy in impact investing.12 The four stages are summarised in Figure 6; the
overall analysis looks at the prerequisites for achieving the scale needed to “push” products to the base of
the pyramid (BoP).
Sections 2.4.1 to 2.4.3 discuss the Artisanal, Manufacturing, and Modern Fuels models in turn.

           2.4.1 The Artisanal Business Model
This model is typified by un-mechanised small-scale rural producers that have been trained, via donor
programs, to locally produce and sell basic improved cookstoves. The cookstoves are made from locally dug
clay and in some cases assembled with metal liners brought in from Kampala. GIZ’s PREEEP program
currently has about 800 stove producers working in 28 districts, with 260 set up as businesses running
commercially in rural districts. Production capacity per production unit varies significantly; the program has
computed an average recent production rate of five stoves per production unit per month, giving an
average production rate of 4,000 per month, or 48,000 per year.13 The stoves sell for USh 10,000–15,000
(US$4–6) each, which represents true cost with no subsidy (not including additional support from donors
through artisan training and consumer awareness programs). Examples of stove types are shown in Table 4.

          Manufacturing capacity. Artisans who produce ICS are currently identified and trained by donor
           programs. As individual small-scale producers, they have limited capacity to scale up production,
           have very limited access to capital, may be dependent on ongoing donor support, and are usually
           not perceived as credit-worthy.
          Quality. ICS quality is a critical issue if benefits are to be realised by consumers. Low-quality stoves
           can damage the market through poor reputation and subsequent lower adoption rates. Artisanal
           models, although overseen by donors through support programs, do not have any formal testing or
           quality standards, and stove quality may vary considerably.
          Willingness to pay. Low consumer awareness of the benefits of ICS, coupled with high levels of
           poverty in rural areas, can result in a low willingness (and ability) to pay. Although microfinance
           services in rural areas can offer consumers a way to purchase the cookstoves through staged
           payments (which have been demonstrated to increase willingness to pay), such services are
           currently highly limited.15
The artisanal model has two advantages:
          Local production. Artisanal producers are close to consumers and have a good understanding of
           their needs and desires. This proximity also avoids costly and difficult transportation. A
           disadvantage is that the local market can become saturated, impairing long-term sustainability.
          Low entry costs. There are very low overheads, ensuring low entry costs and thus enabling new
           artisans to enter the market.
These key strengths and weaknesses, which represent factors integral to the market system, are
summarised and supplemented in Table 5. This table is the output of a workshop organised by UNACC and
attended by its members as well as others.

The critical issue that arises from this analysis is the potential impact of subsidies on centrally
manufactured or imported cookstoves, including those from carbon finance programs. This could result in a
high degree of competition for artisans, with knock-on effects on their livelihoods. The nature of the
artisanal business model – that inputs are locally readily available and not subject to price fluctuations, and
that production and sales are within the local community – means that the business model is less reliant on
external markets or co-innovators such as transport agents or fuel providers.
Ability to achieve commercialisation at scale
The target consumer segment is focused on Base of the Pyramid and the business model is currently
supported by donor agencies. The long-term commercial viability of this model is still being tested16 and
modified to increase sustainability for artisans, which places the model within the “Validation” stage of the
From Blueprint to Scale stages shown earlier in Figure 6. It is as yet unclear whether this model has the
potential to achieve commercialisation at scale.

          2.4.2 The Manufactured Business Model
The Manufactured Business Model (Figure 8) is the dominant model in Uganda, with a large number of
actors. The model is defined as including all manufacturers producing more than 20017 ICS per month at a
central point for distribution and sale. The model includes everything from low- and no-mechanisation ICS
manufacture to highly mechanised manufacture, though the latter is currently represented only by
imported models, as shown in Figure 9.

The range in mechanisation and quality of materials used leads to varying degrees of ICS quality. Table 6
shows selected examples of models from some of the larger manufacturers.
This market is dominated by charcoal stoves sold to urban and peri-urban consumers, the exception
being imported wood stoves distributed by UpEnergy using carbon finance to help address market barriers
and subsidise prices. All the other manufacturers produce mainly charcoal stoves, with a small number of
woodstoves produced on demand. Current production of charcoal ICS is between 25,000 and 30,000 per
month18 and production rates for locally produced wood ICS are between 419 and 30020 per month, all on
demand; this is to be compared to an estimated total ICS market of 110,000 per month (see Annex 1).
Two new high-performance models are soon to enter the market in Uganda: the Philips Stove and Biolite
stove. The latter is supported by GACC’s Spark program and plans to distribute approximately 3,000 units in
its first year, with the potential to scale up production considerably. The Biolite stove burns wood and
biomass and is targeted at rural and peri-urban consumers.
Although factory-level production is currently done outside Uganda – Envirofit in Kenya and China, and
Philips in Lesotho, being two examples – potential exists to establish factory production in Uganda under
the right conditions. Given sufficient volume and a viable market price, a number of manufacturers of
other goods (see Box 1) may also be able to rapidly introduce large-scale factory production of ICS.

     Box 1: Can Uganda scale up ICS production?
     Uganda’s manufacturing sector is relatively well developed, with the percentage of GDP coming from
     manufacturing (8 per cent in 2011) broadly average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The sector produces agricultural tools,
     casements (such as doors and windows), wire and fencing, furniture and steel pipes, and a range of other steel
     products.
     There is interest in the ICS sector as the stoves are known to be relatively straightforward to design and
     manufacture at scale. The key barrier to new national entrants is confidence in the demand for products at scale
     of around 1 million units. Manufacturers include Alam Group, Madhavani Group, Mukwano and Roofings.



Distribution: There are two primary routes to distribution in this model: via sales outlets such as hardware
stores, or through aggregators such as farmer cooperatives, community groups and other sales agents.
Evidence from interviews suggests that the latter approach is gaining momentum and is responsible for the
greatest increase in sales in the market (see Box 2).

     Box 2: Living Goods: The aggregator model of distribution
     Living Goods is a non-profit health-focused agency whose mission is to reduce the under-5 child mortality rate in
     Uganda. The agency, in partnership with BRAC, the largest NGO in the world, follows the “Avon” model of door-to-
     door distribution and has 1000 women agents selling malaria, diarrheal and pregnancy products. They also sell
     products that can help buyers earn a living, such as ICS and solar energy products.
     Each agent has approximately 100 clients (giving access to 100,000 clients), and they sell with a 20% margin on top
     of cost price.Since teaming up with Ugastoves, within a 12 month period sales have increased from 800 charcoal
     ICS per month to 4000 per month, and cookstoves now account for over a third of all sales revenue. Living
     Goods plans to expand distribution volume, contingent on a reliable supply from manufacturers. Living Goods is
     also benefiting from carbon finance linked to ICS sales, selling approximately 200 wood-burning ICS per month.
     Distribution is currently in the following regions: Jinja, Masaka, Mokono, Mpigi, Nsangi and Kewwempe
     (Kampala).

 The Uganda Carbon Bureau is establishing similar stove distribution models through their component
project activities (CPA) model.21 Examples include the International Medical Foundation serving Kampala
(charcoal) and the Kakira Sugar Fair Trade Farmer Cooperative, whose 10,000 farmer members provide
access to several million households.
Although distribution is hampered by poor road infrastructure and high transport costs, this does not
appear to be a significant impediment to market growth.
Consumers: This model typically appeals to urban and peri-urban charcoal purchasers, with the exception
of some advanced (gassifier) woodstove suppliers. Many manufacturers produce both charcoal- and wood-
burning stoves, with the latter typically at a smaller scale and often to order.
Barriers to commercialisation at scale: The SWOT analysis undertaken by the guests of the UNACC’s RBF
Workshop in Kampala on 24 June 2013 consolidates and confirms the critical issues that affect this business
model, as shown in Table 7.



21
  A program of activities (PoA) provides the organizational and methodological framework for CPAs that have the
same stated goal. Compared to traditional CDM projects, CPAs have a much shorter time to market and lower costs
for project operators who wish to secure carbon finance revenue.

The key barriers to this market segment include the following:
        Consumer awareness and willingness to pay: Recent consumer research (TNS, 2013) has found that
         (a) 58–60 per cent of consumers are “not sure” that an ICS saves either time or money and (b) most
         consumers (70–82 per cent) say that if they really want something they can find a way for paying
         for it. This indicates that consumer awareness is the critical factor affecting willingness to pay.
         Further to this, our own interviews with Ugastoves and Living Goods (see Box 3) indicate a high
         degree of willingness to pay when investment is made in distribution and sales, thereby increasing
         consumer awareness. Although demand for charcoal-burning stoves is strong at around the US$7
         price range for urban and peri-urban purchasers, this is not the case for many rural customers. For
         higher-price (and higher-quality) stoves there is a gap between cost of production and consumer
         willingness to pay. However, a price of US$7 does not provide sufficient surplus for marketing and
         after-sales maintenance, further limiting consumer awareness.

            Box 3: Establishing suitable ICS Quality Standards
            Discussions are ongoing regarding the best way to define standards for improved cookstoves in the
            developing world. Although national performance-based standards have been developed and
            implemented in a few countries (including Uganda), no international standard yet contains commonly
            accepted criteria by which to define “clean” with regard to cookstoves. Such an international standard
            would significantly enhance efforts to see clean cookstoves adopted at scale.
            An International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Workshop Agreement (IWA) was
            finalized and affirmed in 2012. The IWA provides guidance for rating cookstoves on four key performance
            indicators: fuel use/efficiency, total emissions, indoor emissions and safety. For each indicator, it defined
            five performance tiers, ranked from 0 (worst) to 4 (best). This International Workshop Agreement (IWA) is
            the first step towards establishing ISO global standards and protocols.
            In Uganda, the existing national standard is being revised and may adopt suitable aspects of the IWA. In
            addition, at the time of writing, the World Bank’s ACCES Quality Assurance and Technical Support pillar
            aims to give the initiative a solid technical foundation to ensure that the cooking technologies promoted
            are of high quality and provide real benefits both to African families and communities and to the global
            climate and environment. In year 1, this pillar has four central objectives: 1) assess baseline product,
            manufacturing, and testing quality and capacity in three countries of engagement (Senegal, Democratic
            Republic of Congo, and Uganda); 2) customize existing standards frameworks such as the ISO IWA and
            quality assessment methodologies for use in the ACCES initiative; 3) set quality thresholds for World Bank
            support in the three focus countries; and 4) design technical support packages for testing centers and
            manufacturers to support quality improvement.
            The ACCES team is led by Berkeley Air Monitoring Group with contributions from Colorado State
            University, Winrock International and several other technical experts.


          Access to Finance: This is a critical constraint mentioned by all market actors along the value chain.
           The traditional banking sector does not recognise ICS as a bankable business, and lending rates are
           typically as high as 26–32 per cent per year. This results in a serious capital constraint across all
           elements of the market system. Banks that target smaller businesses and microfinance, such as
           Centenary Bank and Opportunity Bank, do not provide loans to start-ups without collateral. On the
           consumer side, loans made at the point of purchase have greater potential through group loans or
           for consumers that already have access to credit. The still-nascent mobile banking system could in
           time allow customers to make staged payments, increasing the willingness to pay (see Section 3.3).
           This may prove to be the most preferable route in Uganda given that loans are not popular and the
           culture of repayment is poor.22 For instance, in 2011, there were only nine borrowers from
           commercial banks per 1000 adults in Uganda, compared with a Sub-Saharan African average of 45
           borrowers per 1000 adults.
          Stove Quality and Testing: As with the Artisanal Model, stove quality and testing remain
           considerable barriers to the market. Small-scale manufacturers have expressed a certain amount of
           unwillingness to scale up their production capacity until they are fully aware of the future stove
           standards required. Meanwhile, the high degree of variability in stove performance affects
           consumer confidence.23 Testing costs are high, and without a minimum standard for Uganda the

           main incentive is to generate carbon finance revenues, which are usually directly linked to ICS
           efficiency.
          Mechanisation: Most Ugandan manufacturers have very low levels of mechanisation. Ugastove, the
           largest ICS manufacturer, has some metal cutting equipment and has recently invested in a new
           brick kiln, but production is labour intensive. Existing manufacturers in Uganda cannot easily
           increase volume of production in response to consumer demand. There is, however, potential for
           new entrants currently manufacturing goods in Uganda to undertake factory production.
Despite these considerable market barriers, the manufactured charcoal-burning ICS sector is gaining
momentum. New actors are emerging and this, coupled with growing demand from a middle class
increasingly aware of the benefits of ICS, is strengthening the market. Raw materials are readily available
and the cost of labour is low. It is our opinion that the commercial viability of the business model is well
tested and that the sector is in the third, “Prepare” stage of the From Blueprint to Scale report (see Figure
6) where the focus is on consumer awareness, supply chains and organisational capacity. This business
model is close to being ready to roll out to large numbers of customers. What is not known is the potential
to scale up wood-burning ICS to rural markets.
As summarised earlier in Figure 8, there are a number of opportunities and threats to the Manufactured
Business Model. One of the greatest opportunities for achieving scale (though also a threat to current
producers) is the introduction of mechanised manufacturing by factories in Uganda producing other goods.
Encouraging new entrants of this kind will require a clear market with sufficient volume (an estimated 1
million households) at sufficient value (about US$10–12 per unit).24 The role of government is also crucial:
government policy and legislation on ICS standards and testing, as well as awareness programs such as
Energy Week, could usefully support to the sector. Meanwhile, taxes and tariffs on raw materials and fuels
could have a detrimental effect.
A critical co-innovation factor for this market is charcoal and wood production. It is not clear what impact
increased used of charcoal ICS would have on demand for charcoal. Promotion of charcoal ICS over wood
could have knock-on environmental effects which need further investigation.
In summary, the manufactured charcoal ICS market appears to be on the cusp of commercial viability. Most
current manufacturers concentrate on the charcoal ICS sector and receive support from donors and/or
carbon finance. But their business models are not entirely contingent on this support. Activities required to
“prepare” the market to go to scale are hampered by a lack of both finance and the large-scale awareness-
raising required to increase willingness to pay at a commercial level. Although in some cases production
levels are increasing rapidly (Ugastove and EUF, for example), the total numbers remain low and
manufacturers are not in a position to grow to significant scale without support or incentive. Evidence
based on current market activity in Uganda suggests that commercially promoted wood ICS would require
a higher incentive than has been available through carbon finance.

           2.4.3 The Modern Fuels Business Model
The third and final ICS business model, Modern Fuels, consolidates two separate stove types: those burning
biogas and those using liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG. The market for biogas stoves remains small. For
example, the Uganda Domestic Biogas Programme built 560 units by June 2011, with 20,000 plants planned
by 2013. Waste collection and biogas production systems are generally locally fabricated, using some local

materials as well as livestock (and some agricultural) waste and converting it to biogas for cooking on-site.
The stoves themselves can be either locally fabricated or imported.
LPG stoves are in a different technology category. These are typically imported from China, India and the
European Union. LPG itself is sourced through conventional petrochemical supply chains, largely for the
high-end urban market. Examples of stoves are provided in Table 8 and a summary of the markets in Figure
10. The size of the biogas market is unknown, but potential for development exists by targeting cattle
farmers in the West of Uganda. The LPG market is estimated at approximately 2000 ICS per month, driven
primarily by LPG fuel providers rather than ICS manufacturers.

As Table 9 shows, the high quality of modern-fuel stoves, in terms of both emissions levels and product
standards, comes at a high price. This in turn limits the customer base, although the size of the middle class
consumer group is growing.

External factors affecting the LPG market are considerable. Both the stove technology and, more
importantly, the fuel are imported. This creates vulnerability to international market price fluctuations as
well as import tariffs and levies. Although consumer concerns about the volatility and safety of LPG are
being addressed, they still affect consumer confidence.
The biogas ICS market is still nascent and heavily dependent on both raising awareness and the technical
capacity to produce on-farm biogas. However, the development of on-farm biogas is supported by a
number of donors across East Africa focused on developing technology, supporting installation and
leveraging carbon credits. Benefits to farmers, beyond energy access, include fertilizer production and
financial returns from selling excess biogas. The large number of cattle farmers in Western Uganda and the
range of subsidies and support provided by donors provide potential for the continued growth of this
market.

2.5 Summary of the Innovation Ecosystem
The foregoing assessment of the three business models – Artisanal, Manufactured, and Modern Fuels –
indicates the commercial dominance of the urban and peri-urban market for improved charcoal-burning
stoves, even though it continues to depend on support from both donors and carbon finance.
Because most charcoal stove manufacturers also make wood stoves (albeit on a small scale), they could
respond to increased demand from rural consumers for wood ICS. Stimulation of the woodstove ICS market
is underway through both support to artisanal producers and the efforts of carbon credit agencies in
promoting the Envirofit and Ezy woodstoves to rural consumers. The long-term commercial viability of the
wood ICS market, however, is yet to be validated. (See Figure 11.)
In our view, what the ICS market needs to achieve commercial sustainability at scale (i.e., multiple actors
providing multiple products) is a focus on the relatively well developed urban and peri-urban (and higher-
end rural) consumers who purchase rather than collect fuel. Then, once the Artisanal model (or an
alternative) has been validated, a subsequent program could focus on poorer, typically wood-collecting

addressing more challenging market segments.25

For our purposes, we are focusing on the “high” importance barriers and suggest that barriers of medium
importance be addressed through complementary measures.

2.6 The Enabling Environment
The enabling environment in Uganda comprises three main elements: policies and regulations, financial
markets, and socio-political factors.

         2.6.1 Policies and Regulations
The role of policies and regulations on the market is significant. Significant policy drivers include:
        Import duties on cook stoves – Imported stoves such as the Envirofit are subject to import duties
         of 25 per cent.
        Import duties on metals – Metal for the cladding on ICS is the greatest material cost, and can
         represent up to 80 per cent of the stove price.26 The Import duty on sheet metal is currently 25 per
         cent.
        Withholding tax of 6 per cent.
        Value Added Tax – ICS are subject to VAT at a current rate of 18 per cent;27 other energy products,
         such as solar products, have been exempted.
        Cookstove standards and testing – There are no national minimum standards for ICS.
        Environmental and Energy Policy – National policies on deforestation, environmental protection,
         and energy access all affect the sector. Further investigation of the policy framework is required.
        Charcoal – As the predominant ICS fuel, all policies that affect the charcoal market have a knock-on
         effect on the ICS market. There is currently no direct tax on charcoal, though traders are subject to
         tax. All policies or regulations that affect the supply and market cost of charcoal and wood will have
         a knock-on effect on the ICS market.
        LPG – As an imported product, LPG is subject to international fluctuations in price as well as import
         duties. The current import duty is 7 per cent and the import license commission is 2 per cent. It is
         exempt from VAT.
There has been notable policy progression in the decentralised energy access sector, in particular the
current exemption of solar energy products from import duties and VAT.

Although this report focuses on household ICS, it is worth pointing out that policies for institutional ICS
could also affect household production, given that the manufacturers are typically the same within Uganda.
The Ugandan Ministry of Energy estimates that there are 17,000 schools in Uganda cooking on open fires
every day.28 Policies that promote or legislate for the adoption of ICS within schools will – in addition to the
direct social, environmental and financial benefits – help support the household ICS market through greater
awareness, strengthening ICS providers in Uganda and promoting inward investment in the sector.

         2.6.2 Financial Markets
The financial markets affect the Ugandan ICS market in four main ways:
     1. Carbon finance – This currently plays a significant role. For those producers and distributors that
        are contracted with a carbon finance partner, the effective subsidy is in the range of 20–40 per cent
        of the final sales price.29 However, the carbon market is currently very weak and volatile, with
        voluntary markets offering higher prices than compliance-based markets in recent years.30
     2. Commercial loans – Currently the small-scale energy sector – and in particular the ICS market – are
        not seen as bankable businesses in Uganda. Loan rates are very high at 25–32 per cent a year and
        subject to change.
     3. Consumer finance – Microfinance is available throughout Uganda, particularly through group
        loans, but is subject to the availability of capital. The poor perception of the ICS market by banks
        and lending agents also limits potential. Community-based savings and credit cooperatives
        (SACCOs) play an important role in consumer finance.
     4. Mobile banking – Considerable potential exists with mobile banking: more than 30 million people
        in Uganda have phones, whereas only 4 million have bank accounts. Transaction volumes have
        grown exponentially. Although mobile banking technology is still in its infancy in Uganda – subject
        to abuse, high transaction costs and consumer uncertainty – experience from across East Africa
        and discussions in Uganda indicate that teething problems can be overcome.

         2.6.3 Socio-political factors
Cultural factors also play an important role in the cookstove sector. Traditional fires affect the taste of the
food and it is hard to encourage people to abandon their taste preferences; awareness campaigns,
therefore, have an important role to play.

Other factors, such as low loan rates and a poor culture of lending and repayment, are also relevant when
considering ways to tackle financial market barriers. Corruption is a particular problem in Uganda, which
currently ranks 130th out of 171 in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.31 The
problem of pervasive corruption will enhance the need for rigorous results testing prior to paying for RBF,
with a knock-on effect on costs.

3. Results-Based Financing
The fundamental idea behind results-based financing (RBF) approaches is that payments that would
otherwise be made automatically are made contingent on the delivery of pre-agreed result(s), with
achievement of the result(s) being subject to independent verification. RBF approaches were pioneered in
the health sector32 but there has been increasing interest in whether and how they could be used within
the energy sector, and especially on how they might promote private sector investment in (low-carbon)
energy sector opportunities (ESMAP, 2012).
The main difference between RBF and conventional approaches, such as upfront grants, is the way in
which the risk of project failure is allocated between principal and agent. 33 Under a conventional
approach, the financial risks of project failure are borne mainly by the principal: if the project fails to deliver
the anticipated results, the principal’s resources will already have been committed and will be
(substantially) unrecoverable. By contrast, under an RBF approach, the risks borne by the principal are
reduced: if the project fails to deliver the expected results, the financial resources of the principal are not
expended. By corollary, the opposite is true for the agent: under an RBF approach it faces substantially
greater risk as if the project fails as it will receive no contribution from the principal; these risks are
lessened for the agent under a conventional approach.
The desirability and effectiveness of an RBF instrument therefore depends on whether this allocation of risk
is appropriate: when the additional risks placed on agents can be easily absorbed by agents, and they
respond to this additional risk by having a stronger incentive to deliver results, then an RBF approach is
likely to be a cost-effective way of delivering the desired outcomes. By corollary, when the agent cannot
easily absorb and respond to the additional risks, then the RBF may not be appropriate.
The remainder of this section is structured as follows:
         Section 3.1 determines the policy objectives for any intervention in the Ugandan cookstove sector.
         Section 3.2 summarises the current constraints holding back the development of the sector.
         Section 3.3 identifies a range of different RBF instrument design options, and scores them against a
          range of criteria that help to identify their appropriateness.
         Section 3.4 provides a short list of suitable RBF options which form the basis of the design
          considerations in Section 4.

3.1 Policy Objectives
Based on discussions with stakeholders, we have identified three possible policy objectives for any
intervention in the Ugandan cookstove sector that seeks to deliver lasting benefits:

     1. To stimulate the uptake of efficient and clean cooking solutions that deliver a range of benefits,
        including health, with an emphasis on facilitating the emergence of a commercial market at




32
  See, for instance, http://www.rbfhealth.org/rbfhealth/
33
  In this work, the principals are most likely international donors, the government or other large organisations (such
as the PSFU) that have interest in, and the institutional capacity to monitor, an RBF agreement to encourage ICS
deployment. The agents will depend on the type of RBF used, but are most likely ICS manufacturers, financial
institutions or other organisations working in the ICS sector in Uganda. An assessment of their institutional capacity is
undertaken for each RBF.

         scale.34 This approach focuses attention on consumers who, although likely to be willing and able to
         purchase ICS in the future, may need an additional stimulus in the short term. Those consumers
         who are unlikely to represent a commercial proposition for ICS manufacturers and retailers in the
         medium-to-long term are neglected by this objective (even if their use of an ICS may deliver
         significant health or other benefits).
     2. To promote rapid installation of clean cookstoves within a defined timeframe to deliver health
        benefits. This objective focuses on areas where ICS use results in the greatest short-term health
        benefits. Less attention is given to the extent to which some consumers are willing to pay for
        cookstoves that is close to an unsubsidised market price.
     3. To encourage the emergence of radical and innovative approaches to the manufacture,
        distribution or retail of efficient and clean ICS. This approach hypothesises that inappropriate
        business models are the main constraint to market development, and thus looks to support
        alternative approaches.

Objective 1 is preferred for three reasons.
First, stimulating a commercial market at scale is probably the best option for generating long-term
benefits beyond the duration of the intervention. Benefits in the short and long terms arise from the
deployment and continued use of ICS that have better fuel efficiency but, as quality improves, have lower
pollutant emissions. There are already local as well as foreign ICS manufacturers active in the Ugandan
market (see Section 2.4). An RBF approach that focuses on boosting awareness among those with the
greatest ability to pay may help increase demand while allowing manufacturers to realise scale benefits
that help them expand their market. The combination might foster the development of a larger sustainable
market that can continue to deliver health benefits. The benefits from focusing intervention where there is
greatest scope for developing a self-sustaining market – rather than necessarily on rapid deployment of
cookstoves – can be seen from experiences in other countries, most notably Kenya (Rai, 2009).
Second, by adopting an approach that places emphasis on whether consumers wish to purchase
cookstoves, there is less need to specifically quantify the health and environmental benefits of ICS use,
which can be a challenging task. Health benefits may still be realised through an appropriately designed
RBF approach that targets low-emissions solutions including LPG, and can be measured through proxies
such as air pollutants. A recent systematic review of livelihoods impacts (IOB, 2013) shows the huge
potential benefits from ICS deployment. Impact research in Sub-Saharan Africa is underrepresented,
however, and studies suggest that it is not the ICS itself but human behaviour that is the dominant factor in
determining health and environmental benefits. Given this, concretely tying the RBF objectives to the
delivery of these benefits – such as improved health outcomes, as implied by objective 2 – may be very
difficult. It should nonetheless be emphasised that the establishment of a commercial market at scale is
expected to deliver very real and significant benefits beyond health (see Section 4). Further still, the RBF
approach can be designed to incentivise the delivery of these benefits. In particular, it can provide greater

  A commercial market at scale is defined as a market in which (a) multiple actors serve multiple consumer segments
and (b) consumers purchase ICS without intervention.

incentive to the deployment and use of high-quality clean cooking solutions such as advanced ICS products,
including LPG stoves, that that correlate with delivering health benefits.35
Third, in contrast to objective 3, focusing on the establishment of a commercial market does not
prescribe a particular business model but leaves entrepreneurs open to innovate and invent cost-
efficient business models, and provides the greatest incentive for innovation and sustainable business
development in the Ugandan ICS sector. Objective 3 directly influences the business model and, as such,
risks alienating existing suppliers and consumers. Initiatives pursuing similar objectives have failed to
generate sustainable long-term benefits in the past, including large donor-driven stove programs in the
1970s and 1980s.
This objective can be mapped onto the three segments of the Ugandan cookstove sector discussed in
Section 2:
    1. Low-quality, wood-burning artisanal stoves used predominantly in rural areas. Most activity in this
        area is donor-driven, with an estimated turnover of 4,000 stoves per month;
    2. Manufactured, mainly charcoal-burning stoves of medium quality in urban and peri-urban areas.
        This is where the bulk of the commercial activity is currently focused, with Ugastove and other
        producers currently supplying about 20,000 improved cookstoves per month;36 and
    3. High-quality cookstoves imported or domestically produced, sold to urban consumers, and fuelled
        by wood, charcoal and refined fuels.
The objective of creating a commercial market at scale implies primary focus on the medium-quality
segment. This reflects where there is the greatest market opportunity, given current willingness to pay
among Ugandan consumers. This also offers significant socio-economic benefits including large fuel savings
for households. However, an RBF approach can be designed, along with its duration, to encourage either
higher-quality cookstoves over time, including those with fewer health impacts, or encourage penetration
to poorer rural house-holds typically collecting firewood. These do not need to be mutually exclusive, and
different segments can be targeted simultaneously – in other words, an RBF program targeting higher-
quality stoves with health benefits could run concurrently with an RBF program targeting lower-tier stoves
that will achieve fuel savings and greater market penetration.
While the objective to create a commercial market at scale is expected to deliver the greatest benefits at
the lowest costs, other options could be considered depending on the objectives of the donor and
principal. One option might be to focus on improved cookstoves for rural three-stone fire users. Likewise,
focusing only on health benefits through reduced HAP might imply primary focus on the high-quality
segment, which offers the greatest pollutant reductions but will reach a smaller number of people.
However, these are not considered further in this analysis.

3.2 The Constraints on Market Development
This section distils the main constraints holding back greater penetration of ICS within this market
segment to evaluate whether proposed RBF approaches would overcome them. It concentrates on two
main barriers: low consumer awareness and lack of access to finance.



35
   ICS products that achieve substantial reduced household air pollution (HAP) commensurate with delivering health
benefits are currently not distributed beyond pilot studies in Uganda and come at a high unit cost in the range USD
40–80. (Interviews June 2013)

The first main barrier is low consumer awareness of ICS benefits and the corresponding low willingness
to pay. Consumers are unaware of the fuel savings and secondary benefits, such as reduced smoke
production, derived from ICS use. This results in an overall low willingness to pay for ICS, below the
economic benefits, which are mainly fuel savings for charcoal and refined fuels as well as reduced time
gathering and preparing fuelwood. (The benefits of ICS use are quantified in Section 4.3 and illustrated in
Table 21.) Suppliers are either not interested in advertising the benefits or do not have sufficient capital or
capacity for marketing. For example, extra revenues such as carbon finance are used to lower the price of
cookstoves rather than for information or marketing campaigns.37

The second main barrier is access to finance for both ICS suppliers as well as consumers, which increases
the difficulty of expanding ICS supply operations and constrains consumer’s ability to pay. The World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report (WEF, 2013) identifies access to financing as the second
biggest barrier to business across all aspects of the economy. Commercial credit is mostly unavailable to
small and medium-sized suppliers or is available at very restrictive interest rates, for example at 25–30 per
cent per year.38 Consumer lending for small investments, for example below US$30, is virtually non-
existent. Group loans have been used before by Ugandan financial institutions and can, together with

SACCOs, represent the initial main channel to deliver consumer finance. However, even group loans do not
allow for feasible interest rates, especially in light of the lack of consumer awareness of ICS benefits and
the resulting low willingness to pay.
Because RBF itself does not entail up-front finance, it does not overcome the initial financing constraints
ICS suppliers face. It is reasonable to assume, based on the interview evidence obtained in Uganda in June
2013, that new suppliers will enter the market given sufficient consumer demand. Returns need to be high
enough per ICS sold to encourage suppliers to invest in building consumer awareness; the current price
point does not allow this and thus suppresses the market. With the carbon price incentive alone, new
suppliers have started operations from scratch and it is therefore likely that new small entrants will appear.
In addition, large manufacturing or industrial firms in Uganda are willing and able to enter a commercial
market at scale, which would lead to the entry of relatively large ICS production capacity. It is reasonable to
assume a continuum of new entrants between artisanal suppliers and full-scale manufacturing firms that
could enter the Ugandan ICS market and supply ICS of a given quality tier and required pollutant reduction.
Figure 12 above helps to demonstrate how an RBF program targeted at producers may help to lower ICS
prices, thus lowering the right hand box in the graph, whereas an RBF program targeted at consumers may
help to raise consumer willingness to pay for an ICS, thus raising the left hand box in the graph.
The remaining obstacles identified in Section 3 can be overcome by complementary measures beyond
the scope of the proposed RBF options. The remaining obstacles are minor in comparison with the lack of
financing and low consumer willingness to pay and can be overcome by complementary, potentially non-
RBF measures. These can build on current initiatives such as ACCES, which seeks to promote enterprise-
based, large-scale dissemination and adoption of clean cooking solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Further discussion on complementary measures is provided in Annex 4.
Quality and testing, although not a critical barrier to establishing a commercial market at scale, becomes
a critical element in establishing an RBF program, particularly one aiming to increase health and
environmental outcomes, because testing will establish the tier at which the RBF is paid.

3.3 RBF Options and Scoring Criteria
This section identifies (a) a wide range of potential RBF options for stimulating greater ICS penetration in
Uganda and (b) a methodology for filtering the options according to their likelihood of achieving the
objective. The selection and scoring is based on internal team discussions and liaison with Ugandan
stakeholders and other market experts. This section evaluates whether a long list of nine potential RBFs
tackles the main barriers in the Ugandan ICS market and scores each RBF against criteria developed by Vivid
Economics for the ESMAP report on RBF in energy projects. (World Bank, 2013a)
The result is a shortlist of four RBF options, which are analysed in detail with regard to their design
considerations, implementation modalities, and economics such as value for money. The shortlist
includes options for targeting different market actors.
The final design considerations, implementation modalities and economic benefits are based on the
current state of research and are to be refined in later stages, beyond this feasibility report. Under the
ACCES Quality Assurance and Technical Support Pillar, Berkeley Air Monitoring Group and partners (see Box
3 in Section 2) are testing currently available ICS in Uganda to measure their health, fuel saving and other
benefits. The results of this, which are due in 2014 (past the finalising of this report), will be a crucial input
into this subsequent phase of work.

         3.3.1 Candidate RBF Options
The candidate options can be put into four categories according to their focus – suppliers, consumers,
finance providers, and maintenance providers. Under each category a number of different options can be
identified.
Suppliers:

     1. An RBF payment is made for every additional ICS sold that meets certain quality standards;39
     2. An RBF payment is made for every additional ICS sold that meets certain quality standards for
        which continued use can be demonstrated;
     3. An RBF payment is made whose value is linked explicitly to the value that the ICS has provided in
        terms of reducing emissions, improving health or other outcomes;
     4. An RBF payment is made to cover the additional transport costs associated with the sale (or
        continued use) of ICS in a geographically remote area; and
     5. An RBF payment is made for the successful certification that a particular stove design meets a
        specified quality standard.
Consumers:

     6. Consumers receive vouchers that can be redeemed against the purchase of a pre-defined high-
        quality ICS to reduce its cost.
Finance providers:

     7. An RBF payment is made to finance providers according to the value of the loans they make to
        either producers or consumers to finance the production or sale of a high-quality ICS; and
     8. An RBF payment is made to finance providers according to the value of the loans they make to
        either producers or consumers to finance the production or sale of a high quality ICS after those
        loans have been paid back.
Maintenance providers:

     9. An RBF payment is made for every ICS that undergoes a maintenance inspection.

Across all of these different options, there is an important question about how they may interact with
existing carbon market activity in the country. This is explored further in Box 4.
      Box 4: The interaction between RBF incentives and carbon markets
 A key over-arching design issue relates to the way in which any RBF incentive relates with current or
 prospective carbon market activity. The question is whether the sales or use of cookstoves supported by
 carbon market revenues should be entitled to also benefit from an RBF payment.
 We assume that any RBF incentive will be additional to revenues received from the carbon market – in other
 words, that those benefitting from carbon market revenues will also be able to receive any RBF incentive
 payment. This reflects the idea that the objective of the RBF program is to develop a self-sustaining market in
 cookstoves in Uganda so as to promote health and other benefits. There are a number of reasons to suspect
                                                                     40
 that carbon revenues, in isolation, may not deliver these benefits:



39
   This, and options 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8, could be further refined by offering different payments depending on specific
stove standards. More detail is provided in Section 4.

          As discussed in Section 2, even with carbon market revenues, there is currently insufficiently value
           being created by the sale of cookstoves in Uganda to undertake the promotional and marketing activity
           necessary to raise consumer awareness, thereby building a self-sustaining market. The additional
           resources from the RBF can assist with this. This is particularly important given the current low carbon
           market prices and concerns over whether this may persist.
          Exclusive reliance on carbon markets to support the development of a cookstove market in Uganda
           may result in a choice of technologies that do not deliver the greatest health and other social benefits.
           The RBF can help to support technologies that deliver against a wider range of objectives.

 In any detailed design work, careful calibration of the incentive will be required. An expectation will need to
 be formed about the future evolution of carbon market prices so that the RBF incentive payment is sufficient to
 incentivise the desired activity but at the same time does not result in unnecessary public resources being
 wasted. A mechanism may be needed to adjust – on a forward looking basis – the RBF payment in the event
 that carbon prices diverge significantly from current carbon price expectations. Also, the chosen value of the
 RBF incentive payment must not jeopardise the demonstration of additionality that is a requirement for carbon
 credit funding.
 Allowing market participants to benefit from both the RBF and carbon market revenues will have important
 implications for which donors may support the RBF using funds from which sources. Specifically, some donors
 may be reluctant to use resources allocated to climate finance to support an RBF option that also allows market
 participants to issue and then sell carbon credits. This is because their public resources will be used to support
 the sale of the carbon credit that simply offsets an emission reduction that would otherwise be undertaken,
 under existing legal obligations, in a developed country. In other words, the climate finance resources will have
 delivered no net emission reductions. However, this critique will not apply to donor financial resources that are
 allocated to support health or other outcomes.

An additional interaction with the carbon market is to consider using a mechanism similar to the Carbon
Initiative for Development (CI-Dev) to encourage ICS deployment, linking the incentive to future Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) projects.41 As noted in Box 4, international carbon market prices are at
historic lows and there is uncertainty over whether and when they may recover. In response to this, the
Carbon Initiative for Development (Ci-Dev) plans to use donor funds (currently around US$50 million has
been committed)42 to buy carbon credits at prices that are sufficient to make new CDM projects viable. The
Ci-Dev initiative is expected to support around 8–10 projects and it has attracted interest for cookstove
project developers in Uganda and throughout East Africa.43
Although Ci-Dev may be considered to be a results-based financing mechanism, it and initiatives like it
are excluded from the discussion below. This is partly to ensure that the focus is original – detailed design
work on the Ci-Dev initiative has already been undertaken (see, for instance, the Carbon Initiative for
Development program note of February 201244) – but, also due to a desire to consider RBF mechanisms
that might allow more direct focus on the objective of interest. Again, as noted in Box 4, exclusive reliance
on rewarding emission reductions may not result in a choice of technologies that delivers the greatest
health and other social benefits, or focuses attention on delivering a self-sustaining market. We do,
however, pay attention to where and how existing carbon market infrastructure may allow a reduction in
the transaction costs associated with different RBF designs.

41
   The Clean Development Mechanism, as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, provides for emissions reduction projects
that generate Certified Emission Reduction units, which may be traded in emissions trading schemes.
42
   In addition, a further US$20–25 million has been committed to supporting carbon market readiness activities.

             3.3.2 Filtering the Options
To determine the appropriateness of each RBF option, we use two filters:
             Filter 1: Does it tackle the main barriers?
             Filter 2: Does it lend itself to effective RBF design?
Filter 1 assesses the appropriateness of the intervention against the key barriers to the development of
the ICS sector in Uganda, as detailed in Section 2.5 and summarised in Section 3.2. RBF options failing this
stage are excluded and do not progress to Filter 2. This ensures that the RBF is tackling the key barriers
holding back the development of a commercial market at scale. This does not preclude any additional
interventions to address other barriers.
Filter 2 is more specific and evaluates the RBF options on the basis of “precondition criteria” and other
factors that influence the attractiveness of using RBF and builds on previous RBF literature (World Bank,
2013a). Each RBF is scored on a relative scale on the basis of desk research and on-ground research in
Uganda in June 2013. The options are given one of three scores:
             Red (poor)
     R
             Amber (limited)
             Green (good)


For Filter 2, at least two preconditions must be met:
            The agent45 must have access to capital consistent with the capital costs of the project; and
            Both principal46 and agent must possess sufficient institutional capacity.
The agent will need to have access to sufficient financing to cover any upfront costs prior to delivery of
results. This largely relates to access to capital markets, although it is possible that agents could finance any
upfront costs from their own resources. The importance of this barrier will obviously depend on the scale
of the upfront capital costs that are incurred, so that smaller and less capital intensive investments within
the cookstove value chain may face fewer challenges, as will RBF instruments that are aimed at larger
organisations with greater financial resources.
Lack of capital can often be a very important barrier to the implementation of RBF approaches, especially
those that require substantial fixed investment costs to be incurred before there is hope of recouping the
RBF payment. In the Ugandan context, a limited form of RBF scheme in the solar PV sector has been
implemented before with other measures to increase availability of up-front finance. A grant component
was split between payment up front and payment upon verification of solar installations.
Both principals and agents need to have sufficient institutional capacity to, respectively, set up and
respond to an RBF incentive. For the principal, this relates to the ability to implement and monitor the
instrument and to ensure quick disbursement of resources when agents deliver agreed results. It has
sometimes been argued that RBF requires lower technical capacity on behalf of principals than
conventional instruments because, for instance, it does not require appraisal of different grant
applications. However, a more appropriate assessment may be that administering RBF requires different

Final Report: Results-Based Financing for Clean Cookstoves in Uganda


technical skills and that, especially in cases where monitoring and verification is not trivial, these may still
be substantive. For agents, technical capacity relates to the planning tools and managerial ability that allow
them to map out the expected cash flows from an RBF instrument, and to react to the new incentive.
The second key precondition is that the principal and the donor have the institutional capacity to provide
and respond to the incentive provided by the RBF.
The principal must be able to design and calibrate the RBF scheme appropriately and to make payments
when the results have been delivered. Principals for an RBF in this context may be large international
organisations, donors, the Ugandan government or other institutions such as the Private Sector Foundation
Uganda (PSFU). The institutional capacity and access to finance differs for the principals but its assessment
is beyond the scope of this work.
The agent must also be able to increase the result which is being incentivised by the RBF payment. This is
discussed further in the context of each of the RBF options.
In addition to the “precondition criteria,” five further conditions make it more or less attractive to use
RBF approaches, as laid out in the ESMAP report (World Bank, 2013a):
        Control of outcomes;
        Monitoring costs;
        Within resources of agent;
        Cost base variability – does it require fixed investment or are the costs variable and therefore
         adaptable to changing market conditions; and
        Duration until payment.
All these factors determine the extent of additional risk placed on agents by the various RBF options –
which, as explained at the beginning of this section, is the key to determining their appropriateness.
Tight control of outcomes reduces the risk and costs of an RBF scheme. In cases where the factors that
will influence whether or not the results are delivered by the agent are largely under the agent’s control,
the premium an agent would need to justify bearing the additional risk from the RBF scheme will be lower.
For example, placing an RBF instrument on sold units of ICS would be less costly than placing it on the
demonstrated usage of ICS, as the former is largely under the control of ICS manufacturers while the latter
is driven by the customer side, especially in relation to actual use of ICS products.
Risk-driven cost increases are lower when both principal and agent have a clear “line of sight” to the
result against which results-based payments are made, and both parties can trust the monitoring and
verification arrangements. If all parties are able to easily observe the relevant results (and know this in
advance) and there is no contractual ambiguity, then agent’s risk will be lower. In addition, as the
disbursement of funds depends on the monitoring and verification arrangements, insufficient trust in
monitoring and verification arrangements will increase the agent’s perceived risk. On the principal’s side,
trust in monitoring and verification procedures is essential in avoiding the risk of overpaying and/or the
possibility of gaming by the agent. Monitoring the sale of ICS is potentially easy to verify, whereas
monitoring and verifying the usage would depend on the ability either to set up independent agencies or to
combine usage monitoring with the existing procedure for verifying carbon finance emissions reduction.
Risk-driven cost increases are lower when the additional investment required to deliver the results does
not entail a significant proportion of the agent’s (potential) resources. If the activities associated with the
RBF instrument represent a small proportion of the overall firm’s resources, then the success or failure of
the project will have little or no impact on the viability of the agent – and hence on the willingness of
capital providers to provide capital to the agent. Correspondingly, there should be little or no change in the


   IMC 10206
                                                                                                             44
Final Report: Results-Based Financing for Clean Cookstoves in Uganda


terms on which that firm can access finance. By contrast, if the RBF instrument is linked to a substantial
proportion of the agent’s activities, then this makes success in delivering the results critical to the agent’s
financial viability.
Risk-driven cost increases are lower when the agent’s costs depend on the results delivered. In cases
where the cost base of an agent varies as the amount of results increases or decreases, then the agent has
a natural “hedge” against poor performance; although its revenues are lower, so are its costs, muting the
impact on its overall profitability. By contrast, an agent that has very substantial fixed costs (high
“operational gearing”) will be much more affected by poor performance: its revenues will fall but its costs
will be unaffected. This factor will be particularly important when not all of the factors influencing delivery
of the results are within the control of the company. For manufacturers of ICS, this entails investment in
new equipment – a fixed cost – or scaling up the inputs used with current equipment – increasing variable
costs. For consumers, the investment in ICS is mainly fixed because the one variable cost, which is fuel,
would also be incurred for unimproved cookstoves or three-stone fires.
Risk-driven cost increases are lower the shorter the time horizon for RBF payments. The further out into
the future an RBF payment is promised, the more risk an agent faces before it receives the payment.
Consequently, an RBF instrument might be preferable for assets with shorter operating lives, and a short-
duration RBF instrument may be preferable over a longer-duration RBF instrument.
The last step is to evaluate the feasibility of the exit condition of each RBF. The exit condition must be
able to be clearly defined and monitored if the intervention is to have a credible outcome.

         3.3.3 Assessing the Options
This section summarises the results of filters 1 and 2 for the “long list” of nine RBF options. As will
become apparent, of the nine options identified, four appear to be particularly strong candidates that
should be explored further.
Discussion is divided into each of the four categories of RBF outlined above: suppliers, consumers, finance
providers, and maintenance providers.

    A. Suppliers
As Figure 13 shows, RBF options aimed at suppliers allow ICS prices to be reduced to levels that overlap
with consumers’ current willingness to pay. However, to create long-lasting benefits, the consumer
willingness to pay for ICS would need to rise to levels sufficient for ICS suppliers to recover their costs after
the RBF has exited.
RBFs aimed at suppliers are likely to increase marketing, sales and distribution, thereby increasing
consumer awareness as well. The main constraints on currently low marketing and sales efforts are a lack
of funding and awareness of the benefits of ICS. By providing additional funding and tying the total amount
of funding received (in part) to ICS sales, efforts to increase sales via marketing of ICS benefits, better
distribution channels or sales services are incentivised. In turn this will create increased consumer
awareness and, over time, help raise consumer willingness to pay.
The following evaluates each of the five supplier-focused RBF options against Filters 1 and 2.

RBF options targeted at ICS supply potentially lower the stove prices to levels that coincide with consumer
willingness to pay. However, to be sustainable, that willingness must rise to levels at which ICS suppliers
have sufficient margins for future investment.

     Option 1: Payment for every additional ICS sold that meets certain quality
       standards
This RBF provides a payment for each ICS sold into the target market that meets pre-defined quality
standards. Payment to manufacturers could vary by quality standards, correlating to expected health
benefits, allowing for the quality standards needed to trigger payment to increase over time. The goal is to
either (a) lower the price of ICS to levels that match the willingness to pay for consumers or to (b) increase
the amount manufacturers spend on marketing as a way to increase consumer awareness and their
willingness to pay.
Filter 1
RBF 1 could help to address the key barriers holding back the cookstove sector in Uganda. The additional
financial resources provided by the RBF would provide a stronger incentive for producers to raise the
awareness and benefits of purchasing high-quality ICS. They may also be persuaded to reduce the purchase
price of ICS, thereby reducing the lack of access to finance that consumers currently face. The RBF may also
encourage manufacturers to overcome deficiencies in their business model and to improve the quality of
ICS they offer as well as to diversify what they offer to match customer needs and expectations.

                           For large players, the cost base is relatively variable because metal

RBF 1 fares well overall. Institutional capacity, control, monitoring and duration until payment all score
relatively well. However, the key concern is that by only placing the incentive on the sale of the ICS, there
will be no incentive for continued use and hence the long-term benefits anticipated from such use cannot

be assured. This might result in lower health, carbon and other benefits than anticipated. Experience from
the PV RBF program indicate that linking the RBF to the point of sale can reduce long-term sustainability as
providers race to installation with less concern for standards and maintenance.47
The exit condition can be a certain number of stoves in each quality segment, based on later design
considerations. The exit condition can be very clear and monitored at low cost, resulting in a credible and
inexpensive RBF scheme.
In summary, RBF 1 is selected for a shortlist and analysed further in Section 4 to determine its design,
implementing modalities and economics.

     Option 2: Payment for every additional ICS sold that meets certain quality
       standards for which continued use can be demonstrated
This option is a modification of RBF 1, with part of the payment made only when it is verified that the ICS
continues to be used after a certain time from the date of sale. This may be between six months and two
years. Manufacturers participating in a carbon finance scheme currently receive no upfront payment and
full payment of carbon credits after six months or one year, upon verification of use during that year. The
additional incentive to encourage long-term use might generate more health, carbon and environmental
benefits than RBF 1, but does so at additional costs because the continued use must be controlled,
monitored and verified. As with RBF 1, the size of RBF payment could vary according to the quality of the
cookstove, and expected health benefits, anticipated from the stove use.
Filter 1
As this is a variant of RBF 1, it potentially offers the same benefits in terms of overcoming the current
market barriers. The additional financial resources provided by the RBF would provide a stronger incentive
for producers to raise the awareness and benefits of purchasing high-quality ICS. They may also be induced
to reduce the purchase price of ICS, reducing the significance in the lack of access to finance that
consumers currently face. The RBF may also encourage manufacturers to improve both their business
model and the quality of ICS they offer, as well as establish appropriate maintenance and user-support
arrangements.
Filter 2
Table 12 summarises the Filter 2 assessment.
RBF 2 fares fairly well overall, although it favours larger suppliers – in all likelihood, those already
engaged in carbon finance48 – due to the increased costs, the need for usage monitoring and the
demands on institutional capacity. It incorporates the same mechanisms as RBF 1 but adds a long-term
component of continued use. This ensures that related benefits such as in health and carbon are more
likely to be generated throughout. However, this RBF also increases monitoring costs and is harder to
control than RBF 1, and the RBF payment is delayed further than for RBF 1.

                           All manufacturers have the ability to control the effort to promote sale of
                           cookstoves. Therefore, the first payment upon sale can be directly
                           controlled by the agent. However, manufacturers would only receive the
Control                    second payment upon verification of continued use of the ICS. Although

                           Monitoring costs are low for sale but potentially high for verifying the

There are a number of ways to mitigate some of these downsides. Monitoring costs can be lowered by
tying it to existing monitoring infrastructure as required, for instance, in carbon finance verification –
although care would be needed to ensure that this did not lead to the exclusion of potential agents who did
not already have this infrastructure in place. Alternatively, or concomitantly, the payment for this RBF can
be phased to mitigate the cost of tying the RBF payment to the demonstration of continued use.
The exit condition can be a certain number of stoves in each quality segment, based on later design
considerations. The exit condition can be a certain number of stoves which were sold and are in continued
use. Because this is a very clear condition, it can be monitored easily at a low or moderate cost.
RBF 2 is shortlisted and will be analysed further in the following sections.

    Option 3: Payment for additional value created by high-quality ICS, with health
      or other factors as defined targets
This RBF differs from RBFs 1 and 2 as the payment (trigger and amount) is linked to delivery against
certain outcomes. For instance, the RBF would be set at a certain amount per reduction in the risk of
respiratory illness or alternative outcomes. This RBF would directly target certain benefits instead of relying
on the co-creation of such benefits by encouraging the sale and use of ICS. This directly supports the
achievement of these benefits. However, the downside is that it will place incentives to extend cookstove
uses in certain ways and areas that maximise the realisation of these benefits (for instance in areas where
three-stone fires are the norm), but which may not correlate well with the creation of a commercial market
at scale.
Filter 1
In principle, this RBF addresses the key problems. An additional incentive would help overcome the low
consumer awareness of benefits and financing challenges in a similar manner to RBF options 1 and 2. It
appears to score sufficiently well against this filter to warrant further investigation against the second filter.
Filter 2
Table 13 shows that RBF 3 scores less well against a number of the criteria in Filter 2.
RBF 3 scores poorly on institutional capacity as measurement of most of the possible metrics (other than
carbon) is either technically impossible or prohibitively expensive. In particular, targeting specific health
outcomes such as a reduction in disability, adjusted lifetime years lost due to HAP or even merely a
reduction in HAP greatly reduces the control of the agent as the use of the stove depends on the consumer
and would be prohibitively expensive to monitor and verify.
Targeting specific health outcomes or achieved pollutant reductions would require complex monitoring
technology that, even in the unlikely event that it could be implemented in Uganda, would be prohibitively
expensive. While targeting carbon can clearly be achieved, this would limit the ability of the RBF to achieve
results other than those that will already be achieved by carbon markets (such as, for instance, incentivise
stoves that deliver greater health benefits) and as noted above is already covered by existing initiatives.
RBF 3 is excluded from further analysis under the current objective of creating a commercial market at
scale to encourage long-term benefits (including health as a co-benefit) after the RBF has exited.

    Option 4: Payment for every additional high-quality ICS sold, used, or
      generating benefits in a geographically remote area
This RBF is designed to encourage the distribution of ICS to remote areas. Although conceptually similar
to RBFs 1 and 2, it provides funding only for ICS in remote areas and is therefore not encouraging an “oil
stain”-type market growth (i.e., growing outward from one or more central points) based on Uganda’s
existing urban and peri-urban market. This RBF would also most likely target ICS using fuelwood as this is
the dominant fuel in rural regions.

It is doubtful whether this RBF would support the objective of creating a sustainable commercial ICS
market at scale and associated health benefits. The mechanism would focus on the delivery of ICS in rural,
isolated areas which, even with support, may fail to provide the economies of scale needed to make large-
scale entry into the market for improved cookstoves in Uganda attractive. During the early phases of the
development of a market in Uganda, it may be more prudent to focus on larger population bases, where
per capita incomes are higher, and to focus on more remote locations only when the market is more
mature. Nevertheless, if the objective is to increase carbon, health and environmental benefits as well as
fuel savings in rural regions, this RBF is well suited to the task.
RBF 4 appears to fail Filter 1 and is excluded.

     Option 5: Payment based on certification of high-quality ICS
This RBF option makes a payment for every cookstove design that is designated to reach a particular
quality and pollutant reduction standard. The cost and effort of quality certification for new stove designs
has been identified as a barrier in the Ugandan ICS market. The payment of this RBF would be focused
largely on helping to reduce the costs associated with certification – although higher payments may be
possible for higher-quality standards including pollutant reduction levels (even if the certification costs do
not differ by quality standard) to provide an incentive to increase cookstove quality.
Filter 1
RBF 5 aims to tackle the barrier wherein manufacturers face limited incentives to produce high-quality,
low-polluting stoves. It does this both directly, by reducing the costs associated with bringing a certified
high-quality stove to market ; and indirectly, by increasing the penetration of higher-quality cookstoves on
the market. In this way it can increase consumer awareness about such stoves. However, a number of
other barriers are not addressed by this intervention. For instance, it does little to improve ICS suppliers’ or
consumers’ access to finance and only indirectly tackles consumers’ low willingness to pay.
RBF 5 could be a supplementary measure to the shortlisted RBFs. However, on its own, it is unlikely that
it will deliver long lasting health, carbon, environmental or economic benefits – and is therefore excluded
from the shortlist.

    B. Consumers

    Option 6: Vouchers to discount the purchase price of a pre-defined high-quality
    ICS
This RBF would provide vouchers to consumers who would be able to redeem such vouchers in order to
reduce the purchase price of an improved cookstove. The value of the voucher could differ according to
the cookstove for which it constitutes part-payment; by ICS quality standard, geographic area, or over time.
Conceptually, this RBF is equivalent to RBF 1. However, it has significantly different transaction costs, with
the costs of distributing vouchers to eligible households, and safeguarding against fraud expected to be
considerably higher than the cost of monitoring sales. On the other hand, this RBF has the benefit of not
reducing the quoted stove price observed by the consumers, but rather providing a one-off part payment
against that price. This would create/maintain awareness that the true value of stoves is the current market
price as shown in Figure 14, rather than (as is the risk with RBF 1) establishing an expectation among
consumers that the “true” ICS price is the subsidised one. In addition, the value of the voucher can differ by
stove quality, region or over time and therefore be targeted more specifically to achieve the desired
outcome. The voucher itself can also be used to further highlight ICS benefits, e.g. by stressing the fuel
savings. The experience of using vouchers to promote health outcomes in Uganda supports the view that
vouchers can play an important educational role (see Box 5).

       Box 5: Marie Stopes HealthyLife and HealthyBaby Voucher Schemes in Uganda
There is a strong track record of using vouchers to promote development outcomes in Uganda: the HealthyLife
program provides vouchers in relation to the testing and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and has been
running since 2006, while the HealthyBaby system provides vouchers to promote safe delivery, prenatal and postnatal
care. Both programs are managed by Marie Stopes International and receive support from the Global Partnership on
Output Based Aid (GPOBA).
The evidence from randomised evaluations appears to suggest that these programs have delivered a number of the
immediate results anticipated. In particular, an evaluation of the HealthyBaby program found that it significantly
contributed to increased deliveries in private facilities and that this was accompanied by significant reductions in
                                                49
public facility as well as in home based births. Although assessing health impacts is more difficult, a study found that
one year after the start of the HealthLife program, there was a demonstrated reduction in the prevalence of syphilis,
                                                                                50
with a greater reduction among those living near voucher-contracted facilities.

The programs also appear to have raised awareness of the benefits of the services offered. For instance surveys
found that the ability of individuals to list two or more STI symptoms increased 18 per cent in the year after the start
                             51
of the HealthyLife program.
However, it is also clear that the costs of running the voucher programs in Uganda have been significant.
Administrative costs appear to have accounted for around 80 per cent of the total costs of the HealthyLife program in
                                                                                         52
the initial years, although they subsequently dropped to a little less than 20 per cent.
These costs may be partly linked to concerns over fraud and mismanagement of resources. Reports from reviews of
the Uganda (and similar Kenya) schemes have identified a number of malpractices, such as voucher distributors and
service providers forming a coalition to redeem vouchers without the provision of services; clients/patients forming
an alliance to reclaim vouchers without providing services; providers making false claims; and providers asking for
money from voucher holders. A number of recommendations are made to combat practices of fraud, including
                                                                                  53
specialised training, external scrutiny and active prevention/detection measures.



The agents in this RBF are most likely to be the ICS suppliers because they have to collect and possibly
redeem the vouchers. To incentivise the collection and redemption of vouchers, and therefore their
acceptance, the voucher value for consumers has to be lower than the redemption value producers receive
upon handing in the voucher. This premium could vary by region, fuel or other factors. Additional
safeguards, such as linking vouchers and sales with ICS serial numbers, are important to reduce potential
abuse.
Filter 1
This RBF would appear to tackle some of the key barriers in the sector at present. By reducing the
effective purchase price of the cookstove, the need for consumers to access finance, and/or the costs
associated with repayment of that finance would fall. Furthermore, it may be expected that the explicit
provision of a voucher to consumers might encourage greater awareness about the role and benefits of ICS.
Evidence strongly suggests (USAID, 2012a) that once consumers are aware of the benefits of ICS, they are
willing to purchase it at market prices. Vouchers can persuade consumers to purchase ICS more effectively
than subsidies as they raise awareness for the product and its benefits. They also provide the feeling in the
consumer of having made a “saving” on the purchase whereas a subsidised price would raise less
awareness.
Filter 2
Table 14 shows the assessment of this RBF against the key criteria. A key concern with RBF 6 is whether the
monitoring costs can be kept low.
RBF 6 fares relatively well on Filter 2. Monitoring costs and the institutional capacity of ICS suppliers might
be the biggest constraints but these may be overcome by adequate technology. Section 4 elaborates
further on the design and implementation modalities.

RBF 6 can have a clearly defined exit condition, for example a certain amount of distributed or redeemed
vouchers. The monitoring of this, however, might be difficult. If the exit condition is the distribution of a
certain number of vouchers, the actual amount redeemed and therefore the delivered benefit is uncertain.
If a certain number of redeemed vouchers are being monitored, care needs to be taken to avoid issuing too
many vouchers and therefore alienating ICS consumers by voiding their voucher after the desired amount
of ICS has been sold.
RBF 6 is included in the shortlist and is analysed further in Section 4.

       B. Finance providers

       Option 7: Payment for every loan made to suppliers or consumers54 to finance a
       high-quality ICS
RBF 7 can be split into RBF 7 a), which is focused on suppliers; and RBF 7 b), which targets consumers;
both have distinct advantages and disadvantages.
RBF 7 a) for suppliers provides fewer benefits and has a lower probability of achieving the desired
outcomes than RBFs 1 and 2, which target suppliers directly. Bank loans are currently available only at
prohibitively high interest rates (25– 30 per cent) and with substantial collateral. Evidence during the
interviews in June 2013 in Uganda suggests that banks are unwilling to grant new loans to suppliers unless
up-front finance or a credit line is provided to the banks or financial institutions granting the loans. Further,
to bring the high interest rates down to a practical level for suppliers to borrow against would require a
very high value of RBF incentive. For this reason, and given that the provision of a credit line is more
practical, an RBF for loans to suppliers is considered infeasible and is not considered further.
Credit lines might be a complementary measure to encourage ICS deployment and supplement any RBF
as the analysis of RBF 7 a) shows credit lines can increase lending to the sector and supplement any RBF,
such as supplier focused RBFs 1 or 2 or consumer focused RBFs 6 and 7 b), to increase their effectiveness.
RBF 7 b) for loans to consumers is likely to achieve similar outcomes as a voucher scheme.
Section 2 identifies the important role that aggregators are increasingly playing in extending the
penetration of the ICS market. Aggregators such as farmers’ cooperatives and health agencies may already
have loan arrangements with banks that can be extended to enable them to provide credit via deferred or
staged payment to consumers purchasing ICS. The provision of this deferred or staged payment for an ICS
will be the trigger for RBF payment. The benefits of this RBF are that it lowers the consumer willingness to
pay barrier while strengthening the role aggregators and other intermediaries play in the market. The
transaction costs will vary depending on who responds. The extension of existing credit lines may keep
costs feasible, while the costs of testing creditworthiness of new lines may be prohibitively high. This may
in turn limit the scope to consumers linked to existing credit lines. Another constraint to this RBF are the
number of possible hurdles associated with monitoring and verifying such small-scale credit arrangements
though this may be addressable through design.
Filter 1
RBF 7 a) has been found infeasible and is not considered further.
The effectiveness of RBF 7 b) depends on the level of competition in the lending market. With sufficient
competition, it may be expected that there could be a significant expansion in lending activity. In turn this
could encourage the development of high-quality ICS and distribution channels as well as competition in
these markets to reduce costs and purchase price. If competition in the banking sector is less vigorous then
the impact of this RBF on the key market barriers will correspondingly be lower.

The table shows that the RBF scores well against the main criteria listed and should therefore be
considered further. The exit condition for RBF 7 b) is clearly defined and can be easily monitored.
RBF 7 b) is shortlisted and further analysed in the following sections; RBF 7 a) is not.

    Option 8: Payment for every loan made – and paid back – to producers or
      consumers to finance a high-quality ICS
This RBF is conceptually the same as RBFs 7 a) and 7 b) but adds the long-term component of loan
repayment. For the same reasons as given for RBF 7 a), RBF 8 a) is excluded from the analysis. RBF 8 b) for
consumers, however, is considered further and evaluated against the two filters below.
Filter 1: RBF 8 b) incorporates a long-term focus by adding the condition that the loan must be fully
repaid before the payment is made to the financial institution. It addresses the same barriers – and with
the same caveats - as RBF 7 b).
Filter 2: Table 16 shows the scoring of RBF 8 b). Ultimately, RBF 8 b) mitigates potential problems with RBF
7 b) but scores slightly worse on the criteria.

       D. Maintenance providers
Stakeholders have expressed concern that the failure to adequately maintain ICS is lacking and that this
reduces the health, environmental and other benefits of ICS. To generate lasting benefits and to
encourage consumers to purchase ICS, the quality and maintenance of ICS has to be sufficient. Currently,
small, medium and large ICS suppliers offer warranty schemes, although consumers and retailers might be
unaware of them.55 Furthermore, most of the maintenance requires the exchange of certain cookstove
parts, and this is sometimes done via the established distribution channels.

    Option 9: Payment for every successfully completed yearly maintenance of
    high-quality ICS
Filter 1
Although RBF 9 does not address the main challenges in the ICS market in Uganda, it can be a
supplement to RBFs 1, 2, 6 and 7 in ensuring the long-term benefits of ICS. That said, it does not
overcome general financing barriers on the supply and demand sides of ICS and does not encourage a
sustainable commercial market at scale. A further concern with this RBF is that it may encourage
unnecessary maintenance activity, such as maintenance activity that is undertaken only to receive the RBF
payment.
Given these concerns, it may be better to concentrate on other RBFs that can help to overcome this
concern – either by only providing the RBF in relation to cookstoves that have a longer-than-expected
average lifetimes or by linking payment to continued use.
RBF 9 is excluded from the shortlist but included in the suggestions of complementary measures to
increase the benefits of RBF in the Ugandan ICS sector.

Figure 16 summarises the shortlisted RBFs and other RBFs which passed Filter 1. The diagrams allow
comparing each RBF against seven screening criteria and show that:
         All but RBF 1 (the RBF for suppliers for each ICS sold) fare moderately or poorly on monitoring.
         RBFs 6 and RBF 7 b) score similarly, with a good – that is, short – duration of payment but difficult
          monitoring, while addressing different agents: RBF 7 b) addresses financial institutions, whereas
          RBF 6 bypasses them and relies on ICS consumers and suppliers.

4. Design Considerations and Implementing Modalities
This section discusses:
        The design considerations for the four shortlisted RBF options;
        The anticipated market responses, including supplementary measures;
        A tentative estimate of the Value for Money of an RBF intervention in the Ugandan ICS market; and
        An overview of the implementing modalities.

4.1 Design Considerations
Design considerations are structured around five key questions:
    a.   Who should be eligible to receive an RBF payment?
    b.   What should be the trigger or condition for payment of an RBF instrument?
    c.   What should the structure of any RBF payment be?
    d.   How should the size of the RBF payment be determined?
    e.   What should the duration of the RBF intervention be, and what is the appropriate exit strategy?

The following examines each question in turn, adding detail for each option as appropriate.

    a. Eligibility
Wider eligibility increases the potential benefits because ICS quality can be determined on the outset.
When more agents are able to participate in any of the four shortlisted RBFs, the likelihood of achieving the
desired outcomes increases. However, a crucial caveat to this is that the agent(s) must be using the RBF to
promote cookstoves of a sufficiently high quality to generate satisfactory health and environmental
benefits. This can be achieved through certification for ICS that achieve certain pollutant reductions or
efficiency levels using the results of the ongoing benchmarking through the ACCES program (see Box 3 in
Section 2), with an option to keep the door open to new entrants who improve their quality and meet the
required standards.
As discussed in Section 3, the supplier RBFs should potentially be open to all participants in the Ugandan
ICS market supplying stoves of a sufficient quality, including ICS suppliers currently engaging in any
carbon finance scheme. Carbon finance continues to be one of the main drivers of the Ugandan ICS market
and, excluding suppliers participating in carbon finance, not only restricts the choice of current suppliers
but also means that to gain the interest of these suppliers, the RBF incentive would have to outweigh the
incentive set by carbon finance. This could create additional costs. It is likely to be preferable to focus on
exploiting synergies between carbon finance and any RBF incentive so as to support an ICS market that
delivers both emission reductions and other health and environmental outcomes.
Eligibility does not vary between RBFs 1 and 2. Both schemes are aimed at ICS suppliers, the main
difference being that RBF 2 requires continued monitoring of use.
For RBF 6 – consumer vouchers – the eligibility of suppliers does not vary either from RBFs 1 and 2
(subject to meeting any stove certification requirements); however, it might be possible to restrict the
access to vouchers by geography or income group. In particular, restricting the eligibility of vouchers could
reduce the risk that the RBF leads to some consumers switching from higher-tier BLEN (biogas, LPG,
electricity and natural gas) stoves to lower quality (but RBF-subsidised) charcoal or wood ICS (see Box 3 for
further discussion). However, monitoring and enforcement may be difficult.

For RBF 7 b) – loans to consumers – eligibility is more difficult to define and will need careful
consideration in the design phase if such an RBF is to be implemented. The RBF is targeted at all actors in
the market ecosystem that might lend to consumers or offer a line of credit to purchase a cookstove. A
number of non-commercial actors, such as NGOs or donors, may lend either directly to consumers or
through intermediary groups. These agents may be considered inappropriate for RBF funding.

    C. Trigger
For the shortlisted RBF options, the trigger for the RBF payment is variously defined as the sale or
purchase of ICS (for RBFs 1 and 6, respectively), the sale and verified use (for RBF 2), and purchase of ICS
with a loan (for RBF 7). Whereas RBFs 1, 6 and 7 b) have a single trigger, RBF 2 has multiple triggers
because use is monitored at set intervals and payments are in part linked to use.
Annex 4 discusses an alternative design featuring a trigger based on reaching a certain level of sales, rather
the sale of a single cookstove.
All trigger conditions can be monitored and verified, which provides agents and principals with feedback
on the take-up and success of the RBF.

    D. Structure of RBF Payment
The ESMAP paper identifies three questions that help to determine the structure of an RBF payment:
In all four cases, it seems likely that all of the additional incentives provided by an RBF would be paid
after the result has been achieved: for RBF 1 and 6 this would be soon after the sale of the cookstove, for
RBF 7 b) soon after the provision of a loan while for RBF 2 there would be an ongoing structure of
payments, with some proportion likely to be paid immediately after the sale of the cookstove, and
additional payments every (x) years subject to ongoing use. Proportions would be determined during
detailed design. While this means that the RBFs will not address financing challenges faced by the agents
themselves, the challenges are expected to be relatively small (in the case of RBF 7, or RBF 1 and 6 in the
case of larger suppliers) or addressable by other interventions. In addition, the provision of the RBF subsidy
in the cases of RBF 1, 2 and 6, or the loan in the case of RBF 7 b), is expected to reduce the consumers’
consumers’ need to seek consumer financing.
In all cases the RBF would at least partly be linked to a market outcome: the purchase of an ICS in the
case of RBF 1, 2 and 6; and the making of a loan for purchase in the case of RBF 7. In the case of RBF 2, the
ongoing payments for continued use would not be linked to a market transaction.
In all cases where the RBF is linked to market outcomes, it is anticipated that the structure of the RBF
would be to provide a fixed amount of incentive payment for each eligible market transaction (rather
than, for instance, using the RBF to provide a “top-up” to achieve a certain price). This will be the simplest
option from an administrative standpoint, and will reduce the risk of gaming (for example, agents
suggesting that a transaction took place at a different price in order to increase the value of the RBF
payment). As discussed further below, RBFs 1, 2 and 6 may need a mechanism that periodically adjusts the
value of the RBF incentive on a forward-looking basis to account for fluctuations in carbon prices.
In each case, the RBF could be structured in conjunction with a complementary awareness-raising
campaign. Box 6 illustrates how this might work for RBF 6.

         Box 6: Design option for RBF 6: a prize draw
     This RBF tackles two main barriers: consumer finance and consumer awareness. Prizes are a very effective tool for
     generating consumer buzz and raising overall awareness, and are popular among consumers.
     The voucher scheme could be run along the lines of a prize draw, with winners receiving either a cookstove or a
     voucher to purchase a cookstove at a discounted rate. For example, a radio awareness campaign could highlight
     the benefits of cookstoves and offer a free cookstove or voucher via a prize draw; consumers could enter by
     sending a text message from their phones. This could be run weekly and have one or more winners per week.
     The campaign would further benefit by being able to trace, via the winners’ phone numbers, where the
     cookstoves has been distributed, and could extend its general reach by sending a text message to all numbers
     that entered the prize draw.
     Some careful thought will need to go into addressing the distribution aspects of such a scheme. It could start
     small, addressing a particular area, then scale up to a national prize draw. An example of a similar scheme run in
     Kenya is ONSPEED, discussed in Annex 4.




       E. Size of RBF payments
The size of the RBF payment has to be large enough to provide an incentive without creating windfall
profits or other market distortions, especially in light of the presence of carbon finance as discussed in
Section 3.3.1. In the case of RBFs 1, 2 and 6, the RBF payment has to bridge the gap between consumers’
willingness to pay and the price of ICS that allows for future investment by ICS suppliers. This will need to
take account of expected future carbon prices.
The size of the RBF payment may need to be adjusted over time. This can provide flexibility to account for
changes in market variables such as the cost of cookstove manufacture or carbon market prices. It is crucial
to undertake these reviews in a way that maintains market confidence; they should be announced well in
advance, and any changes in the RBF payment must apply only to subsequent cookstove sales/loan
transactions.
The size of the RBF payment can be adjusted to encourage further health benefits or increasing health
benefits over time. The payment can be tied to specific reductions in HAP or other pollutant emissions
from ICS to increase the incentive to provide better health outcomes.
It is likely that the value of the RBF incentive will need to be set administratively. The alternative would
be some form of auction mechanism but this would be either difficult to reconcile with the desire to keep
many different suppliers/loan providers in the market (in the case of RBF 1, 2 or 7 b) or administratively
very challenging (in the case of RBF 6). In addition, the institutional capacity of agents and principals to hold
successful and verifiable auctions is doubtful.56
Preliminary research indicates that a payment size of between US$5 and US$10 might be sufficient for
urban and peri-urban users and will most likely result in the increased uptake of charcoal ICS. The exact
size of the payment should vary by the delivered benefits of different quality tier ICS and to be modified
over time to increase the overall quality of ICS in use in Uganda. The initial estimate of US$5 to US$10 is
based on the current low willingness to pay prices above US$10 versus the average charcoal ICS price of
US$12 to US$20.

The size of payment is likely to be higher for RBFs 2 and 6. In the case of RBF 2, this will reflect an
additional premium for delaying the payment after verification of use. For RBF 6, ICS suppliers may need
to be compensated for the increased administrative costs as well as for delaying part of their cash flow.
Payment for RBF 7 b) (the loan scheme for consumers) can be tied to be between US$5 and US$10 as well,
and therefore correspond to RBF 1.

    F. Exit Strategy and Duration
The exit strategy for RBF options 1, 2 and 7 b) is readily identified as a certain amount of ICS sold or
purchased.
For RBF 6, it can either be the number of distributed vouchers or the numbers of vouchers used. If the
exit condition is the number of distributed vouchers, the final sales of ICS are uncertain but can be
estimated based on past evidence of what percentage of vouchers has been used in similar schemes. If the
number of vouchers used is the exit condition, there needs to be clear communication regarding the
remaining eligible vouchers and reduction of voucher distribution to avoid having too many invalid
vouchers in circulation.
The number of ICS sales or purchases before exit should be estimated to be high enough to encourage a
commercial market at scale; the potential size of this market is estimated to be at a total of 3.15 million
ICS. Section 2.2 and Annex 1 describe the market size in detail and are based on population projections for
2015. Since the incentive for the supplier -- that is, the agent collecting the total number of purchases and
reporting it to the principal in all RBFs – is to report all purchases as soon as possible to receive the RBF
payment, the total amount of incentivised ICS can be tracked relatively easily.
The duration of the RBF is flexible and depends on the market conditions, the size of the payment and
the ability of suppliers and consumers to respond to the RBF incentive but may be approximately five
years. This assumes a total market size of 3.15 million ICS in use and a doubling of the current ICS market
growth rate from 20 per cent to 40 per cent.
Figure 17 shows the increase in the ICS market growth and the difference to the assumed business-as-
usual scenario.
Table 17 summarises the design considerations across the four shortlisted RBFs options.

Figure 17: Scaling up the ICS market

When compared to an assumed ICS market without an RBF intervention, the RBF scales up the ICS market
faster, and the higher ICS penetration continues for a further three years to produce larger benefits..

4.2 Market Response and Complementary Measures
Now that the main design considerations have been established, this section considers how the market
might respond, focusing in particular on RBF 1, 2, 6 and 7 b). It also identifies gaps in the stimulation of the
market ecosystem and the remaining hurdles that will require complementary measures. It should be
stressed that no detailed engagement with stakeholders to verify how the market might respond has been
undertaken as part of this study; rather, this section is based on a series of broad assumptions that will
need testing during the design phase.

RBF 1 and 2: For 1) every additional ICS sold that meets certain quality standards and 2) for which
continued use can be demonstrated
         Respondents for RBF 1
Primary Respondents: This RBF will stimulate all distributors and sales agents of ICS, be they manufacturer
or sales and distribution agents. Depending on the quality standards applied to the RBF some ICS
manufacturers will be better placed to respond than others.
         Respondents for RBF 2
Primary Respondents: The agents best able to respond quickly and effectively to this RBF will be those
already involved in carbon finance who (a) have established, or are preparing, mechanisms for ongoing
monitoring of cookstove use and (b) are distributing cookstoves that meet certain quality testing criteria.
This includes both manufacturers and intermediary actors, such as sales agents. RBF conditions on quality,
and in particular pollutant emissions effecting health, may require the adoption and distribution of
different cookstoves57 by these actors.
Secondary Respondents: Sufficient incentive could have a “pull effect” of bringing in new intermediaries to
act as distribution and sales agents.58 This could help target new districts and increase penetration where
sufficient profits and/or social benefits are perceived.
Tertiary Respondents: Increased demand for cookstoves from sales agents or other intermediaries will give
manufacturers an incentive to respond in any way they choose. This will only occur once the quality and
associated benefits of products have been deemed sufficient to achieve the RBF, and are therefore
dependent on functioning quality and testing arrangements.




57
   For example, current high standards in environmental efficiency are not directly proportional to health benefits, and
to achieve equally high standards for health benefits may require some adaptation.

RBF 6: Vouchers to discount the purchase price of a pre-defined high-quality ICS.
         Respondents
Primary Respondents: This RBF is specifically targeted at consumers; vouchers are intended to increase
both ability and willingness to pay, thus increasing the volume of cookstoves purchased. The RBF may
target different consumer groups or geographic areas, but it will be difficult to establish distinct
boundaries, and vouchers are easily transferred.
Secondary Respondents: Depending on the size of the voucher scheme, both cookstove manufacturers and
distribution and sales agents will be required to respond to meet increased demand. The type of stove
purchased could be at the discretion of the principal (i.e., they select a certain stove for the voucher to be
linked to) or the consumer (if the principal provides a range of cookstoves that may be purchased under the
scheme – all meeting certain quality standards). The latter would be more consistent with supporting a
commercial market at scale, leaving both the manufacturers and distribution and sales agents to respond
to market demand.

RBF 7 b): RBF for every loan made to consumers to finance a high-quality ICS
This is the most difficult of the RBF options for which to gauge a response. One of the key advantages of
results-based financing is that it leaves the market free to respond, and this RBF in particular could throw
up some unexpected and innovative funding arrangements. The uncertain nature of the response makes
this RBF particularly difficult to design – which ultimately may be a reason to reject it from the shortlist of
RBFs.
         Respondents
Primary respondents: The agents best placed to provide loans to consumers are ICS sales and distribution
agents who may be in a position to coordinate group loans or provide staged payments for consumers
through their own financial arrangements. They are in close proximity to the consumer.
Secondary respondents: Manufacturers may provide their own lines of credit by staged payment
arrangements if they can secure sufficient cash flow, but this is unlikely for most manufacturers
Tertiary respondents: Microfinance agencies and SACCOs may provide loans for ICS purchase via
established savings and credits groups with which they are linked.
Who exactly is eligible for the RBF must be clearly defined; it is likely that consumers are receiving support
from multiple directions, and it needs to be clear which funders are eligible – including investors, crowd
funders, NGOs, faith groups, SACCOs, banks, and other actors.
Each of these respondents present potential difficulties when verifying loan provision and may make this
RBF infeasible. However, this problem could well be overcome in the design phase, for example by allowing
for aggregation and sample verification.

Some initial design ideas for complementary measures are provided in Annex 4.

4.3 Estimate of Value for Money
Any estimates of the value for money associated with the RBF approaches discussed above are only
approximate. The exact benefits are difficult to quantify (although the forthcoming ACCES Quality
Assurance and Technical Support Program should significantly improve data availability; see Box 3 in
Section 2). The RBF scheme costs are based on initial estimates rather than an in-depth RBF design study
that would need to follow this feasibility report.
The potential RBF costs consist of both the RBF incentive of between US$8 million to US$16 million and
scheme administration costs. Scheme costs are based on an incentive level of between US$5 and US$10
per ICS and a total sales figure of 3.6 million ICS during the five years of the RBF intervention.
Administration costs require design work beyond this RBF feasibility report but can be estimated as
approximately 20 per cent of the incentive costs, or between US$1.6 million and US$3.2 million. This
would, therefore, yield a total RBF cost of US$9.6 million to US$19.2 million. All costs and benefits are
discounted at 14 per cent according to the current Bank of Uganda 2-year Treasury bond yield.59,60
The potential RBF benefits include:
         Fuel savings;
         Health benefits;
         Carbon reductions; and
         Environmental benefits.
Of these benefits, fuel savings and carbon reductions can be quantified whereas environmental and
health benefits are difficult to estimate. They are, therefore, beyond the scope of this feasibility report
given the absence of more detailed data. Ongoing work is taking place to estimate disability-adjusted life

   Discounting the scheme and administrative costs at the Bank of Uganda 2 year T-bond yield might overstate the
discount rate. The benefits described later in this section are incurred in Uganda are discounted at the same rate,
which may be slightly too low given that fuel savings and carbon credits are distributed to Ugandans. The rationale for
using the same discount rate is to have a comparable base of costs and benefits.

years (DALYs) associated with HAP, which in time will help quantify benefits and deepen linkages between
health and cookstove initiatives.
The benefits may be reduced by like-for-like substitution of ICS, which is estimated at approximately 15
to 20 per cent of all incentivised stoves. Some consumers, who already have an ICS, will benefit from the
RBF incentive and purchase another ICS when their current ICS is obsolete. On the assumption that these
consumers would have replaced their ICS without an RBF incentive, this represents a deadweight loss from
the scheme. We estimate that this reduces the potential benefits by approximately 15 to 20 per cent, based
on the current number of ICS in circulation and an average replacement period of three years.
In addition to like-for-like substitution, there is the low possibility of trading down – that is, that the RBF
discourages some consumers from buying higher-quality ICS than those incentivised by the RBF. Box 7
discusses why this has a low probability and what measures can be taken to further lower its occurrence.
Trading down is not included in the value for money analysis.


      Box 7: Mitigating against “trading down”
 The stoves that might attract RBF support are just a subset of the total cookstove options available to Ugandans. The
 reality of energy access in the Uganda domestic context is that households have a range of technologies to choose
 from. These include everything from unimproved three-stone fires up through several tiers of cooking device and
 finally up to a high-performance BLEN stove.
 It is possible that, as a result of an RBF incentive, someone who may have been a candidate to purchase a high-quality
 BLEN stove instead chooses to purchase a low-quality, but subsidised, charcoal stove. There are three key
 considerations here:
      1.   The quality level identified for RBFs – and the incentives attached to each – can be tailored to reduce the
           likelihood of “trading down” by setting RBF levels that encourage purchase of higher -quality ICS.

      2.   The choice of RBF itself can offer some protection. For example, a voucher scheme (RBF 6) could potentially
           be used through limiting eligibility for receipt of vouchers and by setting differentiated incentives according
           to the type of stove purchased.

      3.   The proportion of Uganda households using BLEN level stoves is very small: around 5 per cent of all
           households now use a modern fuel for cooking. Therefore any such effect will likely be small.

 This suggests that the likely impact of “trading down”, especially if accompanied by careful RBF design, is low.



Whereas fuel savings happen at a relatively low tier improvement of ICS, health and carbon benefits
depend on the exact characteristics of stoves. Although all ICS in Uganda will greatly improve fuel
efficiency over unimproved cookstoves, the difference in fuel savings between mid-tier and higher-tier ICS
is relatively small.
In aggregate, fuel savings can be substantial since quality cookstoves reduce fuel consumption by
approximately 50 per cent. Currently, urban and peri-urban households spend US$20–50 per month on
charcoal for cooking.61 More fuel efficient ICS can reduce this by about 50 per cent, depending on the stove
efficiency, and therefore cut fuel costs between US$10 and US$25 per month on average. This produces



61
  The consumption rate is between two and six weeks per bag of charcoal, according to a large ICS manufacturer and
evidence from the workshop respectively. Charcoal prices, which are volatile, are here assumed to be US$25 per bag.

fuel savings worth between US$36 and US$73 million over the five years of the intervention above what
the market would have created on its own.62
The benefits of ICS using wood are mainly in reduced time spent on gathering and preparing fuel wood
and on cooking. The preliminary findings of the cooking sector study (TNS, 2013) shows that consumers
believe that ICS both save time in cooking and gathering fuel, the latter being less important for those who
purchase fuel. Thus higher fuel efficiency does not produce monetary fuel savings directly for the majority
of households that cook with gathered wood. Less time spent gathering fuel wood and fewer collection
trips, along with less time spent cooking, however, contribute indirectly to monetary effects by freeing
household members to participate in gainful activities. The exact amount of derived benefits depends on
household preferences and no previous studies have estimated this effect for Uganda. Our focus on the
consumer segment that purchases fuel wood limits the benefits that can be realised from time saved in
gathering fuel wood.
Fuel savings, like all other benefits, will continue to accrue beyond the RBF intervention period. Figure 17
at the beginning of this section illustrates that scaling up the ICS market faster with an RBF intervention
continues to produce more benefits during the five years of the RBF intervention as well as over the
ensuing three years. During this time the ICS market operates at its potential capacity of approximately 1.2
million ICS per year. Without an RBF intervention, the potential market at scale is assumed to reach 1.2
million ICS per year in seven years. This difference will continue to produce additional benefits which are
accounted for in the value for money analysis.
Health benefits are hard to quantify and depend on the emissions reduction of each ICS tier. Although the
burden of disease associated with HAP is well documented, there is much less evidence on the health
impact of ICS. Above a certain level of technical performance, ICS can reduce HAP by approximately 50 per
cent as compared with unimproved stoves, depending on the tier of ICS (GACC, 2013). But the current
evidence base is too weak to draw firm conclusions about the correlation of reductions in particulate
matter and disability-adjusted lifetime years lost due to solid fuel combustion. Nevertheless, health
benefits are most likely to be achieved with high-performance ICS or stoves using refined fuels, such as
LPG. Since the aim of this RBF is to create an ICS market at commercial scale, the approximate subsidy level
is set to achieve this objective. This subsidy level is likely to be too low to achieve large uptake of high
performance stoves or LPG as these are more than three times more expensive than ICS using charcoal.
Given the current state of the cookstove market in Uganda, it is questionable whether an LPG market
would be sustainable after an RBF exit. This does not preclude that any well targeted RBF would improve
ICS quality in the market over time. The RBF can provide the right incentives to move from unimproved
stoves to ICS to LPG over time, which would reduce the required subsidy for high-performance ICS and LPG
stoves in the future.
Although there certainly are health benefits, the current evidence base does not allow for quantification
of health benefits (in dollar terms)to be included in the value-for-money analysis. Reduced HAP may lead
to a decline in disability adjusted lifetime years lost, but the magnitude of benefits is dependent on social
factors such as on how often the stove is used, where it is used, how it is used and who is present during
and after cooking. The current evidence base for these factors is insufficient to estimate specific health
benefits in this feasibility report.
Carbon reductions can be priced using either the projected value of carbon credits or the estimated social
cost of carbon. The value of carbon credits provides an estimate of the payment received for reducing

     The calculations assume a discount rate of 14 per cent and a replacement rate of charcoal ICS of three years.

carbon emissions. The value of carbon credits has been volatile in the past and is assumed to be US$7 in
this report, which is lower than the social cost of carbon. The social cost of carbon captures all externalities
associated with carbon emissions. Although the range of estimates for the social cost of carbon are very
wide (Yohe, 2007), a recent US study suggests a value of between US$22 and US$36 per tCO 2 (US
Environmental Protection Council, 2013).
Using the market price of carbon to value the emission reductions over the five years, the RBF is
projected to achieve a benefit of about US$26 million. In addition, the carbon reductions continue to be
higher due to the RBF presence as the commercial market at scale is reached earlier and over seven years;
the additional carbon reductions accumulate to US$35 million. This assumes three carbon credits per ICS
per year at a carbon credit value of US$7 and that all new ICS are eligible and apply for carbon finance.
Using a range for the social cost of carbon of US$22–US$36 per tCO2 over the five years, the RBF is
projected to achieve a benefit of between US$27 million and US$44 million. This is greater than the value
of carbon because of the higher social cost of carbon. However, if the carbon credits are used to offset
emissions in other parts of the world, the overall benefit of the carbon reductions are reduced
proportionally to the amount of offsets sold. In addition, the carbon reductions continue to be higher due
to the RBF presence as the commercial market at scale is reached earlier and over seven years, the
additional social cost of carbon reductions accumulate to between US$34 million and US$59 million.
Environmental benefits, such as reduced soil erosion or less deforestation, are controversial and
excluded from this value-for-money calculation. Past studies failed to find a conclusive answer on reduced
deforestation and soil erosion due to ICS. (USAid, 2012a) To arrive at a prudent estimate for potential RBF
benefits in the ICS market in Uganda, we have therefore excluded environmental benefits.
The RBF intervention’s total potential value for money is approximately US$64 million to US$129 million
over the five years of RBF intervention, and up to approximately US$91 million to US$175 million over
the first seven years; both estimates use the market price of carbon.63 When the social cost of carbon is
used instead, the value for money rises to approximately US$65 million to US$147 million over the five-
year RBF intervention and approximately US$90 million to US$199 million over the first seven years.
Overall, the RBF creates benefits of approximately 6 to 10 times as much as it costs in incentive payments
and administration costs. All costs and benefits are summarised in Table 21.
In addition to the value for money, the return on investment – defined as the additional stoves sold due
to the RBF intervention divided by the incentivised ICS – is approximately 0.6. This calculation is based on
3.6 million RBF incentivised stoves over five years versus the projected growth rate of the ICS market
without an RBF intervention.
However, the return on investment as defined above does not capture how the ICS market reaches a
commercial scale much faster with an RBF intervention than without and that it continues to create
health and carbon-related benefits.

     The low estimates use low benefits and high scheme and administration costs, and vice versa.

4.4 Monitoring and Evaluation Considerations
In formulating a system for measuring outcomes, and then for defining a causal chain between outputs,
outcomes and impacts, a theory-based approach is recommended. The following discussion (a) makes use
of Theory of Change to capture the intended pathway of change, (b) defines a set of assumptions on which
this is based, and (c) provides a framework to identify indicators and monitoring requirements.
Figure 18 shows an overarching Theory of Change for employing RBF mechanisms in the ICS sector in
Uganda. The intended impact is “sustained uptake of Improved Cookstoves in Uganda that deliver a range
of social, economic and environmental benefits to households across the population”. This captures the
policy options outlined in Section 3.1 aimed at achieving health, social, environmental and economic
benefits relating to ICS. However, by declaring this at the “impact level”, it is assumed that there are factors
that could influence the achievement of the result that are beyond the control of the intervention.

The assumptions listed in the bottom of Figure 18 describe the causal linkages between outcomes and
impact. In carrying out future evaluations, which is recommended as part of a theory-based approach, a
key component would be to challenge the assumptions upon which the theory of change is based. For
example, this theory of change assumes that there is a causal linkage between encouraging innovation and
economies of scale among ICS producers, and stimulating the ICS market. Although assumptions are often
based on supporting evidence, every intervention can be seen as a way to test the assumptions, the better
to strengthen the knowledge base and understand how and why interventions work. Continuing this
example, there may be extenuating circumstances that, despite strong and appropriately targeted
encouragement, prevent the ICS market from being stimulated. Investigating this, using “realist
approaches” to understand contextual influences, would then provide useful lessons about the RBF
mechanism and the assumptions underpinning it. Figure 18 outlines the assumptions underlying the linkage
between outputs and outcomes (on the left) and then between outcomes and impact (on the right).
The outcomes of such an intervention capture the real purpose of an RBF intervention in the ICS sector,
namely, stimulation of the ICS market, increased demand for ICS in Uganda among the target population,
and increased use of ICS. The RBF, if appropriately designed, will contribute to these outcomes if the
underlying assumptions are valid. The outputs of an RBF intervention are under the control of the RBF, and
are the direct outputs of the activities undertaken.
Because the four shortlisted RBF options have different modes of delivery, they differ in their outputs.
These can be seen to be “nested” within the overarching Theory of Change, each with its own output that
contributes to the delivery of the various overarching outputs as displayed in Figure 19.

After linking RBF options to outputs, the next stage is to design indicators and monitoring and verification
tasks for each output. A set of example indicators can be found in the Table 22, along with the Trigger or
Means of Verification (MoV) and monitoring tasks that will need to be carried out. Importantly, indicators
such as “quality” and “level of use” will need to be defined in order to be rated, with criteria for the range
of scores also defined and agreed with various stakeholders. This will enhance the transparency and
consistency of monitoring and verification. For example, “quality” may be defined by reference to objective
technical standards according to the stove model. This would require awareness amongst suppliers of the
details of the technical standards in use for monitoring and verification purposes. In defining level of use, a
helpful reference is Kirk Smith and his colleagues’ work at the Household Energy, Climate, and Health
Research Group, UC Berkeley,64 and may include a combined rating that includes frequency of stove use,
the amount of time spent preparing each meal, and the number of hours the stove was lit at each meal
time. This would capture initial adoption, sustained use and seasonal variability. Stove use monitors are
seen to be the most precise (and costly) measurement tool, while recall questionnaires among a sample of
stove users may be sufficient.

  “The introduction of a new cookstove into the household often leads to the “stacking” or use of multiple fuels and
stoves. Rather than fully switching from their traditional fuel stove combinations to the new ones, households tend to
use every combination for the tasks that best fulﬁll their needs, increasing the portfolio of cooking options for the
home. Therefore, measuring the levels of use during the initial adoption and sustained use or disadoption of the new
and traditional stoves is as important as monitoring other technical speciﬁcations of the cooking devices to assure the
sustainability of the beneﬁts from cookstove programs.” I. Ruiz-Mercado, E. Canuz, J.L. Walker and K.R. Smith,
“Quantitative metrics of stove adoption using stove use monitors”, Biomass and Bioenergy (2013).

Indicators in use by international agencies in the cook stoves sector are mainly focused at the impact level
of our theory of change. These would therefore not inform the payment trigger but could be used during
future evaluations. Relevant indicators at impact level are summarised in Table 23.

4.5 Implementing Modalities
           4.5.1 Principals and their Competencies
The principal is defined as the organization that manages the RBF scheme and would usually be a donor
agency or government department. Although there is a range of potential principals, those most likely to
act as an RBF principal might be either national or subnational governments or development agencies
(World Bank, 2013a). Principals and their competencies from the perspective of an RBF scheme for ICS in
Uganda are discussed below.

       G. Government of Uganda
The Renewable Energy Policy for Uganda of 2007 aims to increase the use of modern renewable energy.
The Ugandan Government through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) is
implementing plans to increase the use of modern renewables from 6 to 61 per cent by 2017. This policy
highlights the need for mass adoption of improved cookstoves to reduce demand for biomass energy
resources. MEMD, together with the Ministry of Water and Environment and local governments, has also
supported the development of ordinances in districts where charcoal is produced. These are expected to
regulate charcoal production and trade in an attempt to ensure sustainable supply. The government is also
developing a new Biomass Energy Strategy with a focus on increasing the use of efficient biomass energy
technologies. In 2009 a Climate Change Secretariat was established and capacity building measures for the
Clean Development Mechanism in Uganda were undertaken, chiefly by the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation (NORAD) and the UN Development Programme. Although there are no specific
incentives for investing in cookstoves and fuels manufacturing, Uganda’s fiscal incentive package for both
domestic and foreign investors provides generous capital recovery terms (GACC, 2013). There is, therefore,
a supportive strategic policy environment, although dialogue is ongoing over increasing support for ICS
policies and measures.65
Sector coordination is improving through the new Uganda National Alliance for Clean Cooking (UNACC),
with the Biomass Energy Efficient Technologies Association also playing a manufacturers’ coordinating role.
UNACC – set up in 2013, linked to GACC and supported by the Ministry of Energy – is currently establishing
a secretariat and has developed a Strategic Planning Matrix.
There is experience in the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Private Sector Foundation Uganda
(PSFU) in supporting sustainable energy technology, in particular through the national solar program
supported by the Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) project described in Box 8. Support is also being
planned for the clean cooking sector under the ongoing ERT project, with PSFU and MEMD implementing
activities such as business development and consumer awareness.

      Box 8: The Energy for Rural Transformation program for Solar Home Systems and ICTs
  The Government of Uganda has received funding from the World Bank to implement the second phase of the
  Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) project. This project, following a first phase begun in 2002, aims at scaling
  up investments in rural electrification as well as information and communication technology. Under the project,
  the Rural Electrification Agency will implement the solar photovoltaic (PV) Targeted Market Approach, whose
  main focus is to promote consumer credit and provide consumer subsidies for PV to targeted markets. This is
  expected to result in the installation of 20,000 PV systems in four years, starting in 2013. PV installations will be
  subject to audit and verification before disbursement of subsidies to consumers, much as is anticipated under
  the ICS RBF option 2 described in this report.
  A similar programmatic approach to the ICS sector might be taken in Uganda, and indeed agreements are
  already in place between the World Bank and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to implement ICS
  components, including through Private Sector Foundation Uganda.


In addition to the Rural Electrification Programme, the government of Uganda has experience in
implementing a range of output-based aid programmes, most notably in the health and water sectors.

    H. Donors and International Organizations
There are a number of potential principals in this category. The most active is GIZ, which has key ongoing
roles in the cookstoves sector.
Along with BMZ and the government of the Netherlands, GIZ is implementing a major program on policy,
strategy and capacity development across the energy sector. This includes decentralization and energy
feed-in tariffs. GIZ is also driving a program funded by EnDev to train stove builders in 17 Districts of
Uganda. The Uganda Country Action Platform (GACC, 2013) indicates other donor agencies that may be
considered to have the competency to act as principal (Table 24).

Although they have very limited experience in the cookstoves sector, there are also health sector donors
that could also have an important role to play given the potential public health benefits. The relative
experience of potential health sector principals with interests and experience in Uganda suggests that their
role might be confined to that of program funding.
In conclusion, there is capacity for the program to be run by government or donor agencies, and a detailed
institutional capacity assessment would help determine the right principal. There is most likely a need for
technical assistance in a number of specific areas, as previously identified in Section 4.2.

         4.5.2 Agents and their Competencies
An agent is defined as any organisation or individual that attains the desired RBF result and applies for RBF
funding.
The various manufacturers and other agents that may respond to an RBF scheme are identified in Section 3
and the likely market response, including the response of agents, in Section 4.2.
As discussed in Section 3.4, different levels of RBF incentive can be set for different levels of technology
performance, so the range of agents responding to the scheme will be dependent both on the policy
objective and on the RBF design. This is most likely to include locally manufactured ICS, especially if the
focus of the RBF scheme is on the expanded distribution of quality ICS products. International and high-
performance technologies such as gasifier stoves are likely to best meet the objective of delivering health
benefits.
In terms of the competency of agents there is a considerable variation in the scale of operations, levels of
management capability, quality control and technical performance. Complementary Technical Assistance to
support expanded operations will be needed for some agents. In particular, some consideration must be
given to the fact that existing carbon market agents will have significant capacity to monitor results,
providing a platform for meeting measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements for RBF
implementation.

5. Conclusions
5.1 The ICS Innovation Ecosystem in Uganda
Section 2 described the ecosystem for improved cookstoves in Uganda, including its current scale and
potential market size. There is a nascent ICS market, with a range of small and medium-sized suppliers of
improved cookstoves.
This report has identified the main barriers that must be tackled with the objective of supporting a
commercial market at scale. These are shown in Table 25.

5.2 The Way Forward: RBF for Improved Cookstoves in Uganda
Out of nine candidate options presented, we have identified four feasible options for implementing a
results-based financing program for improved cookstoves in Uganda. These options tackle the main
barriers to the sustained scaling up of the commercial ICS market and can address health objectives if RBF
incentives are set appropriately. One or more of these RBF options could be implemented, depending on
the results of future detailed design work. The four shortlisted options fall into two general categories
depending on supplier or consumer focus, as shown in Figure 20.
One or more of these different RBF options can be considered as candidates for a future national
cookstoves program that follows a policy objective of delivering health benefits by the private sector,
with an emphasis on facilitating the emergence of a commercial ICS market at scale.

Figure 20: Shortlisted RBF options: supplier versus consumer focus


An RBF program in Uganda will not be successful without complementary interventions to address those
barriers that the RBFs themselves do not address. These interventions have been detailed for each RBF in
Section 4. Producers and distributors receive other forms of technical support from development partners,
without which the quality and scale of production is at risk.
The complementary measures that are needed to ensure that the results-based incentives succeed
include: national awareness campaigns, policy changes to lower costs and encourage investment, access to
finance, technical assistance including business development support services, and a national quality
assurance and testing program.
The total potential value for money of the RBF intervention is approximately US$64 million to US$129
million over the first five years and up to approximately US$91 million to US$175 million over the first
seven years; both estimates use the market price of carbon.66 When the social cost of carbon is used
instead, the value for money rises to approximately US$65 million and US$147 million over the five-year
RBF intervention and approximately US$90 million and US$199 million over the first seven years.

5.3 Implementation
The Government of Uganda and development partners have already implemented alternative energy
access initiatives, notably the solar PV program under the MEMD Energy for Rural Transformation
program, with the involvement of the PSFU, REA and other partners.
Our assessment is that international partners or government agencies could act as principal for an RBF
program and that a detailed institutional capacity assessment will help determine the optimal
arrangements. International partners should take forward their existing plans and integrate aspects of the
shortlisted RBF options following detailed design.
This report shows that there are a number of capable agents that would likely respond well to a future
scheme, but that technical assistance for some agents would increase the likelihood of successfully

     The low estimates use low benefits and high scheme and administration costs, and vice versa. See Section 4.3.

Working Assumptions are as follows:
            That 29 per cent of the rural population constitute the “commercial” ICS market (See Section 3.2)
            That maximum penetration rates into any given market are 80 per cent
            That most households will purchase between one and two ICS71
            That each household will replace an ICS every three years

Ongoing and Planned Initiatives in the Cookstove Sector in Uganda
As of June 2013, there are a number of other existing and planned initiatives to stimulate the cookstove
sector in Uganda:
       1. Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Programme (PREEEP), implemented by GIZ
          with BMZ and ENDEV funding.
       2. Increasing the Provision of Clean Energy in Uganda, implemented and funded by the World Wildlife
          Fund (WWF).
       3. Breathing Space, Implemented and funded by Shell Foundation.
       4. Capital Access for Renewable Energy Enterprises (CARE2), implemented by GVEP with SIDA funding.
       5. Uganda Efficient Stove Programme, implemented by Impact Carbon and financed via carbon
          credits.
       6. Improved Cookstoves in East Africa (ICSEA), implemented by the Uganda Carbon Bureau and
          financed via carbon credits and multi-donor seed funding.
       7. Biolite HomeStove Programme, implemented by Impact Carbon, funded by GACC Spark Fund.

The Potential for Innovation Prizes to Stimulate the Cookstove Sector in
Uganda
Innovation Prizes are both a potential tool for delivering RBF and a possible complementary measure. The
options are discussed briefly here.
Consumer Awareness:
Prizes are an effective tool to generate consumer buzz and raise awareness, and are popular among
consumers. Given that consumer awareness is a major hurdle in the cookstove sector, a prize approach
appears to be an appropriate area for further investigation. RBF Option 6 (vouchers to discount the
purchase price of a pre-defined high-quality ICS) presents an option for using a prize as the implementation
modality, building on experience from other initiatives in East Africa such as ONSPEED in Kenya (see box). A
simplified adaptation of this approach for RBF 6 is discussed in Section 3 of the report.

  Example: ONSPEED East Africa
  In 2006-07 an internet company called ONSPEED decided to expand into East Africa. A sales and marketing plan
  was designed in partnership with a local software distribution company in Kenya to promote both the software
  and the brand into the East African market.
  The sale and marketing plan had two parts: offline media and scratch cards. The offline media part of the plan
  involved creating a competition wherein free copies of the software were given to a limited number of entrants,
  the point being to collect mobile numbers that ONSPEED could then use to offer discounts and promotions in the
  future.
  More specifically, ONSPEED ran free or paid radio advertisements targeting commuters, asking them to send a
  text message to a specified number; each week 10 random users were selected to receive a free copy of the
  software. The marketing team then used the mobile numbers that did not win for sending marketing information,
  including an option to opt out of receiving future messages. The platform was very simple: a SIM card installed
  into a laptop, plus software to process the messages. ONSPEED targeted particular areas over time rather than
  spreading its campaign over the entire region.
  The scratch card model was a system whereby people received free scratch cards with newspapers and magazine
  sellers. A limited number of scratch cards gave free copies, but all gave discounts and ONSPEED worked with the
  partner company to have local distributors in major cities.
  Source: Jonathan Slater was the technical director of ONSPEED before changing careers and joining InnoCentive as Director of
  Business Innovation.


Quality and Standards
There are various options both for incentivising improvements in cookstove quality and undertaking and
verification of standards. This is an approach that has been used successfully at a regional level for off-grid
lighting under the Lighting Africa program, supported by the International Finance Corporation. Options
include, but are not limited to, prizes for:
        All stoves that pass a certain level of quality or performance criteria within budget, mid-range and
         premium pricing categories;
        The most improved stove manufacturer; and

        The best quality cookstove wholly produced in Uganda86

The first two are arguably better dealt with through technical assistance and support towards covering the
cost of stove testing; the first because it is focused on getting multiple manufacturers to improve standards
rather than identifying a single clear winner, and the second because it lacks appeal as a marketable award.
The third, which features a clear winner, presents the greatest potential for media buzz. The prize could be
non-financial – marketing and promotional support, for example, for the prize winner and a given number
of runners-up. This would need to be supported with clear product branding and labelling. If linked with
RBF Option 6, the prize for the manufacturer could be having the winning stove model become an
approved cookstove for the voucher scheme.
Best Practice
Innovation prizes are often used to help identify and support best practice through business plan
competitions. These prizes are typically focused on highlighting innovative start-up or small-scale
businesses for inward investment. In Uganda, low levels of inward investment for cookstove companies
may limit potential, though options do exist for prize winners to receive advertising on crowd-funding sites
such as Kiva, for example.87 This could potentially help with the funding barrier for some smaller scale
manufacturers and distribution and sales agents.
Should RBF 1 or 2 be implemented, the market may respond in any number of ways, and some may be
more innovative or successful than others. To identify and highlight best practice, a small-scale prize may
be established part-way through RBF implementation to highlight successful RBF agents and approaches.
This would be intended as a showcase to others, revealing how they might improve market penetration.
Technology Development
Most innovation prizes focus on technical innovation, where their advantages and benefits are well
understood. Beyond establishing and meeting common standards (as discussed above), technology is not a
priority hurdle to the development of the ICS market in Uganda. This is not a static position and could be
revisited once the market is better established; in our opinion, further growth in consumer demand
precedes further donor-stimulated technology development. For example, once a commercial market at
scale is established, it may be appropriate to stimulate further technology development as a way to
continue to raise standards among existing stove users, or bring down costs to target the currently non-
commercial market.
Market Stimulation
So-called “grand challenges”, although relatively rare, show evidence of being able to stimulate significant
change within markets. Typically featuring prize purses of over US$1 million, their use in nascent
commercial markets has brought about rapid expansion including technology development, the
establishment of functioning supply chains, and increased consumer awareness and demand.88 Market
stimulation prizes by their nature depend (in the view of this report) on commercial markets and are not
appropriate for social or environmental goods that lack commercial financial return. They are also best


86
   We suggest a country-level prize rather than a global one if the prize is designed to raise local quality. A global prize
would present an alternative proposition on a much larger scale and would require clear specification to ensure
appropriateness for the Ugandan market.
87
   At least one Uganda distributor has recently benefited from KIVA funding. See http://www.kiva.org.
88
   Examples include the Ansari “XPRIZE” (www.xprize.org)and the historic Orteig prize, which have played important
roles in the space and air travel industries.

applied where a significant technological breakthrough is required, with the prize awarded based on a clear
point of achievement (e.g. the first flight across the Atlantic).
Given that the ICS market we are targeting in Uganda is commercial, a design option for RBFs 1 and 2 could
be the award of a significant prize purse upon reaching a specific sales (or sales in use) target; however, we
do not think this approach is appropriate in the Ugandan context. Firstly, because there are a large number
of suppliers in the market, a market stimulation prize that rewards just the first-past-the-post would limit
support to just one supplier – strengthening a monopoly position rather than supporting multiple actors.
Secondly, although there is benefit to be attained from improved technical performance of ICS – and there
have been suggestions of a global ICS technology prize89 – there is no particular technical hurdle that needs
to be overcome at this point, with high-end ICS already being available from international suppliers, and
continued technical innovation better harnessed globally rather than nationally.
Thirdly, indications from recent grand challenges90 suggest that large prize purses that reward first-past-
the-post can lead to “gaming,” where corporations seek to maximise output to win the prize rather than
focusing on long-term commercial success
