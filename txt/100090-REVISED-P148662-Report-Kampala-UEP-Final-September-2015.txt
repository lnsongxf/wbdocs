This Urban Environmental Profile benefited immensely from close collaboration with representatives from the
Government of Uganda, including the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), Ministry of Lands, Housing & Urban
Development, Ministry of Water & Environment, National Environmental Management Authority and National Water
& Sewerage Corporation. The team would like to express its gratitude especially to Ms. Jennifer Semakula Musisi and
Ms. Judith Tukahirwa Tumusiime of KCCA, for their close involvement and guidance, and to their team represented by
Dr. Najib Lukooya Bateganya and Mary Karooma for their support and important contributions made.

The study would not have been possible without the generous financial contribution of Korean Green Growth Partnership.

is a structure to balance development and mitigate the
loss of assets, or to preserve or even enhance them. A
strategic concept would provide the platform for the city
to use innovative tools; such as development offsets, now
being considered. Wetland degradation is the primary
example. Historically, the Kampala region has been
uniquely bestowed with an abundance of this highly
valuable natural resource. Within KCCA, this resource is
now largely gone—resulting in what could be described as
the very the opposite of “Green Urban Development.”

Development in Kampala and its environmental impacts
needs to be considered at the metropolitan scale. The
broader metropolitan region still has critical natural assets,
such as the large area of wetlands east of Murchison
Bay, which should be protected and conserved as
urbanization expands. Proper consideration of proposals
for development in the context of the remaining assets can
allow the city to avoid the mistakes of the past.

Valuable ecosystems are under acute pressure, and action
will need to be taken soon if their continued deterioration
is to be arrested. From a fiscal perspective, Kampala will
have limited resources to invest in gray infrastructure
that is required to offset the degradation of the green
asset base. Given these constraints, leadership and
institutional actions—feasible and capable of addressing
key problems—are particularly important.

II.	     BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Kampala has experienced decades of significant urban
growth and is currently the second-fastest-growing city
in Eastern Africa. As Uganda’s capital city, Kampala is the
industrial, commercial, and education center and vital to
the country’s economic growth. As shown in Figure 1,
the city (referred to as the Kampala City Center Area or
KCCA), is within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area
(GKMA), which also includes the inner suburbs, the outer
dormitory towns and suburbs, peripheral towns, and peri-                                   KCCA
urban extension to the south-west towards the Entebbe
community (referred to as the KMTC) (KCCA, 2012).
KCCA consists of five urban divisions, including: Central,
Kawempe, Makindye, Lubaga and Nakawa. Collectively,
these divisions cover a total of 189 square km, with 169
square km of land and approximately 20 square km of
water. The GKMA is a 970 km2 area roughly defined by
a 20km radius from Kampala City Centre that includes
171 parishes, of which 99 are in Kampala District, nine in
Mukono District and 63 in Wakiso District (Uganda Ministry
of Works and Transport, 2008).

The city of Kampala developed on hills linked by wide
valleys of wetlands and river channels that flow into the

Kampala has grown outward from the urban center along
upland corridors, with development spreading down the
slopes of the city’s 24 hills into the low-lying wetland
areas (Figure 2, N.B. darker colors indicate areas of
steep topography). This growth has led to an increasingly
inefficient pattern of development that encroaches into
wetland areas. This pattern has furthermore presented
difficulties for provision of adequate sanitation, drainage,
flood control and environmental asset protection in
addition to proving costly for the government to service
(KCCA, 2013; Fichtner, 2014).

About 23% of the GKMA is fully urbanized, a significant
portion (60%) is semi-urbanized, and the remainder
consists of rural settlements. These rural areas are those
generally not represented by color overlays (Figure 3)
(KCCA, 2014b). By contrast, the KCCA is almost entirely
developed, with less than 10% of the land mass vacant.
Approximately 7% of the GKMA area is wetlands (KCCA,
2012).

A consequence of rapid urbanization has been the overall
decline in the quality of the urban natural environment.
The impacts of climate change have exacerbated the rate
and extent of environmental degradation and have made
the city’s efforts toward environmental management all the
more challenging.

As Kampala’s population has increased, open space
and undeveloped land in the city center has been
replaced with development that has often occurred in
environmentally vulnerable areas. Figure 6 illustrates
Kampala spatial development from 1989 to 2010. Prior to
1989, most development occurred within upland areas of
the urban core and along major transportation corridors,
which represented 27% of KCCA’s total land area (Abebe,
2013). With the increase in population, particularly
the in-migration of the rural poor, development spread
to unplanned areas on the lower slopes and low-lying
drainage corridors and marginal areas: areas are often
prone to flooding and are environmentally vulnerable.

From 1989 to 2010, the area of developed land increased
from 27% to 78% (Abebe, 2013). Figure 7 illustrates
the trend in the conversion of land from undeveloped           Figure 6   Spatial development from 1989 to 2010 in GKMA and KCCA
to developed within the past 25 years. The majority of         Source: Abebe, 2013
Kampala’s urban development has been residential,
which covers approximately 23% of the GKMA landmass
(over 60% of the total developed areas in the GKMA) and
approximately 64% of the KCCA land area. Employment-
associated land uses account for 3% of the GKMA land area
and 10% of the KCCA. Public services and facilities land
uses are 2% of the GKMA and 6% of the KCCA (KCCA, 2012).

A recent survey estimated that 40% of the city population,
and much of the recent migration, live in informal
settlements and/or slums that lack basic infrastructure
services for the provision of water, storm drainage, sewage
treatment, and solid waste collection (KCCA, 2012).
While an array of practical and social factors have driven
informality, the demand for affordable and accessible          Figure 7   KCCA Undeveloped and Developed Land, 1985-2010
housing has been key. Planning scenario projections            Source: AECOM created chart with data from Abebe, 2013
indicate that the demand for land could vary between
200,000 ha in the worst case scenario to around 100,000
ha in the best case scenario by 2040 (Figure 8).The dense
informal settlements predominate at the edges of the
wetland corridors throughout the city and, as later sections
of this document will discuss, have become one of the key
drivers of environmental degradation of the water quality
in wetlands and drainage courses.

Climate Change
As Kampala is located near the equator, there is little
fluctuation in the average temperature throughout the
year. Temperatures range from average lows in the mid-60s
F to average highs in the low 80s F. However, the tropical
rainforest climate provides variation, with two annual
wet seasons. There is a long rainy season from August
to December and a short rainy season from February to
June that has substantially heavier rainfall per month. The
average annual rainfall is between 1,750 and 2,000 mm,
with monthly rainfall ranging from approximately 50mm to
260mm (World Meteorological Organization, 2013 in UN              Figure 9   Monthly Rainfall Recorded at Makerere University
Habitat 2013) (Figure 9). Recent climate projections for                         May 2012-April 2013
Uganda conclude that while overall rainfall totals for the        Source: UN Habitat, 2013
country may remain similar to the present, and Kampala’s
total rainfall may decrease (Figure 10), the seasonality
of rainfall may see a longer wet season that extends from
September through to the start of the February rainy
season (Baastel, 2014, Baastel, 2014b).

Projected climate change impacts for Kampala anticipate
an increase in temperature and decrease in overall
precipitation, threatening water supplies (Baastel,
2014). Recent analysis focused on Kampala suggests a
temperature increase of 1.5ºC to 3.0ºC by 2095 (Figure 11)
and a 20 mm decrease in precipitation by 2095 (Figure 10)
under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions projection.
(Baastel, 2014). Furthermore, a rise in mean annual
                                                                  Figure 10   Observed and Future Rainfall in Kampala
temperatures could intensify an urban heat island effect          Source: Baastel, 2014
that where built-up areas absorb and generate more
heat than nearby rural areas. This combination of higher
temperatures could strain water resources by reducing
flows and degrading quality.

The city has already experienced an increase in rainfall
during extreme climate events. Rainfall data is being
developed at a weather station installed at Kampala’s
Makerere University as part of a flood modeling program.
While there is limited modeling and few weather stations,
the analysis indicates an increase in intensity of rainfall
and greater likelihood of extreme weather effects that can
cause harm to human and natural systems (UN-Habitat,
2013).

chronic urban environmental management conditions due
to rapid urbanization without corresponding development
of urban services. The City of Kampala’s Carbon Disclosure

the predictability of planting and harvesting and increasing
already-chronic flooding (CDP, 2013). Low-lying areas
of informal settlements will continue to be the most
vulnerable as they are already located in hazard prone
areas and are subject to flooding and or high storm runoff
from the adjacent hills (UN-Habitat, 2012). During heavy
rains in June and November, 2014, there were news reports
of trees uprooted and latrine slabs lifted and carried by
floodwaters, polluting waters with human waste (Daily
Monitor, June 10, 2014; UGO News, 2014). Public health
challenges from increased flooding include the rise of
cholera outbreaks during the rainy season (Lwasa, 2010).

Although new information about climate change specific
to Kampala is underdevelopment (Baastel, 2014), the
city’s efforts to address climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions have been limited. There is a Climate
Change unit within the Ministry of Water and Environment,
but a national policy on climate change has yet to be
produced. However, there is no local adaptation policy
to comprehensively address climate change issues in an
integrated and strategic manner. There is an inherently
low capacity to adapt to climate change given the large
population of urban poor, the un-serviced informal
settlements, and inadequate urban services in general
(Lwasa, 2010).

III.	 QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS
Kampala’s key environmental assets are predominantly the
network of wetland waterways that course throughout the
city, delivering a suite of ecological services, including flood
attenuation, water purification, and wastewater treatment.
The quality and function of the city’s aquatic system has
been significantly degraded. The city’s terrestrial assets are
composed of hills, open spaces, and trees. These areas are
being rapidly developed and lack formal protection and
environmental management. While there is limited data
available about the city’s air quality, existing findings show
increased degradation due to the rise in vehicle emissions.
Furthermore, the lack of national air quality standards will
continue to delay establishment of baseline monitoring.

The City of Kampala and the GKMA are rich with aquatic
environmental assets. The urban fabric has been shaped
by the wetlands and the waters that flow into Murchison
Bay on Lake Victoria (Figure 2). These aquatic ecosystems
provide floodwater attenuation, sewage treatment, water
purification, food, and building materials, while areas such
as Lutembe Bay, designated an Important Bird Area by
BirdLife International, provide critical habitat for the city’s
biodiversity.


Wetlands
The City has relied on Kampala’s wetlands throughout
the settlement’s history to provide numerous ecological
services that support the City:

  •	 Wetlands have served as the city’s primary                    Photo: Farming in Wetlands.
                                                                   Source: AECOM
     infrastructure for physically and biologically
     cleansing water, filtering out sediments and
     nutrients that enable the raw drinking water to be
     cost-effectively treated for human consumption.
  •	 The wetland system has also served as the city’s
     primary sponge for absorbing stormwaters, slowly
     releasing and cleansing waters by discharging into
     Lake Victoria or recharging groundwater flows.
  •	 Wetlands have provided the city’s predominant
     human waste processing function by receiving raw
     sewage and mechanically treated waste water,
     processing nutrient loads, and releasing waste water
     downstream with a higher degree of treatment.
  •	 Wetlands have provided food, fuel, and building
     materials. Additionally, the wetlands help
     support the fisheries that provide livelihoods
     for approximately 1,200 people at Portbell,
     Ggaba and Munyonyo (KCCA, 2014).

Degradation of the Nakivubo and its deteriorating water
quality has caused the National Water and Sewerage
Corporation (NWSC) to relocate their raw water intake and
treatment facility as a result of increased treatment costs
(see Figure 17). The major challenge facing drinking water
treatment in Kampala is pollution of the water source at
Gaba, which is heavily saturated with effluent discharges
from Nakivubo Channel (MOE Dir of Water, 2010). The
treatment costs at the Gaba Water Works facility near the
outlet of the Nakivubo increased fourfold over the last 10
years as a result of the encroachment of Nakivubo and
degrading water quality (Kansiime et al., 2007; NEMA Exec
Dir speech, 2011). The potential of the Nakivubo wetland
to provide some natural pre-filtering has been almost             Figure 17   Increased Costs of Water Treatment Chemicals in Gaba

The regulatory context for the development of the land
during the colonial period established conditions that led to
further environmental degradation beyond the challenges
of working with the physiography. Urban development of
the land under the control of the British Crown was subject
to formal planning, while the area occupied by the local
African population evolved organically without formal
physical planning (Koojo, 2005). Decades of expanding
urban development has led to the clearance of much of
the natural vegetation on the hill tops and slopes. This has
destabilized the soil and caused increased runoff, erosion,
siltation, and flooding in the low lying areas between.

system. For ease of construction and to reduce costs, the
transport infrastructure is located in low-lying areas. The
impacts of road construction, the disturbance of land on
either side of the road, increased runoff, the parcelization
of wetland sections, and the disruption of hydrology
functions have also contributed to the degradation of
wetlands. At the same time, low-lying roads also facilitate
the informal settlement of wetland edges alongside new
roads (i.e. Northern Bypass).

The Namanve Forest Reserve is a formally gazetted area
of forest located in Kira district, approximately 15km east
of Kampala’s city center. While approximately 1,000 ha
were de-gazetted in 1997 and allocated to the Uganda
Investment Authority for development, approximately
1,200 ha remained as gazetted. While there are numerous
reports in local media concerning development activities
occurring within the forest reserve, such as tree plantations
and housing settlements, the state of this environmental
asset is not widely documented (New Vision, 2013c; Daily
Monitor, 2013; Observer, 2013).

Kampala’s seasonal rains (August to December and
February to June), which generate pollutant-laden
stormwater runoff that spreads across the land, also
influence the diversity of vegetation growth by season.
For example, vegetation studies of the city’s Mapererwe
Landfill area at Kiteezi reveal that while there are 108
plant species observed growing in the area during the
dry season, an additional 37 plant species were recorded
growing during the wet season (AWE, 2013). Additionally,
eight of the dry season species are specially adapted to

Kampala prepared a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory
in 2012, using 2012 as the inventory base year. Solid
waste and wastewater discharge sectors contributed
the greatest amount of GHG emissions, 42% and 23%
respectively. These numbers reflect the lack of mechanisms
for capturing methane, a high-intensity greenhouse
gas, at the city’s Mpererwe Landfill. Furthermore, the
significant amount of emissions from sanitation reflects
the use of pit latrines, septic systems, and other non-
central sewage collection systems that release methane
without any capture by treatment facilities (Lwasa, 2013).
Transportation-related emissions are likely to increase
with improvement in roads as well as the rise in private
modes of transport within the city-region (Lwase, 2013)
(See discussion of Emissions as a driver of air quality
degradation).                                                     Photo: Kampala on a clear day.

Overview of Air Quality Trends
Based on the limited data available from a pilot study and
media reports, Kampala’s local air quality appears to show
signs of poor quality with regard to particulate matter
from vehicles, road dust and biomass burning. While data
from air quality measurements at the city landfills in the
outer-lying area of the city conforms to the draft national
standards, it is likely that additional air quality monitoring
of Kampala’s urbanized areas, similar to the 2014
Schwander et al. study, will continue to show a correlation
of poor air quality where there is significant vehicle and
road presence. The absence of adopted, national air quality
standards will likely delay any significant efforts to generate
comprehensive baseline data with periodic monitoring of
the city’s air quality.                                           Photo: Kampala on a day with extensive air pollution.
                                                                  Source: Schwander et al, 2014
From a greenhouse gas (GHG) perspective, Kampala’s
establishment of a 2012 GHG baseline is a strong start
for assessing future GHG emissions trends and evaluating
impacts from GHG mitigation activities, such as the
proposed landfill gas capture infrastructure for Mpererwe
Landfill. Given the growth of vehicles in Kampala (see
Drivers section on Air Emissions), it is anticipated that GHG
emissions from vehicles will grow. Future GHG inventories
will be needed to evaluate whether improved solid
waste management and construction of new wastewater
treatment facilities with higher levels of overall sewerage
treatment will be effective in capturing GHG emissions and
preventing their release into the atmosphere.

C.	        Stormwater Runoff
Expansion of the city’s drainage system has not kept up
with the rapid urban growth and development of informal
settlements. As previously stated, Kampala has seen a
197% increase in the number of buildings constructed in
the city from 2004-2010. The extent of impervious surfaces
and compacted land area, the higher rates of precipitation
and increasing storm events, and poor maintenance of
the existing drainage system collectively have caused an
increase in the volume and coefficient of runoff. This lack
of an adequate drainage system required to manage storm
water runoff and flooding is a key driver of Kampala’s
environmental asset degradation. A reduction in pervious
land creates greater storm water runoff volumes, leading to
increased flooding and increased pollution of waterways as
storm water collects solid and liquid waste from settlement
areas and roads, transporting pollutants into the city’s
wetlands.

Between 2004 and 2010, Kampala’s amount of impervious
roof area has grown 262% across the city with substantial
increases in each drainage area (Figure 22) (Table 4). Also,
                                                                        Figure 22   Increase in Roof Area per Catchment, 2004-2010
the buildings have generally increased in size, leading to an           Source: UN, 2013
even higher rate of increase in roof area. These conditions
have increased the frequency and severity of flooding
problems throughout the city. A detailed case study
analysis as part of the Kampala Flood Risk Management
Report 2013 shows that the amount of impervious surfaces
in a catchment is a major determinant of the volume and
speed of surface water runoff and therefore flooding (UN-
Habitat, 2013).

untreated leachate to mix with stormwater and move off
site (AWE, 2013). The landfill’s leachate discharged into
groundwater, without full treatment by reed beds, has
posed a significant health risk to the adjacent community.
Specifically, water analysis from three nearby community
boreholes that access an aquifer adjacent to the landfill
showed that the levels of lead were 20, 80 and 90 times,
respectively, higher than the national standard for potable
water (AWE, 2013). Lead exposure, particularly for children,
can cause numerous health effects and have a harmful
impact on children’s learning and behavior (WHO, 2014).
The high levels of lead at the landfill are attributed to           Figure 24   Composition of Solid Waste Collected

emits methane from the decomposition of wastes. While
a system was designed to capture the landfill’s methane
and convert the gas into an energy source, the system has
not yet been installed, enabling this high-intensity GHG to
contribute to global climate change (AWE, 2013).

Another factor in air quality in Kampala is the large
number of motorbikes (or “boda-bodas”) driven in the
city. Motorcycles have a significant impact on air quality
as they generate more pollution per Km than other
vehicles. Boda-boda usage data is variable. In Uganda,
since 2009, approximately twice as many boda-bodas have
been imported compared to all other vehicles combined
(Table 10). KCCA Strategic Plan recently noted that a free
registration exercise recorded 55,000 motorcycles (KCCA,
2014b). In 2011, boda-bodas accounted for 42% of vehicles
on Kampala’s roads but only carried 8.5% of the passengers
(Figure 24) (KCCA, n.d.a).

with the expanding number of vehicles in the city has led
to traffic congestion. Vehicles idling in traffic contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions in addition to GHGs released
when moving to the destination point. In 2011, a baseline
of automobile traffic flow on Kampala roads was recorded
at 181,216 vehicles per day (KCCA, 2011 as cited in
Watundu, 2013). Limited availability of data inhibits a
comparison of average traffic counts in Kampala from
additional years.

                      One key regulatory function of NEMA is the review and approval of Environmental Impact
                      Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements as well as Environmental
                      Audits. Further on the management of wetlands, NEMA is empowered as the authority, in
                      consultation with the lead agencies, District Environment Committees and local
                      environment committees, to establish guidelines for the sustainable management of
                      wetlands, to identify wetlands of local, national, and international importance and to
                      declare wetlands to be protected wetlands. There are around 65 NEMA staff (of which
                      around 35 are technical staff and the rest non-technical staff) to cover its entire portfolio.

                      resources for sustained utilization. Within the department, there are two divisions: (i) Policy,
                      planning and enforcement – for M&E (eg encroachment), EIAs report review, auditing and
                      standards; and (ii) awareness-raising, information and management – for R&D, assessment
                      and inventory (coverage and info), district supervision (training and technical support).
                      Currently the department has only 20 technical staff covering the entire country, with 1 staff
                      in each district.
