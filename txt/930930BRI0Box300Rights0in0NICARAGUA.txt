   KEY   MESSAGES:
    hmed Al-Sabir, Bushra Binte Alam,
   Adolescents El-Saharty
    and Sameh perceive gender inequality in terms of decision-making and access to family planning methods.

   Most adolescents have little knowledge about the laws and their rights.

   The Constitution recognizes and upholds the dignity of the person and establishes unconditional equality of
    all Nicaraguans, however laws and policies are not being enforced.

   Although the SRH curriculum has been developed properly, teacher training, resources and classroom
    planning are impractical.
