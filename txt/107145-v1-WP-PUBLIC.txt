baseline forecast also assumes (i) agreement on
an IMF EFF leading to fiscal adjustment and lower
debt-to-GDP levels, and (ii) some trickling in of
grants and concessional financing pledged at the
February 2016 London donor conference. Jordan’s
announced plan to create jobs for Jordanians and
Syrian refugees, attract new investment, rebuild host
communities, and mobilize sufficient financing to
support its macroeconomic framework is ambitious
and contingent on timely reform implementation.

vi.      The balance of risks is on the downside.
Chiefly, Jordan will need to continue managing
repercussions from the regional security and
political situation, and the challenges of hosting
1.37 million Syrians (of which 639,704 registered
refugees).1 Additionally, since Jordan benefits from
the GCC for remittances, exports, FDI and grants –
large sources of foreign exchange - persistently low
oil prices are a risk for Jordan this year and in the
medium term. Weak global demand may impact
demand for Jordan’s mining exports. Furthermore,
the willingness and speed of reform implementation
particularly to improve the business climate will be
crucial to attract Jordan’s investment aspirations.

                                                     BOX 1. The Jordan Compact.


 Jordan has committed to the Jordan Compact to address the challenges presented by the Syrian refugee crisis.
 At the February 4th, 2016 ‘Supporting Syria and the Region’ conference in London, Jordan committed to the Compact,
 “a new holistic approach between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the international community to deal with
 the Syrian refugee crisis.” The Compact supports the Jordan Response Plan for 2016-2018 which assesses budgetary
 needs of US$ 8 billion for refugee and resilience response programs across impacted sectors including education,
 energy, environment, health, justice, livelihoods and food security, local governance and municipal services, shelter,
 social protection, transport, and water sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
 The Compact centers on the following three pillars:
          “1. Turning the Syrian refugee crisis into a development opportunity that attracts new investments and
          opens up the EU market with simplified rules of origin, creating jobs for Jordanians and Syria refugees whilst
          supporting the post-conflict Syrian economy;
          2. Rebuilding Jordanian host communities by adequately financing through grants the Jordan Response Plan
          2016-2018, in particular the resilience of host communities; and
          3. Mobilizing sufficient grants and concessionary financing to support the macroeconomic framework and
          address Jordan’s financing needs over the next three years, as part of Jordan entering into a new Extended
          Fund Facility program with the IMF.”
 Additionally, Jordan commits to undertaking reforms towards achieving the Compact. These are related to
 reforms that improve the business and investment environments, implement administrative procedures allowing
 Syrian refugees to apply for work permits and allow Syrian refugees to formalize their businesses. The Compact also
 focuses on the education sector, committing to provide education to each child in Jordan for the 2016/2017 academic
 year. The plan is estimated to cost US$ 1 billion to implement over 2016-2018 and hinges on financial support from
 the international community and relaxed rules of origin from the EU.
 While the international community has pledged financial support towards the Compact, a number of areas
 require clarification. Pledges in London amounted to US$ 700 million in grants in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and
 further support is expected from multilaterals to scale up concessional financing to Jordan. Four related points are
 important to understand to assess fiscal impacts: (i) first, the amount of firm financing specifically for Jordan is yet
 to be announced, including how much financing is new and incremental to what has already been programmed by
 donors; (ii) second, the split of financing between grants and concessional financing and at what terms would impact
 Jordan’s fiscal balance, interest cost, and debt levels; (iii) third, how much of the support will support humanitarian
 versus development programming; (iv) finally, how much financing will be disbursed through the budget or off-
 budget. Off-budget funding is typically directly channeled to NGOs and UN agencies, and while welcome, would not
 be captured in supporting the fiscal balance.

18.      Jordan’s banking indicators largely
improved in 2015. Banks’ nonperforming loans
(NPL) ratio continued to improve for the fourth
year in a row to 4.0 percent by end-2015 from
8.5 percent end-2011 and the lowest since 2008
(4.2 percent) (Table 1). While banks’ Return on
Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) both
slightly weakened to 10.3 percent and 1.3 percent
respectively by end-2015 (compared to 11.0 percent
and 1.4 percent respectively), the capital adequacy
and leverage ratios both improved to 19.1 percent
and 13.0 percent, respectively, by end-2015. For the
first time since 2012, banks’ exposure to sovereign
debt13 is lower at the end of the year compared to
the previous year. By end-2015, this accounted for
40.6 percent of total assets (and further to 40.4
percent by end-January 2016) compared to 40.8
percent end-2014.

of commercial banks’ aggregate investment in claims on public

22.     However, the balance of risks is on the
downside. Chiefly, Jordan will need to continue
managing repercussions from the regional security
and political situation, and the challenges of hosting
1.27 million Syrians (of which 639,704 registered
refugees). Additionally, since Jordan benefits from
the GCC for remittances, exports, FDI and grants
- large sources of foreign exchange - persistently
low oil prices are a risk for Jordan this year and in
the medium term. Also, fiscal adjustment fatigue
becomes a more prominent risk in the upcoming
period. Weak global demand could depress demand
for potash and phosphate, particularly from India
and China. Furthermore, the willingness and speed
of reform implementation particularly to improve
the business climate will be crucial to attract the
investment Jordan aspires for.

23.     Jordan’s initiative to create economic
opportunities for Jordanians and Syrian refugees
is ambitious, and contingent on timely reform
implementation. The plan to create jobs for
Jordanians and Syrian refugees by attracting new
investment is an innovative holistic approach to an
emergency situation involving a number of actors
in the international community (Box 1). Jordan will
need to embark on investment climate reform, labor
market reform, trade reform, and special economic
zones development to implement the plan, among
other measures. Under the plan, five development
zones will be provided with investment incentives.
Combined with easier access to European markets

                       BOX 2. The Emergency Services and Social Resilience Program – Fact Sheet.

The World Bank responds to the Syrian crisis through a comprehensive package of interventions. At the early
stages of the Syrian refugee crisis, the World Bank provided a State and Peace-building Fund Grant (SPF, US$1.2 million)
to improve access to basic education, vocational training opportunities for targeted host and displaced communities.
As the crisis intensified, a larger program of support was designed to help Jordan build up resilience to the current
and future impacts of conflict spillover. Through a loan of US$ 150 million, the World Bank funded an Emergency
Project to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflict which financed vaccines, drugs and treatment of
Jordanians crowded out of public hospitals, as well as universal bread and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) subsidies. The
Emergency Services and Social Resilience Program was launched in 2012 as another component of the World Bank’s
support to host communities with the objective of helping Jordanian municipalities and host communities address
the immediate service delivery impacts of Syrian refugee inflows, and strengthen municipal capacity to support local
economic development. The operation formed part of a wider World Bank response to support Jordan mitigate the
socio-economic impact of Syrian refugees.
Beneficiaries
ESSRP targets municipalities most affected by the Syrian crisis using as a proxy the proportional increase in total
population. In its first year of implementation, the ESSRP supported nine municipalities in the Northern Governorates
of Irbid and Mafraq. At the time, both Governorates were hosting 55 percent of the refugee population in Jordan. The
nine selected municipalities had an estimated population of about 791,150 Jordanians and 299,000 Syrians. By the
second year, it was evident that the pressure of the refugee influx was expanding to other parts of the country including
in the middle and southern regions. As such, an additional seven municipalities were targeted bringing the total number
of participating municipalities to 16 with an estimated population of 1.8 million, of whom a quarter million were Syrian
refugees. Given the focus of the Project on supporting non-exclusionary municipal services, it benefited both host and
refugee communities. The participatory mechanisms of the Project were intended to promote inclusion and enhance
the voice of host communities including women and children. With its focus on institutional support, the Project also
sought to support institutions at different levels to prepare emergency preparedness and risk management plans and
systems.
Project Components and Activities
Funding investments in municipal services through the transfer of annual municipal grants. The ESSRP was
designed as a simple project with two main components – 1) A municipal grants component and 2) A capacity building
and Project management component. Component 1 provides direct Municipal Grants to municipalities on an annual
basis. The individual allocations are based on the total number of refugees and are transferred to municipalities on a
bi-annual basis thereby providing some predictability that allows municipalities to plan for the use of resources over
a multi-year period. Municipal grants financed public services and programs that were directly within the municipal
competence – e.g. solid waste management, rehabilitation of roads, street lighting, pest control, recreational facilities,
local economic development and livelihoods, etc. in addition to financing the rehabilitation and building of social
infrastructure, such as women’s and children’s centers, soccer fields, parks, or other communal infrastructure, activities
and services. The identification and prioritization of key investments is done through a community consultative process
that leverages consultative mechanisms established and supported by other partners including UNDP, USAID and
others.
The ESSRP provided critical technical assistance to strengthen capacity of implementing partners including
municipalities. Component 2 finances technical assistance to participating municipalities to help them plan, implement
and manage activities funded by the Municipal Grant, as well as project management support to implementing agencies
to coordinate, manage and oversee the Project. It also provides capacity building for key Government agencies and
vulnerable communities in emergency preparedness, and risk planning, management and financing. Project management
support is extended to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA), the Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB)
and other national and subnational agencies and institutions involved in the coordination, management and oversight
of the Project’s implementation. It finances inter alia implementation support, fiduciary and safeguards oversight and
management, and other project related communication activities, workshop, trainings and Project monitoring.

 Sarhan municipality built a space to house a sewing workshop for women. One of the owners of a garment
 factory in one of the Qualified Industrialized Zones (QIZ) established the sewing workshop to create employment
 opportunities for the women residing in the town. The workshop employed over 150 women in two shifts. The
 investment in building a new space for the workshop through the ESSRP enabled hiring up to 400 women and
 meeting hygienic standards for work. The success of this partnership between the municipality and the private sector
 has prompted other municipalities to seek similar opportunities. On one of the visits to a neighboring community,
 one of the women who was also a member of the municipal council said that creating opportunities for women in
 their hometown was critical since their families would not be in favor of them traveling out of the town for work.

 ESSRP is monitored through an independent organization that examines process and outcome performance.
 The World Bank and DFID had contracted REACH – an independent organization - to undertake the monitoring and
 impact evaluation of the ESSRP. The aim of the monitoring process is to identify and extract best practices and lessons
 learned, to make the necessary adjustments to Project implementation, and to inform similar engagements that
 seek to address the needs of host communities as a result of urban displacement. The REACH monitoring is based
 on a combination of household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews with municipal staff
 and implementing partners. The monitoring rounds look at process level monitoring and outcome level monitoring
 (Figure 25). Process level monitoring examines change at the institutional level based on three indicators of successful
 interventions: the relevance of interventions and their alignment with priority needs; the accountability of the process
 by which interventions are selected and subsequently implemented; and, finally, the efficiency of the implemented
 projects, namely the efficiency of the procurement process, the extent to which assets are being efficiently used
 and the financial sustainability of funded projects. The outcome level monitoring examines the effectiveness of the
 interventions and the quality of service delivery and perceptions of improvements amongst the community.

 Gharb Irbid represents an example of a municipality which conducted well designed effective community
 consultations, with a high diversity of participants and detailed documentation to ensure that the results of
 these processes inform the planning and design of projects. Municipal officials reported they held 10 community
 discussions, in 10 separate villages, as well as more general outreach activities, such as bilateral meetings and
 informal conversations at weddings and community events. It appeared that the officials within the Local Development
 Unit (LDU) were personally motivated to communicate and engage with the local community. For the community
 discussions, participants were selected from a diversity of backgrounds, including mokhtars (community leaders),
 women’s groups, Syrians and representatives of community based organizations (CBOs) and the private sector.
 Potentially as a result of the wide geographical reach of these consultations 5 percent of households reported that
 they had been consulted and 100 percent of consulted households reported they were either satisfied or very
 satisfied with the process. Further, the LDU was able to provide copies of the documentation for this process, which
 demonstrates that there was a clear and transparent mechanism by which the communities’ opinions were recorded
 and subsequently taken into account in the planning process.

towards supporting longer-term approaches
that helped mitigate the impact of the crisis on
services that were already stretched in meeting the
needs of the Jordan’s own citizens. Amongst the
lessons learnt, however, is that the efficiency and
effectiveness of working through local authorities is
conditioned upon the capacity of existing systems
across all levels of Government.

40.      Supporting resilience at the community
and institutional level is critical for addressing
situations of protracted displacement. However,
such support should be complemented with reform
efforts that support improvements in the efficiency
and accountability of service delivery systems.
In the case of Jordan, and while the design of the
Project was kept simple, its procedures were
streamlined, and municipalities were provided with
maximum flexibility to manage the implementation
of their investments, the efficiency of the Project’s
interventions was undermined by a centralized
and bureaucratic local governance system and a
generally low level of capacity at the municipal
level. Despite ongoing and past efforts to address
these inefficiencies, municipal performance
continues to suffer from structural issues that
relate to an unpredictable and tight fiscal transfer
system, a limited revenue base and heavily staffed
municipalities that are running large amounts of debt
and high salary costs. The ability of the Project to
finance a broader range of social and developmental
services was also constrained by the absence of
systems in place for allowing municipalities to work
with other partners like the private sector and non-
governmental organizations. In light of the newly
passed decentralization and municipal laws, Jordan
faces a real opportunity to embark on a systematic
process of reforms that can address these systematic
issues and unlock the potential for creating a more
accountable system of local governance; one that
delivers better and more efficient services to its
citizens.

developed an alternative method for estimating
poverty by imputing household consumption data
into the Employment-Unemployment Survey, which
is conducted every quarter. This approach offers
alternate annual poverty estimates for Jordan. Based
on this new approach, estimates for 2011 and
2012 point to a small decrease in the poverty rate
compared to 2010. Previous Bank research revealed,
however, that a third of the population lived below
the poverty line in at least one quarter of the year.
Hence, while progress continues in tackling chronic
poverty, transient poverty affects a large swath of
the population, which points to a large share of
vulnerable Jordanians.



Syrian Refugees and Labor Market Outcomes in
Jordan: (Special Focus 2) A large influx of refugees
into a country occurring over a relatively short
time is bound to have a major impact on the host
country’s labor market. While in principle both
positive and negative impacts could arise from such
a shock, ultimately the net impact on the Jordanian
labor market remains an empirical question. Official
data are utilized to examine the impact on three
labor market indicators – labor force participation,
the employment rate and the unemployment rate
- while accounting for economic activity through
using construction permits as a control variable, at
the level of governorates. The Vector Autoregression
(VAR) methodology has been adopted on panel
data that involves a cross-section of governorates
in Jordan, during the time period Q4 2007 to Q3
2013. We find evidence suggesting that the Syrian
refugees are causing a reduction in the national labor
force participation rate of Jordanians. Preliminary
analysis reveals this could be the result of refugees
willing to work for relatively low wages, causing a
