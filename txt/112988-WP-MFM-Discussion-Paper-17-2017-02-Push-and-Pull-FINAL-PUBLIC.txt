Abstract

Over the past decade, a large number of low- and lower-middle income ‘frontier
economies’ have begun to access international private capital markets to meet fiscal
financing needs. In this paper we seek to identify drivers of this trend, identify associated
risks, and present policy implications for frontier-market policy-makers. Through simple
analysis of the characteristics of recent frontier market issuers, we show that smaller,
poorer, and less well-governed economies are now accessing global credit markets.
Through cross-country regression analysis, however, we demonstrate that the capacity of
these countries to issue debt (and the cost of this debt) continues to be influenced by their
macroeconomic performance and quality of governance. Drawing on evidence from Ghana
and Zambia, we illustrate potential risks arising from recent expansions of access to global
debt markets, where rapid debt accumulation of foreign-denominated debt in the context
of lessened market discipline and following recent debt relief is now posing pronounced
debt sustainability and refinancing risks. We conclude that increased access to international
debt markets presents both opportunities and risks to frontier issuers. The new cohort of
frontier issuing economies should: i) take careful account of debt risks and debt
sustainability considerations when developing fiscal policy and debt strategies; ii) work to
reduce the costs of ongoing external borrowing through adopting sound economic policies
and protecting credit ratings; and iii) develop domestic debt markets as a potential
alternative source of fiscal financing through which to reduce reliance on foreign-
denominated Eurobond debt with its associated refinancing and currency risks.

     1. Introduction

The number and range of ‘frontier’ economies issuing sovereign bonds and syndicated loans has
increased over recent years.2 As East Asian and Latin American countries have graduated from
frontier market status, bond issuance by Sub-Saharan African countries has accelerated rapidly.
Sub-Saharan Africa now accounts for the majority of frontier market issuances, while the nominal
volume of frontier market issuances and number of issuing countries continues to increase. What
accounts for the changing global landscape for frontier market bond issuance? Does increased
access for countries previously excluded from global capital markets reflect improvements in those
countries’ economic fundamentals and capacity to manage debt-related risks? Or has the “search
for yield” in post-crisis global capital markets driven increased risk appetite? What are the
implications for the current cohort of frontier market economies in terms of managing
macroeconomic risks associated with accessing private capital markets and their likely future
capacity to meet fiscal financing needs through tapping global capital markets?

In this paper we attempt to answer these questions. Based on recent trends in bond and syndicated
loan issuance by frontier economies, we: i) examine changes in the country characteristics of
frontier markets over the past fifteen years, showing how the “search for yield” has led to increased
risk tolerance for investors with smaller, slower growing, and poorly-governed countries now able
to access private capital markets to meet fiscal needs; ii) provide empirical analysis of the
determinants of bond issuance and pricing among these recently issuing frontier economies,
demonstrating that – while there has been an expansion of the range of countries able to access
private capital markets – similar factors as those identified in the earlier and broader international
literature continue to determine access and pricing; and iii) use case study evidence from two
countries to illustrate how recently less-constrained access to private capital markets has led to
heightened exchange rate, refinancing, and debt sustainability risks. Our analysis builds on a
substantial existing literature examining the determinants of bond issuance and pricing.

From these findings we distil two main policy messages. Firstly, frontier markets can no longer
rely on ‘market discipline’ to ration access to private capital markets and therefore must ensure
that adequate ‘policy discipline’ is applied. Countries with weaker fundamentals and governance
can access international debt markets and must ensure that policies are adequate to prevent
inappropriate or excessive borrowing including through ensuring sound debt management
practices and carefully considering debt sustainability implications of fiscal policy decisions.
Secondly, frontier economies stand the best chance of maintaining access to international capital
markets if they are able to maintain strong growth performance and a strong sovereign risk rating.
Policy reforms should be pursued with these objectives in mind.

In the second section of this paper we summarize recent literature regarding the factors determining
sovereign access to private capital markets. In the third section, we discuss recent developments
in frontier economy bond issuance. In the fourth section we present regression results regarding
the factors influence bond issuance, coupon rates, and secondary market pricing for frontier
economies. In the fifth section we present case study evidence regarding the risks of increased
private capital market access from two Sub-Saharan African economies and lessons for mitigation
of such risks. In the final section we present conclusions and policy recommendations.

   2. Literature

There is a very substantial existing literature regarding the determinants of global capital flows.
An additional literature examines the determinants of private capital access for frontier markets.
A more recent literature examines the specific very recent experience of frontier markets,
especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, in tapping international credit markets through the issuance of
global bonds. We briefly summarize these literatures in turn, and – based on this discussion -
outline the novel contribution of this research.

A large theoretical literature examines the factors constraining and enabling international capital
flows. In a seminal paper, Lucas (1990) famously noted that, given relative scarcity and associated
expectations of high returns, too little capital flows from rich countries to poor countries. Feldstein
and Horioka (1980) are credited with the corollary empirical observation that savings increases
with investment in most countries, with investors tending to allocate capital within national
boundaries rather than optimizing investment based on global opportunities. Recent work has
presented various theoretical explanations for the failure of neo-classical models predicting the
flow of capital to developing countries. Kalemi-Ozcan et al. (2008), for example, noted that
frictions at national borders may account for the divergence between theoretical predictions and
empirical observation, showing that capital flows between richer US states to poorer states,
conforming closely to the standard model. Verdier (2008) shows that, in presence of an
international borrowing constraint and complementarity between domestic and foreign capital in
production, foreign debt rises with domestic savings, a prediction consistent with data on capital
flows.

A large empirical literature examines the determinants of global capital flows and yields.
Typically, regression analysis is employed using large cross-country datasets to determine the
relative importance of ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors in variables impacting the volume and pricing of
international debt flows. Push factors refer to global economic conditions, including global risk
and interest rates. Pull factors are country-specific, typically including – among others – growth
rates, debt levels, reserve adequacy, and institutional performance. The conclusions of such work
are often contradictory, reflecting in part the difficulty of establishing causal links, and clear
messages for policy-makers are sometimes elusive. Studies reach different conclusions regarding
the relative impact of global and country-specific factors. Results also vary regarding the
importance of key macroeconomic variables, including levels of debt and reserve assets.
Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the impact of specific factors may differ substantially
over different periods of the credit cycle (Frances, Aykut, and Tereanu 2014; Fratzcher 2011).

A few researchers have addressed the determinants of market access specifically for frontier
markets during particular previous periods. Grigorian (2003), for example, focusses on debut
sovereign bond issuances. He identifies a range of country characteristics that impact on the
likelihood of successful bond issuance, including size of the economy, the current account
position, reserve adequacy, and inflation. He finds that the fiscal deficit is positively correlated
with successful issuance, with the financing need effect outweighing any associated concerns
regarding creditworthiness. Debt levels, trade openness, and the existence of a Fund program
have no impact on the likelihood of a successful debut issuance. More recently, Das,
Papioannou, and Polan (2008) present an analysis of 21 emerging and low-income debut
issuances during the 1996-2008 period. They find that issuance size is determined by market
conventions rather than macroeconomic fundamentals. They further find that the pricing of
debut bonds (spread and coupon) is (unsurprisingly) strongly correlated with credit rating, with
the adequacy of reserves playing no significant role.

A recent literature addresses bond issuances by frontier market economies over the past decade,
with a particular focus on the experience of Sub-Saharan Africa. Guscina, Pedras, and
Pesciuttini (2014) provide an excellent analysis of 23 debut bond issuances since 2004. They
identify low advanced economy interest rates and the ‘search for yield’, combined with investor
appetite for diversification as important push factors. Strong economic fundamentals, often
associated with high commodity prices, recent debt relief through HIPC, and limited inflation,
are cited as important ‘pull’ factors. Through a formal analysis, the authors identify economic
growth, quality of institutions, debt levels, the federal funds rate, and global volatility as
exerting a significant impact on debut spreads. A recent joint World Bank/IMF Board paper
includes formal analysis of the determinants of bond issuance, concluding that domestic factors
are ‘most powerful’ (IMF/World Bank 2014). Several recent papers (Mecagni et al. 2014; Hou
et al. 2014; Sy 2015; Tyson 2015; Tyson 2015a) provide narrative descriptions of the increase
in global bond issuances by frontier markets and assesses the advantages, disadvantages and
risks associated with such financing instruments. These authors typically ascribe roughly equal
importance to global and country-specific factors in driving market access or do not attempt to
determine their relative importance. Tyson (2015) highlights lack of conditionality as an
important factor increasing the attractiveness of global bonds to frontier economies relative to
more traditional sources of concessional financing. This literature emphasizes risks arising
from increased reliance on global bond financing when countries face exchange rate volatility,
difficulties in refinancing bullet-structure instruments, and challenges in ensuring the quality
of investment of bond proceeds.

This paper contributes to the existing literature by: i) providing the first quantitative analysis
of recent changes in the characteristics of frontier market issuers and drawing conclusive
findings regarding the relative importance of push and pull factors for frontier issuers; ii)
providing an up-to-date analysis to date of the determinants of market access and pricing
exclusively for frontier economies; and iii) providing specific policy messages based on the
recent experience of frontier market issuers.

   3. Characteristics of bond-issuing frontier economies

In this section we describe changes in the characteristics of frontier market issuers over the
past 15 years and assess the extent to which such changes have been driven by push or pull
factors. We find that the broader range of frontier markets now accessing global capital markets
reflects increased risk appetite by investors, rather than improved macroeconomic and
governance performance of new issuers.

There have been substantial changes in the frontier countries issuing sovereign bonds over
recent years. A larger number of frontier market countries are now issuing bonds. Sub-Saharan
African countries are increasingly dominating frontier market issuance, both in terms of
volumes and number of issuances. In 2000, Latin America accounted for three of five issuances
and 70 percent of frontier market issuances by volume. As Latin American and East Asian
countries have graduated from frontier market status, they have accounted for a steadily
declining number and volume of issuances. The first Sub-Saharan frontier market bond
issuance occurred in 2007. In 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for seven of nine frontier
market issuances and around 80 percent of the total volume issued.

What has driven the changing composition of countries issuing sovereign bonds? One possible
explanation is that as Latin American and East Asian countries have graduated from frontier
status a new cohort of countries, including those in Sub-Saharan Africa, have recently achieved
a sufficient level of macroeconomic and governance performance to attract private sector
lending. If the changing composition of issuing frontier economies is driven by “pull factors”,
we would expect to see similar performance against key macroeconomic and institutional
indicators of issuing frontier markets over time. New issuers would have achieved market
access by meeting the performance level required by private markets. We find little evidence
of this.
                                                               6
Firstly, it is clear that the average size of frontier issuing economies has declined over time.
This has partly been driven by bond issuances by several very large frontier economies only
over the 2000-2007 period (China, Brazil, and Indonesia, with China and Brazil both
graduating from frontier status over the period). However, even with these outliers excluded,
the average size of issuing frontier economies has declined significantly, with the proportion
of frontier issuances by countries with economies of less than US$40 billion increasing from
28 percent over 2000-2007 to 61 percent over 2008-2015.

Frontier economies are now also issuing bonds at lower levels of income, as measured by GDP
per capita. As shown in Figure 4, over 2000 to 2014, the average per capita income of issuing
frontier market economies declined fairly steadily from US$2,800 to US$1,300 (before spiking
in 2015 to US$2,600). The proportion of frontier issuances by countries with per capita
incomes of less than US$2,500 increased from around 40 percent over 2000-2007 to nearly 90
percent over 2008-2015. Investors, however, may be concerned about economic growth, rather
than only the income level. As shown in Figure 5, however, there also appears to have been a
reduction in growth rates of issuing economies (over the five years preceding issuance), with
the average issuing country having experienced a five-year annual average growth rate of
greater than 6 percent in around 40 percent of cases between 2000 and 2007, but only 30
percent of cases over 2008-2015.

It is also clear that frontier economies with poorer governance are now issuing bonds. The
average overall CPIA score for issuing frontier economies declined from 3.8 to 3.6 over the
period 2000-2015.3 The proportion of issuances from countries with CPIA scores of less than
3.5 increased from around 12 percent over the period 2000-2007 to around 33 percent over the
period 2007-2015. Analysis of World Governance Indicator scores shows a similar decline in
average quality of governance among issuing frontier economies over the period.

In contrast to the trends described above, the average level of indebtedness of issuing frontier
economies has declined slightly since 2000, but recently begun to increase. As shown in Figure
7, the average public debt-to-GDP ratio of issuing frontier economies declined steadily from
around 58 percent in 2000 to around 52 percent in 2007, before increasing steadily again to 56
percent by 2015. Low average debt levels over the period when Sub-Saharan African countries
began to issue sovereign bonds in substantial volumes reflects the impacts of HIPC and MDRI
debt relief, with Sub-Saharan African countries taking advantage of newly reduced debt
burdens to access private capital markets. As Sub-Saharan African countries and other
recipients of debt relief have begun to re-accumulate debt, debt-to-GDP ratios for issuing

Given that smaller frontier markets with lower incomes, lower rates of economic growth, and
poorer governance are now issuing bonds, we might expect to see an increase in risk premiums
and therefore higher coupon rates and spreads. In other words, the new cohort of frontier
economies may have achieved market access despite higher risks by offering appropriate
compensation for those risks. As shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, there is clear evidence for
this. The average coupon rate declined steadily between 2000 and 2012, except for a peak
during the immediate post-crisis period, and has begun to move up again over the past four
years. There is, however, a clear upward trend in the spread between sovereign bond coupon
rates and the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), which increased significantly post-crisis. The average
spread declined consistently between 2002 and 2007, but exceeded 2002 levels from 2010.

Overall, this analysis strongly suggests that changes in the composition of frontier issuing
economies over recent years have been driven, on average, more by push than pull factors.
New issuers have not improved to meet a threshold level of macroeconomic and institutional
performance required necessary for issuance by private capital markets. Rather, the standards
for investment applied by private capital markets appear to have declined. Investors, seeking a
given return on investment (relative to the zero-risk federal funds rate) have moved into riskier
investments.

     4. Determinants of frontier market issuance and pricing

The analysis above might be taken to suggest that international capital markets are
increasingly unconcerned about market and institutional fundamentals of issuing countries,
responding instead to global push factors, including low global interest rates. In this section
we present formal analysis to further examine the relative importance of push and pull factors
in determining market issuance and pricing of frontier economies over the past ten years. We
find that the pull factors such as macroeconomic performance and quality of governance
continue to exert an important impact on issuance and pricing for the new cohort of frontier-
market issuers.

Model specification

The quantitative analysis is based on two different regression models and estimators. The
first regression model builds on the analysis above and estimates the propensity of issuance
of a Eurobond or a syndicated loan determined by the fundamental push and pull factors. The
sample includes 110 countries classified as low- and lower-middle income in 2005.4 Push
and ‘pull’ factors included in the analysis are those commonly cited in the existing literature,
including the federal funds rate, the VIX risk index, growth rates and various other
macroeconomic variables, and selected indicators of institutional quality. The full set of
variables included in the analysis is summarized in the table below (summary statistics are
provided in Annex 1). The model is unbalanced panel that incorporates the cross country and

                                                                10
time variation of the data set as a logistic function. Thus, a pooled unbalanced logit model is
employed, presented as follows:

Issuancejt = α2 + β3X't + β4w'jt + u2jt                                                (1)

where: Issuance is a binary dependent variable having values of 1 in the years when the
Eurobond or syndicated loan was taken and 0 otherwise, α2 is a constant, X is a vector of
exogenous push factors, w is a vector of domestic pull factors, β3 and β4 are parameters to
be estimated, u2 are the residuals and j and t are a country specific and time specific
subscripts, respectively.

The second regression model estimates the relationship between the coupon rates of the
issued Eurobonds and the major push and pull factors. It employs a simple cross sectional
ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator with robust standard errors presented with the
following formula:

Coupon_ratei = α1 + β2X'j + β3w'j + u1j                                                (2)

where: coupon_rate is the rate by which the Eurobond was issued, α is a constant, X is a
vector of exogenous push factors, w is a vector of domestic pull factors, β2 and β3 are
parameters to be estimated, u1 is the white noise error term and j is a country specific
subscript.

The models are specified according to variables identified as significant in the existing
empirical literature. We employ an estimation strategy moving from general to specific model
estimations. In the preliminary search for the optimal specification, all variables that were
identified in the broad survey of the literature (Section 2), were provisionally considered for
inclusion in the regressions (data description is provided in Table 2).

Data quality and availability have imposed some constraints on modeling. Data with large gaps
or missing recent observations were omitted from the modeling. Variables discarded due to
data quality and coverage considerations included:

   Foreign reserves (no data available for many SSA countries);
   Real exchange rate (no data available for majority of the countries in the sample);
   Debt service of total external and external PPG debt (data not available for many countries
    in the sample, especially from SSA region);
   Trade openness that is calculated as a sum of exports plus imports over GDP (the data for
    exports and imports start from 2005 and data for many countries is missing or is available
    only until 2012);
   Fitch sovereign rating (no data available for majority of the countries that have not yet
    accessed international markets); and
   CPIA as an alternative indicator for institutional quality (data starts from 2005 and no
    data is available for the upper middle income countries as CPIA assessments are only
    carried out for LICs).

Starting with the most general model that includes most of the variables commonly included
in the empirical literature, the specification was refined based on progressively dropping
variables with insignificant coefficients.

The most general specification (Regression 1, Table 3) includes most of the important
variables identified in the empirical literature. This model includes a battery of pull factors
such as: log of GDP per capita, change in the stock of debt to GDP ratio, net FDI inflows,
inflation, IMF and commodity export dummy variables, GDP growth, inflow of net official
development assistance, budget balance, current account balance and some of the factors that
measure the institutional quality in the countries (regulatory quality or rule of law). In
addition, two push factors are included: federal funds rate and the VIX index measuring the
volatility of the international financial markets.


                                                                      14
The results in Regression 1 indicate that GDP per capita is insignificant (p-value of 0.9) and
part of its impact is captured by GDP growth. Therefore, we exclude it from the model and
proceed with more parsimonious specification (Regression 2, Table 3). In Regression 2, the
first difference of debt to GDP ratio remains insignificant (p-value of above 0.7) and is
correlated with the budget balance. In the more restricted model (Regression 3), the FDI
variable remains insignificant. The IMF dummy variable and the FFR remain insignificant in
Regressions 4 and 5, respectively, and are therefore omitted from the most parsimonious
model presented with Regression 6. The joint statistical significance of all the excluded
variables (starting from Regression 1 to Regression 6), was tested and their joint
insignificance confirmed, supporting their exclusion from the model. Assessing the goodness
of fit with the Pseudo R squared coefficient, we observe no deterioration in goodness of fit
from exclusion of variables (0.32 Regression 1 to 0.33 Regression 5).

The results from the most parsimonious model presented in Regression 6 are based on a large
number of observations (i.e. 886 over 76 LICs). The model was specified with only one
indicator of institutional quality to avoid problems of multicollinearity with the other
institutional indicators given their strong correlation. Results are generally intuitive and
consistent with theoretical predictions, although with some exceptions.

In terms of push factors, there is a robust statistical evidence based on 7 different regressions
(Table 4) in which only the VIX index has a statistically significant impact on countries’
propensity to raise financial resources from the international financial markets. When the
VIX index increases, there is higher expected volatility on the financial markets which
appears to increase risk aversion among investors, leading to lower issuance. However,
contrary to most theoretical predictions, the FFR rate has no statistically significant impact
on frontier markets’ propensity to issue.

In terms of ‘pull’ factors, our results show robust statistical evidence for the impact of the
official development assistance and quality of the institutions. Countries with higher levels
of official development assistance are less likely to access the international financial markets,
potentially reflecting either reduced financing needs in the context of large aid inflows, or
higher risk perceptions in the context of high aid dependence. Institutional quality is also an
important determinant for counties’ access to international financial markets, with this result
robust across different indicators of institutional quality: regulatory quality (Regression 6)
and rule of law (Regression 7).

Less robust statistical evidence is found for the impact of GDP growth, the budget deficit,
the current account balance, inflation and the commodity exporting dummy variable because
the significance of these variables depends on the model specification. In that sense, most of
them have become significant only after the model was restricted by dropping the other
redundant variables. This may imply that part of the impact of this variables has been captured
by the redundant variables that were causing multicollinearity explained previously.

The size of the budget balance is negatively correlated with issuance, reflecting increased
likelihood of accessing international capital markets when financing needs are higher. In
general, however, stronger fundamentals are associated with greater likelihood of issuance.
Countries are more likely to issue when experiencing a lower current account deficit, stronger
GDP growth, or if they are commodity exporters.

The most general (unrestricted model) includes battery of pull and push factors (Regression
1, Table 4). Institutional quality (the rule of law) and the current account balance as a share
of GDP were insignificant (p value above 0.9) and therefore dropped from the model. In the
more parsimonious specification (Regression 2), the debt to GDP ratio becomes insignificant
with a p value above 0.95 and is therefore omitted from subsequent regressions. The final

model (see Table 4). The goodness of fit as measured by R squared coefficient improves
marginally with exclusion of the redundant variables.

The most restricted model (Regression 8) includes 59 coupon rates from frontier market
issuances and the goodness of fit is relatively good at 0.60. The estimated results are generally
consistent with the findings from the existing empirical literature (Section 2). In terms of
push factors, the FFR and the VIX index have positive impact on the coupon rate; a higher
federal funds rate increases the opportunity cost faced by investors and therefore leads to
higher coupon rate of the issued Eurobonds. In a similar manner, higher expected volatility
on the international financial markets increases the risk aversion of investors, driving higher
coupon rates.

Regarding domestic pull factors, there is robust evidence that the existence of an IMF
program increases the coupon rate, indicating that countries that are under an IMF
arrangement are considered riskier than those without an arrangement. Higher levels of
overseas development assistance also reduce the coupon rate, potentially reflecting increased
availability of foreign exchange or perceptions that a high level of international assistance
represents a form of implicit guarantee against default. A better risk rating assigned from the
credit rating agencies reduces the coupon rate, presumably due to lower risk perceptions.
Variance decomposition of the coupon rates (Figure 10) indicates that the largest contribution
in determining variations in the coupon rates is the sovereign risk rating followed by the
federal funds rate. The rest of the variables make almost equal contributions.

Discussion of regression results

Overall, the results above show that pull factors still matter. A larger group of countries is
now considered ‘eligible’ for market access, and the economic fundamentals and institutional
quality of these countries appears to be lower than those of earlier frontier issuers. But the
relative performance of countries among the group of eligible economies matters in
determining market access and pricing. Further, while low global post-crisis interest rates
may have initially spurred investors to consider a broader range of countries as potential
borrowers, interest rates are unlikely to, on their own, ensure a continued broadening of

access to capital markets or even sustained access for current frontier issuers given the
continued importance of other macroeconomic and governance factors.

      5. Case study analysis

Over recent years there has been a structural shift in global bond issuance, with smaller, poorer,
and less well-governed economies increasingly accessing global capital markets. Pull factors
still seem to exert an important influence, with domestic macroeconomic and governance
factors playing an important role in determining access and pricing. In this section we seek to
verify these findings with reference to the experience of two case study countries. We examine
the experiences of Ghana and Zambia - two Sub-Saharan African frontier markets that have
repeatedly issued global bonds to meet fiscal financing needs over recent years. We explore
the conditions in which these frontier issuers were able to access global credit markets, the
subsequent deterioration of pull factor conditions, and the subsequent increases in financing
costs and emergence of repayment risks. Case study countries are not selected on the basis that
they are representative, but rather because they illustrate particular debt sustainability risks
associated with broadened frontier market access.

Bond issuance

Ghana issued its first Eurobond (US$750 million with a coupon of 8.5%) in October 2007
(Table 5). In issuing, Ghana become one of only four African countries to have issued prior to
the global financial crisis6. After a pause of almost six years, Ghana issued its second Eurobond
of US$ 1 billion in August 2013, then a further US$ 1 billion in both 2014 and 2015, and US$
750 million in September 2016.

Zambia issued its first Eurobond later than Ghana, in September 2012, in a wave where many
other African countries also took up the opportunity to raise capital in this manner of the first
time7. Zambia’s first issue was for US$ 750 million and was 15 times over-subscribed (Table
5). Zambia issued a second time in 2014 for US$ 1 billion, and again for US$ 1.25 billion in
2015.

  At the end of 2008 South Africa, Seychelles, Gabon, Republic of Congo and Ghana were the only countries to have issued Eurobonds
from the SSA region.
7
  By the end of 2012 eleven countries from the SSA region had issues Eurobonds: South Africa, Seychelles, Gabon, Republic of Congo,
Ghana, Senegal, Cote D’Ivoire, Nigeria, Namibia, Angola and Zambia.

                                                                 18
Debut issuance for both countries followed periods of robust growth. But in both cases,
issuance proceeded over a period in which important macroeconomic imbalances were
beginning to emerge.

Ghana’s debut Eurobond came at a time when the country had been growing strongly. In the
five years up to its issuance average economic growth was 5.5% (2002-06) and inflation was
in single digits (8.4% in 2007). Ghana’s debt to GDP ratio was also low at this point following
rounds of debt relief, including reaching the HIPC completion point in 2004. Between its first
and second Eurobonds, Ghana revised its GDP series in 2010 (including rebasing) leading to
an upward shift in its GDP of 60% and it being classified as a lower-middle income country.
This provided a boost for Ghana’s credentials as an investment destination, although the shift
also meant that it would gradually lose access to concessional financing.

The higher level of growth and prospects for future gas and oil revenues attracted investors to
Ghana. However, the period following initial issuance is also characterized by high and twin
deficits and growing debt levels as Ghana not only tapped Eurobonds, but also scaled-up its
infrastructure borrowing (especially from China) resulting in its debt-to-GDP ratio increasing
from 31% in 2007 to 72% in 2015. The large imbalances led to Ghana signing a three-year
IMF program in April 2015. Continued strong performance against some macroeconomic
indicators (growth, new exports and international support) and deteriorating performance
against others (macroeconomic imbalances and growing debt levels) led to Eurobond pricing
fluctuating between 7.88% and 10.75% across its first five issues8.

Much like Ghana, Zambia experienced robust economic growth from the mid-2000s. Zambia’s
average growth was 8.25% in the five years leading up to its debut issue in 2012 buoyed by an
increase in copper mining production (its main export) and prices. On account of this growth
Zambia was reclassified as a lower-middle income country in 2011. Furthermore, the
macroeconomic situation had improved throughout the 2000s and inflation was 6.8% in 2012.
Zambia’s debt levels were also low in 2012 given the conservative fiscal stance since debt
relief, including HIPC completion, in 2005, which saw debt levels plummet from pre-debt
relief highs of 124% of GDP in 2004. These factors helped Zambia issue its first Eurobond at
5.4%, a much lower costs than subsequent issuances.

Interest in the second and third issues was helped by the growth story continuing despite copper
prices falling from their 2011 peak, and a revision (including rebasing) of the level of GDP
upwards by 25% in 2014. However, balanced against this was a growing debt burden and
increasing financing needs driven by rising and repeated fiscal deficits, all while the copper
price continued to decline. The cost of Zambia’s second Eurobond was over 3 percentage
points higher than the first and the third cost nearly 9% as signs of an economic slowdown and
an external financing deficit emerged.

Debt risks

Over the period of issuance, deteriorating macroeconomic performance posed growing risks to
debt sustainability for both countries. As commodity prices fell, growth and the external
position weakened. At first, the impact was mainly on the composition of Zambia’s and


8
  Care needs to be taken when comparing the costs of Eurobonds as the market environment is different at each issue, some have different
tenors (for example the 2015 paper in 15 years) and repayment agreements.



                                                                   19
Ghana’s debt portfolios, as opposed to their levels, but with later issuance their debt to GDP
ratios have also increased rapidly.
Foreign currency denomination of Eurobonds meant that currency risks resided with the issuer.
Both countries recently suffered large depreciations of their local currency against the US$ (in
which the Eurobonds are denominated). Zambia’s Kwacha depreciated by 40% in 2015 and
the Ghanian Cedi by 50% in 2014. Such foreign exchange risks needs to be managed and
assessed carefully by sovereign borrowers. Depreciation had immediate and substantial
impacts on the fiscal position through the growing cost of debt service in local currency.
Zambia’s interest costs, as a percentage of domestic revenue climbed from 6.7% in 2014 to an
estimated 18.4% in 2016 (Smith, Davies, Chinzara 2016).

Mounting repayment risks reflected not only large payments in single years, but also the
bunching of repayment years. The redemption profiles of both Ghana and Zambia show a
significant concentration of payments over coming years and efforts will likely be needed to
buy-back some of this debt in in the hope of smoothing repayments.

Growing concerns about debt sustainability are evident in sovereign ratings and debt
sustainability assessments. Ghana’s debt to GDP reached 72% in 2015 from 31% in 2007 while
Zambia’s reached 53% in 2015 from 26% in 2012. From its first issue in 2007 to 2013 Ghana
had been regarded by the World Bank and IMF Debt Sustainability Assessments (DSA) as
being at ‘moderate risk of debt distress’. This status was elevated in to ‘high risk’ in 2014.
Zambia was deemed to be at ‘low risk’ from the time of its first Eurobond issue in 2007 to mid-
2015 when its status was elevated to ‘moderate risk’. Equally the long-term foreign currency
sovereign rating of Ghana, assessed by Fitch Ratings, remained at ‘B’ between 2006 and 2015,
although the outlook switched from positive in 2006 to flipping between negative or stable
from 2008 to 2014. Fitch rated Zambia ‘B+’ in 2011 and 2012, but downgraded the country
to ‘B’ in 2013 where the rating remained with stable or positive outlook in 2014 and 2015.

Growing risks are also reflected in pricing. Over the period Zambia and Ghana have issued
market appetite for frontier bonds has waxed and waned with global trends and the availability
and prospects for returns from wider emerging in relation to OECD economies. This has been
clear in the pricing of the Ghanaian and Zambian paper in the secondary market (Figure 11).
Eurobond paper from both Ghana and Zambia has traded at a premium when compared to other
SSA issuers in 2014-16, although there has was some narrowing of this gap between June 2016
and September 2016 as investors’ outlooks for both countries became more positive.

Policy measures are being explored to manage emerging debt sustainability risks, but it is not
clear that such measures will be effective. Both countries have announced the intention to
establish sinking funds as a means of reducing repayment risks. However, both countries are
far from running budget surpluses and any contributions therefore needs to be borrowed. There
are benefits of sinking funds, including lower costs of future borrowing linked to a sinking
fund, but borrowing at nearly 10% to place money in low yielding safe financial assets is both
expensive and means that sinking fund assets are accumulating only very slowly. This and
Ghana’s recent efforts to buy-back most of the Eurobonds maturing in 2017 suggests that
refinancing will more likely be the tool selected to ensure funds are available to repay the bonds
as they mature. 9 Also reflecting recognition of repayment risks, Ghana and Zambia switched
to Eurobonds that are amortized over three years, instead of a single year, in 2015. This change
will smooth the debt profile and hence manage repayment risks better.

Conclusions from case studies

Ghana and Zambia were able to access global credit markets on the basis of strong growth
performance and low levels of debt following HIPC relief. Both countries retained access to
global credit markets and continued to issue Eurobonds as growth slowed with commodity
price declines, fiscal balances deteriorated, exports slowed, and governance remained weak.
The use of Eurobond instruments magnified risks, with US$ denomination increasing exchange
rate exposure and the bullet structure posing repayment risks. As a result of these risks, debt
sustainability and credit ratings declined, and risk premiums on the coupon rates for new
issuances and in the secondary market grew. Both countries now face difficult adjustments to
reduce debt costs and risks and avoid continued dependence on future issuance of relatively

   6. Conclusions and policy implications

This paper has explored the recent trends in bond and syndicated loan issuances by frontier
markets and the implications for debt risks.

Through simple analysis of the characteristics of issuing frontier markets we have shown that
there has been a structural shift in the composition of issuing countries, with smaller, poorer,
and less well-governed economies now accessing global credit markets. The need for risk
diversification by international investors and the search for yield have enabled a wider range
of frontier markets to access international financial markets.

Through cross-country regression analysis, however, we have shown that the same factors as
those identified in previous literature continue to exert an important influence on issuance and
pricing. While a broader range of frontier markets are now enjoying access to global credit
markets, pull factors continue to influence the likelihood of issuance and the pricing of bonds.
Frontier countries with strong GDP growth, prudent fiscal policy, good external positions and
sound institutions are more likely to be able to access global credit markets. Countries with
good credit ratings are likely to face substantially lower prices for private sector debt.

Through analysis of case studies we have illustrated the country-level implications of these
findings. Both Ghana and Zambia are among the new cohort of frontier market economies that
have successfully and repeatedly accessed global credit markets. In the lead-up to debut
issuance, both countries experienced strong growth and reductions in debt levels through HIPC
relief. In the context of the search for yield, both countries were able to issue Eurobonds
repeatedly to meet fiscal financing needs, with markets interpreting strong growth performance
as evidence of creditworthiness. Over the period of issuance, however, underlying
vulnerabilities, including emerging macroeconomic imbalances, reliance on commodity
exports, and weaknesses in policies and governance surfaced, leading to deteriorations of debt
risk and credit ratings. Risks were heightened by the US$ denomination and bullet structure of
Eurobond debt. Both countries now face difficult adjustments to manage and reduce debt risks.

These findings, overall, demonstrate a general heightening of risk due to a broader range of
countries now issuing on international capital markets and the need for increasing caution on
behalf of frontier-market policy makers in managing these risks. Firstly, there is an increased
need for ‘policy discipline’ among frontier market countries when accessing global capital
markets. ‘Market discipline’ has recently played a weaker role in rationing access for countries
facing macroeconomic or governance vulnerabilities. Policy responses need to reflect debt
sustainability considerations and the reality that market conditions might be much more
restrictive when current and recent borrowing must be refinanced. Such policy discipline
should involve:

1. Taking full account of debt sustainability risks and vulnerabilities in fiscal policy decision-
   making. This means both restricting borrowing within sustainable limits and ensuring that
   borrowing is used to finance viable public investments that can support future growth. An
   important additional element of managing debt sustainability risks is taking account of the
   pro-cyclicality in market access illustrated in our results. Countries that may have easy
   access when growth is strong and budget deficits modest may find their access is restricted
   and more costly during periods of downturn. Changing market access and borrowing costs
   as macroeconomic conditions evolve should be taken carefully into account when making
   fiscal policy decisions.

                                               22
2. Carefully monitoring and responding to debt management risks. Case study countries
   illustrate that frontier markets are taking borrowing opportunities when offered with little
   account taken of portfolio composition and associated debt risks. These risks can be
   particularly pronounced given the bullet structure of most Eurobonds. There remains an
   active need to ensure all decisions regarding the composition of borrowing are guided by a
   strategy that takes currency and repayment risks into account. Building debt management
   capacity and developing and using medium-term debt strategies to guide debt portfolio
   composition is vital.

 Secondly, frontier markets need to ensure that policies support continued access to private
 credit markets at reasonable cost. Empirical evidence from cross-country analysis and case
 studies suggests that private capital markets remain highly sensitive to a small number of
 indicators when allocating and pricing capital among frontier markets. Firstly, the focus of
 international investors on growth performance and the budget balance suggests the need for
 continued efforts to pursue growth-enhancing structural reforms and prudent fiscal
 management. Secondly, the importance of international credit ratings in determining access
 and pricing suggests that countries should invest in: i) improving and sustaining
 performance against policy dimensions taken into account by credit rating agencies; and ii)
 ensuring that information of relevance to credit rating agencies is quickly and transparently
 communicated, including through adequate debt recording and reporting practices and open
 dialogue with rating agencies.

 Finally, frontier markets should continue to work towards the development of domestic debt
 markets. Recent experience has shown that under appropriate institutional settings larger
 frontier economies are capable of fostering relatively deep and efficient domestic debt
 markets. Domestic private debt can provide an important alternative source of fiscal
 financing through which to reduce reliance on foreign-denominated Eurobond debt with its
 associated refinancing and currency risks.
