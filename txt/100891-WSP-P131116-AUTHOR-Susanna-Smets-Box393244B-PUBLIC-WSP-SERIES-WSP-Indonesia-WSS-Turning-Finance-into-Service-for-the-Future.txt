Water Supply

in Indonesia
Turning Finance into
Service for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies, and
organizations in Indonesia. The core team of the Directorate of Settlements and Housings in the Development Planning
Agency (Bappenas) has been key partners with the Water and Sanitation Program in analyzing the sector. The authors ac-
knowledge the valuable contributions made by the Members of the Technical Working Group on Water and Sanitation (Pokja
AMPL): Bappenas, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Environment, Ministry of Housings, National Statistical Bureau, and the provincial technical working group of the province
of West Sumatra; by the development partners (UNICEF and ADB) and the National Water Supply Association of Indonesia
(PERPAMSI).

The Task Team Leader for the Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and Pacific is Susanna Smets. The follow-
ing World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the service delivery assessment process and
report: Martin Albrecht, Rahmi Kasri, Maraita Listyasari, Deviariandy Setiawan and Almud Weitz. The peer reviewers were
George Soraya and Fook Chuan Eng from the World Bank, Aidan Cronin from UNICEF and Julian Syah from the ADB in
Indonesia.

The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bank’s Wa­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct­ ed in
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to as­       sess the ad-
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de­   livery pathways. SDA’s
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fi­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.

The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Group’s Water Global Practice, sup-
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

  Based on the JMP Report on Intercountry Workshop (2009), there are some major discrepancies between JMP and national data in Indonesia: differences in
data sources, methodologies, population estimates, urban/rural definitions and definitions of ‘adequate’ and ‘sustainable’.

     •	 Clarify roles and responsibilities for regulation and operation of urban sanitation service provision at local govern-

     •	 Ensure efficient implementation of agreed commitments on water and sanitation sector development.
     •	 Scale up development of human resources through institutionalized capacity building.

    In comparison, access to urban water supply services has only increased from 90% to 93% between 1990 and 2011. While pointing out successes in rural
 water supply development, the report does acknowledge that the different increase in access rates between urban and rural areas is majorly influenced by
 the high urban population growth rate of around 4%.

    Several projects such as the Multi Village Pooling Project, the Second Generation Project and the Domestic Private Sector Participation Project (DPSP)
 have been implemented by MPW to facilitate partnerships among local governments, CBOs and local banks in order to improve provision of rural water
 supply services.

      •	 Strengthen the National Water Supply and Sanitation Information Services System (NAWASIS) to become an inte-
         grated portal for sector-wide M&E.
      •	 Improve local capacity for use of M&E data for sector planning, budgeting and targeting implementation support.

          remain ‘healthy’, by improving asset management, implementing cost-recovery tariffs, reduce non-revenue water
          and improving the management of human resources.
       •	 Intensify assistance to PDAMs to access financial sources such as commercial financing or government assisted
          schemes.
       •	 Continue supportive incentive schemes such as Water Hibah to realize financial commitments by local government
          into the sector.
       •	 Identify further incentives for PDAMs to increase access into low-income communities.
       •	 Engage local governments into a sound planning to secure future availability of water sources, e.g. by developing
          sound water safety plans.

 The big task for Indonesia in the near future will be to find
 ways to address these challenges. In addition to detailed
 subsector priority actions identified in section 6 to 10, the
 following sector-wide priority actions have been identified
 by stakeholders:
 •	 Identify support structures for local governments to as-
      sess and improve the quality of their strategic planning
      processes.
 •	 Scale up development of human resources through in-
      stitutionalized capacity building.
 •	 Develop sound investment plans and ensure their en-
      dorsement and incorporation into local government
      work plans for immediate implementation.
 •	 Investigate how local accountability mechanisms are
      functioning and potential ways to improve this.
 •	 Actively seek involvement of private sector and devel-
      op alternative financing mechanism.
 •	 Engage local governments in water management and
      planning to secure future availability of water resources.
 •	 Cleary define poor households at the bottom 40% of
      the income distribution and design targeted support to
      ensure inclusive service-delivery.
