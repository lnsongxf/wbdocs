Introduction to the Volume


R    ight to information (RTI) laws establish the right of citizens to access information about the
     functioning of their governments. The adoption of laws establishing the right to informa-
tion (also referred to as access to information or freedom of information) has been extremely
active in the past two decades. The number of countries that have passed RTI legislation has
risen dramatically in the last two decades, from approximately 13 to over 95, including many
countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and most recently, Africa and the Middle
East.
     Effective RTI legislation is an essential tool, empowering citizens to access information on
public policy choices and decision-making processes, to understand entitlements regarding
basic services, and to monitor government expenditures and performance, providing opportu-
nities for more direct social accountability. Because a well-crafted RTI law provides citizens with
the right to access government records without demonstrating any legal interest or standing, it
can require a significant shift in the way state-society relationships are organized from need-to-
know to right-to-know.
     Right to information, as a right and a principle, entrenches the notion of transparency as
part of good government. RTI systems are practical mechanisms of government administration
that reflect commitment to the principle of transparency, and may serve to encourage, if not
facilitate, participation and accountability. They aim to increase the transparency of govern-
ment by providing regular and reliable information to the public and facilitating appropriate
and relevant use of administrative information. Effective right to information systems require
well-designed legal frameworks, stable institutional arrangements, and effective records and
information management in order to support adequate response to public demand and to
proactively disclose information of relevance to the public. Even with these components, how-
ever, no right to information system will function adequately without appropriate leadership
and incentives to support its implementation. Monitoring the practices of these systems can
identify whether problems are rooted in a lack of political will, or the capacity of an admin-
istration to implement the legal (or de facto) mandate for transparency. A lack of impact in
transparency efforts may, in fact, be the result of flawed internal arrangements and processes
that are supporting the right to information even when political support for right to information
is strong.
     The benefits of right to information in government have been celebrated without much
systematic evidence of its effectiveness or outcomes, in part because the right to information
is considered an intrinsic good, a human right that should be enjoyed by individuals regardless
of its effect on economic growth or political stability. Assessment of RTI implementation—in
terms of the formalization of practices, the quality and efficiency of those practices, and their
effectiveness—has become of paramount importance in the last decade for policy-makers
and development practitioners. But studies about how laws are being implemented are quite
limited. Many countries are still focusing on developing new forms of regulation and guidance,
with in-practice assessments yet to be considered and produced. The absence of information
xiv                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      has thwarted efforts at achieving a solid understanding of the implementation of RTI systems
      and these systems influence downstream development outcomes.
           This volume of case studies is an attempt to better understand the factors that drive
      effectiveness in RTI implementation. It serves as the basis for a separate meta-analysis of these
      twelve country case studies that reveals recurring patterns, challenges, and resulting solutions
      in the implementation of RTI systems.
                    Implementing Right to Information
                                   Part 1 Introduction
This first round of eight case studies was completed in 2012 under the direction of Anupama
Dokeniya. Case studies were prepared examining the experience of a number of countries
that have passed Right to Information (RTI) legislation within the last 15 years: Albania, India,
Mexico, Moldova, Peru, Romania, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. Each country case study
assesses four dimensions critical to the effective implementation of RTI legislation as follows:

1. The scope of the information that the law covers, which determines whether an RTI law can
   serve as the instrument of more transparent and accountable governance as envisaged by
   its advocates. For example, a law that leaves too many categories of information out of its
   purview, that does not adequately apply to all agencies impacting public welfare or using
   public resources, or that potentially contradicts with other regulations—like secrecy laws—
   will not be effective.

2. Issues related to public sector capacity and incentives, additional key functions and
   demands within the public sector created by RTI, entities responsible for these functions,
   and various organizational models for fulfilling these functions.

3. Mechanisms for appeals and effective enforcement against the denial of information
   (whether it be an independent commission or the judiciary); the relative independence,
   capacity, and scope of powers of the appeals agency, and the ease of the appeals process;
   and the application of sanctions in the face of unwarranted or mute refusals, providing a
   credible environment.

4. The capacity of civil society and media groups to apply the law to promote transparency
   and to monitor the application of the law, and a regulatory and political environment that
   enables these groups to operate effectively.

    The in-depth research presented in these case studies was conducted to examine factors
that promote the relative effectiveness of these four key dimensions when implementing RTI
reforms, including institutional norms, political realities, and economic concerns. An analysis
was conducted to determine which models have the potential to work in different contexts and
what lessons can be drawn from these experiences to help countries currently in the process of
setting up RTI regimes.

                    Implementing Right to Information
                     A Case Study of Albania

1. Introduction
There has been notable legislative and institutional progress toward securing the right to infor-
mation (RTI) in Albania since it first emerged as a political issue 20 years ago, but significant
weaknesses in the functioning of the system remain.1 Requests for official information are now
widely sought by various elements of society—journalists, the business community, civil society
groups, and individual citizens, but access is still a challenge, and an administrative culture of
secrecy and confidentiality persists.
     In the past two decades, Albania has made impressive progress in developing new legisla-
tion according to international and European Union (EU) standards; it demonstrates a degree
of regulation (through formal rules, as expressed by its percentile ranking in the World Bank’s
Doing Business database) consistent with other countries with similar gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita.
     However, implementation practices are below what is expected of a country at Albania’s
stage of development.2 According to the last European Community (EC) progress report on
Albania (November 2010), “proper implementation of the legal framework remains a con-
cern…administrative capacity needs to be significantly reinforced, including filling the existing
gaps, streamlining management of currently fragmented responsibilities, and ensuring proper
horizontal and vertical coordination. “These gaps in the implementation and enforcement of
existing laws and regulations, as observed by international partners like the EU, World Bank,
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), provide a partial explanation for why the country’s
socioeconomic development lags behind that of its neighbors.
     The political instability of the past few years has not helped the situation. The government
has changed several times since Law 8503 (Right to Information about Official Documents) was
adopted in 1999, and each change has led to the reorganization or abolition of ministries and
the redeployment or removal of senior public officials. Such instability affects the entire legal
and administrative reform process and curtails the development of administrative capacity
(including the setting up of systems and procedures and the training of officials) that would
enable the effective application of the law as well as other reforms. This problem is accom-
panied by a lack of public awareness about the law at all levels of Albanian society—from the
government to ordinary citizens.

     Methodological Note. This case study combines a review of the legislation and secondary
     literature on the law (such as reports produced by national and international agencies) and
     interviews with public officials—including staff from the Ministry of Education and Science
     (MOES), Ministry of Health (MOH), and Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MOTPW); the
     institutions in charge with overseeing the implementation of the law; the People’s Advocate;
     stakeholders—civil society organizations who played a role in designing and monitoring the
     implementation of the law; donor representatives; members of Parliament; and experts who
     contributed to the development of the law.
          The interviews were conducted in an effort to understand the implementation efforts and
     challenges since the passage of Law 8503. Detailed sector-based analyses show that imple-
     mentation procedures and practices, including providing ATI through public relations, public
     awareness, legal rights of access, and other means, vary widely across the three central govern-
     ment ministries. A lack of coordination on this scale has a direct effect on citizens.
          The case study assesses efforts in the three sectors in which the majority of government
     programs are being implemented: health, education, and transport and public works, and in
     the specific departments and implementing agencies that have dealings with the public, civil
     society, and media (especially those dealing with public information).3



     2. Passage of the Law
     Albania provides both constitutional and legal guarantees of the right to information. The cur-
     rent constitution, which became effective in November 1998,4 enshrined this right in Article 23.
     Seven months later, the People’s Assembly of Albania approved Law 8503, the Right to
     Information about Official Documents, becoming the first country in the region to adopt leg-
     islation securing RTI for citizens. Article 23/2 of the law states that “everyone has the right, in
     compliance with law, to get information about the activity of state organs, as well as of persons
     who exercise state functions.”
          Efforts to establish a constitutional and legal framework for citizens to access information
     date back to the early 1990s5 during Albania’s transition from a Communist single-party system
     to a multi-party democratic system. In these years, citizens became free to demand freedom
     of expression and other rights previously suppressed. As with other political and democratic
     reforms undertaken during the initial stages of democratization, establishing the legal and
     institutional instruments to ensure citizen access to official information was an initiative of
     the political class who voiced a desire to support an open environment in the country.6 But
     pressures from the international community were also very important. The bureaucracy did
     not resist or try to block this initiative; in fact, the administration readily accepted all the legal
     changes proposed. RTI was something of a novelty at the time, often confused with freedom
     of expression.7
          In the early period of constitutional development (1991–95), numerous drafts of the Con-
     stitution were produced, each seeking to incorporate universally accepted principles. In many
     cases, provisions of important international conventions were included verbatim; for example,
     Article 17 raises the European Convention on human rights to the level of a constitutional
     norm. The incorporation of RTI in the Constitution occurred in several stages throughout the
     1990s. Article 8/1 of the Interim Constitution of 1991 recognized “the universally accepted
     norms and principles of the international law.” RTI was sanctioned for the first time by
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                              13




Law 7692 (1993), which amended the Interim Constitution and abolished the old communist
constitution of 1976. The name for Law No. 7692, amending Law No. 7491, is The Major Con-
stitutional Provisions of the Republic of Albania (Fundamental Freedoms and Human Right).8
     In response to the concerns of international community stakeholders working to support
the new democratic state of Albania, the administration ratified the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on October 4, 1991, which places an obligation on signatories
to take positive steps to ensure that rights, including freedom of expression and information,
are respected.9
     Civil society was still at a nascent stage of development in the post-communist Albania
of the early 1990s. Even as reforms to democratize institutions and establish instruments for
protecting human rights were ongoing, civil society did not play an influential role in enshrining
RTI when drafting the 1994 Constitution.10 The few established NGOs did not have the capac-
ity to play an influential role. However, by the time of the drafting of the 1998 Constitution, a
few NGO representatives were advocating for the inclusion of RTI.
     The involvement of other stakeholders and interests groups was not a direct initiative of
the political class, but occurred because the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) advised the Parliament to pay attention to civil society recommendations. How-
ever, only one legal expert from the Institute for Political and Legal Studies (IPLS) represented
civil society on the drafting committee.11 Only one consultation meeting with civil society
stake-holders was organized by the Administrative Center for Coordination of Assistance and
Public Participation (ACCAPP), an independent entity formed at the request of the govern-
ment and sponsored by the OSCE. According to records (maintained in the archives of the
People’s Assembly) of the discussions held at the meeting of the Parliamentary Commission
on the Preparation of the Draft Constitution, a group of NGOs presented the commission with
proposals for amendments to the Constitution to strengthen the legal provisions that ensure
RTI for citizens. These proposals were eventually incorporated into Article 9.12
     These changes occurred after the civil unrest of 1997 when the ruling Socialist Party
expressed its commitment to reform the entire legal system. During the first years of transi-
tion under the Democratic Party,13 there were several instances of the withholding of informa-
tion and attacks on the media. Law 8503 was drafted quickly, in part because of international
pressure on the political class to break with its communist past and to respond to the unrest
of 1997. One clear indicator of the emergency nature of the process was that the draft law
was prepared and introduced by one person—a co-chair of the Committee on Constitution
Drafting. Because the constitutional provisions for the law already existed, the governing coali-
tion had a good reason to put the law in place as soon as possible.14 The Albanian Parliament
approved a set of information laws in July 1999, including Law 8503 itself and several others
that restricted access under certain circumstances.
     Even as the current constitution was enacted by referendum in 1998, many European
countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, were in the process of introducing laws
on the right of access to official documents.15 Albania’s Constitutional Commission (com-
posed mainly of politicians) maintained an inclusive, open approach to international advice,
and extensive consultations took place with other constitutional experts from a number of EU
countries and the United States. The drafting process was also observed by the Venice Com-
mission—an important Advisory Board of the Council of Europe. Albania, a member state of
the Council of Europe, decided to elevate RTI as well as a number of human rights to constitu-
tional rights. Article 48 (being especially relevant to the implementation of the Law on Access
14                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     to Official Documents) provides that everyone, individually or collectively, may direct requests,
     complaints, or comments to public bodies that are then obliged to answer within a specified
     time period and under conditions set by law. Thus, public bodies have a constitutional duty to
     reply to requests, including those seeking ATI.
         In September 2004, the London advocacy group for Article 19 released a Memorandum
     on the Albanian Law, making several recommendations to amend Law 8503. In 2007, based
     on these recommendations, the Centre for Development and Democratization of Institutions
     (CDDI), in cooperation with the Justice Initiative of New York, started revising some aspects of
     the law (definitions, scope, limitations, and modalities) to present final amendments to Parlia-
     ment. These proposals were made public in March 2007 during a Civil Society Forum meeting in
     Tirana. In July 2010, the Parliamentary Committee on Education and Public Information Devices
     discussed and approved two draft proposals for amending the law but left the final decision to
     the People’s Assembly, which, for unknown reasons, never discussed or voted on them.



     3. Clarity and Comprehensiveness
        of the Legal Environment
     3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
     Law 8503 operationalizes Article 23/1 of the Albanian constitution, which states: “The right
     to Information is guaranteed.” Further, Article 23/2 declares that, “Everyone has the right, in
     compliance with law to get information about the activity of state organs, as well as of persons
     who exercise state functions.” Law 8503 applies to “public authorities” only;16 it does not apply
     to private companies that carry out public services. It covers all public authorities at the central
     and local levels. This is significant, because more and more privately owned companies are
     carrying out services formerly provided by the public sector. The term public authorities itself
     is also vague compared with terms in the legislation of other countries that either define or list
     public authorities; this is widely considered to be open to abuse. The vague and contested
     boundary between public and private commercial interests arguably constitutes a major short-
     coming of Law 8503.
          The ombudsman’s17 proposal to address this shortcoming18 was not endorsed by the Coun-
     cil of Ministers. In 2007 the CDDI and the Justice Initiative proposed that not only public offi-
     cials but also physical or legal persons who benefit from public funds and who carry out public
     or administrative functions (such as private companies that have concessions or monopolies in
     water supply, energy supply, and the like) should grant access to documents that relate to the
     use of public funds.

     3.2. SCOPE OF EXEMPTIONS
     Like all legislation addressing RTI, Law 8503 contains explicit exemptions. Information that is
     granted to one person may not be refused to any other person except when it consists of per-
     sonal data about the person who was initially granted access. This exemption does not apply
     to the personal data of those exercising state functions or public services or that are preserved
     in an official document—as long as these data are related to the qualities requested by law or
     legal acts associated with the duties performed.

3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
One shortcoming of the law is the time limits set out for public authorities to respond to a
request. Public authorities must decide whether to respond to a request for information within
15 days, and if they decide to respond, information should be provided within 40 days from
the admission of the request. This timeframe has posed a problem, especially for the media;
journalists claim that such a delay in receiving information hinders their work; international
organizations have also been critical of this timeframe. For example, an analysis of the law by
the London advocacy group Article 19 states that the 15-day decision-making period is in line
with international standards but “the 40-day deadline for supplying information represents
an unacceptable lengthy delay to responding to applications for information and is hard to
reconcile with the shorter decision-making period.”19 This timeline is also clearly inconsistent
with EC Regulation 1049/2001, which specifies that 15 working days is the maximum time limit
for either refusing or granting access to official information.


3.4. IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATIONS
There are no common standards, regulations, or administrative guidelines followed across
institutions to align their internal rules and procedures with the requirements of Law 8503; this
is left to the discretion and willingness of the administration of each institution. Therefore,
agencies have a degree of flexibility as to how they implement the law, such as in the appoint-
ing of information officers and assistant information officers. Some institutions have been
trying to develop their own internal regulations. For instance, the MOH has developed and
published guidelines on a time limit for answering or refusing requests;20 the Ministry of Justice
has done the same for accessing information on its Web site through the Public Information
Office. The Department of Public Administration (DPA) and MOH21 have published some
instructions on their Web sites on how to obtain information from public agencies. Overall, the
effect of this lack of centralized coordination is not positive. Attempts made by the People’s
Advocate22 in 2005 to draft implementing regulations defining the internal rules for informa-
tion access (including procedures on how citizens can obtain information) failed because the
Council of Ministers never approved it.
     The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported the
oversight capacities of the law through direct assistance to the People’s Advocate in drafting
new regulations; it has also recently supported NGOs23 in monitoring ATI in courts. In 2010,
as a result of this support, the Ministry of Justice approved the Regulation on the Relation-
ship between the Judicial Authorities and the Public, which is based on Law 8503. All district
and appeals courts must implement the regulation, which aims to regulate internal processes
that guarantee public ATI on court procedures and disclosure of judicial information. The
regulation distinguishes between documents subject to limited access and those subject to
unlimited access—which include all court documents for which there is no legal limitation on
public access.


3.5. BROADER LEGAL ENVIRONMENT
Law 8485 (December 5, 1999, the Code of Administrative Procedures)24 also ensures the right
to access information contained in official documents, even if the petitioner has no legiti-
mate personal interest in the issue. In addition, the code outlines RTI25 that applies only to

     participants in “administrative dispute resolution proceedings” and only for documents used
     in the procedure in question.
          This law and Law 8503 were preceded by a number of laws with specific purposes. Free-
     dom of thought and expression is protected by the 1997 Law on the Press and the 1998 Law
     on Electronic Media, both passed before the current constitution was even approved. The
     availability of official information is ensured by Law 8502 (Establishing the State Publication
     Centre); the aim of this center is to make state bodies, other public administration institutions,
     and physical and juridical persons aware of the laws and international agreements ratified or
     adhered to; normative acts of the Council of Ministers and of ministers and directors of other
     central institutions; other important acts issued by state bodies and institutions; and relevant
     legal literature in order to protect their rights and interests and consolidate legal and constitu-
     tional order (article 1/3).
          This is complemented by Article 29 of Law 9000 (Organization and Functioning of the
     Council of Ministers), which provides for the publication of all decisions taken by the institu-
     tion in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Albania, regardless of whether their nature is
     normative or individual and regardless of the time and way they enter into force. The law also
     provides for explicit obligations on the publication of government ministers’ instructions in the
     Official Gazette.
          A number of other important disclosure laws have also been adopted. Law 9049 on the
     Declaration and Control of Assets, Financial Obligations of Elected People and Some Pub-
     lic Officials stipulates that “data to be benefited from the declarations according to this law
     are made accessible to the public, in accordance with Law No. 8503.” Point 3 of Article 35 of
     Law No. 8652 on the Organization and Functioning of Local Government states that “public
     information in every commune and municipality is carried out in accordance with Law 8503 and
     rules set by the respective committee for this aim.”
          There are also a number of laws that restrict public ATI. Law No. 8517 on the Protection of
     Personal Data (1999) allows individuals to access and correct their personal information held by
     public and private bodies, and is overseen by the ombudsman.
          Law No. 8457 on Information Classified as State Secret regulates the creation and control
     of classified information. It was adopted to ensure compatibility with the standards of the
     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and sets three levels of classification: top secret,
     secret, and confidential. Classified information can be left undisclosed for 10 years, but that
     period can be extended if it is believed that certain information should remain undisclosed.
     The law creates a Directorate for the Security of Classified Information to enforce security and
     safeguard rules. In May 2006, Parliament approved amendments to the law, creating a new
     category—restricted—that refers to information that if disclosed would “damage the normal
     state activity and the interests or effectiveness of state institutions.” Articles 294–296 of the
     Criminal Code penalize the release of state secrets by both officials and citizens with a penalty
     of up to 10 years for unauthorized release. Civil society groups and international organizations
     have strongly criticized these amendments.
          Law No. 8839 on the Gathering, Administration, and Protection of Police Classified Infor-
     mation is relevant to all acts, official documents, audio-video recordings, computer-generated
     or stored data or documents, and/or any other material linked to police activity, specifically:
     public order and security, crime prevention, police organic structure and personnel, investiga-
     tion techniques, and so on; and border surveillance service, public personalities, escorting, and
     other security protocols.

   Unlike state secrets, these are considered to be professional secrets; the right to access
such information is limited by law. Nevertheless, the limitations must be justified and, in the
event of an appeal, the burden of proof falls upon the government.



4. Capacity
4.1. ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Law 8503 applies to all public agencies but does not provide for a single, centralized agency to
coordinate the implementation of the law across agencies. A national conference organized by
the People’s Advocate (ombudsman) in December 2002 emphasized that, at the local and cen-
tral level, functional information offices are not in place in most key institutions, nor have the
institutions merged with other units.26 Due to the continuing efforts of the People’s Advocate
to implement the law,27 progress has been made across administrations, at the central and
local level, to open Public Information Offices (PIOs) or public information centers (PICs) with
the primary responsibility of offering information to the public.
     The People’s Advocate is tasked under Article 18 with overseeing Law No. 8503; the
responsibilities of this office are also regulated by Law 8454 on the People’s Advocate. The
People’s Advocate does not have the authority to order bodies to revise their decisions or
to force them to answer citizen requests for information or services, but it has often reported
deficiencies and violations of Law 8503 by public institutions to the People’s Assembly. In cases
in which citizens have addressed the ombudsman, it has asked the responsible public institu-
tion to respond directly to the citizen’s request. But despite its interventions, the ombuds-
man seems to have had little positive impact on the implementation of the law. In 2007, the
ombudsman, in cooperation with the IPLS and USAID, drafted a recommendation for approval
by the Council of Ministers (Recommendation No. 177 of June 2006) to address citizen com-
plaints. But despite pressure from the ombudsman and the USAID office, the council never
passed the regulation.

4.2. BUDGET
The actual level of funds allocated to the implementation of Law 8503 has been arguably
insufficient, especially in the ministries of education and health, where the need for active,
ongoing communication with citizens is critical. It is difficult to accurately quantify how much
has been allocated to ATI-related activities in total, whether at the central or ministry level; it
is even harder to estimate at the regional (city) level. This is because of the way ministries and
agencies prepare their budgets; that is, funds for ATI-relevant infrastructure and activities are
allocated across programs rather than in their own category.
    Because financial support comes in the form of grants from donors (for example, for train-
ing in information technology, or IT), many financial transactions related to donor contribution
do not go through the treasury; it is, therefore, impossible for the treasury system to track
this information. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that allocations for implementing
the ATI law have increased somewhat over time: before 2004–05 there were no PIOs in place.
Today they exist in all line ministries as staff positions and in organizational structures.
    Law 8503 does not specifically oblige the state administration, Ministry of Finance, and/
or public entities to allocate specific funds for its implementation. Still, there has been a trend
18                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     over recent years for ministries to seek and allocate funds for activities such as Web sites,
     conferences, workshops, public awareness campaigns, and other initiatives, to create an envi-
     ronment in which citizens have quicker access to more information. In 2011, for example, the
     MOES allocated around $160,000 for public awareness activities; last year it spent around the
     same amount on the implementation of Law 8503. But an interview with the director of bud-
     gets at the Ministry of Finance revealed that the government does not prioritize these requests
     and the amount of funds that are allocated is relatively minor.
         International donors are the major alternative sources of funding for ATI-related activities.
     To fulfill the development objectives of increased transparency, accountability, and ATI, donors
     are encouraging the implementation efforts of all the ministries and sectors involved.
         The government has initiated a competitive grant of around $500,000 for NGOs to develop
     projects that improve transparency, cooperation between the government and citizens, and
     government accountability. In the first call-for-proposals round, however, the Agency for the
     Support of Civil Society (ASCS)28 did not support any project proposal that specifically pro-
     moted RTI in Albania (among 52 winning proposals, only one or two suggested an increase of
     transparency through civil society action and/or contribution).

     4.3. STAFFING AND TRAINING
     The number and quality of staff, their level of training, and the overall institutional capacity
     constitute significant challenges to the implementation of Law 8503 in Albania. In general,
     knowledge about the ATI law among civil servants is poor, although some supportive struc-
     tures exist and some officials are trying to make more information available to the public.
          At the local level, PIOs and PICs were originally established in the country’s big munici-
     palities. Different models were introduced to provide new practices of communication that
     would enable decentralization.29 The slow rates of decentralization were reflected in a lack of
     transparency and poor quality of services. In general, PIOs and PICs provide information on
     services and departmental tasks (for example, decisions made by the municipal council) to
     the local media, business community, and general population. They also help citizens solve
     individual and collective problems, including assisting them in making requests for information
     and collect feedback from citizens on issues concerning community life and the quality of local
     government services.
          At the central level, ministers prefer to use spokespersons to deliver information to the
     media rather than building the infrastructure and staff needed for the implementation of Law
     8503. This attitude indicates a management culture that negates the equality principle of the
     law (that is, that the law should treat all users equally). Even in existing offices, most requests
     for information and complaints are handled informally through personal contacts within the
     public administration.30
          As table 1 shows, according the interviews conducted for this study in 2010, the three min-
     istries had different structures for enabling public ATI.
          Although there are many similarities between the MOH and MOES in terms of their mission
     and objectives—and even the number of staff at the central and local level—table 1 shows that
     the MOES considers public communication important enough for the ministry to have estab-
     lished a separate office dedicated to handling it. By contrast, at the MOH, there is only one
     public communications specialist and in the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, there are
     two. The way these ministries are organized reflects the importance that political appointees

give to public ATI. This is hardly surprising, given that the origins of the law lie in the political
elite rather than pressure from the public or civil society organizations.
     All ministries have a spokesperson appointed by the minister—a political appointee who
handles most communications with the media and who is responsible for informing the public
about a number of activities and issues. It is not clear whether or not these spokespeople were
appointed as a direct result of Law 8503, but they are best understood as the voice of the
minister rather than as facilitators of ATI. On the other hand, specialists, chiefs of sectors, and
directors of public communication are civil service appointees approved by the DPA. Thus,
there is a clear division between the functions of a spokesperson and a public communications
specialist.31
     The Albanian government has been allocating more budgetary and human resources to
ICT; this is increasing ATI. Data provided by the DPA indicate that the Council of Ministers and
ministries employ a total staff of 35 in public communication units and around 80 in IT depart-
ments at the director, chief of sector, and specialist levels, with each ministry employing an
average of 6–7 IT staff members. The MOES is an outlier, with six staff persons dedicated to
public communications.
     Past surveys32 indicate that most civil servants do not consider Law 8503 relevant to their
contact with citizens; only a few consider it as one of the top five laws they refer to when
providing services. One reason may be that civil servants, particularly at the local level, do not
have enough knowledge about the legal framework for citizen access and RTI or how it applies
to their institution. For example, many public officials are unaware of the legal deadlines for
answering citizen requests.
     In 2002, the government decided to address this by making training on Law No. 8503
delivered by the Training Institute for Public Administration (ITPA) compulsory for every civil
servant entering public administration before the end of his or her probation period. With con-
tributions from international donors and support from the World Bank, EU, USAID, and other
civil society groups, the ITPA has been organizing training courses on ATI since 2003. But even
though this training is mandatory, our interviews and research suggest that most civil servants
have not taken this course (only approximately 330 of 4,000 civil servants have).
     Table 2 shows that a reasonable number of civil servants have attended ITPA courses, tak-
ing into account the relatively small number of relevant positions at the central and municipal

                                                                   that does exist—the TIPA’s own data-
                                                                   base—suggests that staff at the minis-
     tries examined earlier in this case study have received relatively little training. For the period
     2004–09 (data for 2010 is not available), only eight members of the staff from the Ministry of
     Education and Science received ATI training: four from the MOH and five from the Ministry
     of Transport and Public Works, mainly because, while the cost of training is only US$20 per
     person per day, the ITAP’s budget has been reduced over the last few years because of overall
     budgetary constraints, and ministries have been forced to pay for their own staff training.
     According to the approved ITAP strategy (2011–13), “financing of the new Training Program
     will be a challenge that needs to be addressed for ensuring successful delivery of the training
     courses. The budget funds are limited compared to the needs identified for delivery of several
     training courses across public administration.”
          Understaffing and political appointments are hampering the implementation of the ATI
     law in Albania and merit is not always the basis on which civil service staff is recruited. The
     difficulties in civil service recruitment and staffing also affect the implementation of Law 8503.
     The organic law called The Status of Civil Servants was adopted in November 1999, but
     even as reforms are continued, much still remains to do before the goals of the original law
     are achieved. Frequent restructurings, especially in the MOES and MOH, have had a nega-
     tive effect on public communication specialists. The politically motivated turnover of public
     employees has continued, intensifying since the formation of the new government in 2009; this
     has undermined the competitive recruitment procedures required under the Civil Service Law
     and perpetuated the politicization of the public administration.

     4.4. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
     Records management systems have not yet been fully developed in the line ministries. In gen-
     eral, the record management system is still paper-based; digitalization of records management
     system is in a very earlier stage of development.
         The Law on Archives sets rules on how to record, retain, and conserve information in each
     institution. All public institutions must maintain regular registers and archives for storing docu-
     ments up to a specific time period and should have an office and staff dedicated to this task.
     The National Archives has its own staff and facilities as well as legislation, but until now, the
     process of compiling and providing information has been solely paper-based. Because of the
     great amount of information requested, the Swiss government is now supporting the process
     of digitalization of the National Archives of Albania, making it necessary for standard rules
     regarding digital archives to be defined.

   BOX 1. PUBLIC INFORMATION CENTER, MUNICIPALITY OF TIRANA
  In 2003, the Public Information Center (PIC) was opened in the Municipality of Tirana. At
  the same time, the municipality issued citizen report cards (CRCs) to obtain citizen feed-
  back on municipal services. Both the PIC and CRCs have improved the capacity of local
  stakeholders (Tirana citizens and NGOs) to monitor and evaluate the delivery of public
  services. Tirana citizens can register complaints about municipality services at the PIC,
  helping direct the municipal management’s attention and intervention to areas of citizen
  concern. By helping the municipal management establish priorities for the annual munici-
  pal budget, the CRCs allow Tirana’s citizens to participate in the city council’s decision-
  making process.
      The PIC has increased and improved the capacity of the municipality of Tirana to com-
  municate with its citizens. Before its establishment, only about 300 citizens were able to
  contact the municipal staff; within one year that number had increased tenfold to approxi-
  mately 4,000 people. The timeframe for providing information to citizens was shortened
  by 10–15 days (from 45 days to 30–35 days). Prior to the PIC’s establishment, businesses
  and citizens would directly approach department staff in charge of providing licenses,
  certificates, and other documents, but with the new PIC structure, this contact has dimin-
  ished, reducing the level of petty cash corruption.

     Recently, the Council of Ministers approved a decree on the design, implementation,
and operation of information systems (pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 21 of Law 10273 on
Electronic Documents), which orders all institutions to provide a separate system for continu-
ity of work (Business Continuity Center, BCC) and for information storage (backup) to provide
24-hour uninterrupted service. In addition, institutions developing new systems in the IT field
must provide a system maintenance agreement (service-level agreement or SLA), as part of the
investment for these systems.

4.5. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Beginning in 2007, the government has taken serious steps to digitize many public services
and develop an information society services system. Legislation is being prepared in line
with the acquis communitaire.33 The National Agency for the Information Society (NAIS),
established in 2008, has been integrated into the Ministry for Innovation and Information
and Communication Technology; it is responsible for information society reforms and their
implementation. Other institutions in this field are the Agency for Electronic and Postal
Communications, the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection, and the National Authority
for Electronic Certification.
    A “Cross-cutting Strategy on the Information Society 2008–13 “is being developed based
on European best practices that will take into account features of the Albanian economy
and society. The growing use of IT is the cornerstone of a strategy to create an information
society that places a special focus on the promotion of good governance through online
22                                                 RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     services—government-to-business, government-to-citizens, and government-to-government.
     The government portal34 is highly instrumental in ensuring the implementation of this concept;
     it offers an access point for the three groups.
          Under a Council of Ministers order, all ministries and central agencies must have branded
     Web sites; therefore, important public information is now available online, including strategies
     and sector-wide related documents. There is also now a unified standard applied across min-
     istries about the provision of documents not published on the Internet. In some cases, specific
     regulations, decisions, ministerial instructions, or orders of public interest are only listed rather
     than made available online directly, but they must still be accessible to those wanting to obtain
     them. In 2006, in an effort to increase transparency and citizen scrutiny of the decision-making
     process, the Council of Ministers added a section to its Web site featuring council decrees
     published immediately after each meeting.
          In addition, the needs of citizens and other information users need to be addressed. It
     seems that the information selected for publication on most ministry or agency Web sites is
     not based on any consultation with clients, public surveys, or on any assessment of information
     requests received by various users (citizens, media, civil society, or the business community). In
     other words, these agencies still need to publish more information about the activities that are
     of the most interest to the public.
          Much has been achieved in the past three years, especially the improvement of services
     such as e-registration, e-licensing, e-tax, and e-procurement for the private sector and busi-
     nesses. Reports prepared by the USAID, the main supporter of these IT initiatives, quote
     interviews in which respondents express an increased satisfaction level with the e-services.35
     Nevertheless, as the EU Progress Report of 2010 points out, there are shortcomings with
     regard to data retention, unsolicited communications, itemized billing, and conditional access.




        BOX 2. THE NATIONAL ALBANIAN ARCHIVES MODERNIZATION PROJECT
       The project will be implemented over a four-year period, creating infrastructure to install
       the Scope-Archives program with legal standards and to have international agreements in
       the archival realm (ISAD-G). The project will ensure that the hardware and software moves
       the process of digitalization forward, and that staff and users of the system will be trained.
       The following processes were completed in 2010:
        • Installation of the local area network (LAN) for the General Directorate of Archives in
          two buildings;
        • A database (Oracle) that includes 1.5 million records;
        • Version 4.0 of Scope-__Archives, a program for inputting archival data; and
        • The process of correcting inventories and the correcting and completing the cards is
          underway.

     importance of IT in information systems and for good governance.
   • Improvement of IT infrastructure in the public administration.
   • The creation of standard definitions aimed at increasing effectiveness and productivity
     and lowering operational costs.
   • Increased IT capacities, human resources, and the continuous upgrading of skills.
   • Appointment of dedicated staff to provide information, and making a clear distinction
     between the job description of PIOs and spokespeople.




The 2009 Law on Electronic Commerce needs to be amended to address the restrictions on
providing information about social services that are focused on improving services through
information technology. A broadband policy has not yet been developed, and investment in
communication infrastructure is still poor.36

4.6. MONITORING
By law, oversight of the implementation of the ATI law is tasked to the People’s Advocate (the
ombudsman), which reports its concerns annually to the Parliament. It does not, however,
conduct systematic monitoring and evaluation of the law’s implementation or the performance
of institutions in making information available. Instead, it bases its facts on reports and com-
plaints logged by citizens and organizations to which information is denied.
     There is no system in place to monitor requests for information submitted to ministries and
agencies (such as the number of requests received and replied to within a certain period of
time). According to a public relations specialist at the MOH, there is no capacity for recording
or categorizing public requests. Some officials keep records manually; while efforts are under-
way to introduce an electronic records and management system, it is not yet in place. Manual
records are incomplete because they only cover requests handled by an individual rather than
all those received by the ministry.
     Interviews with officials from the MOH and MOES reveal that almost 90 percent of
the requests are not of an investigative nature (such as how the budget of the ministry is
being spent or if a particular type of service that was promised was delivered. Instead,
people ask for basic information that is sometimes available online, such as where specific
medications can be found, procedures for receiving diplomas, and deadlines for university
applications.

     5. Enforcement and Sanctions
     5.1. APPEALS
     When a request for information is refused, complaints are resolved according to the Code
     of Administrative Procedures, and when these are exhausted, through the courts under the
     Code of Civil Procedures. The right of a citizen to receive judicial review of a refusal to provide
     information has never been exercised. There could be several reasons for this, including (1) a
     lack of knowledge among citizens on RTI and on the obligations of government officials and
     institutions to provide the information requested; (2) the excessive time needed for administra-
     tive review; and (3) a lack of confidence in the judiciary because of its reputation for corruption
     and inefficiency.37 The only known case of this kind is that of the Centre for Development and
     Democratization of the Institutions (CDDI) suing the central executive institutions for refusing
     to release information in violation of Law 8503. However, the CDDI lost both cases in court,
     one in 2005 and the other in 2009.
          Long delays in responding to requests poses a problem, as previously noted, as does the
     lack of safeguard provisions like those for so-called whistle-blowers. Because of the length
     of the average judicial process and the lack of citizen confidence in the judiciary, only a few
     recorded court appeals for denials of ATI. In addition, systems that ensure an efficient record’s
     maintenance and management are not well developed. Due to the lack of information and
     data on appeals heard by the courts for violations of RTI, and no studies or special reports
     on the subject, it is not possible to be more precise about the effectiveness of the appeals
     procedures.
          The legislation governing the People’s Advocate limits its powers to expressing opinions
     and making recommendations; it can start an investigation into a complaint presented by
     an entity or citizen and can recommend a criminal investigation, court action, or dismissal of
     officials for serious offenses, but its decisions are not binding.38 Therefore the implementation
     of its recommendations depends on the agency manager’s decision. Of the 325 complaints or
     requests that have been received by the People’s Advocate, 118 cases have been addressed in
     favor of the citizens logging complaints.

     5.2. SANCTIONS
     One of the weaknesses of Law 8503 is the sanctions and compensation framework. Article
     14 of Law 8503 indicates that the “sanctions applied in the case of failure to implement the
     law are defined according to the legislation in power for administrative offences.” Provisions
     related to the execution of sanctions are generic. Article 17 states that “procedures…for com-
     pensation of the damage (caused by the violation of provisions of law) are regulated by law.”
          Sanctions applied in the case of an administrative infringement are defined by Law 7697 on
     Administrative Offences. The Administrative Procedures Code39 defines RTI as a fundamental
     principle of the functioning of the Albanian public administration. If an entity denies or refuses
     to issue the required information, citizens have the right to sue in court and the court has the
     right to apply sanctions according to the legislation in effect.
          There is no practice or administrative culture across Albania’s institutions for applying sanc-
     tions against employees for not following general policies on public ATI. In fact, there has not
     been a single case in which an employee has been penalized for refusal to release information.
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                               25




The law is also weak with its vague provisions stating that the Penal Code or Law 7697 on
Administrative Infringements may apply in the case of violations, but it does not define the
violations. Clarifying the definition of sanctions and the remuneration procedures would signifi-
cantly improve the law’s implementation process.



6. Compliance
Without written records, it is difficult to conduct a systematic analysis of Law 8503’s imple-
mentation to determine what types of information people request or to identify issues and
problems. The lack of official data is worsened by the fact that, even though some NGOs have
taken steps to monitor the implementation of Law 8503, most civil society organizations have
not addressed the broader issue of refusals, preferring to take their own requests up with
higher authorities, the media or, in rare cases, the courts.

6.1. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
Although the publication of information is uneven across government ministries, several legal
and sublegal acts are now published online. Until 2005, legal information—laws, decrees, or
instructions—were published primarily in paper form, and there was no single source where
information could be downloaded. With the support of the World Bank and EU, an electronic
system for legal information was established at the State Publication Center.40 The Official
Gazette is now published on paper and electronically and in 2005, the government began pub-
lishing government decrees online after every meeting of the Council of Ministers, increasing
transparency.
     However, the information published often lacks consistency, especially with regard to
secondary legislation. In 2009, the Center for Public Information Issues (CPII), supported by the
Open Society Foundation in Albania, conducted a study to identify legal and administrative
acts not published in the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Official Gazettes. The study was intended to
assess the level of compliance by the two most important institutions—the Parliament and the
Council of Ministers—with the legal requirements for the proactive publication of acts; it iden-
tified at least 465 decisions (both title and content) of the Council of Ministers not published in
the Official Gazette.
     In December 2010, the CPII released its second monitoring report on the three consti-
tutional branches of power: the legislative, executive, and judiciary. The conclusions were
disturbing: in 2009, 18 percent of the Council of Ministers (DCMs) issued decisions were not
published in the Official Gazette (figure 1); only 5 out of 11 (45.4 percent) of the instructions
issued by the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and Telecommunications were published;
and, according to the CPII’s 2009 monitoring report, none of the administrative instructions
issued by the MOH during 2006–09 were published.
     Even more troubling, only 3 out of 41 instructions issued by the minister of education dur-
ing 2009 were published in the Official Gazette; in other words, 73 percent were unpublished,
according to the CPII report in 2010. Comparative data from this study (figure 2) show that
this ministry rarely releases the minister’s public instructions—only 7 percent were published
in 2006 (93 percent unpublished), with only a little improvement in 2007. Though there was
progress in 2008, when approximately half of the instructions appeared, the situation further

     FIGURE 1. Publication of DCMs in the Offical Gazette, 2009




     deteriorated in 2009, illustrating how difficult it is for the public to access information—even
     on vital subjects like education. Businesses have faced similar problems with activities in the
     private education market.
          The Ministry of Finance displays a similar approach; all the instructions were published in
     the Official Gazette in 2006, but the situation has since deteriorated, year by year (figure 3).
     In 2009, 41 percent of instructions were un-published. According to the 2009 CPII Monitoring
     Report, the majority of the instructions of ministers in all 15 ministries were not published in
     the Official Gazette every year.
          The publication of local government acts is even more rare. According to another study
     conducted by the CPII in June 2010, no municipality, except Tirana, published city council deci-
     sions on their official Web sites or in any local gazette.
          Yet, there is one positive development to note. The State Publication Centre published an
     “extra” edition of 138 DCMs that were not published on time; this shows that pressure from
     civil society has a positive effect. In its 2007, 2008, and 2009 human rights reports, the U.S.
     State Department notes, “Most government ministries and agencies posted public informa-
     tion directly on their Web sites. However, businesses and citizens complained of a lack of
     transparency and the failure to publish regulations or legislation that should be basic public
     information.”
          To increase the rate of publishing acts in the Official Gazette, the CPII recommended that
     the Ministry of Justice start a consultation process to consider adopting changes to Law 8502,
     including the introduction of online publications as a means to increase access to legislation
     and improve consistency across state publications as well as to avoid the delays and costs of
     Official Gazette publications. According to the CPII, the drafting process for new amendments
     to Law 8502 (ongoing since December 2009) is progressing satisfactorily.
          Progress is also being made in areas like procurement, as observed in the 2010 EC Prog-
     ress Report. Legislation was approved in January 2009 requiring contracting authorities to use
     electronic procurement and to publish all procurement notices and tender dossiers on the

Public Procurement Agency’s (PPA’s) Web site,41 a step that has improved ATI and reduced
procedural costs.
     In addition, information about legislation is open and published online through the State
Publication Center’s Web site,42 the use of e-governance systems is progressing, and more
information is being made available to various target groups. For example:
     The business community can access (1) the e-procurement system;43 (2) the tax and cus-
toms systems;44 and (3) the business registration system.45
     Farmers have an information system that provides prices for agricultural products—mainly
fruits and vegetables—in some of the country’s biggest markets, such as Tirana, Korce, and
Fier. The data is processed and then uploaded onto the ministry’s Web site.46
     Citizens can find information about (1) the education system;47 (2) health services;48 (3) labor
and employment services;49 and (4) the civil registry system.50 Establishment of the government
portal will ensure one access point for the three main categories.51

       BOX 4. ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY
       Despite the concerns about accountability cited in various pieces of Albanian legislation,
       public officials who behave unprofessionally or who do not uphold their duty of serving
       citizens are rarely held accountable. Although there are disciplinary procedures for officials
       who act unethically or illegally in refusing to provide information to the public, the lack of
       a precedent for enforcing such measures, in addition to the absence of a clear system of
       appeals and a general lack of confidence in the judiciary, means that public confidence in
       the system of disciplining public officials is low.
            There is no evidence that any public official has been disciplined for failing to comply
       with Law 8503, which led the People’s Advocate to propose stronger disciplinary measures
       in 2005. In the absence of effective formal sanctions, individuals who are refused the right
       to obtain information by a specific agency address their concerns to the People’s Advo-
       cate or report it to the media (the TV show “Fix Fare” is dedicated to investigating and
       reporting such cases).
            Information disclosure has often been a sensitive issue which, given its negative
       impact on the Albanian process of European integration, has also impacted the overall
       political development of the country. The lack of electoral programs has become a major
       public concern in Albania as political parties fail to commit to transparency or to the
       better implementation of Law 8503. Despite pressure from the media, civil society, and
       international organizations, political parties fail to disclose information on campaign or
       party financing. Even the two main parties do not attempt to ensure open disclosure of
       this information. For example, G 99, a newly-emerging, left-wing political party, submitted
       an official request based on the provision of Law 8503 to the Central Electoral Commission
       (CEC) on January 28, 2010, for access to election materials (including ballots), referring to
       a similar case in the State of Florida in the United States during the 2005 U.S. presidential
       elections, but the request was rejected by the CEC.
            Civil society organizations reacted to government decisions on the changes
       to the law on taxes immediately after they were published on the Council of Ministers’
       Web site. Another good example of civil society pressure on government to be more
       accountable to its own citizens was the reaction of the Albanian Helsinki Committee
       that, on February 9, 2006, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Parliament requesting her to
       stop approval of the government-proposed amendment on the law for access to official
       documents, which was to add more categories of “restricted information” to ensure
       “the effectiveness of government institutions,” succeeding the stop approval of such
       amendments.




     6.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
     Civil society groups monitor implementation, and several surveys have been conducted both
     at the central and local levels. The Soros foundation, EU, USAID, and other donors have
     financed NGOs in this area.52
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                                        29




     According to the CDDI and Citizens Advocacy Office (CAO)53 surveys, many public
requests for information, whether from individuals or civil society organizations, are treated
carelessly and often ignored. There are numerous cases of administrative silence (that is, when
the administration does not provide any response even when the time limit for providing infor-
mation has been exceeded); this is more often than not motivated by political and personal
interests rather than by structural weaknesses.54
     The CPII, supported by the Open Society Foundation in Albania, conducted a study to
identify legislative acts not published in the Official Gazette since 2009.55 Additionally, the
Europartners Development Center measured the public perception of the level of ATI pro-
vided by municipalities and immovable property offices in five cities in 2009–10.56
     Although there is a lack of hard data measuring the implementation of the law, most surveys con-
clude that many citizens are unaware of the existence of the legal framework and most public officials
(both at the central and local levels) are unwilling to implement the law. Interviews with specialists in
all three ministries as well as civil society representatives support this; they suggest that usage is lower
than might be expected. A CDDI survey found that 87 percent of public employees were unaware
of the law’s existence, and very few institutions had appointed PIOs.57 Still, investment in IT in several
areas—such as public procurement, tax services, and legislation—did improve the situation. The last
human rights reports issued by the U.S. government (2009, 2010) stated that: “During the year public
access to information improved greatly, in large part due to greater use of the Internet.”
     Law 8503 provides that all requests to be treated equally, regardless of who is requesting
the information. But it is well recognized—although there is no widespread evidence—that
information is provided to journalists more freely than to ordinary citizens. But even journalists
indicated during interviews that they often face difficulties in obtaining verbal or written infor-
mation from government officials on specific topics during investigations of specific officials
and institutions, behaviors and decisions against citizens, or the implementation of various
policies or orders. This problem is also presented in a special edition of a private national tele-
vision ToP Channel called “Fix Fare.”58
     Recognized as a cultural or social phenomena rather than an administrative one, personal
connections are important in obtaining information from an institution quickly. Also, it is dif-
ficult for handicapped people to access information because of the lack of facilities at public
institutions to ensure physical access.
     Albanian legislation outlines no practice for publishing draft decisions or strategies online
in order for the public to offer feedback. In the 2010 report issued by the European Commis-
sion, the EU raised concerns about this in sectors such as the environment, where information
is limited and data unreliable: “Public awareness and participation in environmental decision-
making and public access to environmental information remain weak.”59
     Requests were filed by the author to interview several public officials in the line ministries
about fulfilling their obligations under the Stabilization and Association Process, and written
requests were submitted to various departments within the line ministries as well as some sub-
ordinate agencies in order to determine the status of the implementation of specific actions.
In some instances, the request was refused instantly and no information was provided (with the
explanation that the officials were not allowed to provide information unless the permit was
given by a minister or head of the institution), despite the fact that the request was accompa-
nied by a “special authorization” issued by the head of the EU Delegation in Tirana, requiring
all institutions to supply any information requested for this assignment.

        BOX 5. INCOME AND ASSET DECLARATIONS
       The High Inspectorate of Declaration and Audit of Assets (HIDAA) was created in 2003 to
       help reduce corruption in Albania’s public sector. It audits all public officials and conducts
       investigations into conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, the Center for Transparency and Free
       Information (CTFI)—an NGO— monitors the activity and functioning of the HIDAA, par-
       ticularly the level of transparency and the quality of information provided by the institution
       to the public, media, and other stakeholders. According to CTFI reports, the HIDAA has
       answered all submitted information requests in a “very satisfactory “manner. Until recently,
       the information was released based on some tariffs paid by those receiving the informa-
       tion. This practice has since been definitively abolished and the release of information is
       now free of charge. While the HIDAA’s goal is to promote transparency, Law No. 9887 on
       the Protection of Personal Data, exercised by the new Commissioner for Personal Data
       Protection (created in 2008), defines the rules and procedures for the protection and treat-
       ment of personal data.
            On February 5, 2010, the Inspector General of the HIDA, and the Commissioner for
       Personal Data Protection signed a memorandum of understanding to formally establish
       ways the two institutions would collaborate. According to the CTFI, the legal restriction
       to release all information processed by the HIDAA has not decreased either the qual-
       ity or the quantity of transparency regarding the declaration of assets administered by
       this institution. Progress has also been made in establishing PIOs/PICs at the central and
       local levels.

     7. Conclusion
     The transition process to democracy, and subsequently, the processes of NATO and EU
     integration, created incentives for the political class and the bureaucracy in Albania to dem-
     onstrate a commitment to openness. But the implementation of the ATI framework has faced
     a number of challenges including a culture of secrecy and disincentives created by vested
     interests to hampering proper implementation of the ATI.

     7.1. STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
     Freedom of information and transparency were championed by the ruling coalition in both
     its programs following the 200560 and 200961 elections. The establishment of the public
     information centers and the application of information technology for active communication
     by the public with the central institution of the government has been highlighted since the
     2005 program. However, months after taking the government, the Prime Minister issued an
     order placing the obligation to release information to the public on the administration only
     if the permission was issued by the head of the institution, a minister, or an agency director.
     This order was opposed by civil society and the international community. In October 2006,
     Parliament, through a press statement of the Director of Public Affairs, announced that live
     transmissions of the development of the plenary sessions of the People’s Assembly of Albania
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                              31




were not permitted for private media. The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reacted against
this decision as a violation of the right to ATI and called on Parliament to urgently restore the
violated right to obtain information and to keep it transparent, not obscuring it with the draft-
ing or adoption of formal procedures or administrative orders.
    Despite problems in ensuring easy and open public ATI, adoption of the access laws have
provided an opportunity to other stakeholders, particularly civil society and the business com-
munity, to participate and—to a certain extent—influence the policymaking process in Albania.
It has also provided more opportunities to media to play its important investigative role in
fostering further public debates on different issues of public interest.
    The influence of civil society on the policymaking process is occurring in different forms,
such as establishment of sectoral working groups that also regularly support the prepara-
tion and implementation of a given strategy62 or in the development and implementation of
national strategies63 or laws.64 Recent experience shows that the legislative process is more
effective when remarks and suggestions from public-private-civic consultations are adequately
reflected in laws or other strategic documents. There were a series of public consultations for
reviewing the draft National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) from 2007 to
2013; during October–November 2007, serious remarks were addressed on several parts of the
draft strategy. The government, in response to stakeholder demands to improve the docu-
ment, withdrew the draft from the Council of Minister’s meeting agenda.65
    The use of access laws and the right to access information from the government, the judi-
ciary, and Parliament has frequently been used by civil society organizations to put pressure on
government agencies, justice institutions, and Parliament to be more transparent.66

Importance of public ATI related to EU integration process in Albania. Programming and
implementation of the National Plan for Integration, Stabilization and Association Agreement
(or NPISAA) is primarily a responsibility of Albanian stakeholders—the executive, legislative,
and judicial branches of power. However, close cooperation with civil society and various inter-
est groups is crucial for framing the approximation efforts into a sound process. This coopera-
tion, followed by an intensive consultation and brainstorming process with relevant actors, is
particularly important in the framework of approximating domestic legislation with the acqui
communitaire. Increased access to strategic information related to policy development and
participation of civil society, private actors, and other stakeholders into the policy development
process contributes to the increasing quality of government strategies.
    This level of advancement in the role of civil society and the influence of other nonpolitical
actors (such as the business sector, media, and interest groups) on political processes as well
as on the EU integration process continue to be factors for success. In fact, since the signa-
ture of the SAA and the entry into force of the Interim Agreement, not only are Albanian civic
and private actors attempting to actively influence policy and decision-making processes, but
they have often appeared very determined to criticize and influence EU-originating processes
as well.67
    The role of civil society in lobbing for adopting or rejecting legal changes to the ATI
framework has been also important; an example of this is the recommendations made to the
government in 2008 to amend the Law No. 8503, For the Right to Information on Official Docu-
ments68 in order to address deficiencies identified with its implementation; another example
is when civil society took a critical position with regard to proposed amendments to Law
No. 8457 of February 11, 1999 on Information Classified as a “State Secret.”69
32                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          Another important stakeholder is the business community. It has both benefited from the
     implementation of RTI and the access legal framework and at the same time used the right
     to pressure the government or Parliament when their interests are put at risk due to decisions
     that have been taken or are to be taken by the government. ATI related to conditions to be
     fulfilled by Albania in the framework of the Interim Agreement70 have been important in mak-
     ing the business community aware of the competition they must face while the Albanian mar-
     ket is integrated into EU market. Although representatives of some economic sectors were
     actively consulted by the Albanian negotiating team, the general reaction of the business
     community has been one of concern and apprehension. Representatives of the business com-
     munity are becoming increasingly involved in this process and they exert increased pressure
     on the government or show support according to their particular interests.71 There are two
     main institutionalized forums for consultation with business and other social groups: the Busi-
     ness Advisory Council, set up by the Ministry of Economy, which discusses all draft legislation
     affecting business (including regulatory reforms), and the National Labor Committee, which
     brings together representatives of the government, employers, and employees to discuss a
     wide range of social and economic issues. The former appears to be far more effective than
     the latter.
          Recently, progress has been made regarding the introduction of ATI norms on private busi-
     ness activities. The World Bank Doing Business 2010 report ranks Albania among 37 countries
     that stand out for having the strictest rules on disclosure of related party transactions as part of
     investor protection reforms in 2009.72
          Interviews with Albanian Construction Association representatives highlight that use of the
     ICT for enhancing public ATI has been important for establishing formal norms and practices
     that contribute toward increasing transparency on government information of interest to the
     business community while decreasing the power of official discretion for provision of informa-
     tion to the public. They confirm that information published in the Web site of the Ministry
     of Transport and Public Works, which is regularly updated, provides an opportunity for this
     businesses in this category to access on-time information related to investments projects that
     will be subject to upcoming bids. Additionally, the information published by the PPA through
     an e-procurement system is another avenue for the business community to get easy access to
     details on procedures, timing documents, and the like. Despite such progress, the use of ATI
     to increase the transparency of the government procurement process still must be improved in
     order to contribute to a further reduction in corruption.73
          Media is one of the most important information consumers; therefore, an ATI regime
     impacts the activity and quality of media of a country. The Albanian media currently, faces
     many challenges in fulfilling its mission of informing the public.74
          There are a number of structural barriers (Fuga 2010) that put limits on the quality and
     volume of information published, particularly those that are broadcast. A society that is highly
     dominated by politics is reflected in a media that is structured according to its political influ-
     ences. Editorial pages have become more selective with facts based on political influences
     rather than by its relevance to the news and information of public interest.
          During the election campaigns, the average citizen could easily classify the media accord-
     ing to political orientations. Public elections are a time when ordinary citizens have the
     opportunity to choose and to be informed about the platforms of various political parties and
     different candidates. As the fourth power, the role of media in informing the public and review-
     ing the activities of political parties is crucial for providing the public with balanced opinions
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                                33




and information free from political influence. All of the organs of the print and electronic media
should be fair and balanced so that all citizens have the opportunity to decide for them-
selves for whom they should vote. Having direct access to public activities is important for an
independent media. Tapes recorded by the political parties that are broadcasted on television
should include the clear statement that the information is prepared by the given political party
and should be treated as a political material. This could help viewers differentiate between
journalism and political propaganda.
    The quality of information offered by the media is also related to the information offered
by the government. Press conferences held by spokespersons of state institutions or political
parties are held frequently and have become routine, becoming one of the main means of
direct communication with the media and public at large. However, the Albanian experience
shows that this important communication tool is not adequately considered as an event to
direct contact of public institutions with the public at large with the scope to inform, explain,
deny, or oppose a particular issue; rather it is more often used as a tool to negatively react or
reject published facts, especially in cases where the head of the institution is affected.75 Many
press conferences do not fulfill their primary directive: to communicate with the public for the
sake of transparency as a constitutional obligation; instead, they are often transformed into
simple tools to show the work, to cover gaps, to respond to unfair accusations, and so on.
    Despite a difficult and often unsupportive environment, investigative journalism is quickly
developing in Albania. Investigative reporting permits members of the public to access a
wide range of information; in turn, this allows for the necessary public debate of issues that
affect the public. Investigative media—as opposed to media that always publish information
approved for publication by the government—does not limit the publication of news and
information of government interest, but it fulfills the goal of providing information that is in the
public interest. There has been more written and television media coverage about cases of
“office abuse,” corruption, and conflict of interest issues. Several cases have been presented
to the public through the media, including the 2011 tendering scandal that led to the resigna-
tion of the Deputy Prime Minister. The resignation was also the result of pressure by the civil
society after the scandal was made public.


7.2. FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND INFORMAL NORMS
The decision-making process is highly centralized in Albania,76 the delegation of power is not
at a level that could contribute to further empowerment and accountability, and responsive-
ness towards the public. Despite the progress made so far, the government rules of proce-
dures for ensuring full access of interested parties or civil society to the policy drafting process
are not yet adequately developed.
     No guidance has been provided to line ministries about how to create a participatory and
consultation process, leaving its development to the discretion of each ministry on ad hoc
basis. However, good examples exist nonetheless. As mentioned above, NSDI development
was based on a consultation process at the sector and central levels. Town planning is also an
open process. A good example of this is the initiative in Tirana Municipality to inform citizens
about the master plan for the development of the city by making it accessible to the public
through the municipality Web site77 and by placing the architectural model in the main square
of the city in a closed but transparent area, allowing citizens to see how the new center of the
city will look.
34                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          At the center of government there are effective arrangements for communicating with the
     media and the public, including inter-ministry coordination. The Prime Minister’s office has
     the capacity to disseminate the information to the public, organize press conferences with
     media, and liaison with both international and national media. The government Web site is
     regularly updated. The Integrated Planning System is a set of operating principles to ensure
     that government policy planning and monitoring as a whole takes place in the most efficient
     and harmonized way possible. IPS is the key national decision-making mechanism for deter-
     mining strategic directions and allocation of resources. In order to better communicate IPS
     to all stakeholders, the Department for Strategic and Donors Coordination has published the
     Integrated Planning System Communication Guidelines 2010–201378 to provide guidelines
     for various stakeholders to work together harmoniously and to exchange information and
     knowledge on IPS processes, implementation, and accomplishments. Another new mecha-
     nism for transparency and ATI related to foreign assistance that was developed at the central
     government is the Donors Database, a joint effort of the donor community and government
     institutions. The database provides up-to-date information on all donor assistance provided to
     Albania, including information on the projects by specific sectors and financial data. The data-
     base is intended to increase coordination and reduce overlap among donors and to better ori-
     ent external assistance to the country’s needs, strategic priorities, and sectors.79 Its publication
     on the government Web site provides open access to interested groups or citizens who would
     like to know more about foreign-financed projects in Albania.
          While progress has been made to employ different mechanisms at the central level for ATI,
     the capacities in the line ministries still remain weak. There is no systematic process for devel-
     oping a communications plan for each sector.
          There are no comprehensive data on the total funds or budget allocations for the imple-
     mentation of ATI at the government level. The strategy for e-government includes some data
     about the domestic budget and the donors fund committed for implementation of the e-gov-
     ernment systems and investments in ICT, but these data are only for 2008–09. The budget
     planning process is decentralized at the ministry level, with the MEF providing the budget ceil-
     ings. Therefore, each line ministry and budgetary institution is responsible for specifying the
     ATI-related products, activities, and their related costs during the preparation of the Medium
     Term Budget Program (MTBP). The MTBP provides a mechanism that enables monitoring of
     commitment levels as well as the achievement of objectives for each ministry in implementing
     their own programs, including ATI and ITC systems. Although the budget planning is left to
     the line ministries, scarce budget resources provide a constraint to effective implementation
     of the ATI. All interviews in the line ministries confirm that ATI is not among the top priorities
     of the budget organizations; therefore, under competing priorities, budget allocations to such
     process are always limited. The e-government strategy is a good tool for ensuring that line
     ministries allocate sufficient resources for its implementation.
          Despite the formal norms requiring the implementation of the right to ATI, informal norms
     contribute to its poor implementation, including the high degree of centralization with which
     the law is handled in the bureaucracy, a lack of awareness among citizens of their rights, and
     the pervasiveness of petty corruption in the relationships between bureaucrats and citizens.
     Although Law 8503 specifies a formal procedure for requesting information and deciding on
     requests, long-standing bureaucratic mentalities and practices favoring centralization of deci-
     sion-making still persist. Requests from citizens are routinely channeled through the Minister or
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                                35




Agency Head who then delegate the drafting of a response to the relevant departments based
on the subject matter and nature of the reply. All interviews conducted for this case study con-
firmed two elements that are negatively impacting the outcomes of ATI laws: (1) decision-
making on the release of information is quite centralized in the public service and as such, certain
information can barely be accessed by beneficiaries and; (2) citizen tend to approach the heads
of institutions directly because they only feel confident in the answer comes from this level.
     But even in cases when information is submitted to the head of institution, information is
denied or resistance is shown to release it. Civil society monitoring of the fulfillment of obliga-
tions in the framework of the SAA process began in 2008 with monitoring reports prepared by
various representatives from civil society and supported by OSFA. The reports are also a good
source of information for the commission structures to get independent opinions on progress
made in various sectors, with emphasis on democracy and good governance.80 However, the
report emphasizes that the team who collected the information and conducted interviews
faced difficulty in obtaining information from some public agencies, including the Ministry
of European Integration. Another example provided during the interviews involved govern-
ment debt toward a considerable number of construction companies that have paved national
roads. The companies have not been reimbursed for certain services. In these circumstances,
the Construction Association has made several attempts to obtain information on the debts,
but they have not been able to obtain an accurate figure on the debt or the time when they
can receive the money owed.
     The behavior of officials in their direct interactions with citizens is often described as “not
according to the ethical norms,”81 but rather based on “individual education or approach.”
Different opinions are expressed regarding the behavior of officials working in private institu-
tions like the banking system. According to interviews, the behavior of officials working at front
desks or information points in private companies and institutions is more led by formal norms
for the release of information and by ethical rules than is the public sector.
     Even citizens who are aware of the law identify a range of problems with the way in which it
is implemented. Interviews and contact surveys conducted by the CAO and municipal govern-
ments (for example, in the cities of Korca and Shkodra in 2004) indicated problems that include
delays in answering requests, the need to wait in lines for hours, the lack of professionalism
and poor ethical standards in communicating with and handling the needs of citizens, a lack
of explanatory notices and orientation information, tardiness and absenteeism from work,
irresponsibility, and disrespect for the law, among others. A survey conducted by EuroPartners
Development82 in the same cities in 2010 determined that the same problems persisted, albeit
with some slight improvements.
     Difficulties in accessing information and the lack of proper structures for doing so, have
historically been sources of petty corruption in Albania, and in some agencies that deal directly
with the public, bribing officials in order to obtain a service or important information remains
a problem. Lack of awareness of their rights to be provided with information on request has
arguably contributed to citizens continuing to pay bribes without being explicitly asked for a
“hidden payment” because they anticipate that doing so will allow them access to informa-
tion that would otherwise be unavailable (this is often identified in citizen interactions with the
courts, immovable property registration offices, and offices issuing permits).
     A general conclusion related to implementation of the ATI and RTI in Albania is that good
progress has been made in developing the legislation and institutional framework supporting
36                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     the implementation but the public information regime in place continues to have significant
     problems in its functioning. The reasons for this include problems with infrastructure, lack of
     sufficient political will expressed in the weakness of administrative capacity, and autocratic
     tendencies inherited from the administration; it is also conditioned by the shortcomings of the
     legal framework for RTI that has remained unchanged since 1999.
          Albania has made progress in recent years in the establishment of an institutional frame-
     work and development of tools and mechanisms that ensure public ATI offices. The People’s
     Advocate in the role of the ombudsman oversees the implementation of the law, but its
     capacities and power must be enhanced.
          Political commitment to the implementation of ATI has increased during the years of the
     transition process, also imposed by requirements resulting from the of EU integration pro-
     cess. However, the centralized decision-making process and a lack of power delegation could
     undermine the proper implementation of the ATI framework.
          Public Information Offices are established in different institutions at the central and local
     levels, and staff is in place to offer services to the public. Several training and capacity-building
     programs have been carried out within the administration, but there is still a concern about
     the weak capacities of the public administration to ensure proper implementation of the ATI
     regime. Ethical behavior and equal treatment remains a concern in the public sector compared
     with the most developed entities in the private sector.
          Good practices are developed to ensure civil society and business participation into the
     decision-making process, but this process must be institutionalized to ensure sustainability and
     implementation across the public administration, and to avoid the use of discretion or consul-
     tation only on an ad hoc basis.


     7.3. RECOMMENDATIONS
     Albania is making progress building an information society and using ICT advantages for
     enhancing public ATI and transparency. However, low rates of using the Internet at the coun-
     try level will slow the impact produced by use of the ICT in different sectors. Public Private
     Partnership initiatives could be developed for building proper IT infrastructure across the
     country.
          The following steps must be undertaken to enhance the ATI:

     Improvements to the law on the right of information to official documents. This remains
     the primary need. The law must be in compliance with the acquis communitaire. Possible
     changes to the law include:
      • Widening the circle of entities that are obliged to provide information, including: natural or
        legal persons who serve public or administrative functions (for example, private companies
        that have monopolies or concessions for the water supply or electricity) and legal entities
        operating entirely or partially with public funds (for example, companies that are in the
        ownership or control of the state or profit or nonprofit companies owned by private per-
        sons that are subsidized by the state to a considerable extent);
      • Adding exclusive criteria that provide an exhaustive list of criteria for withholding
        information;
A CASE STUDY OF ALBANIA                                                                           37




 • Reviewing deadlines for providing information and changing the term “working days” to
   “calendar days” for clarification; the use of the term “working days” has caused delays and
   extensions to deadlines far beyond what is provided by law;
 • Developing information disclosure policies and rules for each institution and defining the
   list of documents that should be made available to the public;
 • Developing specific mechanisms for disabled people have access to public information;
 • Clarifying provisions that provide applicants with the right to obtain documents in
   their preferred format, including electronic, unless this presents considerable technical
   difficulties;
 • Defining the costs to obtain for information in order to reduce the power of discretion
   among some entities that impose very high tariffs.

Harmonization of legal frameworks. All legislation intersecting with the Law on the Right of
Information to Official Documents should be inventoried and harmonized to conform to the
new law’s procedural requirements. Alignment with the acqui communitaire should always be
taken into consideration.

Develop mechanisms to assist citizens filling complaints when RTI requests are denied.
The potential to develop a citizens’ support network to provide guidance on administrative
appeals and request procedures should be explored.

Include municipalities under the e-governance program. Municipalities are closer to the
citizens; as such, citizen access to city council decisions or investment programs will provide
opportunities for participation in decision making and easy access to information about
municipal services.

Strengthen mechanisms for monitoring of the implementation of the ATI framework.
Special research and polling should be done by specialized NGOs to help monitor and sys-
tematically test the implementation of the law by the government, both in quantitative and
qualitative terms.

Intensify public education and awareness activities. Public education for individual citizens
and for businesses is a prerequisite for further enforcement of the public information access
regime. This should involve a combination of targeted press coverage, public education cam-
paigns (with leaflets and brochures), and other types of information campaigns.

      international conventions were included verbatim, such as Article 17, which raises the European
      Convention on Human Rights to the level of a constitutional norm. The entire process of drafting the
      Constitution in 1998 was observed by the Venice Commission, an important Advisory Board of the
      Council of Europe. The first draft of the post-communist Constitution was proposed during the time of

      of the ICCPR, states must “adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect
      to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.” In other words, states must create an environment

     18. In 2007, the ombudsman, in cooperation with the IPLS and with USAID support, made an effort to
         draft a regulation for the approval by the Council of Ministers (Recommendation No. 177 of June 13,
         2006) that sought to address the complaints it was receiving from citizens. Despite the pressure from
         the ombudsman and USAID office, the regulation was never approved by the Council of Ministers.
     19. In September 2004, “Article 19 “released the “Memorandum on the Albanian Law on the Right to
         Information about Official Documents. “In chapter III of the memorandum, entitled “Analysis of the
         Law,” several recommendations were made to amend the Law No. 8503.19
     20. “Udhezimi mbi te drejten e informimit” (Albanian language).
     21. See www.moh.gov.al/publiku%20PDF/udhezues%20per%20te%20drejten%20e%20informimit.pdf.
     22. The draft regulation was prepared with the assistance of the Rule of Law project funded by the USAID.
     23. IPLS, the Center for Public Information Issues, and the Center for Institution Development and
         Democratization are the NGOs being supported by the USAID.
     24. The first draft of the post-communist Constitution was drafted at the time of the Democratic Party
         leadership, but it was rejected by Albanians in a national referendum in 1994.
     25. OSCE established and financially supported the Administrative Center for Coordinating and Assisting
         Public Participation (ACCAPP; acronym in Albanian is QAKAP). On October 15, 1997, the ACCAPP
         opened in offices provided by the OSCE Presence in Tirana. The team of lawyers assembled by the
         Ministry of Institutional Reform designed ACCAPP. While it enjoyed the cooperation and support of
         both the Ministry and the OSCE, ACCAPP was designed as a quasi-nongovernmental organization
         administered by its directors and financially supported by various NGOs and foreign governments.

     28. The ASCS was established on the basis of Law 10093 (2009); it works to encourage, through financial
         assistance, sustainable development of civil society and the creation of favorable conditions for civil
         initiatives to benefit the public, in conformity with Article 4 of the law and the priorities and strategies
         of the respective government programs.
     29. The World Bank and Dutch Government, through a trust fund, supported the opening of the PIC at
         the Tirana Municipality (Tirana Transparency Project, 2001–03); the USAID-supported establishment of
         PIOs in several cities; and the OSFA Public Administration Program that has supported the creation of
         citizen information centers/offices in 14 municipalities—4 percent of the total municipalities in the
         country. The nature of these facilities is diverse. In the towns of Kucove, Gramsh, Rreshen, Lezhe,
         Permet, and Kelcyre the offices are modest. In Elbasan, the OSFA helped create a social services and
         information office, whereas in Kucova and Berat, the offices are more specialized to handle business-
         licensing procedures. In Durrës, Shkodër, Pogradec, Korçë, and Sarandë the offices represent
         integrated facilities offering a wide range of information.

     31. The duties of the public information officers are to enable access to information for the public with
         regard to the activities and services of the ministries, demonstrating to and supporting citizens to
         better understand administrative dispositions. The main task of the spokesperson is to maintain
         contact with the media and to communicate through the media the information relating to ministry
         activity.

      maximum transparency of the government through free and full access to the activity and data of
      public institutions, up to the personal records of officials, and one the other, a true and fair observance
      of freedom of media and freedom of opinion. The government declares its highest commitment and
      dedication, considering freedom of information and transparency as the key tool for good governance
      and the fight against corruption. The new majority guarantees none of its political officials will bring a
      penal or civil suit against journalists and the media. In no case, will the Media be treated in a
      discriminatory way in pursuit of political or other ends.”

     61. See the government program (2009–13): “The right to information, organization and expression will be
         implemented at higher level. Government is committed to a maximum transparency, respect for
         freedom of media, to a proactive process information and accountability, to support the activities of
         civil society while respecting its independence. Albania will continue to be country of unique
         standards in Europe and the world, where the administration can not file a civil suit or criminal to
         publish to the media despite what officials.” http://km.gov.al/?fq=preprog/programi

     63. The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) is a medium-to long-term document
         with a planning horizon covering the period 2007–13. It is the successor to the National Strategy for
         Socio-Economic Development (NSSED), which was presented by Albanian Government in 2001 and
         was the main government strategic document until 2006.
     64. On May 18, 2010, The Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Water Administration organized an open
         consultation with interest groups and civil society on the draft law on environment.
     65. Approval was supposed to take place by the end of the year in 2007.
     66. In October 2005, when the privatization of AlbTelecom was intensely investigated by the Parliament,
         the Centre for Development and Democratization of Institutions (QZHDI)—an NGO specializing in
         public information law—urged the concerned ministry to make available a copy of the offer of Turkish
         company “Calik Enerji, which was declared winner of the tender. An application made under the 8503
         law for RTI, was rejected by the Ministry of Economy with the claim that the ministry had signed a
         confidentiality agreement with all firms tendering. However, the ministry refused to submit a copy of
         such agreement, and even the intervention of the ombudsman didn’t have any persuasive effect.
     67. Albanian think tanks who opposed in December 2006 draft Law on State Police, prepared under the
         assistance of PAMECA Mission. In other cases representatives of the private sector have tried to
         influence various developments caused by the negotiation and implementation of the Interim
         Agreement, which might affect directly their activity.
     68. A group of experts, selected by the OSFA and Centre for Development and Democratization of
         Institutions in 2008, worked together to prepare a number of amendments to Law No. 8503 (For the
         Right to Information on Official Documents. The proposed amendments were consistent with the most
         advanced standards of European legislation and beyond. The final draft was a product of a series of
         discussions in the six public open meetings with representatives of public administration, members of
         Parliament, interest groups, media, and civil society. Lobbying in Parliament was another important
         moment, which was conducted with individual and joint meetings with MPs of all political sides,
         representatives of the parliamentary committee on information and media, with heads of
         parliamentary groups and the Minister of Justice. Even though a group MPs from the ruling majority
         and opposition undertake the initiative to include the discussion on the new the draft agenda of
         Parliament, yet the change of law has not taken place.
     69. The law sets three levels of classification: top secret, secret, and confidential. Information can be
         classified for ten years, but that period can be extended. In May 2006, Parliament approved
         amendments to the law, creating a new category called “restricted,” referring to information that if
         disclosed would “damage the normal state activity and the interests or effectiveness of state
         institutions.” These amendments were strongly criticized by civil society groups and international
         organizations.
     70. Once this enters into force, Albania has to deal with EU market competition.

         establish additional transparent procedures that eventually facilitate the access to information. The
         Construction’s Association has suggested to the General Directorate of Roads to publish the individual

      offers to a bid, once the time of the submission is over. In this way all the process is very open and
      transparent to all construction companies, and the process would be less disputable and avoid any
      mislead of the biding process. The GDR has not taken into consideration this request.

78.   The aim of the document is to propagate information in a structured manner in order to communicate
      to all stakeholders on the IPS implementation status and make them understand that it is an
      integrated process, not a fragmented one, and that it is a two-way process for gathering as well as
      receiving information. The document contains general information about IPS processes and its
      institutional structures and makes an overview on IPS communication since its adoption by the
      Government of Albania in 2005. It intends to brief the government and stakeholders on past and
      current IPS-related communication activities. The document foresees and plans the IPS
      communication for the period 2010–13, which coincides with the new IPS implementing stage in all
      ministries, with an emphasis on securing technical assistance, organizational development, and
      improving ministry planning and budgeting capacity aimed at ensuring quality of implementation and
      further strengthening accountability mechanisms. See http://www.dsdc.gov.al/dsdc/Platforma_e_

                             A Case Study of India

1. Introduction
On May 10, 2005, the Indian Parliament enacted the Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI Act),
providing citizens with a legal right to access government information and records; establish-
ing mechanisms of implementation, promotion, and enforcement to enable the exercise of
this right; and, in effect, opening the official decision-making processes to public scrutiny. The
recognition, by law, of citizens’ right to access the information contained in hitherto secret
documents marked a shift in the paradigm of governance—from one characterized by official
discretion, secrecy, and control to one of openness and transparency. The significance of the
law’s passage was recognized by commentators who hailed the law as a “great and revolu-
tionary law”1 with the potential of “fundamentally altering the balance of power between the
government and citizens”2 in India.
     The passage of the law was rooted in a strong grassroots movement that gained national
momentum in the early 2000s, it was consequently embraced as a key platform by a major
political party. India’s civil society and media have also expressed high expectations of the
RTI Act. The law was expected to usher in a new era of transparent and open governance and
“merge with and strengthen the aspirations of people for participatory democracy.”3
     On paper, the law provides a way for citizens to access information and records held by
public authorities at the central, state, and local government levels and establishes an inde-
pendent grievance-redressal system to deal with complaints that arise from noncompliance.
     In practice, the law’s potential has been realized to a certain extent. Various studies have
shown that citizens have responded to the RTI Act enthusiastically, filing information requests
with government departments on a range of issues. In the two-and-a-half years after the RTI
Act was passed, it was estimated that 2 million requests for information had been filed by
citizens citing the legislation.4 Civil society, in particular, has popularized the law by mobiliz-
ing citizens to use it and by monitoring its implementation. For its scope and design,5 the
Indian RTI Act is widely regarded as a model piece of legislation.6 This attention, as well as the
tremendous popularity of the law, has prompted several countries around the world to draw up
their own access-to-information legislation. At the same time, in some instances, information
obtained through the RTI Act has been used by civil society groups and individuals to demand
improvements in the provision of government services.



                                                                                                      55
56                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          These are positive developments, but they only go so far. Reports also indicate that public
     officials, by and large, lack the skills and training needed to comply with the law, and in many
     ways, they continue to resist its implementation. Meanwhile, continued resistance to the RTI
     Act at various levels raises important questions about the government’s willingness to create
     an enabling environment for citizens to exercise their right to information (RTI).
          This case study builds on recent work on the subject and also draws from numerous inter-
     views conducted with an array of stakeholders. It examines India’s experience with the imple-
     mentation of the RTI Act to date, focusing on both the implementation measures put in place
     by the government as well as the use of the law. It examines the role of three key stakeholders
     in particular—politicians, civil society actors, and bureaucrats—in the design and implemen-
     tation of the law; in so doing, this study seeks to shed light on how the law has been put in
     practice.
          An analysis of the various implementation measures enacted by the central government
     suggests that there has been procedural compliance with the basic provisions of the RTI Act.
     Specifically, rules and regulations regarding the payment of fees and the appeals process have
     been framed, information commissions have been set up, and officers have been designated
     to handle requests and appeals in various government departments. But recent assessments
     of the law’s implementation indicate that there are key gaps in the RTI regime. A number of
     studies cite inadequate infrastructure and insufficient budgetary and human resources as key
     constraints on the performance of departments as well as information commissions. Public
     information officers (PIOs) in both the central and state governments have reported low levels
     of awareness, training, and capacity building as well as poor records management as the major
     reasons for delays in responding to requests for information.
          The growing backlog of pending appeals and complaints with the information commis-
     sions—and the low number of penalties thus far imposed—have prompted civil society groups
     to question the efficacy of the enforcement mechanisms under the RTI Act. These implementa-
     tion gaps suggest that while there has been procedural compliance, the government has only
     made limited efforts to ensure the systemic change required occurs. For example, internal
     rules and procedures have not been reviewed, and records management practices have not
     been improved to enable departments to disclose information more efficiently. The imple-
     mentation of the RTI Act appears to have become a “check-the-box” procedure; its actual
     realization would require the substantial, internal reforms of the structures and processes of
     government departments.

     1.1. METHODOLOGY
     This case study is a combination of desk-based secondary research and primary data collection
     from interviews and TI requests, drawing on secondary literature on the genesis of the RTI Act
     in India as well as recent studies assessing the status of the law’s implementation.
          In order to understand the dynamics of RTI implementation, this case study analyzes
     the efforts of the nodal implementing agency—the Department of Personnel and Training
     (DOPT)—as well as three departments of the central government:7
      • Department of Rural Development. This department, under the Ministry of Rural
        Development, formulates and oversees implementation of the government’s flagship pro-
        grams on livelihood generation, wage employment, rural housing, and rural connectivity.
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                 57




   These schemes are implemented across the country through state governments, district
   rural development agencies, and Panchayati Raj institutions.
 • Department of School Education and Literacy. This department, under the Ministry of
   Human Resource Development, is responsible for the formulation and implementation of
   policies on elementary education, secondary education, literacy, and adult education.
 • Central Public Works Department (CPWD). This department, under the Ministry of Urban
   Development, is the premier public works agency of the central government. It is respon-
   sible for the construction and maintenance of all central government works and assets.

     Qualitative interviews were conducted with key officials in each of these four departments
to understand departmental compliance with the RTI Act (assessed against the key obligations
of public authorities under the RTI Act),8 challenges to its implementation, and the impact of
the law on departmental functioning. Interviews were also conducted with civil society organi-
zations (CSOs), activists, and the media. The study focused on the use of the RTI in three key
sectors: rural development, education, and public works. The interviews helped to gauge per-
ceptions of the RTI Act, understand ways in which the law is being used to demand informa-
tion from the government, and evaluate how the law has changed or influenced the way that
government departments are held accountable to the public.
     To assess the readiness of the department to implement the law, RTI applications were
filed in the three central government departments seeking information on the total number of
RTI applications that were received, rejected, and fulfilled as well as the number of first appeals
filed between 2008–10.
     In addition, a literature review was undertaken. Although data assessing the status of
RTI implementation in India are limited, there are several valuable studies on the subject. In
2008–09, the Government of India commissioned the private consultancy firm Pricewater-
houseCoopers (PwC) to assess the implementation of the RTI Act. Simultaneously, civil society
groups launched their own study under the umbrella of the Right to Information Assessment
and Analysis Group (RAAG), a coalition of people’s organizations and activists. Despite differ-
ences in scale and methodology, both studies contain similar findings.
     On a positive note, these studies echo several others in suggesting that the institutional
mechanisms for operationalizing the key provisions of the law have been set in place at various
levels. Central and state governments have formulated rules to implement the law, govern-
ment departments have designated information officers to handle requests and appeals, and
information commissions have been set up across various states.9
     However, the studies also cite low levels of awareness about the law among civil servants,
limited training and capacity building among PIOs, inconsistent rules and procedures for
accessing information, and poor records management.10



2. Adoption of the RTI Act, 2005
Public demand for the RTI Act, coupled with support from the Congress-led United
Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, eventually led to its enactment in May 2005. It was
preceded by a number of state RTI laws and, at the national level, by the less ambitious and
ineffectual Freedom of Information Act 2002 (FOI Act). The pluralistic nature of the Indian state
58                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     as well as its highly vibrant and active civil society not only spurred the passage of the law but
     has also helped to maintain pressure on the government to effectively implement it.
          An extensive body of literature chronicles the history of the RTI movement in India.11 This
     movement is particularly significant because of its deep grassroots origins, unlike in many
     other countries where the impetus for reform was supplied by either reformist elements within
     governments or pressure from international donor organizations. Although the Constitution
     of India constitution does not explicitly recognize citizens’ right to information, a series of pro-
     gressive judgments by the Supreme Court of India has recognized this right as an extension of
     the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1)(A).12 But it was
     not until a powerful grassroots movement, championed by well-connected national advocacy
     groups, became aligned with the vision of the political class in the early 2000s, that a law to
     operationalize such judgments was adopted.
          In the 1990s, a small grassroots organization in rural Rajasthan—the MazdoorKisan Shakti
     Sangathan (MKSS, Organization for the Empowerment of Workers and Peasants)—began to
     campaign for access to government records and documents as part of its broader struggle to
     secure minimum wages under the government’s drought relief programs.13 For over a decade,
     the successes of this group in extracting information from the government sparked a nation-
     wide campaign that culminated in the enactment of various state and national RTI laws.
          In many ways, the MKSS campaign was unique. While sporadic demands for information
     had been articulated by people’s organizations in other parts of the country, the MKSS created
     a mass support base of ordinary farmers and villagers for the movement.14 Inspired by the
     MKSS, people’s groups and organizations throughout the country (including the National
     Alliance of People’s Movements, Rural Workers’ Campaign, and Dalit Sangharsh Samiti) real-
     ized the importance of RTI in their own work.15
          The movement also drew support from human rights activists whose efforts against human
     rights violations and illegal detentions were frustrated by a lack of information; from environ-
     mental groups that had initially achieved some success in petitioning the Supreme Court for
     greater transparency on environmental issues;16 advocacy groups able to draw the support
     of opinion makers, such as the Lokayan, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI),
     and the National Campaign for Advocacy Studies; prominent individuals, including retired
     bureaucrats, lawyers, senior journalists, and academics; and even officials from within the
     bureaucracy.17
          In 1996, the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information (NCPRI) was formed, a
     critical development in galvanizing on one platform disparate groups, including representa-
     tives of people’s movements, activists, lawyers, journalists, academics, and retired bureaucrats.
     To build up mass support for its movement, the NCPRI adopted a strategy of reaching out to
     groups and organizations working on different issues across the country. The NCPRI prepared
     and submitted a draft RTI bill to the Press Council of India, which was forwarded to the govern-
     ment following a series of public consultations. A government committee (the H. D. Shourie
     Committee) was set up to review the draft bill, and within a few months, it submitted a diluted
     version of the bill to the government.18
          At the national level, the government’s response remained ambivalent. Other than some
     minor efforts—such as those under the V. P. Singh government in 1989 (scuttled by the bureau-
     cracy) and an unfulfilled promise in the election manifesto of the National Democratic Alliance
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                 59




government, which came to power in 199819—the government had never quite espoused the
RTI cause.
     State governments, meanwhile, made more rapid progress; many enacted RTI laws in
the 1990s,20 responding to a diverse set of pressures. In some states, such as Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka, the impetus for reform came from within the government.21 In others, such as
Maharashtra, a grassroots campaign for greater transparency led by Anna Hazare, forced the
government to repeal an ineffective law and replace it with a stronger state RTI law.
     While these state laws varied in strength and application, they went a long way toward
increasing awareness of citizens’ right to information and thus prepared the ground for
national legislation.22 But at the national level, while some public officials23 supported RTI,
others continued to resist the idea. This resistance, according to Singh (2010), emerged from
a fear among the bureaucracy that the law would bind the government to set rules, leading to
the “death of discretion.”24
     Sharp divisions, even among the political class, came to the fore in 1999, when one cabinet
minister unilaterally ordered the public disclosure of all records and papers in his ministry25 and
the prime minister (PM) rescinded the order. In response to a petition against the PM’s order
(filed by activists and lawyers in 2000), the Supreme Court ordered the government to provide
for RTI, paving the way for the 2002 FOI Act.
     However, the FOI Act was widely criticized for its weak and ineffectual clauses;26 it wasn’t
even published in the Official Gazette of India and, therefore, never came into force.27 In 2004,
the newly-elected UPA government promised to make RTI “progressive, participatory and
meaningful.”28 To monitor the implementation of the government’s programs, the leader of the
Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi, set up a National Advisory Council (NAC) that included key RTI
advocates.29 In August 2004 the NCPRI submitted a draft RTI bill to the NAC that essentially a
series of amendments to the 2002 FOI Act. The amendments included renaming the law from
the “Freedom of Information Act” to the “Right to Information Act.” This was significant since
it placed the demand for information in the context of a legally justifiable right rather than an
abstract freedom.
     Based on submissions from civil society groups including the NCPRI, the NAC submitted
its recommendations to the government for amending the FOI Act 2002. In December 2004,
based on these recommendations, the Right to Information Bill 2004 was tabled in Parliament.
The bill, while better than the 2002 law, still excluded a number of key clauses recommended
by civil society groups: it restricted RTI to the central government only and excluded penalties
for noncompliance. Eventually, a parliamentary standing committee and a group of ministers
were appointed to review the bill and, after a great deal of lobbying from civil society groups, a
number of the original NCPRI-NAC recommendations were reinstituted.30 The stronger legisla-
tion that resulted from this process—the RTI Act—received support from Sonia Gandhi and
the NAC; it was finally passed by both houses of Parliament in May 2005, received presidential
assent in June 2005, and came into formal force on October 13, 2005.31
     From the outset, civil society groups were determined that the RTI Act should follow inter-
national best practices on access to information. They specifically pushed for the incorporation
of the basic principles of maximum disclosure, minimum exemptions, independent appeals,
penalties, and universal accessibility within the law. These principles found expression in the
final text of the RTI Act.

     3. The Clarity and Comprehensiveness
        of the Legal Environment
     The RTI Act 2005, is widely regarded as a progressive law overriding all existing laws, including
     the Official Secrets Act 1923.32 It draws upon the provisions of international access-to-
     information laws, such as those from Canada, Jamaica, Mexico, and South Africa.33 In effect,
     the law covers the whole country, except Jammu and Kashmir.34
         While sporadic attempts to introduce RTI legislation had been made by the government
     since the 1980s, it was really a massive push by groups such as the MKSS and NCPRI in the
     1990s that paved the way for the reform. The national campaign for RTI strategically built part-
     nerships with various stakeholder groups, including the media, lawyers, civil society groups,
     and people’s movements across the country. In particular, the NCPRI organized workshops
     with groups working on issues as diverse as child labor, health, education, and human rights in
     order to highlight the cross-cutting nature of RTI.35
         The campaign also recognized the need to build support within the political establish-
     ment, and RTI activists drew upon their personal connections with senior bureaucrats and party
     leaders to gather support for the campaign. In the final weeks before the RTI Act’s enactment,
     CSOs, including the NCPRI, CHRI, and others, lobbied Members of Parliament relentlessly
     with to ensure that the most progressive provisions were crafted into the legislation—such as
     extending the coverage of the law to the entire government (rather than only the central gov-
     ernment, as was the case with the 2002 Act and an earlier draft of the 2005 law).
         In many countries, expanding RTI is perceived as a neoliberal reform effort pushed by
     governments, but in India, since its inception, the RTI Act has been seen as linked to the
     realization of basic rights and entitlements and as a tool to combat corruption.36 The MKSS
     campaign in rural Rajasthan demonstrated the potential of RTI in helping ordinary workers
     and farmers access their wages under the government’s wage employment programs. In so
     doing, the MKSS developed a radical interpretation of the notion that citizens have a right
     to know how they are governed and to participate actively in the process of auditing their
     representatives.37

     3.1. THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE
     The RTI Act brings under its purview public authorities that are established, constituted,
     owned, or substantially financed by central, state, or local government bodies as well as
     organizations substantially controlled or financed by government funds (directly or indirectly),
     including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). It covers all courts, Parliament, legislative
     assemblies, and councils. Certain security and intelligence agencies established by the govern-
     ment are exempted from coverage,38 but it is noteworthy that, if allegations of corruption or
     human rights violations are concerned, exemptions from information disclosure do not apply.
         The law does not specifically cover private bodies, but it does enable citizens to access
     information about private bodies if such information can also be accessed by public authori-
     ties. For instance, in the case of a public private partnership, any information about the private
     company that is required to be submitted to the government is available to citizens under
     the RTI.
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                   61




3.2. THE SCOPE OF EXCEPTIONS
The law defines 10 exemption clauses to protect information that is likely to affect the country’s
national interests, foreign relations, commercial and trade secrets, and the like.39 These not-
withstanding, information that can be provided to Parliament or to a state legislature can also
be provided to citizens. Further, if the public interest in disclosing information outweighs the
harm to protected interests, public authorities may disclose the information.40
    Civil society pressure resulted in the reinstitution of two important NAC recommenda-
tions in the RTI Act: (1) a provision for requiring the disclosure of information pertaining to
corruption and human rights violations by intelligence agencies (which had been removed
in the bill tabled in Parliament);41 and (2) the law was extended to cover all branches of
government, including those at the state level. This is particularly critical to civil society
groups, since information relevant to the urban and rural poor can only be accessed at the
state-government level.42
    In 2006, soon after the law was enacted, the DOPT issued a notice on its Web site stat-
ing that “file notings” were not to be disclosed under the RTI Act.43 Civil society groups and
activists were quick to respond, challenging the notice before the central and state informa-
tion commissions who supported the view that notings could be accessed under the law.
Undeterred, the government prepared a draft RTI amendment bill, the main purpose of which
was to exclude file notings from the purview of the law.44 Civil society groups and leading RTI
activists, rallying against the bill, launched a major campaign with the support of the media,
successfully stalled the government from pushing the amendment through.45
    In 2009–10, in response to an RTI request, the government again confirmed that amend-
ments to the RTI Act meant to improve the functioning of the law and prevent its misuse were
being considered, including exemptions for frivolous and vexatious requests for information,
discussions on policy decisions, and information from the office of the Chief Justice of India.46
    After civil society groups addressed letters to the PM and Sonia Gandhi protesting the
potential amendments, the government decided to shelve them, assuring activists that they
would be considered only after consultations with a range of stakeholders had taken place. In
this way, civil society groups have played a crucial role—not only in the passage of the legisla-
tion, but also as watchdogs, remaining vigilant and responsive to any government push back
on of the RTI Act.

3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
The RTI Act clearly outlines the implementation roles and responsibilities of public authorities
at various levels. Central and state governments are tasked with framing rules and guidelines
to facilitate citizens’ access to information, developing education programs for the public, pro-
moting the timely dissemination of information by public authorities, conducting training and
capacity building of public authorities, and so on.47 Each public authority must appoint PIOs
and assistant public officers (APIOs) within its administrative units and offices to receive and
process requests for information. The law spells out the procedure to be followed by citizens in
seeking information as well as the protocol to be followed by PIOs and APIOs in receiving and
handling information requests.
    Citizens can seek information under the law by submitting an application in writing, elec-
tronically, or orally in Hindi, English, or the official language of a given area. Applicants are not
62                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     required to state reasons for requesting information or provide any personal details beyond
     basic contact information.
         The law prescribes the imposition of reasonable fees as well as the waiver of fees for citi-
     zens living below the poverty line. The RTI Act sets a time limit of 30 days for official responses
     to RTI applications. Where the information requested concerns a matter of life or liberty, infor-
     mation must be provided within 48 hours.

     3.4. IMPLEMENTING RULES/REGULATIONS
     Under the RTI Act, the central and state governments are required to frame rules to enable its
     provisions. These rules determine any fees and costs for the supply of information, the format
     of applications, modes of payment, procedures for accessing information, and the appeals
     process for information commissions. In addition, the legislatures, high courts, Supreme
     Court, and both houses of Parliament—can also frame rules as “competent authorities.” The
     RTI Regulation of Fee and Cost Rules, applicable to central government departments, came
     into effect on September 16, 2005. State governments have also formulated rules under the
     RTI Act.
         The variations in the rules framed by the central and state governments have resulted in
     as many as 88 different RTI rules currently in operation in India.48 In particular, inconsistent fee
     structures, restrictive formats, and varying procedures for accessing information have been
     cited by civil society groups as stumbling blocks to citizens’ efforts to use the law.49



     4. Capacity, Promotion, and Oversight
     The RTI Act lays out a very detailed implementation framework for public authorities. In some
     countries, like the United Kingdom, the government had five years to fully operationalize the
     RTI law; in India, the time gap between the enactment of the RTI Act and its implementa-
     tion was quite short: enacted in May 2005, the law came into full force on October 12, 2005.
     Public authorities were given 120 days within which to implement the law in its entirety. Some
     key provisions came into immediate effect, including the framing of rules by central and state
     governments, the appointment of PIOs by public authorities, and the establishment of the
     information commissions at the central and state government levels.

     4.1. IMPLEMENTING ORGANIZATIONS
     While the law does not specifically provide for the designation of a nodal implementing
     agency, institutional arrangements have been made with specific departments to lead imple-
     mentation at the central and state government levels. At the central level, the DOPT in the
     Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions has been designated as the nodal
     agency.50 In this role, the department has the powers and responsibilities of the central govern-
     ment as outlined under the RTI Act.51 Notably, the DOPT was closely involved in the formula-
     tion and drafting of the RTI Act; it even presented the draft bill in Parliament. The department
     has a separate RTI division that deals with all RTI matters and the Central Information
     Commission (CIC).52 In most states, either a general administration department or department
     of administrative reforms has been designated as the primary RTI implementing agency.
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                               63




     The DOPT’s role as the lead implementing agency reveals certain contradictions. As the
department responsible for the formulation of personnel policies, senior staff appointments,
and general administration in the central government, the DOPT has played an important role
in setting the tone for implementation. It has issued detailed notifications and instructions to
departments, organized trainings for officers relating to the RTI Act, conducted mass public
awareness campaigns, clarified key provisions of the law, and issued specific orders to minis-
tries to appoint PIOs, proactively disclose information, and to improve records management
practices.53
     But on some issues concerning the disclosure of information by the bureaucracy, the
department’s interpretation of the law has been controversial. As previously mentioned, in
2006, the DOPT stated that file notings could not be disclosed under the law;54 this led to a
number of government departments refusing citizens access to information.55 From a civil
society perspective, access to file notings provides a critical insight into the deliberative
process of government, and opens up to scrutiny the views, recommendations, and decision
of officials on specific policy issues.56 Civil society objections57 forced the DOPT to backtrack
on the issue,58 but the controversy proved to be only the first in a series of attempts by the
government to amend the RTI Act.59 In subsequent years, the department has been frequently
critiqued for its interpretation of the law’s key provisions. Most recently, the department has
mooted a series of amendments that, if introduced, would limit both the subject matter and
word count of RTI applications.60
     As agencies on the frontlines, ministries and departments (at both the central and state
levels) play critical roles on a day-to-day basis in determining how RTI is translated into a
tangible right for citizens. Under the implementation framework outlined in the RTI Act, it is
the responsibility of each line ministry—and the public authorities under them—to set in place
systems and processes to enable citizens to access information under the law.
     There are a total of 60 ministries under the central government, each with a number of
departments and public authorities under its jurisdiction. Aggregate data on compliance with
the RTI Act by these ministries are unavailable, but information from the government’s national
RTI portal suggests that a large number of ministries have complied with the basic provisions
of the law, including appointing PIOs and appellate authorities and proactively disclosing
information.61
     Interviews with officials in the DOPT, Department of Rural Development, and CPWD shed
light on the internal processes and procedures that departments have developed for RTI
implementation.62 The nodal division or the RTI cell is generally responsible for coordinating
the receipt, transfer, and disposal of RTI requests and ensuring that there is department-wide
compliance with the provisions of the law. In their efforts to set in place systems and processes
to facilitate RTI implementation, the DOPT and CPWD stand out. The CPWD has set up an
RTI coordination cell to receive and redirect RTI requests to its relevant branches, divisions,
and subdivisions. It is well staffed and well organized, with nine dedicated staff members and
a separate office space with proper workstations, computers, and sufficient filing space. The
DOPT has recently set up a dedicated RTI cell to streamline the disposal of RTI applications.
Of the four departments, the DOPT is the only one that has issued detailed internal guidelines
for the efficient handling of requests and appeals within the department.63 In the Department
of Rural Development, the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Division handles
all RTI-related matters. The Department of School Education and Literacy does not have a
64                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     dedicated cell or division; all matters related to RTI implementation are handled by another
     department in the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
         It appears that the ways in which departments organize themselves to deal with RTI imple-
     mentation reflects sector-specific characteristics. Policy-intensive departments such as the
     Department of Rural Development and Department of School Education and Literacy tend to
     have leaner RTI implementation structures, with fewer information officers and less infrastruc-
     ture. This is primarily because most of their programs are implemented at the state and local
     government levels; therefore, requests for information are usually transferred to these levels.
     On the other hand, departments that are heavily engaged in the day-to-day implementation
     of programs, such as the CPWD, have more formalized systems, reflected in a higher number
     of information officers and a dedicated and well-staffed RTI cell, as examples. This difference
     in policy versus implementation is also reflected in the number of RTI requests received by
     departments: the CPWD receives a greater number of requests than the other two.

     4.2. BUDGET
     At the central and state government levels, there are no dedicated budgets for RTI imple-
     mentation. Additional allocations have, however, been made to help governments set up
     information commissions.64 In addition, in November 2008, the central government launched
     a centrally sponsored scheme65—to the tune of Rs. 26.68 crores—for strengthening implemen-
     tation, capacity building, and awareness generation under the RTI Act.66 At the level of line
     ministries and departments, however, there have been no additional allocations. Expenditures
     related to the implementation of the RTI Act, including the designation of PIOs, APIOs, and
     appellate authorities, are charged to the overall administrative budgets of each ministry or
     department.67 Interviews with officials from the CPWD, Department of Rural Development, and
     Department of School Education and Literacy confirmed that they do not have any dedicated
     budgets for RTI implementation.68
         This is a significant implementation issue. A subcommittee set up by the CIC in 2007 noted
     that public authorities, particularly at the lower levels of government, were constrained in their
     information provision by inadequate financial resources. The subcommittee recommended
     that central and state governments earmark a certain percentage of departmental budgets for
     the implementation of RTI programs—such as creating infrastructure, training, and capacity-
     building programs.69 The inadequacy of budgets and infrastructure has also been cited as a
     key constraint by the PIOs and department heads at the central and state government levels.70

     4.3. STAFFING AND TRAINING
     4.3.1. Staffing

     The RTI Act provides for the designation of information officers in all administrative units or
     offices of a public authority.71 In October 2005, the DOPT issued a directive instructing public
     authorities to designate PIOs and APIOs. At the sub-divisional and sub-district levels, where
     public authorities do not have offices or administrative units, arrangements have been made
     with the Department of Posts to provide the services of APIOs.72
          Aggregate data on the total number of central government personnel employed to pro-
     cess RTI requests are not available. The number of information officers varies depending on
     the number of offices, branches, and administrative units within a given ministry or department
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                                 65

(as can be seen in the four departments analyzed in table 1). The jurisdiction of each PIO and
AA has been clearly defined: officers process information requests and appeals related to the
specific schemes or programs being handled by them.73 This clear allocation of subject area
benefits both the officers and citizens who can address queries to specific PIOs or AAs.
     There seems to be a wide variation in the seniority levels of PIOs within the central gov-
ernment and across states. In many instances, junior officers have been designated as PIOs
and AAs, which, according to a 2009 CIC subcommittee, is likely to have a detrimental effect
on the quality of decisions.74 In the DOPT and Department of School Education and Literacy,
officers at the level of undersecretary have been designated as PIOs, whereas in the Depart-
ment of Rural Development, PIOs are at the level of director or deputy secretary.75 Civil society
groups also highlight that in the years immediately following the passage of the RTI Act, senior
officers (like joint secretaries) were designated as PIOs, but that junior officers who often lack
the capacity to respond to RTI requests or interpret the true letter and spirit of the law are now
being appointed.76
     While PIOs have been designated at various levels to handle requests and appeals, assess-
ments of the RTI Act suggest that the infrastructure and human resources allocated for imple-
mentation at various levels are insufficient.77 For example, 82 percent of the public authorities
surveyed within the central government reported the need for additional infrastructure to
implement the RTI Act; public authorities at the block and local levels of government lack basic
infrastructure like photocopy machines and computers.78 To facilitate the day-to-day handling
of RTI requests, the DOPT has instructed departments with more than one PIO to designate a
nodal officer to receive all requests and appeals.79

4.3.2. Training

The RTI Act includes provisions for the training needs and capacity building of officers. Central
and state governments, subject to the availability of resources, may conduct training programs
for the PIOs of public authorities and produce training materials and manuals on the RTI Act.80
The training division of the DOPT is the nodal agency in the government for formulating and
implementing training policy.81 The training of government functionaries in processes relevant
to the RTI Act is conducted regularly by the Institute of Secretariat and Management (ISTM), a
training institute under the DOPT. Departments may nominate officers to take part in the ISTM
courses, which include special modules for PIOs and AAs implementing the RTI Act.82
     At a national level, in 2005, the DOPT partnered with the United Nations Development Pro-
gram to launch a five-year training effort for all RTI stakeholders. Implemented in two districts
66                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     each in 27 states, the project involved capacity building and the training of government
     officials at the central, state, and district levels; the training of trainers; and the development of
     training materials. Almost 100,000 stakeholders have been trained under the project, including
     8,100 resource persons to train other officials in the RTI and other trainers.83 The DOPT has also
     been experimenting with the use of information and communication technology in training,
     and in 2009, launched a 15-day online certification course84 that targets PIOs, APIOS, AAs,
     public officials, citizens, CSOs, and other stakeholders.85 To date, there have been 24 groups
     for this training course.86
          But, despite these training initiatives, studies and interviews with civil society groups have
     highlighted the need for greater training and capacity building among government officials on
     the provisions of the RTI Act. Approximately 60 percent of both rural and urban PIOs have not
     received any RTI training, and approximately 40 percent of PIOs cited this as a constraint on
     their capacities to supply information to RTI applicants.87 The lack of training is reflected in the
     low levels of awareness about the law among PIOs; among the rural PIOs surveyed, 30 percent
     did not know the provisions of the RTI Act,88 and civil society groups observe that most PIOs
     are not aware of their roles and responsibilities under it.89 According to one activist, although
     most departments in the government have training centers where civil society and RTI experts
     are invited to train officers, for the most part these are not taken seriously since the training is
     not compulsory and the departments are required to nominate officers for training.90

     4.3.3. Human Resource Policies

     The RTI Act mandates the designation of existing staff as PIOs and APIOs. Consequently, there
     are no formal rules or procedures that require changes in human resource policies to facilitate
     the disclosure of information under the RTI Act. In each of the four departments analyzed,
     PIOs handle other portfolios in addition to their responsibilities under the RTI Act. But respon-
     siveness to RTI requests is not considered in the annual personnel performance appraisal of
     officials designated to perform RTI-related functions. Notably, there are no specific incen-
     tives that reward PIOs for good performance in discharging their RTI responsibilities, which is
     one reason for their lack of motivation.91 Over 10 percent of the PIOs surveyed cited a lack of
     financial and other incentives as reason for their reluctance to be PIOs. According to officials
     interviewed, though the RTI Act places certain obligations on government departments as a
     whole, the implementation of the RTI Act on a day-to-day basis is the responsibility of PIOs
     who face penalties if information is not provided on time. This has prompted resistance to the
     implementation of the law: over 30 percent of rural PIOs surveyed admitted that they did not
     want to be in their position.92

     4.4. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
     Under the RTI Act, public authorities are required to take steps to index, categorize, and
     catalog their records in order to enable the efficient dissemination of information. Within the
     central government, records management is the responsibility of a sister department of the
     DOPT—the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. Over the years, the
     department has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve government records man-
     agement systems, including developing manuals on records management procedures and
     implementing a records-management e-learning module. But despite these initiatives, record-
     keeping practices across the central and state governments generally still remain quite poor.
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                              67




     In 2006, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission highlighted record keeping as the
“weakest link” in the government’s information system. Noting that the “practice of catalogu-
ing, indexing, and orderly storage” was absent at various government levels, the commission
recommended the creation of a public records office and a one-time allocation of one percent
of funds from flagship programs over five years to update records and improve infrastructure.93
Despite these recommendations, efforts have been slow to align records management prac-
tices with the RTI Act.94
     Fifteen percent of rural PIOs and 25 percent of urban PIOs cited poor records manage-
ment as a key constraint to the swift processing of RTI applications.95 Similarly, 38 percent of
PIOs (responding to the PwC study) reported ineffective records management as the reason
for delays in processing requests. This problem was mentioned consistently in interviews with
government officials and civil society representatives, who all attributed the problem to a
lack of dedicated staff to handle government records. For their part, the DOPT and CIC have
issued notifications to public authorities to improve their records management systems under
the RTI Act,96 but compliance with these orders has been slow. Records management prac-
tices in most states have not been revised in decades.97 Officials mentioned that, in the past,
government offices had dedicated record keepers (or daftaris) responsible for maintaining and
managing records. The removal of this post has left a gap that has been, to date, unfilled.98
The PwC study diagnoses the problem as the absence of an “institutional mechanism in public
authorities” that focuses on the RTI Act and record-keeping guidelines.99
     In recent years, the Government of India has launched a number of high-profile initiatives
aimed at promoting the use of information and communication technology in improving gov-
ernance and service delivery. Notably, the government has set up an Office on Public Informa-
tion Infrastructure and Innovations under the PM to develop IT infrastructure to improve the
efficiency of public service-delivery systems.100
     While departments in some states have developed innovative IT solutions, these have
been mostly limited to status tracking of RTI applications. For example, at the central govern-
ment level, the DOPT has developed an online request and appeals tracking system (RTI-MIS)
for ministries and departments that enables PIOs, AAs, and CIC officers to input information
on requests, appeals, and complaints received from citizens under the RTI Act and to use the
system to generate reports and alerts. But in most departments, RTI applications continue
to be maintained in physical form, and efforts to computerize RTI records have been limited.
Most departments do not have an electronic document management system, and most PIOs
do not maintain an electronic list of RTI applications.101 Though officials in interviews spoke
of the introduction of a new file-tracking system, it is not clear to what extent the system was
being used.


4.5. MONITORING
The RTI Act requires each government ministry or department to compile information and
data on the handling of RTI requests and to submit a detailed annual report to the information
commissions. This report must detail the number of requests and appeals received by each
public authority under its jurisdiction, the number of cases in which information was rejected,
the exemptions used, fees and charges collected, and details of disciplinary action taken, and
so on. The information commissions have to submit an annual report to the central and state
governments (as the case may be) on the implementation of the law based on this report.
68                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     The central and state governments at the end of each year may table a copy of these reports
     before the houses of Parliament or the state legislature.102
         In the central government, the CIC has developed an online RTI annual returns system
     to which departments can upload information directly. Information on the number of public
     authorities that have submitted annual reports to the CIC in the past three years is not avail-
     able.103 According to data from the most recent CIC report (2007–08), 1,382 out of 1,597 public
     authorities submitted reports. The number of public authorities listed in the report also steadily
     increased from 938 in 2005–06 to 1,597 in 2007–08.104
         The DOPT, Department of Rural Development, Department of School Education and Liter-
     acy, and CPWD have been submitting reports to the CIC quite regularly. The annual reports for
     these departments can be accessed through the CIC’s system, though there are doubts about
     the accuracy and reliability of the data provided. For example, for the year 2008–09, according
     to information received in response to an RTI request, the CPWD department received 2,830
     RTI applications. For the same period, the annual returns of the Ministry of Urban Develop-
     ment—the parent ministry of the CPWD—reported a total of 2,731 cases, while data for
     2008–09 from the CIC’s annual returns system suggests 2,263. In other cases, departments sub-
     mitted incomplete data. Detailed information would be available on the number of requests
     received by a department and the various public authorities under its jurisdiction for some
     years, but in other years, only data for the department itself (or possibly no data at all) would
     be available. Thus, getting concrete data and statistics is challenging and, in most cases, infor-
     mation is not even available on the departments’ Web sites.




     5. Enforcement and Sanctions
     The RTI Act sets in place a two-stage appeals mechanism for denied requests. Internally, within
     public authorities, the law mandates the appointment of an appellate authority (a senior officer
     in a public authority) to process and handle appeals. A second appeal can be made to the
     central or state information commissions (whichever is relevant to the particular case) within
     90 days of the decision of the appellate authority.
         The information commissions are autonomous and independent government bodies set
     up at the central and state levels. Headed by a chief information commissioner who is assisted
     by up to 10 information commissioners, the commissions have broad powers and can hear
     appeals and complaints under the RTI Act, monitor the law’s implementation, impose penalties
     on PIOs, recommend disciplinary action against erring officials, and award compensation to
     applicants for any loss or detriment suffered.105
         In addition, the information commissions have been empowered to order public authorities
     to fully comply with the provisions of the RTI Act. Specifically, they may order public authori-
     ties to appoint information officers, publish specific categories of information, make informa-
     tion available in a particular form, improve records management practices, and enhance the
     training of officials in the provisions of the RTI Act.106 A major lacuna in the law is that it does
     not prescribe a time limit within which information commissions must process appeals and
     complaints. The draft RTI bill did set a time limit for processing applications, but in subsequent
     amendments to the bill, this clause was inadvertently omitted. Amending it would require par-
     liamentary action and activists are concerned that this could open up a can of worms in terms
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                    69




of allowing the introduction of other regressive amendments; further, there is no incentive for
the government to reform the law in a way that would make things more difficult for it.
     Unlike a number of other countries’ RTI laws, the Indian RTI Act provides for a maximum
penalty of Rs. 25,000 and disciplinary action against PIOs for noncompliance, enforceable by
the information commissions.107 The draft RTI bill that was originally submitted to the govern-
ment by the NAC included an additional penalty of imprisonment, but this clause was removed
in the final drafting stages to ensure that civil servants took the law in the right spirit and “did
not see it as a draconian law for paralyzing the government.”108
     In total there are 28 information commissions—the CIC and 27 state information commis-
sions. This case study focuses on the functioning of the CIC,109 which was constituted by the
central government on October 11, 2005. The procedures for deciding appeals and complaints
are laid out in the CIC (Appeals) Procedure Rules 2005 that were published on October 28,
2005.110 Headquartered in New Delhi, the CIC has been set up under the Ministry of Personnel,
Public Grievances, and Pensions and is currently headed by one chief information commis-
sioner and five information commissioners.
     The RTI Act enjoins central and state governments to provide information commissions
with the officials and employees necessary to function efficiently.111 The central government
has sanctioned a total of 116 posts to the CIC, of which, as of March 2010, 51 were filled and
65 vacant. The commission is largely staffed by government officials, as reflected in the list of
sanctioned posts (see table 2). In addition to its regular staff, certain administrative and data
entry positions in the CIC have been outsourced. Information on the training and capacity
building of CIC staff is not available.112 The shortfall in staff has been said to be a key constraint
on CIC’s performance.113
     RTI activists have also raised concerns about the selection and appointment of informa-
tion commissioners. Under the law, individuals with experience in a diversity of fields (such
as law, science, journalism, technology, management, or mass media) may be appointed as
information commissioners. But studies suggest that most information commissioners are
former bureaucrats. According to one study, of the 28 chief information commissioners initially
appointed, 23 were retired bureaucrats.114 While former bureaucrats have stronger skills and
experience in administrative matters than other citizens, this could be seen as perpetuating a
bureaucratic culture within the enforcement agencies, potentially compromising objectivity.
     The CIC is funded by the central government. Specifically, the demands for grants for the
CIC are presented to the exchequer as part of the overall budget of the Ministry of Person-
nel, Public Grievances, and Pensions. The allocations of funds and approval of expenditures
are subject to clearance from the ministry. Staff salaries are set according to government
norms, and the commission does not have the authority to create new posts or fix staff salaries.
Therefore, while the RTI Act gives the commission considerable autonomy,115 its dependence
on the central or state government for the sanctioning of budgets and staff116 goes against
the spirit of its autonomy. In its first annual report, the CIC noted that the independence and
efficient functioning of the CIC could not be guaranteed unless it was provided with financial
and administrative autonomy.117
     RTI activists have recommended that the budgets of information commissions be delinked
from any government department and be determined by the Parliament or the state assem-
bly, as the case may be. Furthermore, they have recommended that information commissions
should be autonomous and independent in their ability to create posts, hire staff, incur expen-
ditures, and so on.118

         As per information received in response to an RTI request, the annual budget of the CIC
     in 2009–10 was Rs. 1,188 lakhs while the actual expenditure incurred was Rs.1,113.79 lakhs (see
     table 3).
         The CIC maintains a monthly record of the number of cases (both appeals and complaints)
     that are received and disposed. This number has been steadily increasing, from only 703 in
     2005–06 to 22,818 in 2009–10 (see figure 1). In total, in the period 2005–10, the CIC received
     57,046 appeals and complaints, 45,283 of which were disposed. On average, the CIC disposes
     of 9,056.6 cases per year. Detailed data on the time taken to respond to appeals and com-
     plaints are not available, but it has been estimated that the average waiting time is approxi-
     mately 6.2 months.119
         Data on the number of penalties imposed, disciplinary actions recommended, and com-
     pensation awarded since 2005 are not readily available, but studies suggest that information
     commissions across the country have imposed penalties in very small numbers. The RAAG

the country, found that a total of 343 penalties had been imposed as of March 31, 2008. Of
these, 74 penalties were imposed by the CIC (figure 2); as a percentage of cases, this is quite
low. Civil society groups interviewed say this creates a culture of impunity for noncompliance
with the law.
    The 2008–09 RAAG study found that less than 2 percent of potential penalties under the
RTI Act were actually imposed by the information commissions.120 A more recent 2009–10 study
by the Public Causes Research Foundation (PCRF) estimates that the failure to impose penal-
ties has cost the Indian exchequer Rs. 86 crores. Based on its analysis of 76,813 orders passed
by 87 information commissioners across 27 states, it was determined that penalties were
imposed when information was delayed in only 1,896 out of 59,631 cases (3.17 percent).121

5.1. JUDICIAL APPEALS
The RTI Act bars lower court jurisdiction for hearing appeals and complaints related to the RTI
Act because the framers of the law were keen to ensure that it did not fall prey to problems
of delays and pendency characteristic of India’s lower courts. Thus, an independent appeal

     system was created. But because RTI is a constitutional right, interpreted by the courts as
     a fundamental right under Article 19 (1) of the Constitution, citizens can appeal to the High
     Court or Supreme Court in their writ jurisdiction if they believe their rights has been infringed.
          Consequently, the orders and decisions of the information commissions may be challenged
     in the High Courts and the Supreme Court. Detailed data on the number of first and second
     appeals that been challenged in the courts are not available.
          Anecdotal evidence from newspaper and media reports, however, indicates that a number
     of public and private authorities-private schools, stock exchanges, sports associations, and
     other organizations-have challenged the decisions of the information commissions and its cov-
     erage under the law in court.122 Additionally, there have been instances in which government
     officials have challenged penalties imposed by the CIC; in some of these cases, the courts
     have either reduced or overturned penalties while staying the CIC’s orders.123

     5.2. INFLUENCE OF STAKEHOLDERS
     RTI activists and civil society groups in India have been vocal in their demand for strong and
     independent information commissions. Since 2006, a number of studies by CSOs have tracked
     the performance of information commissions in various states.124 These studies have helped
     highlight the various implementation challenges faced by the commissions. Earlier studies
     tracking RTI in eight states (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand,
     Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand) found that state information commissions
     were constrained by the poor allocation of infrastructure, staff, and budgets.125 These findings
     have been supported by more recent assessments. In response to a nationwide survey assess-
     ing the status of RTI implementation, 75 percent of information commissions reported that
     they were not financially independent, 85 percent felt that sanctioned staff were inadequate,
     and nearly 60 percent said they did not have sufficient infrastructure.126 Civil society groups
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                            73




  BOX 1 PERFORMANCE ISSUES OF THE JUDICIARY AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
 The data available suggest that information commissions are falling into a pattern of
 regular delays and poor enforcement characteristic of a number of other enforcement
 and grievance redress agencies—notably the judiciary. The growing backlog of appeals
 and complaints in information commissions has been flagged as a major problem in the
 implementation of the law.127 A 2009 PCRF study of information commissions reports that,
 in some state information commissions, applications remain pending for more than a year.
 Activists fear that if remedial measures are not taken, information commissions will soon
 mirror the judiciary, where court cases remain pending for years.
      In 1996, the Mallimath Committee report estimated that 28 million judicial cases were
 pending across the country. Since that time, the number of pending cases has increased
 to such an extent that, by one estimate, it would take the judiciary 320 years to clear the
 backlog of 31.28 million pending cases.128 A series of government committees have cited
 shortage of staff, lack of training, and capacity building, and poor infrastructure as the
 major reasons for the delays. Judicial reforms to rectify the delays and high costs involved
 in the delivery of justice have been slow to materialize.129
     Vigilance and enforcement agencies like the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
 and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) have been characterized by similar stories of
 delays and poor enforcement measures.130 Studies suggest huge delays in audits com-
 missioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General. A lack of scrutiny and enforcement
 of audit recommendations by the legislature have also been flagged as a key issue. In
 the period 1998–99, out of a total of 1,478 audits, only 87 (5.88 percent) were selected for
 review; only 32 (2.18 percent) were finally reviewed by Parliament’s financial committees.
 Within the CVC, delays in the investigation of anticorruption cases vary from six months to
 three years. The CVC’s enforcement record is equally poor: in the period 1989–98, out of a
 total of 21,164 cases, the CVC recommended prosecution in only 517 (2 percent) cases.131
 In total, only 606 government servants lost their jobs during a 10-year period.
     In recent times, the judiciary and CVC have also been critiqued for a lack of transpar-
 ency in the selection of staff; senior appointments in both organizations have been given
 to retired Indian Administrative Service officers. The appointment of these retired bureau-
 crats to leadership positions in institutions of accountability and enforcement is seen by
 some as a concerted government effort to subvert the institutions’ autonomy. It has been
 argued that such posts act as “inter-temporal” incentives for retiring bureaucrats who—
 once in positions of authority—tow the government’s line.132 Here again, similarities with
 information commissions that have been similarly criticized by civil society groups for their
 selection and appointment processes are evident.
      In sum, the RTI Act appeals process is becoming an increasingly bureaucratic exercise
 because information commissions are unable to process appeals and complaints in a
 timely manner., reflecting a prevailing culture of delayed processing in many enforcement
 and grievance redress agencies (such as judiciary). This bureaucratic culture is also exacer-
 bated by a tendency to appoint former civil servants as information commissioners. These
 practices, in addition to the low rate of imposed penalties, raise serious questions about
 the efficacy of information commissions in enforcing the RTI Act.

     view the dependence of the commissions on government departments for the sanctioning of
     budgets and staff as a major impediment to their ability to function effectively.
         Through their continued vigilance, civil society groups have ensured that critical gaps in the
     implementation of the RTI Act at various levels are highlighted and brought into public view.
     While the extent to which these efforts have been successful in pressuring the government to
     improve implementation is not directly evident, the existence of a strong counter pressure to
     the government has certainly been beneficial.



     6. Compliance
     6.1. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
     Section 4 of the RTI Act mandates the proactive disclosure of information, but it has been
     poorly implemented. After the enactment of the law, departments did promptly upload
     Section 4 manuals on their Web sites, but efforts at routinely updating this information have
     been inadequate.
          A physical and electronic audit of government departments at the central, state, and
     district levels found that most of the Section 4 information published was incomplete and out-
     dated. For example, while 65 percent of urban public authorities had published details about
     their respective their organizations on their Web sites, only 45 percent had published PIO
     information, and only 25 percent had published information on budgets and salaries.133 More-
     over, even PIOs were often unaware of their obligation to update and upload this information:
     43 percent had no knowledge of the proactive disclosure provisions of the law. Overall, state
     government compliance with Section 4 is inadequate.134
          Smaller studies assessing the state of Section 4 compliance offer similar findings. For
     example, a 2009 survey of central and state government Web sites cited “abysmally low” com-
     pliance, varying from 28 percent among state governments, 44 percent among information
     commissions, and 58 percent among central government departments.135 Compliance levels
     appear to be even worse at the local government level. A 2009 study assessing RTI Act compli-
     ance by government offices at the taluka (local) and district levels in the state of Gujarat noted
     that a lack of availability of Section 4 information is widespread. In 94 percent of the taluka
     offices, researchers had to file formal RTI requests to get this information; in 85 percent of the
     offices, researchers were required to pay application fees.136
          Though central government departments have generally performed better, gaps still
     remain. A study of five central government ministries conducted in 2009 found that compli-
     ance was limited, with researchers facing difficulties in extracting Section 4 information. Initial
     compliance with the law was motivated by euphoria or fear; subsequently, compliance has not
     been taken seriously.137 Each of the four departments assessed under this study have separate
     RTI links on their Web sites that provide citizens with some basic information on the RTI Act, a
     listing of PIOs and AAs, fee payment modalities, and access to circulars and notifications that
     may have been issued by the department. But an analysis of the uploaded Section 4 data sug-
     gests that there are gaps in the availability of information:
      • The Department of Rural Development has developed a complex management informa-
        tion system for disclosing information under some of its schemes, but the Section 4
        information given is inadequate.138
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                75




 • The Section 4 manual uploaded by the Department of School Education and Literacy has
   not been reviewed since the RTI Act was passed. Only recently has the department issued
   a circular to officers requesting that they update Section 4 information.139
 • The CPWD has uploaded a three-page “manual” on its Web site that claims to provide
   information on Section 4, but the information is inadequate. An official in the RTI coordina-
   tion cell acknowledged that, while the PIOs/AAs list was frequently updated online, very
   little work had been done relating to Section 4.

    Basic information (the department’s functions, powers and duties of officers, acts and rules,
and the PIOs/AAs list) has been uploaded to the DOPT Web site, but key information—such
as the categories of documents held by the department, facilities available for public consul-
tation, a list of boards and councils, and details of recipients of concessions—have not been
made publicly available.
    The poor implementation of Section 4 is attributed to various factors. The PwC study
concludes that there has been inadequate planning among public authorities for implement-
ing Section 4. Under the RTI Act, it is the responsibility of the public authority as a whole to
proactively publish information, but at a departmental level there is no clarity about whether
Section 4 is the responsibility of the heads of departments or the PIOs. This lack of ownership
and of clearly defined roles and responsibilities for updating Section 4 information is consid-
ered one of the major reasons for poor performance.140
    Studies have recommended defining responsibilities within departments and incentiv-
izing proactive disclosure through institutionalized awards and penalties.141 Some civil society
groups have stated that unless there is pressure on departments from the CIC, there will be no
real motive to implement this clause effectively; PIOs and heads of departments will continue
to pass the responsibility back and forth to the other.142


6.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
Since 2005, an increasing number of citizens have filed requests for information with public
authorities in the central and state governments. While concrete data on the total number of
requests since 2005 are unavailable, the RAAG study estimates that approximately 2 million
requests were filed in the first two-and-a-half years after the passage of the law (October 2005–
March 2008).143 The findings of the PwC study are roughly similar: there were an estimated
85,000 requests in 2008 alone.
    Civil society groups think that these numbers are relatively small and reflect low levels of
awareness among large segments of the population.144 The RAAG study found that nearly
90 percent of rural applicants and 85 percent of urban applicants were male;145 the PwC survey
found that only 15 percent of the public is aware of the RTI Act.146
    Citizens aware of the law still face a number of difficulties, including a lack of information
on filing RTI requests; an inability to find PIO contact information, particularly at district and
local government levels; inconvenient submission and payment methods; and lack of assis-
tance from PIOs in submitting requests.147 Additionally, applicants often must make three or
four visits to public authorities in order to file requests; the PwC study determined that over
26 percent of applicants had to make more than three visits.148
    The “fear factor” associated with seeking information through the RTI Act—particularly
among weaker and more vulnerable sections of society—has also been identified as a major
76                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     constraint in several studies. This fear is born out of widespread reports of harassment of RTI
     applicants by officials, particularly in rural areas;149 over 40 percent of rural and 15 percent of
     urban applicants surveyed by RAAG reported experiencing harassment and threats.150 The
     problems in accessing information faced by citizens are a reflection of low levels of awareness
     and poor training and capacity building among PIOs.151 More broadly, these difficulties can be
     seen as an expression of the bureaucracy’s unwillingness to part with information.152 According
     to PwC, encouraging access to information is “one of the major change management issues”
     faced by governments at various levels.153
         Information about types of requests the manner in which they are processed is limited.
     Most requests for information have been focused on state and local levels of government
     because the bulk of public services are provided by agencies at these levels.154 In many cases,
     requests have been filed seeking improvements in the delivery of basic services (such as water,
     roads, electricity, and sanitation) and access to basic entitlements (such as ration cards, below-
     poverty-line cards, pensions, and wages).155 Citizens and CSOs have also used the law to audit
     and monitor government schemes, the public distribution system,156 and the government’s
     flagship rural employment scheme—the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaran-
     tee Scheme (MGNREGS).157

     6.2.1. Responsiveness of Line Ministries

     The RAAG study found that between 50 percent and 60 percent of information requested was
     actually received by applicants. When information was received, 40 percent of rural applicants
     and 60 percent of urban applicants reported that the information fully served the original rea-
     son for filing the application; 20 percent said it served the purpose in part. Sixty-five percent of
     respondents reported that the la w had been useful in accessing government information and
     resolving basic problems.158
         Statistics on the central government compiled by the CIC suggest a steady increase in
     RTI applications-from 24,436 in 2005–06 to 263,261 in 2007–08 (see figure 3); a relatively small
     number of these applications were rejected.
         But there are currently no data available on the types of information requests that have
     been rejected, and whether or not these rejections were legitimate. Overall, central govern-
     ment departments were quite responsive (based on RTI applications filed by the RAAG): the
     central government was successful in providing information in 81 percent of the cases.159
         In all, of the four departments analyzed, the number of RTI requests initially received was
     quite small, but all of the departments have witnessed a subsequent spike.

     6.2.2. Department of Personnel and Training

     In 2009–10, the DOPT received 6,956 requests for information (see figure 4)160 of which a
     very small number were rejected. On average, the department receives 8–10 RTI requests
     per day.161

     6.2.3. Department of Rural Development

     Despite its size, the department does not receive a great volume of RTI requests (see figure 5).162
     In 2005-06, the department received only eight RTI applications, and though that number rose to
     350 by 2009–10, it remains lower than could be expected. Officials in the department confirmed

that 90 percent of requests that come to the department relate to programs or rural develop-
ment schemes (such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadhak Yojana [PMGSY], the Indira Awas
Yojana [IAY], and the MGNREGS) that are being implemented at the state and district levels
and that are therefore transferred to the relevant departments at these levels. According to

     department officials, the MGNREGS division in the ministry receives the most RTI requests,
     especially ones related to the number of staff at different levels in the department, queries
     about salaries and benefits of officers, and so on. Available data also suggest that the depart-
     ment has not rejected a single request for information in the past five years.
         From the perspective of department officials, the RTI requests received are largely
     “unproductive,” noisome, and time-consuming, since that they usually involve the seeking
     of information related to local-level schemes.163 Officials interviewed claimed that the RTI Act
     was principally being used by people to resolve individual grievances, to settle scores, and
     to harass government departments. They complained about the vague nature of requests
     and the low fees for filing RTIs. The officials suggested that frivolous requests for information
     should not be entertained under the law. 6.2.4. Department of School Education and Literacy
     Data submitted by this department to CIC provide an insight into the number of RTI requests
     received by it:164 in 2009-10, a total of 660 RTI requests were received, of which only 3 were
     rejected (see figure 6).165 These suggest that the RTI Act has been used to seek information
     on teacher salaries and recruitment and retirement policies, probe the functioning of govern-
     ment schools, and question school enrollment policies. Kabir, a CSO that works on spread-
     ing awareness about the RTI Act, has used the law to seek specific kinds of information from
     education departments in the central and Delhi government. For example, the organization
     has filed RTI requests with the Central Board of Secondary Education (which is under the
     Department of School Education and Literacy in the central government) seeking information
     on curriculum design.166

6.2.4. Central Public Works Department

According to data submitted by the CPWD to the CIC, of the three line departments, the
CPWD processes the highest volume of requests (see figure 7); since 2007,the department
has consistently been receiving over 2,000 requests for information. It receives an average of
20–25 RTI applications per day,167 in marked contrast to the Department of Rural Development,

     which receives only 6–7 requests.168 This is not surprising, given that the CPWD provides a
     range of public services and, consequently, has greater interaction with the public. To respond
     to these requests, the CPWD has invested significant time and effort in building up the capaci-
     ties of the department to handle RTI implementation.
          To gauge the responsiveness of line ministries to the RTI, an information request was filed
     in the Department of Rural Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, and
     CPWD—three RTI requests in total; RTI requests were submitted by mail on the same date (see
     annex 1 for a sample of the RTI request). Responses were received from all three departments,
     but some responded sooner and more efficiently than others. The CPWD provided the speedi-
     est reply (7 days), followed by the Department of School Education and Literary (26 days),
     and the Department of Rural Development (31 days). The quick response from the CPWD is a
     reflection the department’s better management of RTI requests and applications.
         With regard to the quality of information given: the CPWD and the Department of School
     Education and Literacy provided partial information; the Department of Rural Development
     provided incomplete information. The Department of Rural Development provided particularly
     poor-quality information, failing to respond to a number of questions on the application. While
     the small sample of RTI requests filed is insufficient to make comprehensive assessments of
     departmental responsiveness to the law, considered with other available data, it suggests that
     departments feel compelled to respond to requests, even if they do not fully. While the quality
     and timeliness of these responses may be critiqued, the responsiveness itself is indicative of
     some degree of institutional change.



     7. The RTI Act and Accountability
     There are high expectations for the RTI Act in India. It is frequently cited in government
     speeches as landmark legislation that testifies to the government’s commitment to “promote
     transparency and accountability for fostering good governance and democracy.”169 The law,
     it is argued, grants citizens with a legal right to demand information and clarification from
     government officials for the first time and, in so doing, challenges longstanding relationships
     of power and patronage.170 Prior to the RTI Act, citizens had few opportunities to hold the gov-
     ernment accountable for its policies and actions; the law has given citizens a legal channel for
     doing this.171 The enactment of the RTI Act itself is perceived as a symbolic shift from a culture
     of secrecy to one of transparency and openness.
           There is clear evidence to suggest that the RTI Act is being used by citizens across the
     country: there are over a million requests for information citing the law every year. Studies
     acknowledge that the law has been used most often in sectors where citizens have traditionally
     had to struggle to access their rights.172 For example, an analysis of over 1,500 RTI applications,
     filed by citizens in five villages as part of a village-level RTI campaign in 2006–07, found that
     most requests were filed with departments delivering basic social services (such as ration cards,
     pensions, and other benefits). A number of civil society groups and people’s movements have
     also been actively using and promoting the law.173
           Since 2005, a number of case studies have documented and highlighted the use of the law
     in helping citizens access their basic entitlements, redress grievances related to the nonprovi-
     sion of basic services, and even expose corruption in public services.174 In many instances, the
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                  81




very act of filing an RTI application has served as a deterrent, prompting government action to
resolve the grievances of citizens.175
     Historically, social welfare and development programs in India have been associated with
reports of corruption, pilferage, and mismanagement. In particular, rural employment pro-
grams have been vulnerable to loss of funds in this way, as collusion between private con-
tractors and local politicians have led to inflated procurement bids and misappropriation of
funds.176 For example, a 2006 survey by the National Food for Work Program, conducted in
six states, unearthed instances of false muster rolls, ghost entries on muster rolls, and massive
discrepancies in the payment of minimum wages to workers.177 The lack of information about
how schemes were being implemented and how funds were being allocated and spent made
it practically impossible for citizens to uncover and check corrupt practices.

7.1. THE NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE ACT (NREGA)
For the first time, RTI has been institutionalized in the country’s largest rural employment guar-
antee scheme—the MGNREGS, which provides rural households with 100 days guaranteed
employment in public works at a minimum wage and which mandates compliance with the
provisions of the RTI Act and the proactive disclosure of all scheme-related data and informa-
tion. Specifically, information that must be disclosed includes demands for work received,
workers registered, job cards issued, funds received and spent, wage payments, and work
sanctioned.178 The law also mandates regular social audits of work and expenditures under
the scheme, including disclosure of government records and documents.179 The RTI Act has
been critical in the success of these audits, and although leakages in the scheme persist, it is
widely acknowledged that the “insistence on transparency and access to records…has helped
prevent pilferage.”180
      The RTI Act has proved to be a useful tool for citizens and civil society groups to legally
demand information on the functioning of state-sponsored rural development and welfare
programs. For example, in 2006, SabarEktaManch, an NGO in Gujarat, filed an RTI application
seeking information on the minimum wage being paid to MGNREGS workers. The information
revealed that these workers were being paid a paltry wage compared to what state mandates.
Based on this, the SabarEktaManch filed an RTI request in the Gujarat High Court, seeking to
fix irregularities in the wage payment system.181 The institutionalization of the law as well as the
social audits within the MGNREGA have brought a greater focus to issues of transparency and
accountability in the delivery of social-sector programs.

7.2. SUPPORTING THE EDUCATION OF THE POOR
Pardarshita, a Delhi-based NGO, has used the RTI Act to scrutinize the admissions process
among New Delhi’s elite public schools, many of which were allocated land at subsidized
rates by the Delhi government on the condition that they reserve 25 percent of their seats for
children from economically weaker segments of the population. In practice, few schools were
adhering to this requirement.
    In July 2004, on the petition of the NGO Social Jurist, the Delhi High Court issued an
order requiring all schools that had been allotted government land to fulfill this condition.
Pardarshita, the SatarkNagarikSangathan (SNS), and other groups filed a series of complaints
on this issue with the Directorate of Education in the Delhi government and with schools, and
82                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     then used the RTI Act to follow up on the status of the complaints. In many instances, the
     filing of such applications alone led to swift action by the schools, resulting in several poorer
     students being able to gain admission. The group continues to monitor and pursue the
     implementation of this quota; today, most schools are complying with the quota as originally
     intended.182


     7.3. OPENING UP EXAMINATION RESULTS
     JOSH, a Delhi-based NGO, has set up a youth task force that operates an RTI help-line for
     Delhi University students; it has been using the RTI Act to campaign for greater transparency at
     the university,183 addressing issues including the internal assessment system and the function-
     ing of college canteens, hostels, street lights, and roads.184
         In 2007, JOSH filed a number of RTI applications with colleges of the Delhi University,
     seeking updates on their compliance with the proactive disclosure provisions of the RTI Act.
     The lack of response spurred JOSH to take the matter up with the CIC. Under pressure from
     the CIC and JOSH, colleges were quick to disclose information through manuals on their
     Web sites.
         The information received through the RTIs revealed that colleges were not following stan-
     dard procedures for internal assessment, but after the initial disclosure of information by col-
     leges, follow-up compliance by departments has been weak. From the perspective of groups
     involved in the campaign, departments cooperated initially because of pressure from the CIC,
     but as soon as the pressure eased, they returned to the status quo.185


     7.4. PUBLIC WORKS
     In 2002, Parivartan, a Delhi-based CSO, sought information under the Delhi Right to
     Information Act 2001 for public works contracts in two East Delhi neighborhoods. A public
     hearing, or jansunwai, organized by Parivartan to audit the 68 contracts revealed massive
     corruption and embezzlement of funds in 64 of the local municipal corporation contracts
     (Municipal Corporation of Delhi).186 The investigations revealed that out of a total Rs. 13 million
     that was officially sanctioned for improving civic amenities in these localities, approximately
     Rs. 7 million worth of items did not exist.187
         Following the public hearing, Parivartan petitioned the chief minister of Delhi. In May
     2004, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi police to investigate allegations of corruption,188
     prompting the local municipal councilor to offer full transparency in public works programs in
     the area. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi agreed to a series of corrective measures, which
     included proactively displaying information about public works projects at worksites, offices,
     and in local communities.189 The court case proved less successful: the Delhi police failed to
     collect evidence years after the alleged corruption case. Parivartan has also campaigned for
     greater transparency and accountability in the management of the public distribution system
     in Delhi.190


     7.5. RATION SHOPS
     The SNS, another Delhi-based NGO, runs an information center in New Delhi to educate and
     encourage local residents to use the RTI Act for a range of issues, including pensions, primary
     and secondary school education, housing, electricity, and water supply and sanitation.
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                83




     Case studies documented by SNS track their successful record in using the law to demand
basic entitlements for slum dwellers, including access to ration cards, regular water supplies,
clean sanitation, and so on.191 In 2004, the SNS helped slum dwellers file applications under
the Delhi Right to Information Act 2001 in order to access ration shop records; they revealed
that shopkeepers were regularly siphoning rationed wheat, rice, and sugar and selling it to
fictitious ration-card holders. Sustained pressure by the SNS and its volunteers has also led to
significant improvements in the management of the public distribution system. More recently,
the SNS has been using the law to access information about the performance of elected
representatives.
     Other groups, including the Hazards Centre (a New Delhi-based CSO that works primar-
ily on issues of the urban poor), have filed RTI requests with the public works departments on
behalf of the inhabitants of resettled and unauthorized colonies, seeking information on the
provisioning of basic services in these areas.192

7.6. COMMONWEALTH GAMES
Meanwhile, in a particularly high-profile case, the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN),
another Delhi-based organization, used the RTI Act to access information on governmental
expenditures for the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG).193 Based on RTI responses from dif-
ferent departments, the HLRN found that social development funds earmarked for the poor—
to the tune of Rs. 744 crores, or $164 million—had been reallocated by the Delhi government
for the CWG.194 Following these findings, the group called for an audit and an investigation
into the diversion of funds by the Delhi and central government authorities. While the chief
minister of Delhi publicly denied that funds had been diverted,195 the matter caught the atten-
tion of parliamentarians—not only in India (where the issue was raised in both the lower and
upper houses)196—but also in the United Kingdom, where a question on the diversion of funds
was raised by a Member of Parliament in the House of Lords.197 Following the disclosure of
these and other expenditure-related discrepancies, the government ordered an official probe
and investigation into the CWG expenditures.

7.7. MEDIA
In some instances, journalists have used the RTI as a tool to collect information. Shyamlal
Yadav, an associate editor with the leading periodical India Today, has filed over 1,800 RTI
applications to gather information for his investigative stories.198 In 2008, Yadav used the RTI
Act to seek details of the foreign trips made by ministers in the UPA government. Four months
and 59 RTI applications later, Yadav found that 71 out of the 78 ministers of the UPA govern-
ment had made a total of 786 foreign trips over a three-and-a-half year period—at government
expense.199 The article raised considerable public interest and gained a lot of media attention,
eventually prompting the PM to write to the ministers asking them to curtail foreign travel
expenditures.200
     In the following year, India Today filed RTI applications with every central government min-
istry, seeking information on the foreign travel of bureaucrats, revealing that between January
2005 and April 2008, 1,576 officials of the rank of director and higher had travelled abroad for a
total of 24,458 days, at a cost of more than Rs. 56.38 crores.201
     In 2006, the media house NDTV and several newspapers (including The Hindu, The
Telegraph, and Hindustan Times) partnered with CSOs to launch the “Drive against Bribes
84                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     Campaign” and to combat corruption. The 15-day campaign sought to discourage people
     from taking bribes, using the RTI Act to access information from the government. Almost
     1,500 trained volunteers assisted people at centers in 48 cities about the law. According to
     journalist Manish Sisodhia, the campaign involved over 700 groups from across the country
     (including NGOs, resident welfare associations, students, and lawyers) and helped generate a
     buzz about RTI.202
          These examples and other case studies suggest that the RTI Act has been used in an
     innovative way by individuals and citizen groups seeking a range of information on govern-
     ment schemes, development projects, benefits, and entitlements. Audits of the MGNREGS
     have helped expose corruption in the wage payments and construction projects. Groups such
     as Parivartan and SNS have used it as a tool for the redress of grievances and as an alternate
     mechanism for the poor to access their basic rights and entitlements to ration cards, pensions,
     electricity, water connections, and so on. Meanwhile, organizations like HLRN used the law to
     expose instances of poor administration (as with the diversion of social sector funds to pay
     for CWG).
          But instances of information obtained through the RTI Act translating into direct action
     against corrupt and inefficient practices or resulting in punitive action against officials have
     been few in number. From the perspective of civil society, this is not as much a reflection of
     the law and its implementation as of the state’s weak mechanisms of horizontal accountability,
     evident in, for example, the unwillingness of judiciary bodies and law enforcement agencies to
     act on findings unearthed through the RTI Act.



     8. Conclusion
     The RAAG study concludes: “while the awareness of the importance of transparency has
     indeed increased manifold [in government], infrastructure needs to be built around it to allow
     it to work better.” Similarly, the PwC study notes a lack of adequate planning among public
     authorities to “proactively identify and address constraints in providing citizens with infor-
     mation.”203 The RAAG report also notes that “the key to increasing accountability of public
     authorities (vis-á-vis the RTI) lies in bringing about attitudinal changes” within the government
     at various levels.204
          Since the enactment of the RTI Act, civil society groups have continued to push for its
     better and more stringent implementation, remaining vigilant against any attempts to amend
     or curb it. Studies have acknowledged the key roles played by CSOs in raising awareness and
     in training and assisting the public in filing requests.205 Because of civil society’s continued
     engagement with the RTI campaign, India did not face the problem seen in other countries
     where RTI laws were passed but rarely used.
          The Indian media were early supporters of RTI, with senior journalists lending strong sup-
     port to the movement.206 They have also served as watchdogs: in 2006, when rumors of a pos-
     sible government amendment to the law opposed by the media began to circulate, the media
     opposed it. Since its passage, national newspapers have regularly featured articles relevant
     to the RTI Act. The RAAG survey of over 60 publications in English, Hindi, and other regional
     languages found that, on average, 65 news items per publication per year deal with RTI.207
     Another key finding of the RAAG survey, however, is that the Indian media rarely use the law to
     unearth stories and investigate issues.208
A CASE STUDY OF INDIA                                                                                   85




     Although the RTI campaign did receive some support from progressive bureaucrats (nota-
bly, N. C. Saxena and Harsh Mander, among others), the bureaucracy’s overall response to the
law has been ambivalent.209 Specifically, this resistance was manifest in repeated attempts to
amend the law and a lack of effort at improving the internal capacities of departments to sup-
ply information.
     In 2010, an all-India perceptions survey of over 4,000 civil servants revealed that they view
the law with trepidation. The RTI Act is perceived as curbing the discretion of government
officials who now fear recording their views on file in the event that an RTI request reveals that
these views are contrary to official rules and procedures.210 There have even been some reports
of officials recording their views on Post-It® notes rather than on files.211 Some also fear that
the law will be used to harass and blackmail them.212
     Another common concern is that departments will be inundated with a huge volume of
requests, bringing the government to a standstill. In interviews conducted with the DOPT,
Department of Rural Development, and CPWD, officials consistently made reference to frivo-
lous, vexatious, and voluminous requests for information. In 2009–10, attempts were made by
the bureaucracy to amend the RTI Act to exempt such requests. More recently, in December
2010, the DOPT mooted an amendment to restrict the number of words that could be used in
drafting an application.213
     On a day-to-day basis, resistance from government officials creates obstacles to citizens
accessing information under the law. Respondents to the 2008–09 RAAG and PwC studies (par-
ticularly those belonging to economically weaker segments of society) reported that they had
been harassed and intimidated by government officials. In some instances, this harassment
became violent, with a number of RTI activists being assaulted and even murdered in the past
few years.214 Puddephatt observes that a major challenge to the implementation of the RTI
Act is this “mindset of resistance” within public institutions, concluding that while “a moment
of political will and a concerted push by civil society” allowed for the RTI Act to pass, it is not
clear, given this resistance, the extent to which political will has translated into improved imple-
mentation outcomes.215
     It has been observed that the perpetuation of colonial laws, including the Official Secrets Act
1923, the Indian Evidence Act 1872, and the Civil Services Conduct Rules, have created an atmo-
sphere in which government confidentiality is the norm and disclosure the exception. As early
as 2006, the Second Administrative Reforms, in its second report on the RTI Act, acknowledged
that the effective implementation of the law would depend on a shift from “the prevailing culture
of secrecy to a new culture of openness.”216 While a series of government committees, including
the Fifth Pay Commission and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission, have recom-
mended amending the Official Secrets Act and other rules and procedures that restrain the dis-
closure of information, this shift has not occurred because efforts to reform the internal structures
and processes of the state—and thus facilitate the disclosure of information—remain weak.
     Politically, the RTI Act, along with the NREGA, is perceived as a major achievement of the
Congress-led UPA government. While a succession of non-Congress governments initiated
efforts to introduce the RTI Act (notably the BJP-led United Front Government that introduced
the FOI Act 2002), it was the Congress Party in 2004 that gave RTI a political impetus.217 Since
the enactment of the legislation, some political leaders, including Congress Chairperson
Sonia Gandhi, have ardently supported the RTI Act and have resisted efforts to amend the
law. But from time to time, serious questions have been raised by various factions within the
political establishment about the applicability of the law to specific areas (if, for example,
86                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




     the communications of the PM and President of India can be disclosed under the law218 and
     whether or not the judiciary is covered under it.219 Political actors have also been divided over
     the issue of RTI amendments, with some supporting them as necessary for the smooth imple-
     mentation of the law and some resisting them.220
          Citizens and the state have been said to share a client–patron relationship, in which citizens
     are perceived more as beneficiaries of state goods than as the bearers of rights. The RTI Act
     challenges this power dynamic by granting citizens the right to question the government and
     to seek information on its various activities. Alongside this shift comes an increasing focus on
     government performance evident in the development of outcome budgets and the introduc-
     tion of a new performance management system in government. Yet, on a day-to-day basis,
     it seems that government bodies continue to be bound by rules and procedures. Given this
     focus on procedures rather than outcomes, it is not surprising that the implementation of the
     RTI Act has become, as previously noted, a “check-the-box” process. In other words, there has
     been procedural compliance, but little attention given to whether or not existing systems and
     processes are able to facilitate the efficient supply of information.
          In sum, an analysis of the implementation of the RTI Act suggests mixed results. On one
     hand, there is evidence to suggest that, at various levels, the government has complied with
     the basic provisions of the law, including formulating rules and regulations, designating infor-
     mation officers, setting up information commissions, and establishing procedures for accessing
     information. Backed by civil rights groups, citizens are often using the law to demand a range
     of information from the government that has been used as the basis of campaigns demanding
     basic rights and entitlements, especially for the poor.
          But the systemic changes needed are yet to be seen. For example, departments lack suffi-
     cient budgets, manpower, and infrastructure, and they are hampered by poor records manage-
     ment practices. Moreover, the institutions set up to uphold and promote the RTI regime, such
     as information commissions, have performed poorly, as seen in the growing number of appeals
     and complaints and in the low rates of penalties.
          The RTI Act 2005 is groundbreaking legislation that commits the Indian government to an
     unprecedented degree of transparency. But research studies and our own analysis suggest that
     there have been gaps in the government’s efforts to implement the law, particularly with regard
     to bringing about systemic changes in the rules and procedures governing the disclosure of
     information. Discretionary practices remain, as does a bureaucratic focus on procedures over
     outcomes. Even so, the law’s impact on society is impossible to dismiss. Thanks to the con-
     tinued and active presence of civil society groups who continue to press the government for
     more effective implementation of the law, it is estimated that approximately 1 million people
     per year, on average, are exercising their right to information.

      5,000 citizens. See http://rti.gov.in/ rticorner/studybypwc/index-study.htm. The RAAG study was more
      extensive, covering public authorities in the central government, ten states, and the National Capital
      Territory of Delhi, with three districts in each state and eight villages in each district randomly
      selected. In total, as part of the study, 515 public authorities were surveyed across the country, 37,704
      people interviewed, and over 800 RTI applications filed with different public authorities across the
      country. See http://rti-assessment.org/exe_summ_report.pdf.

      Goetz (1999);Mander and Joshi (1999); Goetz and Jenkins (1999); and Banisar (2006).
12.   In 1975, the Supreme Court, in the case of State of UP v. Raj Narain (AIR 1975 SC 865), ruled that all
      citizens had the right to know how the government functions. A few years later, in 1982, in a
      caserelated to the disclosure of information about the transfer and nonappointment of judges, the
      Supreme Court recognized RTI as a fundamental right under the Constitution. For a detailed account
      of the constitutional development of RTI, see Mander and Joshi (1999).
13.   The MKSS was founded by Aruna Roy, a retired Indian civil servant; Nikhil Dey, a lawyer who left his
      studies in the United States to take up rural activism; and Shankar Singh, an expert in rural
      communication. For a detailed history of the MKSS and its early work, see Mander and Joshi (1999)
      and Roy and Dey (2004).
14.   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, people’s organizations—particularly those working in the
      environmental field—began to make sporadic demands for information. Concerned about the social
      and environmental impacts of development works, groups campaigning against illegal forest use,
      large dams, and mining began to demand access to records and information on government
      projects. For example, in 1988, the Narmada BachaoAndolan (Save the Narmada Movement), a major
      antidam movement, demanded access to all government documents on the construction of the
      Narmada dam and in so doing challenged the Official Secrets Act (Baviskar 2006; Singh 2007; 2009).

     17.   For example, in 1996, Harsh Mander, a divisional commissioner in Bilaspur, Madhya Pradesh, passed
           a series of executive orders giving people the right to scrutinize government records. Bureaucrats in
           the LalBahadurShastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand—the premier
           training academy of the Indian Civil Services—also lent their support to the movement and helped
           organize a national workshop on RTI at the academy in 1995 (Roy and Dey undated: 13; Mander and
           Joshi 1999).

           Maharashtra (2002), Madhya Pradesh (2003), and Jammu and Kashmir (2004). In May 1997, the need
           for a comprehensive RTI law was unanimously recognized at a conference of chief ministers held in
           New Delhi. It is not clear whether or not this conference acted as a catalyst for the enactment of RTI
           laws across other states.
     21.   In Tamil Nadu, there was no movement or civil society campaign for RTI, and the enactment of the
           law caught many civil society activists by surprise. In Karnataka the government expressed an interest
           in RTI and reached out to campaigners to seek their assistance in drafting the state law (Interview,
           Shekhar Singh, November 15, 2010).
     22.   For some background on the developments that led to the enactment of RTI laws in each state, see

           citizens to inspect files and get photocopies of files from the Ministry of Urban Development (Singh
           2010: 12).
     26.   Specifically, the law excluded a number of security and intelligence agencies from RTI coverage,
           expanded the scope of exemptions, and did not include a mechanism for independent appeals or
           for penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of the law (see Singh 2007: 44).

     32.   Section 22, RTI Act 2005.
     33.   Civil society organizations such as the NCPRI and CHRI drew upon their connections with internal
           experts to provide input on the law.
     34.   The exclusion of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is due its special status under the Indian
           Constitution. The state, however, has its own RTI law known as the Jammu and Kashmir Right to
           Information Act 2009. With the enactment of the national RTI Act, state governments have a choice
           to retain or repeal their RTI laws. While some states, such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, have
           repealed their RTI laws, in other states, notably Delhi, both laws (national and state) coexist side by
           side. When there is conflict between laws, the national law prevails (NCPRI 2007: 10).

43.   File notings are essentially the opinions and notes of civil servants on government files that sum up
      the decisions taken on a particular matter. The draft RTI bill prepared by civil society groups included
      the term “file notings” in the definition of “information.” But this was deleted by the government
      while the bill was being finalized for Parliament. The unease with the disclosure of file notings
      appears to extend to the highest levels of government; even the president of India expressed
      concerns about it to the PM in a string of official correspondence (Singh 2010: 13).

50.   The term nodal agency refers to the department of the appropriate government tasked with
      providing administrative support for the implementation of the RTI Act. The DOPT is one of three
      departments in the Ministry of Personnel, Pensions, and Public Grievances, Government of India that
      coordinates all personnel matters in the central government.
51.   Sections 26 and 27, RTI Act 2005.
52.   Specifically, the RTI division handles all policies related to the implementation and amendment of the
      RTI Act and the framing of rules, guidelines, and orders related to its implementation. It is also
      responsible for developing public awareness programs on the RTI Act.

61.   The Government of India’s “Right to Information—Information Service Portal” provides citizens with
      access to information on the PIOs and appellate authorities appointed in various ministries in the
      central government. It also provides access to the Section 4 disclosure information by these ministries
      and links to the RTI Act on their Web sites. See www.rti.gov.in/.
62.   When an RTI request is received, details of the request are manually entered into an RTI application
      register. Information regarding the name of the applicant, postal address, subject of the request,
      mode of payment, and date of receipt is recorded in the register. Once an application is thus noted,
      it is forwarded to the concerned PIO for further action. The CPWD has a very systematic procedure

114.   Such concerns were raised as early as 2005, when the information commissions were first set up. On
       the eve of the RTI Act coming into force, the NCPRI issued a press statement questioning the
       Government of India’s decision to fill CIC positions entirely with former bureaucrats. This was also to
       be the case with information commissions in other states. See PadmaparnaGhosh, “Employment

      206. Ajit Bhattarcharjea was the founder of the Press Institute of India and also a founder member of the
           NCPRI. During the campaign for RTI, the Press Institute published a number of pamphlets and
           bulletins on the campaign, including Aar Paar and the Transparency Bulletin. In addition, the press
           contacts of Aruna Roy and other NCPRI members ensured that the RTI campaign received frequent
           coverage in the newspapers.
      207. The study found that, on average, English language publications printed up to two times more RTI
           articles than Hindi or vernacular language publications. At a national level, RTI coverage was found to
           be more focused on developments around the law, whereas state newspapers tended to highlight
           citizen efforts to access information. Of particular interest to the media were stories of how the RTI
           was being used by citizens to access information from the government. In addition, important
           decisions issued by the information commissions were highlighted in the papers from time to time.

      217. It has also been noted that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Congress Party took the lead in
           enacting RTI laws in the states where it was in power (Singh 2010: 9).

219. Ironically, despite being an early supporter of the RTI movement, the judiciary has shown particular
     resistance to the RTI Act. A number of high courts across the country, most notably the Supreme
     Court, have resisted efforts to bring the judiciary under the purview of the law. In particular, there has
     been resistance to disclosing information pertaining to judges’ assets. Most recently, the former
     Supreme Court chief justice has come out in support of amendments to the law, stating the need to
     “protect the independence of the judiciary.” See V. Venkatesan 2009: www.hindu.com/fline/fl2624/

                    Implementing Right to Information
                       A Case Study of Mexico

1. Introduction and Background
In June 2002, President Vicente Fox (2000−06) signed a landmark transparency bill into law.
The Federal Transparency and Access to Public Government Information law (hereafter called
the access to information, or ATI, law), which is considered one of the most important reforms
of his administration, came into effect a year later. Article 4 of the law explicitly states that the
purposes of the law are to “increase transparency…and accountability so that citizens can
evaluate the performance of government authorities…[and to] contribute to the democratiza-
tion of Mexican society and the strengthening of the rule of law.”1
     Since then, the right of access to public information has been regulated, and a compre-
hensive information access regime has taken shape. Federal government agencies regularly
publish information on their official Web sites. The number of requests for public information
has increased consistently since 2003. Although records management remains an issue, some
federal agencies have made significant improvements in their archive systems.
     The ATI law passed in Mexico, and its implementation, offer several important les-
sons to be learned for nations seeking to increase government transparency and account-
ability. Nearly a decade since the implementation of the ATI law, Mexicans have access to
public information that was simply not available before.2 There is widespread recognition
among scholars and development practitioners that the Mexican ATI law is among the most
advanced of its kind in the world. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Federal Institute for
Access to Information (IFAI, a federal agency responsible for safeguarding the right to public
information and ruling on citizens’ appeals of denied information requests) is a milestone. At
the time, almost no other country had established a similar institution to implement the right
to access public information.3 Today, the IFAI is a well-established institution, and is widely
recognized by most citizens.4 In addition, in 2007, a reform amending Article 6 of the Con-
stitution explicitly guaranteed the right of access to information and established a minimum
benchmark that federal and state governments needed to follow in their own ATI legislation.
     In more recent years, as unemployment and public security issues have become impor-
tant,5 the focus and priority to transparency has declined.6 Several key public agencies have
received complaints for non-compliance with the IFAI’s decisions to release information (Fox
and Haight 2010b), and there have been attempts to overrule IFAI’s decisions, which are final

      by law.7 But IFAI still maintains independence and resolves most information disputes in favor
      of information requesters.8

      1.1. METHODOLOGY
      The purpose of this paper is to examine the transparency reform and its implementation in
      Mexico, which might provide lessons to other countries embarking on similar endeavors and
      contribute to expanding the knowledge base for ATI practitioners and development partners.
      This paper is mainly based on personal interviews with multiple stakeholders and a desk review
      of primary and secondary sources, and official IFAI data. A full list of individual sources con-
      sulted for this paper is in annex 1.
          As part of a larger study on the implementation of ATI laws in eight countries around the
      world, this document follows a common methodology to provide an overall assessment of key
      implementation measures and outputs from the ATI regime—in terms of proactive disclosure,
      responsiveness to requests for information, and shifts in accountability relationships. The paper
      looks at implementation in three sectors: social development, education, and public works
      (which in Mexico fall under the Secretary of Communication and Transport). These sectors
      were selected because they deliver important public services to large numbers of citizens and
      because, in most countries, they are vulnerable to corrupt practices due to the size of their
      budgets, high volume of procurements, and large number of beneficiaries.
          Additionally, the study examines the institutional arrangements within the executive
      branch. Unlike the cases of Chile, Canada, and India,9 there is no “nodal” ATI agency (that is,
      an agency responsible for the implementation of the law and its coordination throughout the
      government) in Mexico. Instead, a specialized and semi-autonomous federal agency (the IFAI)
      was created to oversee the implementation of the law. But the role of the Secretary of Public
      Function (SFP) is also examined in this study because it is responsible for public administration
      issues and for the internal control systems of the federal administration. In that capacity, the
      SFP is the federal agency responsible for the sanctioning of public officials who do not comply
      with information disclosure provisions. The SFP is also the entity in charge of the federal gov-
      ernment’s overall transparency agenda, including the implementation of international anticor-
      ruption conventions.

      1.2. STRUCTURE OF THIS PAPER
      Following this introduction, section II of this paper examines the passage and some provisions
      of the Mexican ATI law. It analyzes how the law came into effect, which stakeholders—both
      within government and within civil society—championed the law, and the context surrounding
      the law’s approval in 2002. The section also describes the main provisions of the law.
          Section III analyzes the operation of the law. It examines the organizational structure and
      new implementing measures that were introduced by the federal administration to comply
      with the law, including budgetary allocations, use of technology, records management, and
      monitoring and evaluation systems. It also analyzes in greater depth the role of the IFAI, a criti-
      cal element of the law, both for its regulatory and oversight functions. Then, it examines how
      the law has been operationalized within selected federal agencies, as mandated by the law.
      Using IFAI data, section IV analyzes achievements in the implementation of the law since 2003,
      including in usage and compliance. Section V examines the relationship between transparency
      and accountability by discussing four illustrative cases.

    Finally, section VI examines the response of federal agencies to the law after several years
of implementation. The concluding section highlights the key aspects of the Mexican experi-
ence while drawing some lessons learned.



2. Passage and Provisions of the Law
As is the case in other countries that have introduced access to information (ATI) legislation, in
Mexico the extent and scope of the law were significantly influenced by the events leading to
the passage of the legislation as well as the interplay among different stakeholders.
     In general, politicians, bureaucrats, and civil society leaders and organizations, including
the media, are the most significant stakeholders involved in the discussion and approval of ATI
laws. Although they all have different interests and incentives, when political conditions allow
for the collaboration of these stakeholders, laws tend to be broad in scope, effectively balanc-
ing confidentiality and disclosure provisions.
     In Mexico the political transition during the early 2000s and the arrival of a new generation
of public officials to the federal government, some of them coming from the same “epistemic
community”10 as civil society advocates of transparency and accountability, created a favorable
environment for the introduction of access to public information legislation. This legislation,
while progressive in scope, included important provisions to minimize potential bureaucratic
resistance.

2.1. PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION
Mexico’s political transition represented an extraordinary opportunity to introduce innovative
governance reforms.
    The election of President Vicente Fox in 2000 represented a turning point in Mexican
politics. For the first time in more than seventy years, the Partido Revolucionario Institucio-
nal (PRI), which had held the presidency without interruption since 1929, lost the election to
an opposition party, the Partido Accion Nacional (PAN), by a margin of 7 percent and with
the participation of 70 percent of the electorate.11 Capitalizing on his high levels of political
support, newly elected President Fox had strong incentives to undertake bold initiatives that
would distinguish his presidency from previous administrations and demonstrate tangible
results early on.
    In contrast to the “hyperpresidentialism” that had characterized governance in Mexico for
decades, President Fox came to office with weaker executive powers.12 He did not have control
over the lower or upper houses of Congress, and even faced strong opposition within his own
party. President Fox could not single-handedly pass legislation, or dictate public policy.
    As opposition parties began to win elections at the local and state levels in the 1990s,
the press also began to adopt a more independent and assertive position vis-à-vis the
government: journalists and media executives were increasingly unwilling to acquiesce to
government pressures or to refrain from criticizing top government officials. Paradoxically,
this political context of weaker executive powers provided the president with an unparal-
leled opportunity to introduce an ATI law. 13
    Several factors help explain the passing of the law during the Fox administration. First, this
law was able to generate wide agreement across party lines; no political party could afford to
114                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      oppose legislation promoting transparency and access to information. Second, the ATI law
      offered the president an opportunity to demonstrate his leadership skills and his commitment
      to governance issues. Third, the arrival of new actors to the federal government generated
      new and innovative channels of communication and dialogue between the government and
      civil society.14 Finally, the law also provided an opportunity to leave a lasting and symbolic
      legacy of this first PAN presidency.
           As we will discuss further below, leaders of civil society organizations (CSOs), some media
      executives, and academics had been strongly advocating in favor of regulating the right to
      information since the mid-1970s. But it was President Fox who seized the initiative and moved
      quickly to draft a bill soon after coming into office.
           In 2001 the government’s draft bill was leaked to the press,15 sparking a debate among
      the academics, media practitioners, and CSOs who had been advocating for right to infor-
      mation legislation. In May 2001, a number of media executives, journalists, and academics
      formed a loose coalition—known as the Grupo Oaxaca16—that critiqued the government’s bill
      and drafted an alternative transparency bill, lobbied members of Congress, negotiated with
      government officials, and organized conferences and public forums to disseminate information
      about the law and generate stronger bases of support, placing the topic on the public agenda.
      According to analysts, the group was able to play a prominent role because it moved away
      from mere criticism of the government’s bill and adopted a more proactive position (Luna Pla
      2009: 86).
           This level of political engagement by CSOs, academics, and the media was not completely
      unprecedented in Mexico. In fact, Mexico had a strong network of CSOs that, since the 1970s,
      had been advocating for free elections, and which played a critical role in the adoption of a
      series of electoral reforms (Middlebrook, Cook, and Molinar 1994). After the first major elec-
      toral reform in 1977, successive reforms eventually led to the establishment of an autonomous
      federal electoral institution in 1990—the Federal Electoral Institute (Instituto Federal Electoral,
      IFE)17—and to the organization of free and transparent elections. Indeed, the IFE became an
      important precedent and model for the establishment of the Federal Institute for Access to
      Information (IFAI) in 2002.
           In the case of the ATI law, the political context generated a favorable environment not only
      for the collaboration of government officials and civil society, but also for cooperation between
      the media and academics in the promotion of an ATI law.18 In fact, the bill that the executive
      finally presented to Congress included many of the changes proposed by the Grupo Oaxaca.19
      Since legislators wanted to discuss other changes before voting on the law, they invited several
      members of the Grupo Oaxaca to participate in the legislative discussion of the bill.20 Once the
      Fox administration took the initiative in formulating a law, together with key technical experts
      from government, the legislators and Grupo Oaxaca became key actors in the final draft-
      ing and passing of the ATI law. In April 2002 Congress approved the bill unanimously. A few
      months later, the Grupo Oaxaca decided to dissolve.
           The law was able to amalgamate a diverse coalition of support. While it was not the result
      of a broad-based social movement as in the case of India (Fox, García Jiménez, and Haight
      2009) it was backed by a diverse coalition of actors. For the first time in decades, different—
      and competing—political groups (PAN, Partido de la Revolución Democrática [PRD], and PRI)
      that held divergent positions and had not been able to agree on major public policy reforms
      in the past, came together to promote greater transparency and access to public information.
      For the Fox administration, the transparency law promised to be a powerful tool to reveal past
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                               115




mismanagement and corruption cases; for the opposition parties, on the other hand, the law
promised to be an important mechanism for scrutinizing public officials and keeping the new
government in check.
    For the academic community, pushing for a strong law was an opportunity to overcome
ideological differences and to collaborate with a diverse array of national and international
CSOs, all sharing a common interest in being better informed about government deci-
sions and actions.21 And for the media, particularly the two leading national newspapers that
championed the law—Reforma and El Universal—support of the ATI law was motivated by the
need to assert a more independent position (Michener 2010: 22). Furthermore, by supporting
a broader coalition in support of ATI reform, these two newspapers were able to demonstrate
that ATI went far and beyond being a mere “media issue.” Finally, support for the law also
offered an unprecedented opportunity to shed the press’s traditional reputation of submissive-
ness toward the government (Bertoni 2011: 11).
    The passage of the ATI law indeed represents a distinctive moment in Mexican politics.
Over the past decade, no other reform initiative has been able to gather the level of political
support achieved by this law.22


2.2. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE LAW
Strong consensus exists among scholars and development practitioners that the Mexican
transparency law is well formulated and includes progressive provisions (Doyle 2002; Sobel
and others 2006) that serve as models for similar legislation the world over. The Grupo Oaxaca
played a critical role in shaping the text of the law, and helping eliminate a series of loopholes
and exemptions included in previous draft bills.
    Article 2 of the law states that information in possession of the state is public and that the
government should follow the standard of “maximum disclosure” when responding to infor-
mation requests. In Mexico, these provisions were indeed groundbreaking.
    Like any other law, the ATI law was the product of negotiation among different stakehold-
ers with particular incentives and interests. While the Fox administration championed the law,
support for it was not homogeneous within the administration. The greatest concerns, accord-
ing to government officials interviewed for this study, came from the armed forces, attorney
general’s office, and secretary of finance. The law thus included provisions to reserve informa-
tion based on national security concerns to prevent opposition, if not to gain support, from the
armed forces. The secretary of finance raised concerns about the costs of implementation. To
address this issue, a transitory article was introduced in the law stipulating that no additional
resources would be assigned to federal agencies. The final version of the law embodies what
was politically possible at the time it was introduced, and reflects the bargaining power and
interests of different stakeholders.
    The most important provisions of the law include:
 • Procedures for accessing information. The law guarantees (Article 40) universal access by
   explicitly stating that “any person,” regardless of citizenship, can request public informa-
   tion without any requirement to either reveal his or her identity or justify the reason for
   the request.23 Information requests are free; the government may only charge citizens the
   costs of document reproduction and shipment. The government has 20 days to respond
   to a public information request and the deadline can be extended for another 20 days in
   exceptional cases.
116                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      • Proactive disclosure. Article 7 establishes a list of relevant and useful information that
        federal government agencies need to proactively release to the public, including informa-
        tion about their functions and services; salaries of public officials; budget allocations;
        and concessions, subsidies, permits, procurement contracts, and results of audit reports.
        The law also establishes that the questions most frequently asked by the public should
        be considered in the list of relevant public information to be disclosed proactively. It also
        establishes that information should be disclosed in a timely fashion, and that information
        should be reliable, truthful, and presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend.24
      • Exemptions. The law establishes that information in possession of the state is public; it can
        be reserved for a maximum of 12 years. This deadline can be extended as many times as
        needed provided the persistence of the causes that account for the classification of informa-
        tion in the first place. Classification requires proof of potential harm, and the law leaves the
        onus of proof on the government body that denies the requested information. Information
        related to human rights violations cannot be reserved. Partial disclosure is allowed.
      • Scope of coverage. The transparency law applies to all three branches of government—
        the executive, legislative, and judiciary—as well as to the so-called “constitutional autono-
        mous agencies” such as the IFE, Bank of Mexico, National University (UNAM), and National
        Human Rights Commission (CNDH). Yet, only federal executive agencies are bound by the
        law’s implementation mechanisms and thus fall within the IFAI’s jurisdiction. The congress,
        the judiciary, and the constitutional autonomous agencies are compelled by the law to
        design their own internal regulations and mechanisms to respond to information requests
        and to comply with the law.
            The law excludes unions, political parties, and subnational governments from the
        transparency law. Parties and unions are national publicly funded organizations that are
        not explicitly subjected to the law. This exclusion appears to be a major concession given
        to legislators in exchange of supporting and passing the law within the government’s time
        limits. Another important limitation is the definition of the law as a federal—rather than
        general—law, which would have had wider implementation implications for all levels of
        government. The ATI law only binds government entities at the federal level. According to
        the Mexican federal system, States are responsible for passing their own ATI laws. Indeed,
        the biggest challenges to transparency and access to information in Mexico today are
        found at the state level.25
      • Appeals mechanism and oversight institution. The most innovative provision in the ATI
        law is the creation of the IFAI, an institution designed to serve as an intermediary between
        citizens and government agencies and tasked with guaranteeing the right of access to
        public information. 26
             The IFAI acts as an administrative court and oversees the ATI law procedures. Citizens
        can appeal a federal agency’s decision not to release public information or a response
        considered incomplete and/or unsatisfactory. The IFAI’s decisions are binding and defini-
        tive for all federal agencies covered under the law. Federal officials cannot appeal the IFAI’s
        rulings. Citizens, however, can resort to the federal courts to appeal an IFAI decision. The
        IFAI has 50 days to issue a resolution to an appeal.
             Unlike other countries where information disputes are resolved in the courts, in Mexico,
        where the justice system is perceived as slow and costly, the establishment of the IFAI pro-
        vided an alternative and more expedient mechanism to solve ATI disputes.27 The appeals
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                               117




   process is straightforward; citizens do not need to hire lawyers to appeal a federal agency’s
   decision.
       There are precedents for establishing specialized autonomous institutions to arbitrate
   in sensitive matters in Mexico, such as elections and human rights. For example, in 1990,
   as opposition to the ruling PRI strengthened and demand for clean elections increased,
   the IFE was established as a constitutionally autonomous body responsible for organiz-
   ing elections and guaranteeing they were conducted freely and fairly.28 Since the IFAI’s
   establishment in 2002, two former IFE commissioners have been appointed to serve as
   commissioners to the IFAI, and several former IFE staff members have also served in key
   IFAI positions.
 • Enforcement mechanism. While the IFAI’s decisions are binding, it does not have sanc-
   tioning powers, and thus, it has limited enforcement capacity. In the event a federal agency
   does not comply with a resolution by the IFAI, the most the IFAI can do is to inform the
   SFP, the entity responsible for disciplining the federal public servants. The lack of sanction-
   ing powers is considered to be one of the major weaknesses of the IFAI.29




3. How Operational is the Law? Organizational
Structure and Established Implementation
Measures
This section focuses on the implementation of the law. First, it examines the supply side of
implementation through an analysis of the formal institutions and the mechanisms that were
established for requesting information. It then examines the demand side of implementation
through an analysis of the use of the law.

3.1. IMPLEMENTING RULES AND STRUCTURES
Title II of the law established, in general terms, the mechanisms that needed to be set up
inside each federal agency to respond to information requests and to help the public seeking
assistance, including guidance on how to refine a request for information or where to direct
a specific request. More specific and detailed implementation provisions were defined in the
law’s implementing regulations, drafted by the Federal Commission for Regulatory Reform
(Comision Federal de Mejora Regulatoria) in 2003.
     Both the law and the implementing regulations direct each federal agency to set up a
liaison unit (unidad de enlace, which is responsible for handling information requests and
for uploading public information on the agencies’ Web sites), and an information committee
(Comité de Información, a collegial body responsible for reviewing decisions about classifica-
tion of information inside each agency as well as reviewing the agency’s responses to informa-
tion requests, including those related to nonexistent information).
     While each federal agency is responsible for appointing as many staff as it deems neces-
sary to the liaison units, the information committees have to be integrated with at least three
public officials: the head of the liaison unit, another official named by the head of the agency,
and the internal control officer, who is functionally accountable to the Secretary of the Public
Function (SFP) due to its internal control role within federal public administration.
118                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          In addition, the implementing regulations also mandate federal agencies to provide a
      physical space inside their agencies, and assign personnel to help citizens requesting assis-
      tance on how to search the agency’s Web site and/or make a public information request.
          A transitory clause in the law allowed federal agencies to take six months to establish the
      required infrastructure to comply with the law. Citizens could only begin to place information
      requests starting in 2003, a full year after the law was signed by President Fox. This provi-
      sion, however, also explicitly stated that the “conformation of these structures…had to be
      conducted with the existing material, human and financial resources” and that no additional
      resources would be allocated for this purpose.
          Setting up these structures across over 200 federal agencies involved the training
      of thousands of federal public officials. The Federal Institute for Access to Information
      (IFAI), together with the SFP, became the two main entities at the federal level responsible
      for training.


      3.2. COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH
      Right after the IFAI’s commissioners were appointed—and before mid-June 2003, when citi-
      zens could begin to make information requests—the IFAI identified key areas for the imple-
      mentation of the law, including a communications and public outreach component to explain
      the contents of the law, communicate its relevance, generate public support, and minimize
      resistance to its effective implementation within different government agencies.
           The IFAI’s initial work plan had four main pillars: (i) to promote the law within all govern-
      ment agencies, persuade federal officials of the benefits of the law, and provide training; (ii) to
      work at the state level to disseminate information about the law throughout the country and
      persuade governors to pass similar laws in their states; (iii) to work with the media and civil
      society organizations (CSOs) and to disseminate information about the law and encourage
      citizens to make information requests; and (iv) to promote Mexico’s experience in the interna-
      tional arena.
           Since 2002, the IFAI has continued to play a key role in communicating and publishing
      information about the law; collaborating with media, academia, and civil society in awareness
      raising and research; and organizing forums and international conferences to disseminate
      information about the Mexican experience and exchange knowledge on international good
      practices and lessons learned.

      3.3. SPECIALIZED AGENCY OVERSEEING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ATI LAW
      As argued above, the most important mechanism established in the law was the creation of a
      separate federal agency—the Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI)—with opera-
      tional independence and responsible for overseeing the law. The IFAI is a collegial body with
      collective decision-making structures that entail debate and deliberation among commission-
      ers.30 It is led by five commissioners named by the president, subject to no-objection by the
      senate. The commissioners serve for a period of seven years and are appointed in a staggered
      manner. One of the commissioners is designated as the IFAI’s president by his or her peers for
      a two-year period.31
          Article 37 of the Federal Transparency and Access to Public Government Information
      law (here called the access to information, or ATI, law) establishes the IFAI’s responsibilities.
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                                 119




The main responsibilities include: promoting and disseminating the right of access to public
information, resolving public information denials by federal government agencies, protecting
personal data in control of the government, and overseeing the federal government’s compli-
ance with the ATI law.
     The law assigns the IFAI other functions, too,32 which some experts interviewed for this
study consider too demanding for the institute’s budget and personnel.33 For instance, it has
a regulatory function, establishing and revising classification criteria and protecting personal
data; a training function, enhancing the capacity of public officials to comply with the law and
use information technology to receive and respond to information requests; and an education
function, elaborating and publishing studies on the implementation of the law, organizing pub-
lic forums for the discussion of topics related to ATI, and collaborating with other government
and academic institutions to promote the right of access to public information.
     In 2010 after the passage of the Federal Law of Personal Data Protection held by Private
Entities, the IFAI’s functions further expanded, giving the institute the responsibility to guar-
antee and oversee compliance with the new law, provide guidelines for the protection of per-
sonal data held by private entities, and resolve disputes about personal data protection within
the entire national territory.34
     From the outset, the IFAI was provided with sufficient financial resources35 (see budget sec-
tion below). Although the IFAI does not enjoy constitutional autonomy like the Human Rights
Commission or the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE)—and thus, it does not negotiate its budget
directly with Congress, but rather presents it to the finance secretary, which in turn presents the
federal budget to Congress—it does have budgetary and operational autonomy.
     As part of its semi-autonomy, the IFAI was granted full authority and independence in its
internal organizational structure and operation procedures, including its employment and
personnel management policies.
     The IFAI’s personnel policy has been of particular importance for its effective functioning. It
has granted the IFAI greater independence in hiring its own personnel, which has precluded its
early bureaucratization.36 Since 2003 the IFAI has been able to recruit a highly competent tech-
nical staff—most with college degrees. Despite some rotation of the IFAI’s officials, well-trained
and technically sophisticated staff continues in the agency. This has given the IFAI sufficient
institutional continuity and stability to operate, despite disagreements among commissioners
or controversies over some of its rulings.37
     In addition to allocating adequate financial resources and granting the institute autonomy
over is operations, the independence of the IFAI was guaranteed through the appointment
of qualified commissioners.38 Some recent appointments have been criticized in the media,
leading to calls for a stronger system of checks and balances over the appointment process.39
Disagreements between Commissioners on issues such as the nature of the relationship with
government officials and CSOs have also been challenging for IFAI. As the number of appeals
to IFAI increase, effectiveness and efficiency might also become challenging. 40
     IFAI has tended to rely on informal contacts with government to ensure greater col-
laboration, particularly useful since IFAI lacks the enforcement powers to sanction officials
who do not comply with its resolutions. Once the IFAI determines that the information
in question should be released, it will try to work directly with the agency to “encourage
compliance with the mandate, using the informal powers of persuasion” (Fox and Haight
2010b: 153).

      3.4. ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
      The Secretaría de la Función Pública (Secretary of Public Function, SFP) is the federal
      agency responsible for coordinating the government’s internal control systems throughout
      the federal administration. As part of this responsibility, the SFP has the sole authority to
      investigate and discipline federal public officials for violation of administrative procedures.
      In cases of corruption or other criminal behavior, the SFP is obliged to turn the case over to
      the attorney general’s office for a criminal investigation and/or prosecution. Public officials
      who refuse to comply with the IFAI’s resolutions can only be disciplined and/or sanctioned
      by the SFP.
          The SFP is also the federal agency in charge of “formulating and guiding the federal
      government’s policy on transparency and accountability.” Unlike other countries in the region,
      in Mexico there is no anticorruption commission or agency.41 The SFP is the institution respon-
      sible for anticorruption policies and regulations throughout the federal administration. It is in
      this general area of transparency and accountability that the responsibilities and functions of
      the IFAI and SFP intersect and, in some cases, even overlap.
          A good working relationship between the IFAI and SFP is crucial for the effective imple-
      mentation of the transparency law. When public officials refuse to comply with the IFAI’s
      resolutions, the institute’s attributions are limited to reporting these officials to the SFP and
      to recommending that they be sanctioned. The effectiveness of this measure depends on
      the readiness of the SFP to effectively sanction non-complying officials. Yet, the IFAI uses this
      measure only as a last resort, preferring instead to negotiate with government authorities and
      persuade them to comply.
          During the first years after the establishment of the IFAI, the institute and SFP had a col-
      laborative working relationship.42 IFAI’s commissioners worked with the SFP’s staff to develop
      an electronic information request and response platform (the SISI or Sistema Informatizado
      de Solicitudes de Información). This electronic system was highly instrumental in the effective
      implementation of the new law. By 2005 the SFP’s secretary decided to hand over to the IFAI
      the management and operation of SISI.
          SFP also helped set up liaison units and information committees within all federal
      agencies, and internal control officers in each federal agency, who are part of the agency’s
      information committee, report to the SFP, rather than to the head of the agency where
      they work. The inclusion of the internal control officer in the information committee was
      purposely designed to increase the incentives of federal officials to comply with the law, as
      the internal control officer is the one responsible for supervising the compliance of federal
      public officials.
          The arrangements, however, show that the lack of clear guidelines can be challenging.
      The SFP, for example, published a “Transparency Manual” for the federal administration that
      appears to overlap with the IFAI’s transparency guidelines previously issued to all federal agen-
      cies. Although SPF has taken several measures to promote the law, it has also faced appeals
      for non-compliance to information requests.
          Over the past few years, the relationship between the IFAI and SFP has changed. Accord-
      ing to Fox and Haight, notably the SFP itself is one of the agencies against which most
      complaints for noncompliance with the IFAI resolutions have been filed (Fox and Haight
      2010b: 153).
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                                121




3.5. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES: SELECTED LINE MINISTRIES
As stated above, each federal agency is required to establish a liaison unit and an informa-
tion committee to handle information requests. Depending on the number of requests
each agency receives, it can appoint as many staff as needed to its liaison unit. For instance,
the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Social Security Institute, the federal agency with
the highest number of information requests—many of which are requests for personal
data), has appointed a significant number of officials to its liaison unit and made substan-
tial improvements in its own records management system to respond to the volume of
information requests.
     To date, no in-depth studies exist on the operationalization of the ATI law within particu-
lar federal government agencies. But interviews with staff of the liaison units and information
committees in three federal agencies included in this study shed some light on the organiza-
tional arrangements for the implementation of the law.
     Once a request is received, the liaison unit coordinates the search for the requested
information. First, it contacts the head of the unit responsible for that issue. If the head of the
unit states that the information should not be disclosed, it directs the request to the agency’s
information committee. The committee then reviews the request and decides—following the
IFAI’s guidelines for classification of information—whether or not the information is public and
should be disclosed. That decision goes back to the head of the unit and its liaison unit, who
post the agency’s response on the e-platform system (previously known as SISI, and now called
INFOMEX—see section III.I)
     In practice though, there is variation in the agencies’ actual handling of information
requests, including the extent of involvement of the head of the agency in decisions over the
disclosure of information. There is also variation in the agencies’ proclivity to disclose informa-
tion and to comply with proactive disclosure provisions. That depends, in large part, on the
agency’s own leadership and organizational culture.43 Both the IFAI and SFP are quite limited in
their direct capacity to influence the performance of liaison units and information committees,
and no network exists to allow liaison units in different agencies to share their experiences and
learn from one another.
     In the case of the secretary of education, the secretary of social development, and the
secretary of communication and transportation, which are examined in this study, there is
important variation in the management and processing of information requests. The number
of personnel, their background, and resources assigned to the liaison units and information
committees vary across these three federal agencies.
     In the secretary of education, an agency that receives one of the largest numbers of
information requests per year, the liaison unit has a total of less than 10 staff members. But as
education in Mexico is decentralized, a large proportion of public information is managed at
the state level, beyond the IFAI’s reach. The secretary of communication and transportation,
on the other hand, is a centralized agency with over 10 staff working in its liaison unit. Finally,
the secretary of social development has only four staff members in its liaison unit, yet has a
liaison unit for each of its programs. The conditional cash-transfer program Oportunidades, for
instance, not only has its own liaison unit, but a specific citizen attention window through which
most of the information requests and complaints are managed (Fox and Haight 2010b: 157;
Hevia and Gruenberg 2010. Fox, Haight, and Palmer-Rubin 2011). This could explain why this
122                                            RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      secretary is among the federal agencies with the smallest number of information requests even
      though it manages important social programs that benefit millions of citizens.
          Beyond the number of personnel assigned to each liaison unit, leadership commitment can
      be evaluated by the profile that liaison units are given within the agency, the reporting lines
      of authority inside the agency (to whom liaison units report), and the engagement of high-
      level officials in the liaison units and information committees. For example, in the secretary of
      education, the secretary44 appointed one of his closest collaborators and a high-ranking official
      to the information committee. Moreover, according to the agency’s head of the liaison unit,
      the secretary has devoted important resources to train the secretary’s large bureaucracy (the
      secretary of education is one of the largest federal agencies in the country). Similarly, in the
      secretary of social development, the agency’s general counsel is a member of the information
      committee. In contrast, in the secretary of communication and transportation, the liaison unit
      appears to be far removed from the agency’s top leadership. This is a subtle yet telling indica-
      tor of the importance given to ATI and transparency within the agency.45

      3.6. BUDGET
      The level of government commitment to ATI legislation can be analyzed by examining the
      amount of resources devoted to its implementation. In Mexico, the effective implementation
      of the ATI law required the allocation of sufficient financial resources. Specifically, it entailed
      the funding of three distinct functions: (i) responding to information requests and appeals,
      (ii) complying with proactive disclosure provisions, and (iii) setting up and managing the IFAI.
      But the law only acknowledged—and did not guarantee—funding for the IFAI; all federal
      agencies were obliged to comply with the law using existing resources and personnel.
            The IFAI has to submit its budget through the secretary of finance every year, and while no
      guarantees exist that it will be adequately funded every year, the IFAI has indeed received suf-
      ficient financial resources to operate since its creation in 2002.
            In 2003 the IFAI was allocated $17.9 million; in 2009 its budget increased to $22.4 million,
      and in 2011 to $38.1 million,46 a substantial increase to allow the institute to comply with its
      additional responsibilities resulting from the 2010 Federal Law on the Protection of Personal
      Data held by Private Entities. Thus the IFAI is mandated with the protection and safeguarding
      of personal data, whether these data are managed by public or private entities.
            According to the IFAI’s data, on average, close to 65 percent of the IFAI’s budget is allocated
      to personnel compensation and benefits. By 2010 the IFAI had a staff of 256 employees. As a
      result of the Law of Personal Data Protection held by Private Entities, the IFAI estimated that it
      would need to increase its staff to 430 by 2012 to fulfill the institute’s new responsibilities.47 Of the
      budget, 13.5 percent is allocated to general services (rental payments, operation and mainte-
      nance of technical equipment, and postal and utility services); 6.8 percent to advisory services
      and research assistance; 5.6 percent to public communication; 3.8 percent to information tech-
      nology; and the rest to conferences, publications, travel, office furniture, and materials.48
            Aside from the budgetary allocations to the IFAI, it is difficult to estimate the actual costs of
      implementing the ATI law in Mexico, since there are no specific line items devoted to it in the
      federal budget. Each federal agency devotes different amounts of resources and personnel to
      comply with the law, depending in large part on the volume of information requests received.

                                                              minimally affected by complying with
                                                              the law. “For most agencies, imple-
menting an ATI law is possible by diverting existing assets, and as such, is a matter of people,
not equipment” (Hernández-Valdéz 2009: 18). Moreover, the study also reveals that relatively
few additional personnel are required to respond to information requests.
     According to Alfonso Hernández Valdéz report, in 2007, in small agencies it took only one
full-time staff member to respond to all information requests received, on average; in medium-
sized agencies, the number rose to 2.5 full-time personnel; and in large agencies the number
was 25 (it must be noted that these agencies employ thousands of employees). When the
total costs (personnel and equipment) are taken into consideration, the costs of implementing
the ATI law are negligible compared to what governments spend on publicizing their activi-
ties (Hernández-Valdéz 2009: 31). In sum, implementing ATI legislation does not appear to be
that costly after all. This conclusion is shared by a study examining budgetary allocations for
all federal proaccountability institutions (Cejudo and Sour 2007). This study demonstrates that
the IFAI accounts for only 0.012 percent of all federal expenditures. More importantly, in 2006,
the IFAI accounted for only 0.53 percent of all expenditures of the institutions responsible
for accountability at the federal level. The IFE, in contrast, accounted for 26.7 percent of all
expenditures.49

3.7. TRAINING
The IFAI trains federal government officials on a routine basis to ensure adequate knowledge
of the law and relevant tools. Such training is especially important given the high levels of staff
rotation in federal agencies’ liaison units. Between 2003 and 2011, the IFAI trained over 83,000
federal government officials,50 from which 61,483 were trained through e-FAI, between 2006
and 2011.51 e-FAI is an online course developed by the IFAI for all federal government officials
in 2006.
    The training course consists of seven modules on transparency and access to information,
including modules on the law and its implementing regulations; access to and protection of
personal data; organization and conservation of archives; INFOMEX; and how to assist citizens
who approach the agency to request information.
124                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          Finally, some federal agencies have also trained their own personnel, as they have
      designed their own internal mechanisms to more efficiently handle information requests,
      including by reorganization their data storage and records management systems.52

      3.8. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
      The most significant organizational challenge throughout the federal public administration is
      the absence of an adequate and reliable infrastructure for managing, processing, and storing
      information. Public servants are not used to keeping records, sharing information, coordinat-
      ing among different units, or even documenting their activities. Furthermore, Mexico lacks
      adequately trained personnel in archival development.53
           Article 32 of the ATI law establishes that “the National Archive, in collaboration with the
      IFAI, will define criteria for cataloging, classifying and preserving administrative documents.”
      The same article also states that these two institutions will issue guidelines for the organiza-
      tion of archives in all federal government agencies, following international standards and good
      practices.
           Coordination and collaboration between the National Archives and IFAI has faced chal-
      lenges, in large part because the lines of responsibility of each entity have not been clearly
      defined, and because the National Archives is still governed by dated regulation that refers to
      the preservation of historic records, not the management of administrative documents. None-
      theless, since the approval of the ATI law in 2002, some regulations have been issued for the
      preservation and management of administrative records, and a new records law was adopted
      in 2012.54
           In 2004, the IFAI and the National Archives issued the “General Guidelines for the Orga-
      nization and Conservation of Archives in Federal Government Agencies.” In 2007 the Con-
      stitutional amendment of Article 6 further mandated each of the three levels of government
      (federal, state, and local) “to preserve its documents in updated administrative archives”
      (Cejudo 2009). This constitutional mandate is vital to the principle of maximum disclosure con-
      tained in the ATI law: without updated and reliable records, there is no guarantee that citizens
      can effectively gain access to public information.
           Yet, in most government agencies, existing information is still dispersed and/or incom-
      plete. One office might not have access to information developed by another office within
      the same agency and, frequently, information simply does not exist. Because responding to
      information requests requires—first and foremost—that one possesses the requested infor-
      mation, the absence of records actually gives government officials with limited commitment
      to transparency and access to information an excuse to deny information requests. As shown
      in table 2, throughout the years of implementation, a recurrent reason for denying informa-
      tion requests is that the information does not exist. Out of the total number of responses, the
      absence of information grew from 4.2 percent in 2006, to 6.1 percent in 2011, peaking in 2008,
      when it reached 8 percent.55
           While records management continues to be a weakness, some important efforts have
      already been introduced to organize public records in the federal government, particularly in
      those agencies that receive the largest number of information requests per year. The reorgani-
      zation effort began with the most current records, and priority was given to those documents
      that were most frequently requested.

    While much remains to be done in this area, one of the main lessons from the Mexican
experience is that it is not necessary to have a full records management infrastructure before
implementing an ATI law; much can be accomplished with a sustained incremental approach.
In other words, lack of records management systems should be no excuse for preventing the
adoption and implementation of access to information laws. Despite records management sys-
tem constraints, the administration saw an opportunity for passing the law in 2002, and felt that
the law could, in fact, become an incentive to motivate federal officials to introduce modern
information management systems.56

3.9. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The development of an e-platform—the SISI, System for Information Requests—to handle
information requests was one of the key innovations introduced by the IFAI.57 This e-platform
(the expanded version of which was renamed INFOMEX) both facilitated users’ ability to make
information requests, and allowed the IFAI to keep track of government agencies’ responses to
information requests and supervise their compliance with the law.58
     The Constitutional Amendment of Article 6 further required all government entities and
municipalities larger than 70,000 inhabitants to install electronic systems so that all citizens
could place information requests.59
     Requests to federal agencies can be placed electronically, and responses can also be pro-
vided electronically. The current system allows government officials to communicate with the
user, clarify the request, or assist the user in refining his or her search. Users not satisfied with
the official response can—through INFOMEX—turn to the IFAI for an appeal of their request.
     The IFAI also developed a search engine called ZOOM that allows commissioners, govern-
ment officials, and users to find resolutions by topic, agency, or date. This systematization of
rulings enables the IFAI to develop interpretative guidelines based on precedent, using previ-
ous rulings as examples in similar cases. Similarly, users and government agencies can use the
search engine to build their cases.
126                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          INFOMEX, ZOOM, and the Transparency Portal (more information on this portal in sec-
      tion III.J) have been successfully introduced and internalized by all federal agencies. In terms
      of technological infrastructure, the federal government’s capacity to respond to information
      requests is well established.
          Use of electronic requests and introduction of innovative information technologies has
      been largely responsible for the successful implementation of the law in Mexico. It allows
      individuals making requests to communicate with the government on a regular basis, and the
      oversight agency to supervise and keep track of agencies’ performance and compliance with
      the law.

      3.10. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
      The transparency law includes extensive proactive disclosure provisions. These meet an
      emerging international minimum standard on the types of information that should be included
      in proactive disclosure provisions.60 Article 7 lists the information that federal government
      agencies are required to post on their Web sites. To comply with these provisions and make
      the formats for posting information uniform, the IFAI designed a central Web portal called
      Portal de Transparencia or POT (Transparency Portal). Each government agency is required to
      set a Web link to the POT on their Web sites. Although some government officials complain
      that uploading information can be sometimes challenging, and some civil society practitioners
      argue that POT is not always user friendly, it has significantly helped in the verification of com-
      pliance with proactive disclosure provisions.
          To monitor federal agencies’ compliance with proactive disclosure provisions, the IFAI had
      designed a methodology to evaluate the federal agencies’ Web-based Transparency Portals.
      According to the IFAI, in 2004 federal government agencies scored, on average, 63 percent
      on their rate of compliance with proactive disclosure provisions. By 2011 this rate increased
      substantially, reaching an average of more than 85 percent.61
          In 2011, the compliance rates of the federal agencies studied more closely in this report
      were as follows: the secretary of social development had a 78.58 percent compliance rate;62
      the secretary of education, 90.2 percent; the secretary of public function, 80.5 percent; and the
      secretary of communications and transport, 77.8 percent.63

      3.11. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
      The IFAI evaluates periodically the extent to which federal agencies comply with the obliga-
      tions of the ATI Law. INFOMEX, ZOOM, and POT have generated an impressive volume
      of statistical information that not only allows the IFAI to keep track of all federal agencies’
      compliance, but also to analyze data, evaluate trends, and make recommendations to improve
      federal agencies’ performance.
          Federal agencies have incentives to comply with the transparency law because their
      response to information requests is permanently monitored by the IFAI. Through INFOMEX,
      the IFAI keeps track of all information requests received by each agency, the time the agency
      takes to respond, and the number of requests that are appealed to the IFAI. Moreover, heads
      of agencies have an incentive to be well evaluated, as the IFAI’s evaluations are public. No
      agency wants to be listed as a poor performer.
          The IFAI has developed monitoring indicators to assess the extent to which federal
      agencies fulfill the procedures established in the law and provide responses to information
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                               127




requests, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the classification of information. Different
methodologies are used to assess compliance and analyze the state of access to information
in Mexico.64 For example, quantitative and qualitative analyses have been conducted on the
responses provided through INFOMEX and the quality of services provided by the liaison
units. Another strategy consists in cross-checking information obtained from POT against other
electronic systems such as Compranet (an e-procurement platform). The IFAI also relies on the
“mystery shopping” methodology (usuario simulado) to monitor and assess the quality of the
services provided by liaison units to individuals that make information requests.
     Official figures on the extent to which public agencies provide information in response to
individuals’ requests show an overall positive response rate. But these figures have some cave-
ats (Fox, Haight, and Palmer-Rubin 2011: 8, 15). First, federal agencies themselves are respon-
sible for categorizing their responses as positive or negative. Second, the official data do
not address the quality of the information response (for example, sometimes the information
provided is incomplete or presented in a complex technical language). Given these limitations,
in 2008, the IFAI conducted a pilot monitoring exercise to assess the consistency, opportunity,
reliability, and completeness of more than 11,000 information requests. The study found that
83 percent of positive responses were satisfactory and approximately half of the responses
provided by federal agencies were positive.
     The IFAI also monitors individuals’ appeals, and has recently started to monitor the
process through which the IFAI mandates a federal agency to disclose information follow-
ing an appeal to a denial of information. This new monitoring system assesses the delays of
federal agencies in acting upon the IFAI’s resolutions, as well as whether the agency actually
provides a response to the requester. This will help have a more comprehensive assessment
of compliance.
     A few independent evaluations have been conducted, although there is no overall external
assessment of the ATI regime yet (Fox, Haight, and Palmer-Rubin 2011: 14−26, 43−46). Inde-
pendent evaluations of the responses provided by federal agencies to information requests
confirm the high level of satisfaction of requests, although the number of positive responses is
lower than the official figures.65




4. Use of the Law and Government
Responsiveness
From a purely statistical perspective, the volume of requests for information and the rates of
government’s response to these requests have been remarkable. In 2003, the first year the law
came into effect, more than 8,000 users submitted information requests. As figure 1 shows,
since 2003 the number of information requests received by the federal government increased
consistently. From 2003 to 2012 (May), the federal government has received a total of 790,071
information requests.66
    According to the IFAI, 95.9 percent of all requests were received electronically.67 Of
the total information requests received by the federal government, up until December
2011, 91.5 percent received a positive response: either the information was provided or the
requestor was directed to where the information could be found.68 By way of comparison,

      in Australia, during 2004−05, the government received 39,265 information requests but only
      responded to 67.2 percent of them. Indeed, the volume of information requests and responses
      in Mexico are proportional to those received by the U.S. government, which has greater
      capacity and resources to respond to public information requests (Ackerman 2007: 18). As
      John Ackerman notes, compared with other countries that have implemented their access to
      information (ATI) laws, these numbers are highly positive (Ackerman 2007: 18).
           In terms of effectiveness, the federal government responded to public information
      requests in 13.6 days on average,69 well below the limit of 20 days established by the law.
      Furthermore, from 2003 to 2011, the government denied information requests on the grounds
      that the information did not exist in only 6 percent of cases70 (see table 2).
           Since the law came into effect, the number of appeals received by the IFAI also grew con-
      sistently. As figure 2 shows, from 2003 to May 2012, the IFAI received a total of 42,261 appeals,
      which represent around 5.3 percent of the total number of requests. In only 23.4 percent of
      those cases, the IFAI confirmed the decision of the federal agency—that is, it ruled against the
      requestor and in favor of the government (see table 3).71
           According to the IFAI’s data, most information requests are filed by new users (see fig-
      ure 3). Yet the majority of requests are concentrated, both regionally and professionally. Most
      users (more than 50 percent) are concentrated in Mexico City’s metropolitan area; 74.6 percent
      of users have college degrees or postgraduate degrees.72 Although users are not required to
      identify themselves, some do. According to official data, the majority of users are academics
      (31.4 percent), business people (17.9 percent), government officials (11.5 percent), and journal-
      ists (8.2 percent). The remaining requests are made by civil society activists and other unspeci-
      fied users.73 These data reveal that a relatively small percentage of users place most of the
      information requests.

    In 2011, the largest percentage of requests (27.7 percent) involves information generated
by the agencies themselves, such as legal procedures, statistics, and results of opinion surveys;
19.6 percent of requests refer to personal data, and another 12.7 percent refer to information
about the agency’s activities, such as work plans and project results. Requests about procure-
ment information represent 10.7 percent of total requests. Only 4 percent of total requests
refer to the remuneration of public officials and another 3.6 percent to the agencies’ subsidy

programs, such as list of beneficiaries, eligibility requirements, and information about results
of these programs (see figure 4).74 As mentioned earlier, the low volume of requests related to
information about social programs is in large part due to the existence of grievance-redress
mechanisms, such as the Citizen Attention Windows in Oportunidades that provide benefi-
ciaries this information. For the most part, individuals do not request information about social
programs through the ATI law.
     When analyzing the IFAI resolutions, it becomes clear that the IFAI tends to rule in favor of
the requester more often than in favor of the government. On average, from 2003 to May 2012,
the IFAI confirmed the federal government—that is, ruled that the government’s information
denial should be upheld—in only 19 percent of cases. The rest of the resolutions were either to
revoke the government’s initial denial or to modify the government’s response (32.5 percent of
cases). The remaining 48.5 percent of the IFAI resolutions were either dismissed75 or admitted
and then dismissed as the conflict was resolved (table 3).
     An indicator of federal agencies’ level of compliance with the law is the number of requests
they receive and the proportion of responses that are appealed to the IFAI. A higher propor-
tion of complaints indicate that agencies are reluctant to provide the requested information, or
citizens are not satisfied with the response received. Conversely, a lower proportion of com-
plaints relative to the number of information requests might indicate that citizens are satisfied
with the responses given. Of course, citizens may be unsatisfied and yet refuse to complain
due to lack of confidence that their grievance will be redressed.
     The federal agencies that receive the highest number of information requests since the law
came into effect are listed in figure 5. The Social Security Institute is, by far, the federal agency

with the largest number of requests, many of them on personal data. Three of the four federal
agencies closely analyzed in this paper are included in this list: the secretary of education (sec-
ond place), secretary of communications and transport (seventh place), and secretary of public
function (SFP, eighth place).
      In terms of requests that result in appeals to the IFAI, the 10 federal agencies with the
largest number of appeals between 2003−12 are listed in table 4. Not surprisingly, the Social
Security Institute tops the list of federal agencies with the highest numbers of requests that
result in appeals to the IFAI. But in proportion to the total number of information requests
received by the agencies, the SFP—the very agency responsible for the enforcement of the
IFAI’s decisions—is at the top of the list, with 9.0 percent of requests resulting in appeals. The
secretary of communications and transport, and secretary of education are also included in this
list, with a rate of 5.8 percent and 4.7 percent respectively.76
      While this information sheds light on users’ demand for public information and rates of
government compliance with the law, there are some limits to what statistics can reveal. Statis-
tical information does not show the informal mechanisms often used by the IFAI officials to try
to persuade government agencies to disclose the information the IFAI considers to be public.
      It also does not reveal about the quality of data. Agencies might often reply to informa-
tion requests by issuing information that is difficult—if not impossible—to interpret as it is
published in PDF format and therefore difficult to reuse. Or, they might respond with pages
and pages of legalistic argumentation that is virtually impossible to decipher.77 This method of
evading a proper reply is possible because the law establishes that information needs to be
disclosed “in the format in which it exists.” In such cases, when agencies comply with the terms
of the law but not with its spirit, disclosure does not necessarily lead to greater transparency.
      It is important to note that, as will be discussed in more detail below, the disclosure of
information, and the revelation of corruption or mismanagement does not necessarily lead to
proper investigations or sanctions.



5. Broader Impact of ATI
The law has increased transparency in the country, and information that was impossible to
obtain 10 years ago is now available. For instance, disclosures about officials’ expenditures
on per diems have led to significant reductions in these types of spending. But having more
information does not necessarily mean greater accountability, unless disclosure translates into
sanctions or policy changes, as the cases below illustrate.
    Greater transparency is only the first link in the accountability chain (Fox 2007b: 663–71).
Advancing from transparency to greater accountability requires the involvement and effective
coordination of several accountability institutions.78

5.1. CASES STUDIES
A few illustrative cases reveal the challenges of increasing accountability, even when a legal ATI
framework exists, information is disclosed, and civil society organizations (CSOs) are effective.
While civil society pressure (including from the media) has triggered corrective actions in some
cases, sanctions need to be enforced to ensure government accountability.

      5.1.1 Health Programs for HIV/AIDs: The Case of Pro-Vida

      In 2002 the Chamber of Deputies approved an increase of 600 million pesos to the Secretary of
      Health’s budget for health programs. The head of the Budget Committee arbitrarily changed
      the approved budget and allocated resources that were earmarked for the purchase of retro-
      viral medications for patients suffering from HIV/AIDS to an anti-abortion nongovernmental
      organization (NGO, Pro-Vida).
           FUNDAR, a think tank/NGO in Mexico, conducted an investigation into the transfer of
      these funds. Along with a coalition of six other CSOs, FUNDAR requested information on all
      the financial reports Pro-Vida had submitted to the secretary of health. The secretary released
      all the information requested. The investigation showed numerous irregularities in the use
      of funds, such as payments to fictitious organizations, disbursement not related to health
      programs (such as purchases of Mont Blanc pens), and excessive expenditures on publicity
      campaigns. The NGOs then turned to the press and began a media campaign to demand an
      official investigation into this case and the eventual sanctioning of all public officials involved
      in the case.
           As a result of this campaign, and the strong social pressure that resulted as many other civil
      society organizations and newspapers joined the campaign, Pro-Vida was requested to return
      all the transfers received from the secretary of health. In addition, the secretary of health can-
      celled all future transfers already approved to this organization, and Pro-Vida was banned from
      receiving public resources. The SFP charged the head of Pro-Vida a fine of 13 million pesos,
      but no public official was investigated or sanctioned.79

      5.1.2 The Health Rights Campaign of the Women’s Network for the Common Good80

      In Mexico most information requests are made by a small number of individuals, heavily con-
      centrated in urban areas. But in Guerrero, a poor southern state characterized by strong social
      capital, rural organizations have used ATI rights to improve the living conditions of low-income
      rural citizens.
           In 2007, in Guerrero, a peasant women’s health rights campaign, the Women’s Network for
      the Common Good, affiliated with the Union of Communities of Eastern Coyuca de Benitez
      and Western Acapulco (Unión de Pueblos, or UP), decided to organize a campaign to hold
      the federal government accountable for provision of health services through the government’s
      conditional cash-transfer program, Oportunidades. This program is controlled directly by the
      federal government, even when services are provided at the local level. Program recipients
      are entitled to receive regular cash payments upon children’s attendance to school, regu-
      lar preventative health check-ups, and lectures. Oportunidades is one of the most carefully
      monitored and evaluated social programs in the country, and it includes several mechanisms to
      increase transparency and facilitate social oversight. But by using their ATI law, rural organiza-
      tions were able to identify some limitations.
           In the communities of Eastern Coyuca de Benítez and Western Acapulco, Oportunidades
      recipients were confronting problems with public health services. In particular, women com-
      plained about a lack of medicines and supplies in rural health centers, the frequent absence
      of doctors and nurses, and the fees requested for any prescription and basic supplies. Addi-
      tionally, community leaders reported that Oportunidades beneficiaries were asked to make
      “voluntary contributions” to cover the costs of health centers’ electricity, gas, potable water,
      and basic maintenance.
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                                135




    The Women’s Network presented a request for information. They wanted to know the rules
governing basic public health services in rural communities, which services were supposed
to be provided, and whether or not they required any fees. They also requested information
on the list of medicines and supplies that health centers were supposed to have in stock, and
the number of doctors and nurses that needed to be present at the health centers. Finally,
they wanted to know how health centers spent the resources transferred from the federal
government.
    The federal government provided the information requested, including a series of health-
related laws, ministry regulations, and program operating procedures that clearly defined the
basic health services to which rural communities were entitled. This included lists of specific
medicines, supplies, and services that health centers were mandated to provide free of charge.
But the federal government could not provide information on the administration of resources
in specific health centers in the Coyuca region, because the state government manages those
centers (although funding comes from federal sources). In contrast to federal officials, state
health officials were more reluctant to disclose financial information and refused to provide the
necessary data on funds earmarked for basic maintenance and supplies.
    The campaign involved hundreds of women. A substantial volume of information was duly
provided to the community, although it had only a marginal impact on the quality of public
health services or the management of health centers at the local level.

5.1.3 The Customs Department Trust Fund

In Mexico public trust funds (fideicomisos) are among the mechanisms used by some public
officials to keep public funds out of the public eye. Traditionally, trust funds are among the
institutions most resistant to disclosing information about their financial operations. According
to a study (Sandoval 2008), 589 public trust funds were operating in Mexico by 2007. They
managed a significant amount of resources—close to 3 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic
product (GDP). Managers of public trust funds resort to the argument that technically they
are not public institutions and thus are protected by Mexico’s “bank secrecy laws.” In prac-
tice, most of these trust funds do not have sufficient control mechanisms and have escaped
public oversight.
     In 2004 Congress passed an important reform granting the country’s Supreme Audit Institu-
tion (Auditoria Superior de la Federación, ASF) legal attribution to audit trust funds, as this is
an institution that manages public funds.81 But trust fund managers continued to allege their
rights to secrecy.
     By 2005 the ASF had identified significant deviation of resources in financial transfers
made to some trust funds related to the Customs Department (an entity within the secretary of
finance). The secretary refused to reveal financial information on such transfers, alleging that
the trust funds were private entities and thus protected by bank secrecy laws. In 2005 the IFAI
received an appeal to review the secretary‘s decision to withhold the information. The IFAI
ruled that the information was public and therefore had to be released because the origin of
the resources was public, even if invested in a “private” trust fund.
     The secretary of finance released the requested information. The information revealed that
the trust fund managed resources in a discretionary manner and that a significant amount of
resources could not be accounted for. The ASF issued a series of recommendations to the secre-
tary of finance, including the reposition of those resources, while the SFP began an investigation.
136                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         Although the issue was publicized in the national press, there were no sanctions. IFAI and
      several NGOs, academics, and legislators led advocacy to mandate the disclosure of trust
      funds’ financial reports, whenever these trust funds receive public resources.

      5.1.4 Farm Subsidies: The Case of PROCAMPO

      In 2007 the Mexican NGO FUNDAR requested information from the Ministry of Agriculture on
      the list of recipients of PROCAMPO, the largest federal farm subsidy program in the country,
      designed to increase agricultural productivity, support the poorest farmers, and reduce the
      high levels of inequality in Mexico’s rural sector.
           The Ministry of Agriculture responded to this information request, but the information
      was incomplete and delivered in unreadable formats. The NGO appealed to the IFAI, which
      resolved in favor of the NGO and directed the Ministry of Agriculture to release the complete
      list of recipients and provide the documents in a machine-readable format.
           The deficiencies of PROCAMPO have been thoroughly analyzed and discussed in various
      academic forums and publications. As a Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economica (CIDE)
      researcher points out, although the federal government spent significant resources on farm
      subsidies, these subsidies did not bring about greater competitiveness in the country’s agri-
      cultural sector, a sustainable increase in the production of basic grains, or improvements in the
      living conditions of the poorest farmers (Merino 2010a: 53, 75). Even the ASF claimed in 2006
      that it was difficult to conclude that the farm subsidy program had fulfilled its objectives. In its
      audit of PROCAMPO, the ASF recognized that farm subsidies were heavily concentrated in the
      richest northern states, and that 53 percent of PROCAMPO subsidies had been distributed to
      farmers who owned more than 5 hectares of land, while the smallest landholders (those who
      own less than 1 hectare) had only received 0.6 percent of all subsidies during that year.82
           After obtaining the information from the Ministry of Agriculture, FUNDAR—along with
      other NGOs and academics—launched a project called “Farm Subsidy in Mexico,” which
      systematized and ordered the information and posted it online in an easily searchable format
      (www.subsidiosalcampo.org.mx). The Web site database, publicly launched in 2008, allows citi-
      zens to search the list of beneficiaries of farm subsidies over the past 15 years and to compare
      payments and distributional patterns across states (Fox and Haight 2010a: 141).
           This information confirmed that the bulk of farm subsidies had not been allocated to the
      country’s poorest and smallest farmers, as the program originally intended, but to the wealthi-
      est farmers in the country (Merino 2010a: 53). Moreover, an analysis of the list of recipients
      revealed that beneficiaries did not always meet the recipients’ selection criteria. The news
      intensified the pressure on the Ministry of Agriculture to revise the program’s operating rules
      and to clean up its list of recipients.
           Soon after the scandal broke, the president and the minister of agriculture acknowledged
      that “it was imperative to review the list of beneficiaries and to allocate farm subsidies more
      strategically, to those farmers who needed the subsidies the most” (Merino 2010b).
           In February 2010 another investigation led by a group of academics revealed further
      irregularities in the list of beneficiaries (El Diario de los Mochis, April 1, 2011). Again a high-
      level official resigned, and the government announced a review and reform of PROCAMPO’s
      rules of operation. The government established a minimum of 1,300 pesos ($100) and a ceiling
      of 100,000 pesos ($8,000) per farmer per harvest cycle. But the government did not introduce
      incentives to ensure compliance with the new operating rules of PROCAMPO (Fox and Haight
      2010a: 140). Neither were sanctioning mechanisms introduced (El Universal, February 15, 2010).
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                                 137




    In this regards, the ASF has continued to issue recommendations to the Ministry of Agri-
culture. In 2009 the ASF found that 577 public officials from the Ministry of Agriculture had
received PROCAMPO subsidies and “requested from these officials to return the funds that
were allocated to them” (El Diario de los Mochis, April 1, 2011).
    Although the accountability impact of transparency reforms depends on the institutional
setting and the effectiveness of check-and-balances and accountability agencies, these cases
suggest that transparency can have a significant impact on the daily life of the citizens and
communities that exercise their right of access to information. In this regards, an effective ATI
law can unleash a powerful movement of bottom-up accountability, as well as trigger formal
oversight institutions to take action.



6. A Culture of Openness
As the cases discussed above demonstrate, the implementation of the access to information (ATI)
law has been effective in disclosing valuable information to the public. But success has also gener-
ated resistance on the part of some federal government agencies and officials. Transparency reforms
demand a cultural shift in society, and changes in bureaucratic culture take time.
     A survey of midlevel federal public officials commissioned by the Federal Institute for
Access to Information (IFAI) in early 2007 revealed mixed results. Sixty percent of public
officials interviewed acknowledge that “officials in some units within their agencies believe
they own the information they generate and do not share it, even with other units in the same
agency.” Seventy-eight percent of public officials also recognized that Mexico’s bureaucratic
culture needed to change. While the majority of officials interviewed in the survey (59 percent)
believed the transparency law contributed to increasing transparency and access to informa-
tion, only 30 percent considered it contributed to modernizing the administration and 7 per-
cent to reducing corruption. The vast majority of public officials (77 percent) complained that
public information requests are not well formulated (Probabilstica 2007).
     The implementation of ATI legislation may generate resistance on the part of public
officials, especially as they become more aware of the potential risks of information disclo-
sure. Moreover, although official data indicate that federal agencies have received more than
hundreds of thousands of information requests and that the vast majority of these have been
duly processed, looking at the number of requests that are processed or the complaints that
are ruled in favor of the requestor says little about the smaller number of requests that are
denied. A single refusal to comply can be more significant than thousands of routine informa-
tion requests that obtain a positive response.



7. Conclusions
The Mexican law has been recognized by experts and practitioners around the world as one of
the strongest information laws. Moreover, the Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI)
has been recognized as an example of good practice for ensuring compliance with the law and
ruling on individuals’ appeals to government denials of information requests. Indeed, since
2003, other countries in Latin America, including Honduras and Chile, have created similar
specialized access to information (ATI) oversight agencies.
138                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Individuals have more opportunities to access information about the operations and
      management of government agencies. Civil society organizations (CSOs) such as those of the
      Colectivo por la Transparencia have played a key role and made significant inroads in using
      the ATI law, obtaining valuable information about the operation and financial management of
      important government programs. They have used this information to demand greater account-
      ability. Looking at the past 9 years of implementation, and notwithstanding the resistance of
      some government agencies to disclose information, the implementation record of the Access
      to Information and Transparency Law at the federal level is a positive one. The number of infor-
      mation requests has increased consistently, and most of these requests receive positive replies.
      Similarly, most of the appeals to the IFAI are resolved in favor of the requester.
           The overall conclusion from the Mexican case, however, is that greater information is not
      necessarily synonymous with better accountability. Information, while critical, is only the first
      link in the complex chain of accountability. Effective accountability requires the disclosure of
      information to generate effective administrative reforms, corrective actions, and actual sanc-
      tioning of public officials who abuse their power.
           Aside from political will and commitment on the part of public authorities, government
      accountability heavily relies on the constant and unyielding demand of civil society. Continuous
      exercise of the right to access information and the use of disclosed information to advocate
      for greater accountability are critical for maintaining the pressure for greater transparency
      and accountability. For that, capacity building among potential users and other demand side
      actors, especially vulnerable groups and poor communities is very important. Stable democra-
      cies rely on trust between government and civil society, but some level of distrust is healthy for
      accountability relationships to exist.

Notes

1.  Article 4 of the law states six objectives:
    • Allow any citizen to obtain public information through simple and expedient procedures.
    • Increase government transparency by disseminating information generated by the federal
       administration.
    • Guarantee the protection of personal information managed by federal government entities.
    • Increase accountability so that citizens can evaluate government performance of the federal
       administration.
    • Improve the organization, classification, and management of public records.
    • Contribute to the democratization of Mexican society and to the enforcement of the rule of law.
2. Salient examples include the publicity of police files related to federal investigations into crimes
    committed during the 1970s, disclosure of public trust funds previously classified as bank secrets,
    institutional e-mails, and so on. The law covers only federal agencies, not local and state government
    agencies. See Bookman and Guerrero (2009); and Fox and others (2006).
3. Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University in
    Washington, DC (one of the leading organizations advocating for ATI), has recognized that Mexico has
    been a leading example “in crafting an ATI law that can be successfully implemented.” This is in large
    part the result of the creation of the IFAI, a landmark institution that has become a model of good
    practice around the world (El Universal, Mexico, September 29, 2010).
4. A survey conducted by the IFAI in 2008 revealed that 66 percent of Mexican citizens know about the
    ATI law and 33 percent of citizens trust the IFAI, making it one of the most highly trusted institutions in
    the country (IFAI, 6 Informe de Labores al H. Congreso de la Union 2008, June 2009).
5. Subsequent events, at both the international and national levels, have had repercussions for the ATI
    regime. By 2007 the Mexican economy was facing challenging conditions: its exports and foreign
    direct investment (FDI) were negatively impacted by the economic crisis in the United States, and
    violence linked to organized crime and drug trafficking was on the rise.
6. See, for example, the IFAI’s president statement during an interview: “Transparency is no longer a
    priority of the government. The current administration has not yet issued a clear statement towards
    transparency” (El Clarín Veracruzano, Mexico, September 28, 2010).
7. In late 2008, after Congress approved a reform of the Criminal Procedures Code that classified all
    criminal investigations, the IFAI president criticized this reform and stated that “this is the first
    retrocession in matters of transparency” (La Jornada, December 18, 2008). See, also, an interview with
    Jacqueline Peschard, president of the IFAI: “What worries us at IFAI is that the authority of IFAI has
    been questioned. According to the Transparency and Access to Public Information Law, IFAI’s
    resolutions are final. However, on several occasions, the Attorney General’s Office has attempted to
    overrule these decisions by turning to the Administrative and Fiscal Federal Tribunal to review IFAI’s
    decision, something neither the Transparency Law does nor the Constitution provides for in relation to
    transparency decisions” (Revista Etcétera, May 1, 2009). See also Bookman and Guerrero (2009: 47).
8. For an overview of the current state of the ATI system in Mexico, see Fox and Haight (2010b: 135).
9. In India, the nodal agency is the Department of Personnel and Training; in Canada, the Treasury Board
    Secretariat; and in Chile, the Comisión de Probidad del Ministerio de la Secretaría de la Presidencia.
    These agencies coordinate the implementation of the law at the central or federal government level
10. This concept was used by Gregory Michener (2010: Chapter 2, “Surrendering Secrecy in Mexico”).
11. According to the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), the PAN obtained 42 percent of the vote and the PRI
    35 percent in the presidential elections (www.ife.org).
12. See Starr (2006). For an analysis of the (informal/extraconstitutional) powers of Mexican presidents, see
    Whitehead (1995) and Weldon (1997).

      13. For an analysis of the role the media played in the creation of a strong law in Mexico, see Michener
          (2010). See also Bertoni (2011).
      14. For a discussion of this point and an examination of the context that led to the adoption and passage
          of the law, see Michener (2005).
      15. For a comprehensive overview and analysis of the formulation and approval of the ATI law in Mexico,
          see Luna Pla (2009: 61).
      16. The name was given by a reporter from The New York Times to refer to the group of lawyers,
          academics, and activists that met in the City of Oaxaca, Oaxaca State, in 2001 (The New York Times,
          New York, October 12, 2001).
      17. In 1996 the IFE acquired full independence from the executive branch.
      18. Since 1977, when major electoral reforms were first introduced in the country, there were several
          attempts to regulate the right to information in Mexico. But these efforts had not prospered. Some
          argue that the media at that time heavily depended on subsidies and other forms of control from the
          government. After 2000 the media and the academic community began to collaborate in efforts to
          distance the media from their reputation of subjection and lack of independence from government
          controls. See also Bertoni (2011: 11).
      19. Luna Pla (2009: 119). The bill included some aspects of a previous bill that had been presented in 2001
          by the left-leaning opposition party, Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD). According to Luna,
          the PRD’s bill was more limited in scope than that of the Grupo Oaxaca. Eventually, during the drafting
          of the final bill that was approved by Congress, the Grupo Oaxaca collaborated with the PRD (and PRI)
          legislators that had authored the original bill in 2001 (Luna Pla 2009: 96).
      20. This was quite unprecedented in Mexico, where civil society is formally not entitled to participate in
          the bill-making process. Unlike other countries, Mexico does not have a law of citizen participation in
          law making. In Mexico citizens can be consulted, but they are not invited to participate in drafting bills.
      21. Academics from different universities were able to work together advocating for a strong transparency
          and access law. Members of the Grupo Oaxaca also collaborated with international organizations such
          as Article 19 and the Konrad Adenaeur Foundation. See Escobedo (2002) and Ramirez Sáiz (2006).
      22. Actually, President Fox’s administration faced major political deadlocks and legislative stalemates on
          important reform issues, such as energy, education, and labor. For a discussion of this topic see, Wise
          and Pastor (2005: 135−60) and Delal Baer (2004: 101−13).
      23. This condition, combined with the Internet-based system of requests, in practice protects the
          requesters and virtually ensures anonymity. For an analysis of the main contents of the law see Luna Pla
          (2009); Bookman and Guerrero (2009); Banisar (2006); and Mendel (2009).
      24. For a comparative analysis of the proactive disclosure provisions of several ATI laws, see Darbishire
          (2010).
      25. The governors of the states of Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, and Zacatecas, representing the three
          political parties, championed the constitutional reforms of 2007. But some states have actually
          sponsored ATI and transparency laws in their own states, which do not meet minimum transparency
          standards. For a comprehensive analysis of all state ATI and transparency laws, see Díaz Iturbe (2007).
      26. Bookman and Guerrero consider that the creation of the IFAI is by far one of the most novel aspects of
          the law (Bookman and Guerrero 2009: 26). This institutional design has been replicated in other parts
          of the world, as in Chile in 2009.
      27. For an analysis of the justice system in Mexico, see Domingo (2000: 705−35); Buscaglia (2003); and
          Buscaglia (2007).
      28. An independent electoral tribunal—the Federal Electoral Tribunal—was also established to resolve
          electoral disputes. While the IFAI’s decisions are definitive and binding, unlike the IFE and the Federal
          Electoral Tribunal, the IFAI does not have sanctioning powers.
      29. See interview with the IFAI commissioner María Elena Pérez-Jaen, who admitted that the IFAI “lacks
          teeth to sanction government officials who do not comply with IFAI’s resolutions” (interview with MVS
          Noticias, September 2010, www.noticiasmvs.com). In 2010 an executive decree gave the IFAI the
          power to sanction individuals who misuse the IFAI’s personal databases. Yet, it still does not have the
          power to sanction public officials who do not comply with the IFAI’s decisions. See Abel Barajas,
          Reforma, Mexico, July 6, 2010.
A CASE STUDY OF MEXICO                                                                                             147



30. The commissioners’ rulings are taken to a (public) plenary session, where they are resolved by a
    majority of votes. At least three commissioners must be present to pass a resolution. See the IFAI’s
    internal regulation (Reglamento Interno), Art. 7; Art. 9.
31. The IFAI president, together with the Secretaría de Acuerdos, (Resolutions Secretariat) is responsible
    for turning cases over to the commissioners. These cases are assigned in a random fashion, as they are
    received. Commissioners have technical staff to support them in their rulings, and they are entitled to
    request an audience with government authorities and/or requestors.
32. Art. 37 lists all of the IFAI’s functions.
33. Interview with Juan Pablo Guerrero, former IFAI commissioner, Mexico City, August 2010.
34. See Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares, Chapter VI,
    Article 38.
35. Before the 2003 budget was allocated, the commissioners threatened to resign if Congress did not
    allocate sufficient funds to allow the IFAI to operate. In 2003 the IFAI was allocated close to $18 million.
    This budget increased minimally over the years.
36. The unionization of the IFAI employees was precluded by paying high salaries, above the minimum
    wage. Agencies that pay their personnel minimum salaries are compelled to form a union.
37. But some criticisms have also been raised against the IFAI’s hiring policies. According to John
    Ackerman, these policies stray from the ideal of a truly professionalized career civil service, particularly
    because new candidates to job postings are not subjected to an open competition, but are rather
    evaluated by ad-hoc committees where the immediate supervisor retains high discretionary power
    (Ackerman 2007: 44).
38. For an analysis of the challenges involved in the process of selecting candidates for autonomous
    regulatory bodies, see Sanchez Andrade (2009) and Ackerman.
39. IFAI commissioners are appointed by the president, subject to the senate’s lack of objection. The
    senate can veto nominations within 30 days; otherwise, it is understood that the nominee is accepted.
    Despite the senate’s veto power, the president has strong leverage in the selection process of the IFAI
    commissioners. Moreover, the president is not obliged to disclose the list of potential candidates
    before they are turned over to the senate for confirmation.
40. In recent years, the IFAI developed a new electronic tool called ZOOM to allow users to search
    previous information requests, government responses, and the IFAI’s resolutions. This tool allows not
    only users but also commissioners to identify precedents in previous rulings, thus making their rulings
    faster and more efficient.
41. There is an interministerial committee against corruption (Comision Intersecretarial para la
    Transparencia y el Combate a la Corrupcion, CITCC), yet it does not have the scope and powers of an
    independent commission against corruption (for further information, see www.programaanti
    corrupcion.gob.mx/). Nonetheless, Mexico has shown its commitment to curb corruption by
    advancing anticorruption mechanisms and initiatives both at national and international levels. For
    example, Mexico is one of the founding members of the Open Government Partnership (OGP).
42. The SFP—which at that time was called SECODAM—was first headed by Francisco Barrio, former
    governor of the state of Chihuahua. He was elected governor in 1992, in a state that had become one
    of PAN’s bastions. After Barrio resigned to run for congressional office in 2003, his deputy, Eduardo
    Romero, became minister. Romero had served as Chihuahua’s interior minister during the Barrio
    administration.
43. For an analysis of how leadership and organizational culture impact government performance, see
    Thomas (2010).
44. The secretary of education had served as the IFAI’s president. This could largely explain the level of
    interest for transparency and access to information in the secretary.
45. Some interviewees argued that including the counsel general in the agency’s information committee
    can risk making the response to information requests overly legalistic and bureaucratic, leading to
    major delays.

      49. But it must be taken into account that, in 2006, the scope of the IFAI and IFE’s competencies was
          dissimilar—the IFAI’s competencies were federal while the IFE’s mandate was national. After 2010 the
          IFAI’s mandate regarding the protection of personal data held by private entities became national.

          adopted to guarantee citizens’ right to public information and improve their performance (IFAI

      58. Users can also make their requests in writing or by mail, but the mail is not always reliable in Mexico.
          When requests are presented personally in writing, in the liaison units, staff transfer those requests
          into the e-platform so that they can be registered by the system. If the requester wants the information
          to be delivered on paper, he/she needs to pay the reproduction costs.
      59. See Article 6 of the Constitution, chapter V. This constitutional mandate has encouraged states and
          municipalities to adopt the INFOMEX system and the IFAI has been sought to provide training, even
          when the mandate of the Institute is confined to the federal level.
      60. According to Helen Darbishire’s study on proactive disclosure provisions, a standard on minimum
          disclosure provisions is emerging for ATI legislation. These provisions include: institutional information;
          organizational information; operational information; decisions and acts; public services information;
          budget information; open meetings information; decision making and public participation; subsidies
          information; public procurement information; lists, databases, registers; information about information
          held; publications information; and information about the right to information (Darbishire 2010: 21).

      62. It is interesting to note that the two previous years, Sedesol’s compliance rate had been at least
          10 points higher. However, in 2011, Sedesol scored low (below 60%) in the financial part of the
          transparency obligations. Indeed, IFAI considered that in 2011 Sedesol did not publish adequately
          information related to salaries, subsidies and procurement. (Data provided by the IFAI, Dirección
          General de Coordinación y Vigilancia de la Administración Pública Federal, August 2012).

          Económica (CIDE), allows for assessment of each Mexican state and ATI oversight body at the state
          level, the quality of the respective ATI legislation, the fulfillment of the obligations of the state law, and
          the institutional capacity and competencies of each oversight body.
      66. Information provided by the IFAI. The government, by law, is asked to assist requestors in formulating
          their requests so that they are less vague and therefore have more chances of receiving a positive
          response. This provision is called suplencia de la deficiencia de la petición (“improving the deficiencies
          of the request”).

71. Data provided by the IFAI., As mentioned above, appeals to the IFAI are straightforward; users do not
    need to hire lawyers. Yet, some users interviewed for this paper complain that they often need to
    resort to legal assistance to write their appeals to the IFAI, because in complex cases, the government
    tends to give lengthy and complicated answers to justify denials of information requests.

73. Often journalists prefer not to identify themselves because they believe this will increase their chances
    of obtaining the information requested. According to Jonathan Fox and Libby Haight, many journalists
    report that identifying themselves as journalists leads agencies to resist the request. The consequence
    of this is that official IFAI data on the number of journalists’ requests may be underrepresented. See
    Fox and Haight (2010b: 144).

    information provided by the IFAI. It should be noted that in 2011 this list included for the first time the
    National Cancer Institute, with 36.4 percent of requests resulting in appeals. This is the result of an
    atypical situation in which one single requester, using two different names, filed more than one
    thousand appeals and a similar number of requests in a three month period, which paralyzed the
    access to information system in the National Cancer Institute. IFAI learned that the requests and
    appeals had been filed by a National Cancer Institute former employee, who was resentful with the
    Institute. Acknowledging the facts, IFAI’s plenum determined that its was a case of an abusive use of
    the right to access information. (This information was provided by José Luis Marzal, Director of
    Coordination and Oversight at IFAI. E-mail, August 22, 2012)

                    Implementing Right to Information
                 A Case Study of Moldova

1. Introduction
Moldova passed the Law of Access to Information (982) (henceforth RTI law) in 2000. This came
at the end of a turbulent decade that saw the disintegration of the Soviet system. Pressure
from journalists and civil society organizations was important, and they also contributed sub-
stantially to its drafting.1
    This paper discusses the implementation of the RTI law in Moldova. It is part of a larger
comparative study looking at implementation across a range of countries. It is fair to say that
for much of the time since its passage, the existence of a Moldovan RTI law has made little
difference to the socio-political reality of the country. The lack of official data on implementa-
tion makes it difficult to judge to what extent the letter and spirit of the law are being followed.
Based on civil society assessments, it appears that the rate of explicit and mute refusals to
information requests and nonresponses to RTI requests have been quite high. A few institu-
tions have created internal norms for making information available, but many have not done
even this (especially at the local level).



2. Adoption & Provisions
2.1. PASSAGE OF THE LAW
The drafting and passage of FOIA occurred in a very unstable and turbulent period for
Moldova, Corruption was perceived by most of the population as a primary cause of the
country’s political, economic, and social problems. Despite of the fact that 1998 has been
declared by a presidential decree the year of fighting corruption, there were no prosecutions
of governmental officials at the national or local level.2 According to Transparency International
CPI, in 1999 Moldova was rated 75 out of the 99 countries assessed, registering a score of
2.6 points (10—highly clean; 0—highly corrupt).3 State capture turned out to be closely related
to phenomenon of grand corruption where firms were shaping and influencing the rules of
the game through politicians and public officials.4




                                                                                                       159
160                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           A window of opportunity for reform emerged after parliamentary elections held on
      March 22, 1998—the second electoral competition of this kind after the declaration of inde-
      pendence. The Communist Party (CP) participated for the first time in parliamentary elections
      since Moldova achieved independence. Unlike the previous parliament which was clearly
      dominated by the Agrarian Democratic Party (ADP), the new parliament was fragmented. Four
      parties emerged—Communist Party with 30 percent of the seats, Democratic Convention with
      19 percent, Movement for a Democratic and Prosperous Moldova with 18 percent, and Party
      of Democratic Forces with 8.8 percent. Although the Communist Party obtained 40 seats it was
      pushed into opposition by a coalition of the other three parties.
           Between 1998 and 2001, when early parliamentary elections were called, Moldova experi-
      enced a phase of government instability caused by a twofold political crisis: clear cut disagree-
      ments inside the coalition and a conflict between the legislature and the presidency. Three
      cabinets alternated in office during this parliamentary cycle, with an average ruling duration of
      about 11 months. The most reformist one, led by Ion Sturza, which started to implement radi-
      cal reforms stayed in office less than 9 months, and was dismissed in November 1999 through
      a no-confidence vote.5 An ensuing political struggle between the president and parliament
      resulted in a Constitutional amendment in July 2000, which curtailed the President’s powers.6
      Early parliamentary elections were held in February 2001.
           The Freedom of information Act was drafted under these circumstances, and few saw it as
      really important. The focus was on other areas such as privatization of big state enterprises and
      sectors, like tobacco and wine industries, and other economic reforms. Nevertheless, several
      factors contributed to the passage of the law:
       • First, parliament rejected a market oriented policy package, and voted out the reformist
         Sturza government. As a result, the image and credibility of Moldova was severely dam-
         aged internationally. They had to compensate the negative effects of the policy turn by
         promoting other reforms.
       • Second, the legislature as an institution had to prove its efficiency in the face of increasing
         acrimony, given the president’s allegations about the legislature’s inefficiency and incapac-
         ity to promote democratic reforms.
       • Third, political rivalries in an uncertain environment drove political leaders to seek the
         political dividends that support for RTI could provide.
       • Fourth, several former journalists were members of parliament (MPs), and supported
         the law.
       • Finally, there was no focus on what implementation would entail, or its consequences for
         state institutions, and hence RTI might not have been seen as particularly threatening or
         burdensome.

          The unanimous adoption of the law in the Parliament in 2000 was preceded by heated
      debates and a series of 44 amendments, formulated after the law was adopted in a first read-
      ing. The first parliamentary debates centered on a draft that focused on both ATI and the
      media. Momentum was generated by MPs, some of whom were also journalists.7 The initial
      draft was revised following suggestions by international experts, who suggested splitting the
      proposal into two different law—one for RTI and the other for freedom of expression and free-
      dom of the media. The final draft addressed these concerns.8
A CASE STUDY OF MOLDOVA                                                                              161




2.2. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The Law applies to:
 • All the central authorities of the state: the parliament, the presidency, the executive, its
   subordinated institutions, and the judiciary.
 • Local authorities (rayons, municipalities) and their subordinate institutions.
 • All organizations founded and financed by the state, at the central and local level, with
   non-commercial or sociocultural purposes.
 • Private bodies—under contract with a public authority to provide public services—that
   collect, manage, and store official information.

   Information can be requested by non-citizens of Moldova as well—access to information is
guaranteed in the same circumstances to foreign nationals who are temporary residents.


2.3. SCOPE OF EXEMPTIONS
The law attempts to cover virtually all information in the possession of state authorities or
agents (including private ones) and restricts access only in a number of specified cases. Two
principles represent a basis for denying access to information: (i) the protection of individual
data, personal rights, and reputation; and (ii) the protection of national security, public order,
public health, and public morality. The interpretation of these principles in each individual case
is left to the judiciary. Article 7 offers a more precise list of information that may be exempted
from the general rule of transparency (such as state secrets, commercial patents, the disclosure
of which may damage the legitimate interests of economic agents, personal data, informa-
tion on cases being investigated, and information related to scientific/technological research
protected by intellectual property or similar legislation.
     However, providers must disclose the portions of the document that do not contain such
information, and indicate explicitly the classification of the rest of the document. The providers
must also demonstrate that the potential damage done by disclosure is higher than the benefit
(to the public) of access.


2.4. REQUEST PROCEDURES
Entities covered by the law have the obligation to develop the necessary infrastructure to
facilitate access to information, such as creating appropriate spaces for documentation and
consultation of public documents, and job descriptions and training for the civil servants in
charge of implementation,
     The claimant of public information does not have to prove a direct interest or justify its
claim to public information in any way. If the information requested is highly complex, and
requires additional effort to collect and analyze, the entity might charge a fee, which should
not be higher than the reasonable costs of producing, copying, or delivering the information
requested. The entity might respond to the request verbally, or issuing copies of the existing
documents and data, or mailing or e-mailing copies. When the institution appealed to does
not possess the information requested, or when another institution can satisfy the request for
disclosure better, the claim should be redirected accordingly.
162                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          The law provides that the information must be disclosed as soon as it is available in the
      requested format, but no later than 15 working days from the time the claim is submitted. The
      interval could be 20 working days if the volume of information is large or additional interaction
      with the claimant is necessary to clarify the request, in which situation, the claimant must be
      informed.

      2.5. BROADER LEGAL ENVIRONMENT
      Several other pieces of legislation are germane to the functioning of the RTI regime. The
      contradictions between these laws give civil servants substantial discretionary power, and allow
      for a large degree of administrative intervention. Requests for information can be denied using
      different pieces of legislation.

      The Law on Transparent Decision Making9 requires involving citizens and interest groups in
      the public decision-making process, particularly in drafting regulations. Though NGO reports
      (Association for Participative Democracy 2010) have shown shortcomings in the implemen-
      tation of the law, it is considered by the government as a proof of its transparency, and the
      government has invested considerable effort in making it work.

      The Law on State Secrets:10 The first law on state secrets was adopted in 1994,11 and gave
      public institutions much room to restrict access to information much. In 2005 the Moldovan
      authorities drafted two pieces of legislation that severely limited access to information: one on
      state and service secrets, and a new law on access to information. Media and NGOs were vocal
      in opposing the new draft.12 They were joined by international community experts, many from
      the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) (Banisar, 2005). Subsequently,
      both drafts were withdrawn from the Parliament’s agenda.
          A new law on state secrets adopted in November 2008 (Access-Info 2008b; 2009a) retained
      a number of restrictive provisions from the previous law (Banisar 2008). The new law sought to
      extend the definition of a state secret, as well as of types of information that may be protected,
      lacked any provisions for whistle-blowers, extended deadlines for protecting secret information
      were too extensive, and left little room for parliamentary control. As the law does not contain
      any provision regarding a potential conflict with the RTI act, the secrecy of public institutions
      continues. Another factor that favors nondisclosure was the introduction, in 2006, of bonuses
      for civil servants who handle secret information in the course of their official duties.13

      The Law on Commercial Secrets:14 The law regulating commercial secrets dates back to 1994,
      and later amendments have not improved its wording significantly. Journalists have frequently
      been refused information by the citing of this law.15 According to the journalists and NGO rep-
      resentatives interviewed, this law was frequently used by public institutions to restrict access to
      public information.16

      The Law on the Protection of Personal Data17 establishes mechanisms for protecting per-
      sonal information and setting up a National Center18 mandated to ensure that appropriate
      protection is granted by all entities that handle personal data. Personal data are defined by
      law as information that refers to any identified or identifiable person. This definition has caused
      difficulties in practice, as most information can probably be linked with an identified or identifi-
      able person. For example, according to the RTI act, information from ID cards is not excluded
A CASE STUDY OF MOLDOVA                                                                                   163




from free access by citizens, but according to the personal data law this information should
not be accessible to citizens. There is a lack of clear procedures to sanction breaches of data
protection legislation, including for unlawful use of data for personal interests.19
    The legislation on personal data protection can be invoked against journalists when they
seek out information about politicians. Access to wealth statements (defined by law as public
information) is denied on the basis of the personal data protection legislation. Answers to such
requests often depend on the goodwill of the civil servant who handles the request, as the law
allows for significant administrative discretion.20

Freedom of Expression and Media Rights: Laws such as Combating Extremist Activity21 have
also limited freedom of expression. The 2008 of the Code of Conduct for Civil Servants22 bans
all public servants, except those authorized to contact and communicate with mass media on
the behalf of the institution they represent.
     There are a series of provisions from Civil Code Criminal Code and Code of Contraven-
tions which restrict the access to information and the freedom of expression. Nevertheless,
some advances have been made to adjust legal and institutional framework to European stan-
dards. One example is the adoption of Broadcasting Code23 a complex document which has to
ensure the protection of consumers’ rights to receive correct and objective information.




3. Implementation Experience
The law contains sufficiently comprehensive provisions on implementation to facilitate access.
The law requires all public entities to facilitate citizens’ access to information, appoint and
train information officers, and amends internal regulations to reflect RTI procedures (such as
the duties of the civil servants in charge of ATI implementation).24 The law also provides for the
obligation of civil servants to assist citizens in identifying and accessing registers where public
information is stored.25
     In practice, little effort has been made to create mechanisms to ensure implementation
across public institutions or to monitor compliance. Regulations on how the law should be
implemented have not been issued, so individual institutions are left to decide if and how
supplementary regulations should be adopted (some did, most did not). There are no offi-
cially centralized statistics in RTI implementation except some studies that originate from
NGOs, such as Access-Info, which specialize in promoting access to information. A few NGOs
use it systematically. But their capacity and resources are insufficient to put enough pressure
on authorities.
     There is no dedicated budget allocated for the implementation of the law. Most ministerial
accounting departments have no tradition of such collecting fees from requesters and con-
sider the extra trouble of collecting fees not worth its potential benefits. Big institutions such
as ministries or agencies regard the possibility as more of a nuisance as it would imply complex
arrangements between PR offices, the RTI system, and the accounting department. There are
no central guidelines or a consistent judicial practice of interpretation of limitations on collect-
ing fees. Hence, revenues from this source are insignificant.
     Overall, there is little ownership of the law by political leaders.26 The issue of the implementa-
tion of the RTI law has been at the margins of the public agenda.27 The political crisis that followed
164                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      the adoption of the law contributed to undermining the chances of its effective implementation.
      Implementation of RTI has been at odds with the political agenda of the post-2001 government.

      3.1. PERSONNEL AND TRAINING
      Significant differences exist among institutions regarding the appointment of an information
      officer, and only a few public bodies prepare regular reports, publish their budgets, or give
      out data about their public procurements (Access-Info 2009b: 80–90). A monitoring report by
      a local NGO, which looked at 95 public bodies—64 central and 31 local—shows the lack of
      awareness among civil servants about the law’s main provisions and the significant level of con-
      fusion on the difference between petitions and proper information requests. Procedural norms
      have not been included in the internal regulations to facilitate implementation (Cozonac, Guja,
      and Munteanu 2004).
           Preparing an answer for an RTI request usually involves several persons in any public insti-
      tution. The first point of contact for a request is usually the officials working in the department
      of public relations, who handle many other tasks. When a request is submitted, it is usually
      forwarded to the minister or senior officials, who decide which department is competent to
      answer the applicant. The response has to get approved by all department heads, the legal
      department, and the minister. The answers to requests are usually signed by the heads of insti-
      tutions or other top management officials, which shows the existence of multiple filters in the
      provision of information and the lack of autonomy of public servants responsible for this task.28
           Data on ATI requests in many state institutions are still not separated from those of
      individual petitions. It is usually up to the individual who first receives the document to
      qualify it as either a petition or a request for information. Progressive public entities try to
      differentiate between the two not only because the deadlines and procedures for response
      are different,29 but also because such institutions have interacted more frequently with their
      international counterparts, and, as a result, have become more aware about higher standards
      of transparency.

      3.2. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
      Each public institution is responsible for administering and keeping records of the information
      it works with, drawing resources from their general budget. Recent documents might be avail-
      able in electronic format, while older documents are usually in paper format.30
          Overall records management is the responsibility of the Secretariat Administrative Service
      (SAS). A step forward was made with the adoption in 1997 of law on registers.31 A better system
      of record management was put in place through the enactment in 2004 of the law on elec-
      tronic document and digital signature, which establishes a legal framework for the creation,
      recording, circulation and storage of electronic documents, as well as terms of using digital
      signature.32 An integrated system of electronic documents has also been introduced.33 The
      government has launched an initiative for “Government without paper,” to migrate to a full-
      fledged electronically-driven system.

      3.3. OPEN DATA INITIATIVE
      In 2011 a new government initiative to promote open governance was initiated, with the help
      of international partners and political buy-in from the highest level of government. The initia-
A CASE STUDY OF MOLDOVA                                                                             165




tive seeks to involve citizens in the decision-making process and improve its interaction with
businesses and the public.
    A special Web portal was set up (http://data.gov.md), and the Center for Electronic Gov-
ernance was entrusted with operating it. Line ministries and other public bodies were required
to identify, publish, and update datasets of interest for citizens and businesses.34 The center
had to draft the methodology and technical standards for posting this public information, and
offer technical support to all public entities. Two persons with management positions were
designated as counterparts in each institution.35 As the center operates under the umbrella of
the State Chancellery, the weight attached to the e-government agenda is significant.36 The
Chancellery is the main body coordinating government policies and thus has direct access to
line ministries and other public institutions.



4. Appeals & Enforcement
Administrative appeal and action in court against the denial of information or mute refusals
can be initiated in the following cases:
 • The refusal to receive and register a request officially;
 • The refusal to offer access to existing documents, which are by default public;
 • Undue classification of information as state or commercial secret or personal data; or
 • Imposition of disproportionate fees for RTI services.

   There is no independent information Commission. The law provides two types of remedies:
 • Administrative appeal to a senior official or committee within the entity from whom the
   information is requested. This must be done within 30 days from the moment when the
   denial of access occurred or when an unsatisfactory answer was received. The appellate
   person/body has five working days to examine the case and inform the claimant about
   the solution.
 • Action in and administrative court if the solution to the appeal is considered unsatisfactory,
   or if the entity does not have internal appeals procedures. This action must be initiated no
   later than 30 days from the end of the previous procedure.

    Systematic data on appeals and adjudication were not available, but interviews suggested
that the Courts are burdened by a heavy caseload, and poor capacity.
    The judiciary has problems of capacity, integrity, and politicization, as the European evalu-
ation missions attest37—a combination of poor material conditions in courts, overburdened
staff, and a lack of exposure to international legal thinking, especially in new areas such as
modern commercial law, human rights, or freedom of speech. Judges are poorly prepared to
rule on the few ATI-related cases that come before them. Moreover, judges tend to stand with
public institutions.
    In principle, the administrative judge is entitled to impose penalties in proportion to the
damage caused by the denial of access to public information. In practice—and in the context
of an unreformed judiciary with little training and track record on such modern legislation—this
can lead to divergent interpretations. In some courts “utilitarian” logic seems to prevail: they
take into account only the direct material damage to the plaintiff as a person, not the broader
166                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      social interest in higher transparency. In potentially landmark cases involving opaque institu-
      tions brought before courts by activists or journalists (who act on behalf of the public’s “right to
      know”), the institutions are administered very lenient penalties.



      5. Compliance
      5.1. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
      The law specifies information that must be published ex officio. This includes:
       • The mission, organization chart, and types of activities of the institution;
       • The working hours and contacts of the main divisions as well as of the civil servants in
         charge with implementing the RTI law; and
       • The most important decisions and documents of the institution.
       • Synopses of the main documents and decisions of the budget and the main activities
         carried out.

           Other laws also require the publication of documents such as those related to public
      budgets. But while basic data (address, hours) is available on many institutions’ websites, this is
      attributable to the gradual penetration of the Internet into society over the past decade.
           Under the new open government initiative, all state bodies are required to set up and
      update their web pages and also approved a regulation about publishing information on these
      websites.38 The Ministry of Information Technology and the Security and Information Service
      is charged with creating the standards for official websites. All public entities are required to
      include a specific line for the operation of these sites in their annual budgets. The regulation
      also included a comprehensive list of information that should be accessible through the web-
      sites.39 The government’s data portal also provides citizens easy and direct access to informa-
      tion held by public bodies in one place. The BOOST project is making databases on public
      expenditures available.40
           However, proactive disclosure should not imply less attention to request-based disclosure.
      For instance, in response to a request by the author, a ministry official suggested that this was
      not necessary as long as all public information is available on its website.41

      5.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
      Although several ministries claim that there is a database on RTI requests, in response to
      requests, they have either stated that they cannot provide the requested information,42 or
      not responded.
           Several ministries pointed out that most of requests are received by phone and e-mail,
      but they are not registered.43 Only those requests that cannot be solved on the spot and are
      docked in a written form, are in fact registered as ATI requests and counted in the formal
      statistics.44 This can be particularly mis-leading at the local level, where much of the interaction
      that happens between local authorities (who are the main service providers for citizens) and
      their clients is verbal and informal. Central bodies are more bureaucratic in their relations with
      citizens; therefore, for them the data presented above is more likely to be closer to the reality
      on the field. However, even here the conflation of petitions and RTI requests creates a further
      layer of inaccuracy.45
A CASE STUDY OF MOLDOVA                                                                                  167




    There are a few private initiatives to monitor and produce quantitative data on the RTI’s
implementation. The most complete is that carried out in 2008–09 by Access-Info, a civil soci-
ety organization. This was a survey of RTI requests by citizens, journalists, and NGOs to public
sector institutions.
    These studies suggest that there is low awareness about RTI among citizens, and as a con-
sequence, a low number of requests. The reports also show little progress in the receptiveness
of public institutions to citizens’ requests (Access-Info 2011b). Though some improvement was
seen between 2007 and 2010 (an increase in responses received from 20.3 percent in 2007 to
34.6 percent in 2010), the overall rate of response remains quite low. More details on this data
are provided in Annex 1.
    There are also significant differences between central and local institutions: central institu-
tions are more responsive to requests, both in terms of the number and quality of answers.
Central institutions also tend to be more aware of the provisions of the law, or simply to have the
means to deal more effectively with requests. But the majority of requests are made at the local
level and the unresponsiveness of local authorities plays an important role in the public’s percep-
tion of this issue. The rayon-level and de-concentrated bodies, which are at an intermediary tier
of governance, range between the national and the local institutions in terms of responsiveness.
    The courts and prosecutors’ offices as well as the police also tend to be more non-
responsive, invoking the need to maintain secrecy of investigations as a reason.46
    Responsiveness to media is seen to be higher, even though they request more “sensitive”
information, potentially because the media tend to be more persistent in their demands.



6. Conclusion
After almost a decade, the RTI system has been very inadequately institutionalized. According
to the stakeholders interviewed, this situation has its roots in weak political ownership (and, as
a result, visibility), and a passive judiciary that is unwilling to create a coherent practice in this
area. Soon after the passage of the law, the Party of Moldovan Communists (PCM) won power
in 2001—the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party returned to power.
The fragmentation of the liberal opposition helped consolidate its power. In the subsequent
years, Moldova’s record on democracy, electoral practices, civil society, independence of
the media, and independence of the judiciary worsened. The Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe (PACE) commented that although the Communist Party came to power in
a democratic way, “it has changed overnight…democratic institutions and violated human
rights.” The Council of Europe (COE) also pointed to a “continuous worsening and radicaliza-
tion of the political climate.”47
     In the March 2005 elections, the PCM lost its constitutional majority. It was able to reelect
its leader, Vladimir Voronin, as the President only after an agreement with the opposition48 in
which some potentially important democratization measures were promised and partly imple-
mented.49 These included measures to ensure independence of the media, independence
of the judiciary, decentralization of local government, greater parliamentary oversight of law
enforcement agencies, reform of the electoral authorities, reform of the Communist Party, and
his resignation as Communist Party chairman. Moldova’s efforts to come closer to the EU also
generated some reform.50 In this political climate, there was little space for implementation or
exercise of the right to information.
168                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           After the 2001 elections, the space for civil action also shrunk considerably. CSO efforts
      focused on monitoring and assessment projects in most cases, and less direct action against
      a specific institution in a flagship case, or strategic litigation. There are more than 3000 NGOs
      registered in Moldova. But only a small number are active and skilled. The civil society sector is
      very weak, generally lacking in institutional capacity and, often, basic equipment, and depen-
      dent on international financing. Media has also been polarized, with its independence called
      into question. The priority in civil society development efforts in Moldova is to invest in capac-
      ity building and the institutional development of NGOs, and continue to expand the space for
      media freedom.
           In the past two years, increased pluralism and political competition has resulted in more
      details about public affairs put into the public domain, and requests for sensitive information
      have also gone up. Following the dissolution of Parliament, elections in July 2009 transferred
      power from the Communist Party of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM), which had ruled the
      country since 2001, to a coalition of four social-democratic and liberal parties calling them-
      selves the Alliance for European Integration (AIE). Led by Prime Minister Vlad Filat and Acting
      President Mihai Ghimpu, the ruling AIE coalition pursued an active reform agenda throughout
      2010, addressing long-standing deficits in the areas of free press, engagement of civil society,
      and judicial reform. A new window of opportunity emerged. The space for public debate is
      now larger and more diverse.51 The open government initiative has boosted Moldova’s profile
      in the international arena,52 and is a potential tool to improve the implementation of the RTI
      law and the law on transparency in decision making.53

                              A Case Study of Peru

1. Introduction
The formal or express defense of the right to information (RTI) is relatively recent in Peru. It was
first acknowledged as an autonomous fundamental right in the 1993 Constitution.1 Almost a
decade passed before this basic right was regulated by Law No. 27806 of August 3, 2002, the
Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information or Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la
Información Pública (LTAIP) that went into effect in January 2003.
     The law was then modified by Law No. 27927 on February 4, 2003, systematized through
a single revised text, adopted through Supreme Decree No. 043-2003-PCM of April 24, 2003,
and later developed through regulations set forth in Supreme Decree No. 072-2003-PCM on
August 7, 2003 (RLTAIP). In addition, transparency and respect for RTI form part of the 29th
governmental policy of the National Accord that was signed in July 2002 by representatives of
the government, leading political groups, and civil society.2
     More than eight years after the passage of LTAIP and its modifications, Peru has the legal
framework and government political will, formally expressed in the National Accord, to guaran-
tee the full exercise of RTI. A reasonable amount of time has passed, enabling the evaluation
of the impact of this legislation in achieving increased transparency in government. It is not a
question of establishing simple targets, because lack of government transparency and difficul-
ties in exercising RTI are associated with broader cultural processes that go beyond problems
related to the development and application of laws. The idea is to eliminate the culture of
secrecy: the notion that government affairs should take place in secret without citizen involve-
ment; this notion is based on the idea of a relationship between the state and citizens in which
the citizens are viewed as passive subjects who do not have the potential to participate in the
government decision-making process except during elections. Although the law mandates
transparent government action and upholds RTI, the practices of public entities tend to conflict
with this.
     The purpose of this report is to analyze, as broadly as possible, the different factors that
favor or hinder the implementation of transparency and access to public information. This
study attempts to provide a dynamic vision of the state of transparency and RTI in Peru by
examining the legal framework and its application by public officials responsible for fulfilling
the different obligations as set forth in the laws that regulate this fundamental right as well as
individuals exercising this right, with an emphasis on results or impact achieved.

          This study examines legal data, including laws, regulations, directives, and jurisprudence as
      well as literature on the subject, including press and academic articles, reports, working docu-
      ments, and other sources. To complement this information, the author interviewed current and
      former officials and public servants as well as members of nongovernmental organizations that
      work in this area.
          This report presents an overview of the key factors and trends that influence the effective
      implementation of RTI. It is divided into five sections. The second section reviews the process
      of adopting RTI legislation. The third section examines core issues in the discussion of legisla-
      tion on RTI and transparency. The fourth part of the report looks at key actions adopted by the
      government to implement and comply with the legislation. Finally, the fifth section offers an
      analysis of the effective exercise of RTI.



      2. Review of Legislation on Access
      to Public Information
      The 1979 Peruvian Constitution did not expressly mention RTI; because of this, the right had
      to be inferred from the law recognizing the right to freedom of expression, and, specifically, to
      seek and receive information. Nevertheless, there were other legal references to RTI during the
      effective period of the 1979 Constitution, although they were insufficient, unsystematic, and
      limited to specific areas or topics.
           One of these laws was the 1984 Organic Law of Municipalities, which regulated the par-
      ticipation of citizens in local government. In so doing, it established that one way to achieve
      participation was through the use of information that should make available by municipalities.3
      The regulations for the Law on Administrative Simplification, adopted by Supreme Decree
      No. 070-89-PCM on September 2, 1989, established that users had the right to access informa-
      tion about the public activities of government bodies that they were obligated to provide.4
           Subsection (5) of Article 2 of the 1993 Constitution recognized RTI for the first time as
      an autonomous, fundamental right.5 The initiative came from the official government party,
      Nueva Mayoría–Cambio 90 (NM-C90) and received support from other political groups repre-
      sented in the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), particularly members its constitutional
      committee.
           It is ironic that the political movement of the government responsible for the self-coup of
      April 1992 would be the one to propose the incorporation of RTI as an autonomous, funda-
      mental right. One plausible explanation for this is that the government needed a constitution
      that would serve to legitimize the new administration and that responded in large measure to
      pressure from the Organization of American States.6 The absence of legislation on RTI dur-
      ing the 1990s, at a time when the public administration was characterized by serious acts of
      corruption,7 suggests that the government included RTI in the 1993 Constitution solely for
      cosmetic reasons. The first bill to regulate RTI (draft bill of Law No. 3903-98-CR, submitted
      August 21, 1998) was not debated much.8
           After the 1993 Constitution went into effect, another important piece of legislation
      adopted was the Single Modified Text of the Law on General Standards of Administrative
      Procedures. It was adopted by Supreme Decree No. 02-94.JUS on January 31, 1994; it circum-
      scribed access to information contained in records on administrative procedures. Along these

same lines was Law No. 27245, the Law on Fiscal Prudence and Transparency, adopted on
December 27, 1999, which required full disclosure by government bodies of information asso-
ciated with government fiscal policy; it also provided access to macroeconomic information.
    Supreme Decree No. 018-2001-PCM was adopted on February 27, 2001 during the interim
government9 led by President Valentín Paniagua Corazao. The law regulated obligations for
transparency and delivery of information by the government bodies mentioned in Legisla-
tive Decree No. 757. Basically, this new law established the obligation of these public entities
to establish a special procedure to guarantee RTI. In March 2001, also during the Paniagua
administration, Urgent Decree No. 035-2001 was enacted, establishing a series of rules to per-
mit access of individuals to public financial information.
    In April 2001, Law No. 27444, the Law on General Administrative Procedure, was adopted.
Article 110 regulated the right to petition or the power of individuals to request information
held by government bodies. In May 2001, the Paniagua administration enacted Supreme
Decree No. 060-2001-PCM, which created the Portal of the Government of Peru, a Web-based
tool designed to develop an interactive information system for citizens and which provides
access to consolidated information on services and procedures of government entities. The
Portal of the Government of Peru was the immediate predecessor of institutional Web sites for
the publication of the proactive public disclosure obligations stipulated in LTAIP, such as the
Standard Transparency Portal. These tools are discussed later in this report.
    Another important norm is Law No. 27482, adopted on June 15, 2001, which regulates the
publication of the Sworn Declaration of Income, Assets, and Revenue for government officials.
Supreme Decree No. 080-2001-PCM of July 8, 2001, established regulations for the law, defin-
ing standard formats for declarations. These laws regulate Articles 40 and 41 of the Constitu-
tion, which establish proactive public disclosure obligations with respect to sworn declarations
of assets and revenues for officials and public servants. Furthermore, through Supreme Decree
No. 031-2002-PCM of May 8, 2002, the “General Policy Guidelines for the Development of the
Electronic System for Government Procurement and Contracts” was adopted, establishing
guidelines for the electronic system for government procurement and contracts (SEACE); this
enabled access to information generated during government contracting procedures.
    Despite the fact that it was formally recognized in the 1993 Constitution, Congress did not
regulate RTI until 2002. Several factors contributed to the adoption of LTAIP (Law No. 27806,
the Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information). The Peruvian Press Council (CPP)10
and the Ombudsman’s Office11 played key roles by signing an inter-institutional agreement,
joining forces to promote the adoption of an information-access law. The CPP, with techni-
cal support from the Ombudsman’s Office and in the framework of its Access to Government
Information Project that began in June 2000, organized a series of meetings to develop guide-
lines for drafting a law on access to public information and government transparency.12
    Journalists and media directors, government opposition leaders, and public servants in
general were invited to these meetings. The CPP had the support of the British Council and
the international NGO Article 19, helping to finance many of the activities and the participation
of national and international experts. A key result from these meetings was the Lima Principles
document of November 2000, which listed 10 principles of transparency and access to public
information to guide legislation and government policies. In an effort to give the Lima Prin-
ciples more institutional support, the document was signed by the OAS Special Rapporteur
for Freedom of Expression at the time, Santiago Cantón, as well as by the former UN Special
Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Abid Hussain.
190                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          While the CPP and the Ombudsman’s Office brought together representatives of the
      armed forces and the national police to participate in several work meetings, officials from
      both institutions were especially resistant to the idea of exercising RTI in the context of
      national defense and domestic order, respectively. For this reason, in April 2002, an addendum
      to the eighth principle of the Lima Principles was signed that developed the contents of the
      exception of national security in military, domestic order, intelligence, and government foreign
      affairs contexts.
          Since its establishment, the Ombudsman’s Office has implemented, through its Bureau
      of Constitutional Affairs, the promotion and defense of freedom of expression and RTI. For
      example, in November 2000, in Ombudsman Report No. 48, the Ombudsman’s Office urged
      the Congress to pass a law to regulate RTI, as recognized in Subsection 5 of Article 2 of the
      Constitution, and proposed a set of guidelines to that end.13 Also of note is the support pro-
      vided by the Press and Society Institute (Instituto Prensa and Sociedad, IPYS—an organization
      of journalists) as well as by the Legal Defense Institute (Instituto de Defensa Legal, IDL—whose
      representatives actively participated in the preparation of the addendum to the Lima Prin-
      ciples). Both organizations contributed by sharing their opinions and proposals at several of
      the work meetings.
          A second factor that facilitated the adoption of Law No. 27806 was the context of recovery
      of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption that began in late 2000. A video
      made public on September 14, 2000, showed a top Fujimori advisor bribing a congressman of
      the opposition to persuade him to join the government party. This proved fertile ground for
      the development of several initiatives enacted after 2000 to improve government transparency
      and guarantee RTI, as the previously mentioned laws indicate. These laws were the immediate
      predecessors of Law No. 27806.14 Legislators of diverse political viewpoints supported RTI.15
          Most of the draft legislation was submitted by representatives of the new government
      administration of the Perú Posible party (2001–06), which had made campaign promises to
      fight corruption. This objective was shared with the other Fujimori opposition groups, such
      as the APRA party, whose representatives developed draft bills. A multiparty group called the
      Congressional Working Group on Transparency of Government Action and Citizen Participa-
      tion was formed in 2002.16 This group reviewed and analyzed draft bills and prepared substitu-
      tion text. In addition to the participation of the CPP and the Ombudsman’s Office, the working
      group convened the IPYS. The Ombudsman’s Office stated about the law:

         “…it was the result of a unique effort of the Congress since it received and accepted
         suggestions for its preparation from a variety of institutions. At the level of civil society,
         for example, the Peruvian Press Council and the Press and Society Institute made key
         contributions. Likewise, the Ombudsman’s Office provided several reports and opinions
         on this issue to the Congress. All of this contributed to a law to promote citizen access
         to information and transparency in public bodies. To this end, many of its provisions
         attempted to go into great detail since the goal was to impede the culture of secrecy
         from being able to take refuge in vague and imprecise laws.”17

          The chairwoman of the Working Group, Ana Elena Townsend, demonstrated her com-
      mitment to the issue and encouraged broad-based participation of organizations interested
      in promoting the law. The working group took into account the consensus achieved at the
      work meetings organized by the CPP and incorporated many areas of agreement in the draft
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                191




legislation that eventually became the LTAIP. After being approved by the Congressional Com-
mittee on the Constitution, Regulations and Constitutional Accusations, the bill was passed
by Congress, becoming Law 27806, the Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information
(LTAIP), on August 3, 2002; it went into effect in January 2003.
     Although this law incorporated many of the criteria proposed by the CPP, IPYS, and the
Ombudsman’s Office as well as the agreements achieved by the Congressional Working Group
on Transparency of Government Action, at the end of the legislative process, some restric-
tions were introduced that limited RTI. For example, a special procedure was established
for requesting information from the armed forces and national police, and limitations were
incorporated in the exceptions concerning national security. In September 2003, in response
to this situation, the Ombudsman’s Office filed a petition of unconstitutionality against those
provisions. The Congress subsequently repealed them through Law No. 27927 of February 4,
2003. In March 2003, this action led the Constitutional Tribunal to declare that it had no
grounds to issue a ruling in the case. As a result of this modification and in an effort to con-
solidate in a single text the reforms of Law No. 27927, the executive branch adopted, through
Supreme Decree No. 043-2003-PCM of April 24, 2003, the Single Modified Text (TUO) of Law
No. 27806.18 On August 7, 2003, the regulations of the TUO of Law No. 27806 were adopted
through Supreme Decree No. 072-2003-PCM in accordance with the mandate established in
the first of the Transitory, Complementary and Final Provisions of the TUO of Law No. 27806.19




3. Key Issues Surrounding the Debate
on Law No. 27806
This section briefly examines some of the issues raised during the debates about the passage
of LTAIP. These issues continue to be subjects of discussion and disagreement.20 The main
content of LTAIP is provided in Annex 1.

3.1. LEGAL PROVISIONS ON EXCEPTIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
ASSOCIATED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY
A key aspect of all laws that attempt to recognize, develop, or guarantee RTI is the regime of
exceptions that define the limits of the exercise of this fundamental right. An initial contro-
versy emerged concerning the types or categories of exceptions that should be established.
In the functioning of public bodies, several categories of exceptions existed, although there
were no clear criteria for their existence. The following were often cited, among others: secret,
reserved, confidential, top secret, and highly confidential. In some cases, these categories
were recognized in sector regulations (in other words, by the same bodies that applied them).
    There were early discussions about whether the number of categories should be main-
tained or reduced. It was finally decided that the categories should be reduced to the mini-
mum possible because they limit the exercise of a fundamental right and the principle of
transparency. It was agreed that only the following categories would remain: secret, reserved,
and confidential.
    Another area of discussion concerned the specific contents of each category. Initially,
members of the armed forces and the national police rejected the idea that access would be
192                                            RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      permitted to information associated with any aspect of national security and domestic order.
      After several meetings organized by the CPP, members of the armed forces and national police
      were persuaded that they needed to demonstrate a willingness to be transparent in light of
      their negative public image that resulted from high-ranking officials from these institutions the
      participating in the Fujimori government, and specifically, in cases of corruption.
          This process led to the signing of an addendum to the eighth principle of the Lima Prin-
      ciples in April 2002; it included the exception of national security in the context of the military,
      domestic order, intelligence, and foreign affairs. The CPP, in cooperation with the Ombuds-
      man’s Office and IDL, made important contributions to this effort.

      3.2. TIME LIMITS FOR RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
      Specialists, representatives of the Ombudsman’s Office, and journalists who participated in the
      meetings organized by the CPP defended the establishment of short time limits for respond-
      ing to requests to access information. But, in general, public officials preferred longer time
      limits, like the 30-work day deadline for concluding administrative procedures, in accordance
      with Law No. 27444, the Law of General Administrative Procedure.
          Officials argued in favor of this last option, citing the difficulties involved in locating certain
      information in the institutional archives or in requesting the information from other areas; they
      also cited the large number of requests to be processed. In response to these arguments,
      representatives of the Ombudsman’s Office and journalists claimed that delivering informa-
      tion long after it was requested could render it useless or untimely for those soliciting it. For
      this reason, they argued, short time limits should be established. They also pointed out that
      short deadlines could serve as positive incentives for improving information storage and
      organization as well as for improving internal information-flow procedures. They asserted that
      every request should be evaluated to determine if an extension to the time limit was justified
      and that this potential situation could be regulated. The final bill set the regular deadline for
      responding to requests at seven working days; an exceptional deadline was established that
      provided five additional working days for cases requiring more time, as long as the individual
      requesting the information was notified before the regular deadline.

      3.3. COST OF INFORMATION REQUESTS
      The cost of requests to access information was another disputed issue. Public servants partici-
      pating at the meetings convened by the CPP defended the inclusion of items like paper for
      photocopying requested documents, the salaries of individuals assigned to respond to infor-
      mation requests, and, all general costs directly or indirectly related to reproducing requested
      information. There were two reasons given for this position: (1) it would discourage “excessive”
      or numerous requests; and (2) it would transfer the costs of requests to users. The government,
      it was asserted, while it was obligated to deliver information, was not obligated to finance
      requests for information from citizens; the Constitution should have stipulated that individuals
      requesting information would have to cover these costs.
           For their part, experts, Public Ombudsman representatives and journalists argued that the
      disproportionate costs of these information requests would, in practice, impede or discourage
      the exercise of this fundamental right, transforming it into only a symbolic right. Therefore,
      the “cost” of the request that, in accordance with Article 2, Subsection 5 of the Constitution,
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                       193




should be assumed by the user, should also be restrictively interpreted. The cost should be
limited to “cost of reproduction” of the information; it should not include other expenses
normally assumed by the government, like salaries and infrastructure, as examples. Eventually,
these criteria were adopted in LTAIP and its regulations.

3.4. INCLUSION OF PRIVATE COMPANIES PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICES IN LTAIP
Another controversial issue was whether or not LTAIP should apply to private companies
providing public services or specifically, if public information held by a company could be
requested by the government bodies that regulate their activity (in other words, in an indirect
manner). This led to a technical discussion about which methods were legally appropriate
and which would result in the fewest future legal problems. Ultimately, it was decided that
LTAIP should apply to these companies, but the exercise of RTI was limited to aspects of the
company associated with the public services it provided, their rates, and their administrative
operations. a reasonable limitation since it only refers to the areas of public interest that these
private companies manage.

3.5. THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL PROACTIVE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
OBLIGATIONS THROUGH WEB SITES
The limited development of Web-based technology in local governments (the country has more
than 1,800 local government administrations) led to a discussion regarding the pertinence of
establishing a set of proactive disclosure obligations that had to be fulfilled through institutional
Web sites. There was a problem both with a lack of Internet service and limited technical capabili-
ties of staff to administer institutional Web sites. In response, it was proposed that public disclosure
obligations via institutional portals should only be applicable to provincial governments (there are
approximately 195 countrywide). However, it was decided that the obligation would apply to all
local governments, although it was stipulated that the Web sites could be developed progressively.
     Finally, a discussion ensued on the possibility of creating an oversight authority to ensure
compliance with Law No. 27806, but this idea was discarded rapidly because citizens tend to
reject the creation of new government institutions, concerned that they expand government
bureaucracy. To avoid a lengthy debate that could endanger the adoption of LTAIP, it was
decided not to make this measure a priority.



4. Implementation of Legislation on
Transparency and Access to Public Information
This section examines the process for implementing legislation on transparency and access
to public information. It first looks at the norms that complement the regime for access to
information established in LTAIP. This section reviews the functions and duties of the differ-
ent public entities that have responsibilities related to information access. Third, it examines
the technical and organizational capacity of public bodies to manage information. Finally, this
section discusses some key considerations for implementing the legislation, such as training of
public servants.
194                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      4.1. COMPLEMENTARY NORMS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH LTAIP
      Complementary norms of LTAIP include both legal rules and regulations. Some of the main
      complementary norms are discussed in the two subsections below. More detailed information
      on these norms appears in Annex 2.

      4.1.1. Legal Rules

      The first rules of note are compiled in the Code of Constitutional Procedure, adopted through
      Law No. 28237 of May 31, 2004, and which went into effect in December 2004. The Code of
      Constitutional Procedure regulates the action of habeas data to defend RTI in the justice
      system.21 When an entity subject to LTAIP faces a RTI violation, the only administrative require-
      ment to begin the review procedure is a written information request that includes a specific
      date and the refusal of the entity to provide the information or the lack of response to the
      request within the time limit established by law. Additionally, the Code of Constitutional
      Procedure establishes a single time limit of 10 workdays to respond to information requests.
      Thus, it extends the regular deadline stipulated in LTAIP by three workdays but eliminates the
      extraordinary deadline of an additional five workdays. However, despite the definition of this
      new time limit, the regular and extraordinary deadlines established in LTAIP are still frequently
      applied. In many cases, this is because the public servants responsible for responding to
      requests for information are unfamiliar with the Code of Constitutional Procedure.
           Finally, one provision of the Code of Constitutional Procedure has not generated in prac-
      tice the beneficial effects for the protection of RTI that were expected. In the case of habeas
      data proceedings, the provision calls for the elimination of mandatory legal representation.
      This norm was intended to help individuals whose RTI had not been respected by a govern-
      ment body defend their right of access in the justice system.
           But, in practice, this has not occurred. According to IPYS, which has extensive experience
      making requests to and filing complaints against the government, filing an action of habeas
      data without a legal defense hurts the plaintiffs. This is because litigation requires a certain
      level of specialization in the application of procedural norms. Further, judges tend to require
      excessively bureaucratic procedures that are not common knowledge among citizens. Finally,
      government bodies are defended by public prosecutors, thereby generating a technical imbal-
      ance in the litigation, to the detriment of plaintiffs.22
           Another important norm is Law No. 28664, Law of the National Intelligence System (SINA)
      along with the National Intelligence Directorate (DINI), adopted on January 4, 2006. One nega-
      tive aspect of this law is that it establishes longer time limits than LTAIP for the declassification
      of information: 20 years for secret information, 15 years for reserved information, and 10 years
      for confidential information. According to LTAIP, secret information is declassified after five
      years; reserved and confidential information are declassified after the reasons for their clas-
      sification no longer exist. Therefore, intelligence information classified as secret can be made
      public only after four presidential terms have passed; information classified as reserved or
      confidential can be kept from public access even after the reasons for their classification cease
      to exist, for 15 and 10 years, respectively. This is clearly a setback in terms of transparency of
      the military sector and represents a return to the inclination toward secrecy that has tradition-
      ally been present in this sector. The five-year time limit for categorizing information as secret
      in LTAIP does not prevent the extension of this exception past the deadline, as long as it is
      deemed justified; therefore, there is no reason for having modified this regime.23
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                   195




     A third key norm is Law No. 29091 of September 26, 2007 that modified Paragraph 38.3,
Article 38 of Law No. 27444 (Law on General Administrative Procedure). It reiterates the proac-
tive public disclosure obligations of entities subject to the law by mandating that public bodies
must publish their management tools, guidelines, directives, and regulations on the Portal
of the Government of Peru and on their own institutional Web sites, and they must specify
that the information is of an official nature and worth. It also establishes that responsibility for
publishing the information rests with the public servant in charge of the transparency portal.
Moreover, it states that not fulfilling these functions is a serious offense punishable by dis-
missal. The law mandates that the Comptroller General of the Republic is responsible for the
timely control over due compliance with public disclosure obligations.
     Fourth is Legislative Decree No. 1031 of June 24, 2008, which aims to improve the effi-
ciency of government business activities. The fifth of its Complementary, Transitory and Modi-
fying Provisions regulates the concept of trade secret. According to Subsection 2 of Article 17
of the decree, a trade secret is a valid exception to RTI, which is covered by confidential
information. While trade secret is defined in a law that regulates government business activity,
it can also be applied to protect trade secrets of private companies, in accordance with LTAIP.
     Finally, Law No. 29733, the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LPPD), adopted on
July 3, 2011, also deserves mentioning. Although this law refers to the fundamental right
to protect personal data recognized by the Constitution, it contains provisions that should
be harmonized with LTAIP. For example, the income of public officials is considered public
information in LTAIP but is sensitive information in LPPD. This difference has already generated
discrepancies among government bodies as to whether or not the salaries of public servants
are public information. In addition, the LPPD created the National Authority for the Protection
of Personal Data, which has several functions associated with the implementation of and com-
pliance with the law. The fact that no such mechanism exists for RTI could lead to the predomi-
nance of the right to protect information over RTI.

4.1.2. Regulatory Norms

This subsection describes key general regulatory norms; in other words, ones that are applica-
ble to all bodies subject to LTAIP. Many public entities have issued regulations and directives,
but these are procedural or organic provisions about the general obligations of each entity.
General regulatory norms include the following:
 • Regulations of Law No. 29091, adopted through Supreme Decree No. 004-2008-PCM of
   January 18, 2008. This norm develops some aspects of the law that establish the obliga-
   tion of government bodies to publish a variety of legal provisions on the Portal of the
   Government of Peru and on institutional Web sites.
 • Regulatory norms adopted by the Office of the President of the Ministerial Cabinet (PCM).
 • Ministerial Resolution No. 398-2008 of December 2, 2008, which adopted Directive No. 004-
   2008-PCM/SGP, Guidelines for the Standardization of the Content of Transparency Portals of
   Public Entities. This norm contributes by establishing guidelines to ensure that transparency
   portals are developed and made available to citizens using standard formats and contents in
   order to eliminate the differences that existed that did not favor public access.
 • Ministerial Resolution No. 126-2009-PCM of March 25, 2009, which adopted Guidelines for
   the Accessibility of Web Sites and Applications for Mobile Telephony. This technical norm
   was designed to improve the accessibility of the Web sites of government bodies.
196                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




       • Supreme Decree No. 063-2010-PCM of June 3, 2010, which approved the implementation
         of the Standard Transparency Portal.
       • Ministerial Resolution No. 200-2010-PCM of June 24, 2010, which adopted Directive
         No. 001-2010-PCM/SGP, “Guidelines for the Implementation of the Standard Transparency
         Portal in Public Entities.”

           These regulatory norms favor RTI in that they contribute to the increase in compliance with
      the proactive public disclosure obligations for entities subject to LTAIP. They also promote
      access to information through institutional Web sites.
           Also of note is Ministerial Resolution No. 301-2009-PCM of July 9, 2009, which adopted
      Directive No. 003-2009-PCM/SGP, Guidelines for the Report on Requests for Access to
      Information to Be Submitted to the Office of the President of the Ministerial Cabinet. These
      guidelines seek to improve the collection and quality of information from government bodies
      to the PCM on processed and unprocessed requests to access information. This information
      serves as input for the executive branch office’s annual report, which is submitted to Congress
      in accordance with Article 22.
           Finally, there are two specific, complementary regimes for applying the general principles
      of transparency and the list of exceptions. The first, a special regime regulated by Law No.
      27482, adopted on June 15, 2001, calls for public disclosure of sworn declarations of income,
      assets, and revenues of public servants as well as access to these declarations. Furthermore,
      the regime of transparency and access to information on government contracts and procure-
      ment, established by Supreme Decree No. 031-2002-PCM (May 8, 2002), set guidelines for the
      development of SEACE (an electronic system of government procurement and contracts) and
      by Legislative Decree No. 1017, which adopted the Law on Government Contracts.

      4.2. ENTITIES AND OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH LTAIP
      This subsection identifies the public officials and entities responsible for complying with the
      provisions of LTAIP and complementary norms, or those that, without having explicit legal
      responsibilities, have assumed this responsibility as part of their overall functions. Table 1 lists
      these entities and their functions.

      4.2.1. Responsible Parties within the Entities Subject to LTAIP

      LTAIP establishes various levels of responsibility:
       • Individuals responsible for adopting the measures necessary to guarantee the exercise of
         the RTI as part of their duties. This is the responsibility of the highest ranking official of the
         entity [RLTAIP paragraph (a), Article 3].
       • Three employees24 designated by the director of the entity [paragraphs (b) and (c) of
         Articles 3 and 5 of the RLTAIP] will be responsible for:
       • Providing information [in other words, for responding to requests to access public informa-
         tion (Article 8 of LTAIP)].
       • Resolving first appeals when the possibility of this is provided for and when the individual
         requesting information chooses this mechanism [RLTAIP, paragraph (e), Article 5].
       • Managing portals [in other words, the employees responsible for fulfilling the proactive
         disclosure obligations of the entities (Article 5 of LTAIP)].

          In accordance with the organization of each entity, the duties of the responsible parties
      stipulated by LTAIP include:25
       • Receiving requests (physically, via the web, or both).
       • Forwarding requests to pertinent parties, sending to the corresponding area, and search-
         ing for the information in the central archive or in external storage areas.
       • Following up with requests (for example, with a computer notification system, by e-mail, or
         by telephone).
       • Conduct pertinent consultations with the legal area if necessary.
       • Delivering information to individuals requesting it (physically or through the web).
       • Overseeing and updating the Web site.

           As discussed at the Third National Conference on Access to Public Information (October
      2010), most government bodies do not have internal policies to ensure compliance with the
      obligations stipulated in LTAIP for each entity (for example, a regime of internal responsibilities
      to respond to information requests). Internal policies are important because they help ensure
      that the obligations of the legislation on access to public information are adapted to the char-
      acteristics of each entity and promote their compliance within entities.
           Although LTAIP stipulates that noncompliance with its contents constitutes a serious
      offense and may result in a criminal charge of abuse of authority, compliance ultimately
      depends on the director of the entity. An example of this is Mayoral Resolution No. 1364-
      2010-MPT of December 16, 2010, by which the Mayor of the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo
      suspended a municipal official for 30 days without pay for failing to respond in a timely fashion
      to a request of access to public information.26
           Failure to comply with the obligations may result in different types of sanctions. Criminal
      sanctions have included the sentence handed down on September 17, 2008, by the Criminal
      Court of the Superior Court of Justice of Moquegua–Ilo (File No. 2007-328—Acum. 2007-
      398). The court ruled that two officials of the Provincial Municipality of Ilo were criminally
      responsible for committing the offense of omission and delay of functions against the public
      administration, as defined in Article 377 of the Criminal Code,27 for having responded to a
      request for information after the deadline and for having failed to deliver part of the informa-
      tion requested. However, the court ruled for a one-year suspended sentence, during which
      time the defendants had to abide by rules of conduct. The court also awarded civil damages
      to the plaintiff—the individual who requested the information—in the amount of 1,500 nuevos
      soles.28 The ruling referred to the crime of omission, refusal, or delay of functions rather than
      to the crime of abuse of authority defined in Article 376 of the Criminal Code,29 which Article 4
      of LTAIP expressly stipulates is the applicable offense in the case of noncompliance with the
      obligations established in that law.
           Administrative and criminal sanctions for RTI violations are not rules, however. Citizens
      affected by noncompliance have three channels for demanding restitution of their RTI (not-
      withstanding the administrative appeal which, after the Code of Constitutional Procedure went
      into effect, became optional for the affected party): (1) appeal to a superior of the employee
      that did not respond to the request; (2) file a complaint with the Ombudsman’s Office; and/or
      (3) file a legal suit through a constitutional action of habeas data. However, this requires report-
      ing the incident and maintaining the complaint over time, which is generally an onerous task,
      especially in the case of the first two options. At any rate, even if these claims are accepted,
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                   199




their resolution will be limited to the parties involved and will not be applied as a general rule
except in the case of legal proceedings that reach the Constitutional Tribunal and after this
entity declares that its ruling is binding.
    Moreover, in the case of an action of habeas data, an individual can only claim that his
or her RTI was affected because his or her request for information had not been resolved. To
lodge a complaint of noncompliance with proactive public disclosure obligations requires filing
out a compliance petition, the processing of which implies a higher level of specialization than
the habeas data action, given that the requirements of this constitutional procedure, in addi-
tion to those of the Constitution and the Code of Constitutional Procedure, were developed
by the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Tribunal.


4.2.2. Office of the President of the Ministerial Cabinet

PCM is the ministry responsible for coordinating the national and sectoral policies of the
executive branch. It coordinates with the other branches of government, constitutional entities,
regional governments, local governments, and civil society. The PCM’s Public Administration
Secretariat and Coordination Secretariat have RTI and proactive public disclosure obligations.
Both secretariats report to the General Secretariat and are organized in technical teams to
perform their assigned duties.
     The main mission of the Public Administration Secretariat (SGP) is to coordinate and
oversee the process of modernizing the public administration. Its tasks are related to the
functioning and organization of the state, administrative simplification, ethics, and transpar-
ency in accordance with the norms of government modernization, rationalization, decentraliza-
tion, internal control, and the government code of ethics. To fulfill these functions, it is divided
into 12 thematic areas. The SGP is organized into four work groups or technical components:
(1) modernization; (2) structure and operations; (3) administrative simplification; and (4) ethics
and transparency.
     The SGP inherited the ethics and transparency functions from the former National Anti-
corruption Office (ONA). The ONA was created through the Supreme Decree No. 085-2007-
PCM of October 19, 2007. Its anticorruption functions included “developing measures to
prevent corruption that especially affects access to public information, transparency, and
citizen oversight.”
     The ONA was short-lived, closed through Supreme Decree No. 057-2008-PCM on
August 15, 2008.30 This decree modified the Regulations for the Organization and Functions of
the PCM, specifically the articles that regulate the functions of the Public Administration Secre-
tariat. The SGP was charged with: “proposing norms and adopting directives on government
functioning and organization, ethics, and transparency.”
     The SGP exercised this function in the framework of its Ethics and Transparency technical
component. Specific SGP resources allocated to activities in transparency and access to infor-
mation are very limited. From 2008–10, ethics and transparency functions were assigned to two
SGP employees.31 Their work focused on the promotion of regulatory norms on specific issues
related to the proactive public disclosure obligations of the entities subject to LTAIP.32
     The SGP, with technical assistance from the PCM’s National Government Office of Elec-
tronics and Computing (ONGEI), developed the Standard Transparency Portal.33 This portal
is designed to resolve the problem of diverse formats, inadequate content, duplicate infor-
mation, and outdated data on the institutional portals referred to in LTAIP. This is an effort
200                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      to facilitate the ordered, rapid, and friendly access to the information that public entities are
      obligated to publish. The portal is an important tool for citizen access to a large volume of
      relevant information. Because the resources for this work were limited, the German coopera-
      tion agency, GTZ provided financial support for the design and development of the portal. The
      Standard Transparency Portal was designed based on the following criteria:
       • Use of friendly, informative icons
       • Use of clear language that can be easily understood by users
       • Presentation of budget information with statistical graphs
       • Inclusion of comprehensive information on government contracting
       • Listing of government suppliers
       • Inclusion of information on investment projects of government bodies34

           The Standard Transparency Portal was implemented in two phases.35 The SGP organized
      a program for the implementation of the Standard Transparency Portal to provide techni-
      cal assistance to government bodies nationwide.36 To this end, through October 2010, four
      technical assistance meetings were held in central government offices to train 376 participants.
      Regional technical assistance meetings were also held in Cajamarca, Cañete, Ica, Lambayeque,
      La Libertad, Huancavelica, Junín, Moquegua, Tacna, Pasco, Huánuco, Piura, Tumbes, Ama-
      zonas, San Martín, Loreto, and Arequipa with a total of 633 participants. By October 2010,
      13 ministries, 32 decentralized public agencies, 12 programs, 2 projects, 9 regional govern-
      ments, and 8 local governments had implemented institutional Web sites.37
           Although significant progress was made in achieving the objectives of the first phase, the
      implementation of the Standard Transparency Portal is now experiencing some difficulties.38 In
      2011, the change in municipal, regional, and central government officials affected the continu-
      ation of this process. Many local and regional government officials trained in the implementa-
      tion of this tool are no longer in office.39 Moreover, the two officials who launched and coached
      the implementation of this tool in the SGP are no longer employed at the PCM. Some experts
      interviewed for this report have identified problems with the integration and updating of some
      of the databases that provide input for the Standard Transparency Portal. Basically, a few gov-
      ernment bodies are unwilling to share their databases or to permit other entities to use them.
           The difficulties mentioned, in addition to others, like the lack of updated information on
      portals, largely reflect the lack of political will to implement the Standard Transparency Portal.
      In many cases, economic resources are not needed; what is lacking is a decision by the highest-
      ranking officials in each government body to fulfill the objectives that justified the creation of
      the institutional portals.
           In addition to providing technical assistance with the Standard Transparency Portal,
      between 2009–10, the SGP attempted to train the national officials responsible and to build
      their RTI capacities. There are few available resources for these activities, however, for which
      reason the entities requesting the training had to cover the costs themselves, as was the case
      for the Puno regional government.
           The PCM’s Coordination Secretariat (SC) is responsible for all functions associated with
      multisectoral action and relations with other government agencies. It is organized into four
      teams: (1) national policies; (2) multisectoral commissions; (3) regulations; and (4) transparency.
      This last team is responsible for “collecting information from all entities of the public admin-
      istration on resolved and unresolved requests for information, in accordance with the Law
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                201




on Transparency and Access to Public Information, and for preparing the annual report to be
submitted to Congress.”
    To this end, it requires information on resolved and unresolved requests from all entities
subject to LTAIP. This Secretariat is responsible for preparing the annual report that the PCM
submits to Congress, in accordance with Article 22 of LTAIP. A later section of this document
discusses these reports and other data to evaluate the exercise of RTI.
    It is evident that neither the SGP nor the SC have the specific authority to oversee the
level of governmental respect for RTI. Each exercises only limited functions in this regard: the
establishment of technical standards through directives or guidelines; coordination, training, or
coaching; and consultative functions, mostly regarding proactive public disclosure obligations.
Moreover, these are third-level offices in the hierarchy of institutions that implement these
(along with many other) activities in the context of limited human and economic resources
available for achieving desired results.


4.2.3. The Ombudsman’s Office

Since its founding, the Ombudsman’s Office has worked to promote transparency and access
to public information in the framework of its constitutional functions. The Ombudsman’s
Office played a key role in the preparation and adoption of LTAIP. In accordance with
Articles 161 and 162 of the Constitution, and Article 1 of Law No. 26520 (Organic Law of the
Ombudsman’s Office), this institution is an autonomous constitutional body of persuasive
control; in other words, its authority does not involve the use of coercion. Instead, it operates
as a magistracy of persuasion. The Ombudsman’s Office has three broad areas of responsibil-
ity: (1) the defense of constitutional and fundamental rights of the individual and the com-
munity; (2) oversight of compliance with the functions of the government administration; and
(3) adequate delivery of public services. To exercise these responsibilities, the Ombudsman’s
Office is organized into seven specialized bureaus40 and seven thematic programs.41 The
Ombudsman’s Office exercises these functions nationwide through 28 public defense offices
and 10 service modules.
     The Ombudsman’s Office has several areas of responsibility, one of which is associated with
RTI and government transparency implemented mainly through the Bureau of Constitutional
Affairs; the Government Administration Bureau’s Decentralization and Good Governance
Program; and the Program for Public Ethics, Corruption Prevention, and Public Policies. In this
area, the Ombudsman’s Office performs the following functions:
 • Receives citizen complaints of RTI violations.
 • Publishes reports on specific aspects of legislation on transparency and access to
   information.42
 • Prepares periodic reports on compliance with proactive public disclosure obligations by
   regional governments through their portals. These reports have been produced since
   January 2004 and, beginning in 2008, have included the supervision of the Web sites of
   local governments located in departmental capitals.43
 • Raises awareness of and trains public servants and civil society in transparency and access
   to public information.44
 • Monitors public policies on transparency and access to information, promotion of ethics in
   government, and prevention of government corruption.
202                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          While all of these activities significantly contribute to the upholding of RTI and proactive
      public disclosure obligations, the capacity of this institution to ensure ongoing compliance
      with LTAIP is inadequate for the following reasons: (1) it has several areas of responsibility and
      activities in addition to those associated with RTI and transparency; (2) activities in the area
      of access to information and transparency focus on specific aspects of these issues and do
      not address them as a whole; (3) the maintenance, expansion, or strengthening of this work
      area depends on institutional priorities and/or the will of its directors, making them subject to
      change with new management; and (4) the office issues recommendations but does not have
      direct coercive authority even though it is authorized to promote constitutional proceedings.
          Despite these limitations, the Ombudsman’s Office has significant institutional advantages
      for promoting the implementation of and effective compliance with LTAIP. First, it enjoys a
      high level of legitimacy and credibility, enables it to convene broad sectors of the population
      as well as to form strategic partnerships with social organizations to defend rights and ensure
      that government bodies fulfill their duties.45 In addition, the Ombudsman’s Office operates in
      a decentralized manner in provincial offices and mobile units. This enables the institution to
      obtain information from the areas under its jurisdiction and to extend the impact of its activi-
      ties throughout the country.
          Finally, the successful exercise of persuasive authority (the magistracy of persuasion) by
      the Ombudsman’s Office has enabled it to exercise leadership that is reflected in high levels
      of social acceptance. The persuasive, noncoercive nature of its decisions, far from being a
      disadvantage, significantly contribute to the achievement of its institutional objectives because
      they allow the office to exercise its influence in a variety of ways (through public declarations
      or reports, for example) in its efforts to promote good government practices and respect for
      fundamental rights.46 Given these strengths, the Ombudsman’s Office is called upon to play a
      key role in the implementation of and compliance with LTAIP.

      4.2.4. Office of the Comptroller General

      The Office of the Comptroller General (CGR) is the highest-ranking body of the National
      System for Government Control, which is responsible for overseeing the legality of the
      implementation of the public budget, public debt operations, and the acts of the government
      bodies under its jurisdiction. Each public body has an institutional control office that reports
      to the CGR and that normally conducts government monitoring activities. The CGR oversees
      compliance with obligations derived from legislation on RTI and transparency in the Annual
      Control Plan.47 The CGR attempts to balance its obligations to oversee transparency and RTI
      with its other legal obligations.48
          Law No. 29091 mandates government bodies publish a series of management tools on
      their institutional Web sites and stipulates that the CGR is the institution responsible for
      supervising and controlling the due and timely compliance with the law. The law reinforces
      and defines proactive disclosure obligations, many of which were previously mentioned in
      LTAIP. This law is innovative in that it expressly appointed the CGR as the oversight body over
      compliance with these obligations. Based on this law, some experts on access to information
      and transparency have recommended that the CGR be assigned the function of monitoring
      or supervising compliance of government bodies with LTAIP. They understand that compli-
      ance with LTAIP directly contributes to the prevention of corruption and to the adequate use
      of public resources that, in accordance with the principle of legality, the CGR is responsible for
      overseeing. Thus, the CGR, through its institutional control offices (OCIs), oversees compliance
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                        203




of the obligations established by LTAIP and promotes the application of disciplinary measures
against public servants who fail to comply with these obligations.
     Nevertheless, there are two reasons why it is not plausible for the CGR to become the guar-
antor institution for compliance with LTAIP. First, the CGR focuses its institutional efforts on fulfill-
ing its constitutional and legal mandate (on monitoring the legality of public spending). Second,
through its OCIs, the CGR monitors government institutions that have limited human and mate-
rial resources; therefore, the scope and intensity of monitoring mostly depends on the capabili-
ties and resources of each OCI. If the CGR were to monitor compliance with LTAIP obligations, it
would not have enough time or resources to fulfill its legal and constitutional mandate.
     Further, many LTAIP obligations require periodic compliance and should be monitored
accordingly. The CGR must also fulfill its supervisory obligations in Law No. 29091 and other
oversight obligations established in laws that do not necessarily take into account its institu-
tional capabilities. For example, Article 8 of Law No. 29060, the Law on Administrative Silence,
establishes that the OCI of public bodies must oversee compliance with deadlines, require-
ments, and procedures to ensure that they are implemented in accordance with the corre-
sponding Single Ordered Text for Administrative Procedures (TUPA). Likewise, the OCI are
required to prepare and submit to the entity director a monthly report on the status of compli-
ance with administrative procedures as well as on responsibilities identified for non-compli-
ance with the Law on General Administrative Procedure, the Law on Administrative Silence,
and on those associated with complaints by citizens. It is evident that fulfilling this obligation
as well as those originating from RTI legislation would be beyond OCI capabilities.
     In sum, although the CGR can contribute to efforts at ensuring compliance with LTAIP obli-
gations, it can only continue to partially do so in a way that is subordinate to the fulfillment of
core CGR functions. In addition, OCI human and material resource capabilities must be taken
into account when planning annual oversight actions and activities.


4.2.5. Debate on the Need for an Independent Administrative Authority
to Oversee Compliance with LTAIP Obligations

The capability restraints for collecting, administering, and disseminating information associ-
ated with the limitations of the archive system as well as the absence of an institution with the
capacity or authority to ensure ongoing, full compliance with LTAIP obligations, affect the level
of implementation and exercise of RTI.
    Civil society leaders and experts participating in the Third National Conference on Access to
Public Information49 organized by the IPYS in October 2010 concluded that: “An autonomous/
independent technical body is needed to promote and guarantee government transparency
and the right of access to public information. This body will also exercise advisory functions in
the government.”50
    During the Fourth National Conference on Access to Public Information (September 21–22,
2011), Dr. Eduardo Vega Luna, the Interim Ombudsman, called for the creation of an indepen-
dent authority to guarantee and monitor compliance with LTAIP obligations. This proposal was
well received at the conference during a thematic roundtable organized to discuss the pro-
posal.51 Roundtable participants justified the proposal based on the following considerations:
 • This issue is a priority in the region (Mexico and Chile have made advances in this area)
 • The PCM reports are inadequate
 • Information management is poor
204                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         This authority should have the following characteristics:
       • Autonomy, independence
       • Technical specialization

         This authority would have the following functions:
       • Conduct research to improve public policy
       • Supervise and ensure compliance with LTAIP
       • Provide training in and promotion of RTI
       • Resolve citizen complaints in administrative proceedings (to avoid taking the complaint to
         the justice system)
       • Resolve consultations concerned with contradictions in the law
       • Issue rulings in administrative proceedings
       • Support archive management and administration

           Participants also mentioned some challenges in achieving the objectives of the proposal.
      These included the need to generate the political will to create the authority, to have an ade-
      quate budget, and to determine the most appropriate institutional design (for example, whether
      it should be a collegiate body or a single office and what level of autonomy it should have) and
      its institutional position within the government structure. This debate demonstrates how the
      experience of implementing a law can build consensus concerning its modification with a view
      to improving levels of compliance. While forming a specific oversight body for LTAIP was almost
      unanimously rejected during the debate prior to the law’s adoption, there now appears to be
      significant agreement with respect to the advantages of an institution of this type.

      4.3. TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY FOR INFORMATION
      COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT (ARCHIVES)
      A professionally-managed archive system in all government bodies is essential for guaran-
      teeing access of individuals to public information and compliance with proactive disclosure
      obligations. This system enables the systematic collection of information, its safe storage, and
      adequate management. It also ensures its accessibility by both government bodies and the
      public following established procedures and schedules.
          To that end, LTAIP (Article 3) states that “Officials responsible for releasing information
      in their jurisdiction should plan for an adequate infrastructure as well as for the organization,
      systematization, and publishing of information referred to in this law.”
          Along these lines, the RLTAIP (Paragraph e) of Article 6 establishes that the official that cre-
      ates, obtains, holds, or controls the information should “keep a continually updated, system-
      atized archive of public information, in accordance with the time limits established by internal
      regulations of each body on the subject…” LTAIP (Article 19) expressly mandates the obliga-
      tion of the government to “…create and maintain professional public records to ensure that
      the right to information can be exercised fully.”
          The National Archive System is composed of the General Archive of the Nation, the
      Regional Archives, and the Public Archives.52 In accordance with legislation,53 the bodies of
      the National Archive System are interconnected (with regional and public archive systems) in
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                  205




an effort to structurally, legally, and operationally integrate the archives of existing govern-
ment bodies nationwide. This system, which was created in 1991 prior to RTI legislation, brings
together public bodies and institutions responsible for the defense, conservation, organiza-
tion, and services of the “the Nation’s Documental Heritage” by applying archive principles,
standards, and techniques.
    Paradoxically, despite the existence of archive standards and institutions, in practice, there
is no archive system that meets LTAIP requirements. According to a top official of the National
Archive System:

   “The archives are the main input of government activity. To the extent that these are
   organized, they make this information accessible to citizens. Unfortunately, most of the
   archives of the institutions are simply document or paper warehouses, where information
   is stored together without prior selection and is exposed to flooding, neglect and loss.
   They do not take into account that archives hold the memory of the country and each
   institution in particular” (…)

   The situation is almost chaotic. In this scenario, it is very difficult to fully comply with the
   law” (…)

   The work of the archives is practically invisible for the government. The prevailing disorder
   is the ideal breeding ground for corruption. This policy of abandoning the archives raises
   suspicions about authorities who have no interest in maintaining an organized system
   since it allows them to avoid control and being held accountable. We should promote
   the reassessment of the task of archiving.”54

     Two cases reported by the press dramatically illustrate the words of this official of the
General Archive of the Nation. In January 2009, more than 800 boxes containing some 41,000
documents from the Ministry of Health’s central archive “disappeared.”55 In addition, the press
reported on the destruction of credit information (5,000 credit portfolios) belonging to the
government-run development bank (Banco de Fomento— BANMAT) in a sanitary landfill of
Lima56 at the end of the government of former President Alan García.
     The General Archive of the Nation issued a public statement concerning the latter case,
citing archive legislation and announcing that it will launch an investigation.57 As the IPYS
stated in a public declaration on the BANMAT case, “…similar acts are recurring in the context
of the change from one administration to another, at the different levels of government.”58
These cases reveal the absence of the professionally-managed archive system mandated by
the law.
     In a context such as the one described above, it is difficult to collect, manage, and dis-
seminate information. This undoubtedly affects the capacity of public bodies to provide timely
information, especially information produced or generated during previous government
administrations.
     There are several reasons for this situation. First, public servants do not have an archive
culture; rather, they have a storage culture with respect to government information. In addi-
tion, given the limited resources allocated to the General Archive of the Nation to conduct
its oversight and technical training duties, it has a limited capacity to comply with legislation
concerning archives.
206                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           This situation should be addressed and efforts should be made to adequately implement
      institutional archives in all public bodies. This requires the modification or adoption of archive
      standards to respond to the current needs and characteristics of the Peruvian government,
      given that many of the standards regulating the National Archive System were drafted before
      LTAIP went into effect. This effort also requires the adaptation or harmonization of legislation
      on archives with the legislation on transparency and access to public information. One conclu-
      sion of the aforementioned conference was that “the strengthening of the National Archive
      System is encouraged so that it can function effectively as a specialized administrative system
      throughout the government.”59
           Another factor is that the digitization of information, which increases the capacity for its
      conservation and dissemination, is limited to specific institutions and contexts. The govern-
      ment has little experience in the delivery of digitalized information. The lack of technical
      assistance on the topic and the costs entailed in undertaking a technological process of that
      magnitude largely explain this deficit.
           While the initiative of some government bodies to digitize information is positive, this
      process also involves certain risks if it is not done in an organized and/or coordinated manner
      throughout the government. For example, there is a risk of not selecting a technology that
      ensures the possibility of accessing the information in the future because of technological
      changes in the field. Additionally, there is a risk that each government body will choose differ-
      ent and therefore incompatible technologies. For this reason, these entities should take better
      advantage of new information technologies for transparency and for upholding RTI.60
           This section presents some key considerations for the effective implementation of leg-
      islation on access to information, such as the promotion of the effective exercise of RTI, the
      appointment and training of the officials responsible, and the allocation of specific budget
      funds. Additionally, it briefly examines the implementation of legislation on information access
      in the education, health and social development sectors,61 as well as in government contract-
      ing. The analysis of this implementation process uncovers many of the pending challenges for
      the effective exercise of RTI in Peru.


      4.3.1. Mass Dissemination of the Contents of LTAIP and Promotion
      of the Exercise of the Right to Information

      LTAIP went into effect in a government and social context characterized by a culture of secrecy
      and after a political regime opposed to public disclosure of its actions and public access to
      information on governmental management or political control issues.
          Raising public awareness about the contents of LTAIP and broadly promoting the exercise
      of RTI are ways for the government to support a process to implement this law. Nevertheless,
      since went into effect, no national campaign has been launched to disseminate its contents.
      This affects the implementation of LTAIP to the extent that there is considerable ignorance
      about the law and a lack of awareness of the scope of RTI. In the conclusions of the First
      National Conference on Access to Public Information, this problem was already noted:

         “In society, the problem is similar. Lacking a national policy to promote transparency,
         civil organizations have tried to assume this task, with the limitations that this entails. In
         the conference discussion, it became clear that only a small group of professionals and
         journalists have used Law 27806, although with only relative success.”62
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                   207




   It is telling that a similar conclusion was made two years later at the Third National
   Conference on Access to Public Information, although on this occasion participants speci-
   fied that these efforts should include both citizens and public servants:

   “Training/dissemination on the content, scope and limits of the right of access to public
   information are needed, both for all public servants (not only the officials responsible)
   and for citizens (requests that are not considered in the exercise of the right of access to
   information or voluminous requests).”63

    This situation is inconsistent with the inclusion of transparency and RTI as the 29th govern-
ment policy of the National Accord, as mentioned earlier in this report. It is also inconsistent
with Subsection 2 of Article 3 of LTAIP, according to which “the government shall adopt basic
measures that guarantee and promote transparency in the actions of public entities.”
    In this context, the efforts of the Ombudsman’s Office deserve special mention. Despite its
limited resources, the office has disseminated information on the contents, scope, and limits of
RTI as well as government public disclosure obligations among the population and public ser-
vants.64 The annual reports of the Ombudsman’s Office to Congress describe these information
campaigns, work meetings, workshops, and other dissemination activities to promote RTI.65
While commendable, these efforts by the Ombudsman’s Office are still insufficient.

4.3.2. Training of the Public Officials Responsible

LTAIP establishes the designation of a public official responsible for responding to requests for
information and another to comply with proactive disclosure obligations through institutional
portals. The goal of appointing these public servants is not only for citizens to have a visible
interlocutor in government bodies for the exercise of their RTI but also to have officials with a
certain level of specialization in the content, scope, and limits of RTI.
     Clearly, this implied that the officials responsible would receive training on RTI to
guarantee—or at least create the conditions for—the adequate exercise of their functions. In
addition, the second Complementary Provision of the RLTAIP defines this obligation by estab-
lishing that: “the entities will promote the dissemination of the application of the Law and of
these Regulations among personnel with a view to optimizing their implementation.”
     However, just as in the area of dissemination and promotion, the government lacks a policy
for training the officials responsible for complying with LTAIP obligations. At the First National
Conference of Access to Public Information, this issue was emphasized when it was concluded
that: “The event served to bring to light the demand of public servants of every government
entity, or from a coordinating agency of the government, to design and implement a standard-
ized, effective and ongoing training strategy for all levels of personnel, to enable them to learn
about and comply with constitutional and legal mandates to promote transparency.”66
     At the Second National Conference on Access to Public Information, participants again
stressed the need to train the responsible officials of government companies as well as all public
servants who possess public information: “The standards pertaining to public servants should be
publicized. In addition to those responsible for providing access to information, all public ser-
vants holding this information should be trained; there is often resistance at these levels and this
negatively affects [meeting] deadlines.”67 All public servants should receive training in the man-
agement of LTAIP obligations since they refer to basic requirements for the exercise of all public
functions. However, the focus, intensity, and specialization of training should be differentiated.
208                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          The National Civil Service Authority (SERVIR), through its Office of Capacities and Perfor-
      mance, could play a key role in training public servants in the implementation of and com-
      pliance with LTAIP, but this has yet to occur.68 In practice, training has been developed and
      funded by public bodies on only a few occasions. One example of this is SGP training in 2009
      and 2010 based on the directive associated with the required formats for delivering informa-
      tion to the PCM for the preparation of the annual report to Congress. Some regional govern-
      ments use their own resources to finance training of their officials, as in the case of the regional
      government of Cerro de Pasco.
          In general, training of public servants is an initiative of the Ombudsman’s Office or of civil
      society organizations like the IPYS or the CPP. Training sessions provided by the Ombudsman’s
      Office are reported in the annual reports submitted to Congress.69 Another example is the
      training offered to first-instance and appellate court judges by the IPYS between 2003–04, in
      coordination with the Ombudsman’s Office and the Magistrate Academy, on the scope of RTI
      and its protection through actions of habeas data.70
          A noteworthy effort of the CPP is the Transparent Municipalities Project, implemented
      since 2002 in five regions of the country. The project trains public servants of regional, local,
      provincial, and district governments. This project works in partnership with the Integrated
      Financial Administration System (SIAF) of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, the
      Ombudsman’s Office, the Public Window of the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, and
      the newspapers La Industria, Ahora, El Comercio, and El Tiempo.71
          All of these initiatives are extremely important given that they attempt to remedy govern-
      ment deficits. However, they tend to be very specific and depend on the funds these organiza-
      tions can obtain. In summary, there is no general policy, financed and sustained over time, for
      training public servants in the obligations of LTAIP.


      4.3.3. Specific Budget Allocations

      All norms designed to transform the government culture and to instill the principle of transpar-
      ency and RTI involve profound changes that require adequate budget allocations. Among the
      activities that require funding are; the dissemination of the scope of the right and the promo-
      tion of its exercise, training of public servants, implementation of Web sites, and professional
      archives and digitized records. To this end, Subsection 2 of Article 3 of LTAIP establishes that:
      The government shall adopt basic measures that guarantee and promote transparency in the
      actions of public entities.”
           Along these lines, Paragraph a of Article 3 of the RLTAIP states that the top-ranking official
      of an entity subject to LTAIP has the obligation to: “Adopt the measures necessary to guaran-
      tee the exercise of the right of access to public information as part of his or her job duties.”
           The obligations of LTAIP and the RLTAIP require a specific budget allocation because with-
      out these funds it would be difficult to adequately guarantee RTI and government transpar-
      ency. Unfortunately, the Peruvian government did not allocate these funds; because of this the
      participants of the Third National Conference on Access to Public Information concluded that,
      “It is essential for public entities to receive specific resources (economic and human) for the
      functions of transparency and access to public information derived from the Single Ordered
      Text of Law No. 27806.”
           The problem is that directors of the entities subject to LTAIP have no incentive to incor-
      porate indicators for targets of compliance with LTAIP and RLTAIP obligations in their annual
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                 209




operating plans that would enable them to allocate budget funds to achieve these objectives.
Without these funds, entities must attempt to comply with LTAIP obligations using general
budget allocations.
    There are notable exceptions, such as the Ministry of Health, which has incorporated as an
internal policy, in the annual operating plans of its units, compliance with LTAIP obligations in
order to ensure budget funds for the development of the activities necessary to achieve this
objective.72 This is a case in which a government entity made transparency and respect for RTI
a priority. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti (2004–06) first established this priority; subsequent
health ministers have respected and upheld it.73

4.3.4. Appointment of the Officials Responsible

LTAIP mandates the designation of public servants responsible for responding to requests
for access to public information in an effort to facilitate the exercise of RTI. This ensures that
citizens will have specific public servants in all public entities to process their information
requests. The law also attempts to achieve some level of specialization in compliance with
LTAIP obligations. To this end, the public servants responsible are required to meet a specific
profile: they must be very familiar with the institution, hold higher-ranking positions, have the
capacity to influence and change institutional attitudes, and have the capacity to propose
institutional policies and changes to the entity based on their experience in the fulfillment of
their functions.
     Although designating the officials responsible has not been difficult, the fact that there
are no standard profiles or criteria for appointing them is problematic. Profiles of individuals
assigned to the promotion of RTI and compliance with LTAIP obligations vary widely. The fol-
lowing public servants have been assigned the task of responding to or processing requests
for access to information:
 • Secretary general of a government body
 • Head of the communications and public relations unit
 • Head of the general administrative office
 • Head of the executive office
 • Heads of each unit

     In some cases, the designation of the official responsible in each body is in accordance
with LTAIP, which stipulates that this function is the responsibility of the Secretary General who
can delegate this function or form a team with personnel from the area. In other cases, the
official is appointed because of his or her training (for example, lawyers with judicial knowl-
edge), the official manages the archive, because his or her job is related to the different areas
in which information is requested, because he or she is the communication official, or because
the official is responsible for computer services. Exceptionally, the official is designated based
on his or her experience and contacts in the ministry.74
     With respect to personnel responsible for publishing information on institutional Web
sites, the job profile is less problematic because this task is generally assigned to individuals
involved with the entity’s computer unit. However, in these cases, a problem may arise in terms
of the updating of information in accordance with time periods established by law. Computer
personnel often do not have the authority to order officials who produce or hold the informa-
tion that needs to be published to send it in time for processing and publication.
210                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          Another problem concerns the designation of officials responsible for the decentralization
      process in regional governments. Peru is currently transferring national government functions
      to regional governments in several areas, including health, education, and agriculture. Manag-
      ing these new functions requires regional governments to create regional directorates, man-
      agement units, and other bureaucratic offices. Consequently, all activities are not managed
      from the regional government headquarters where the president works, but rather from these
      regional directorates and/or management offices that are frequently established in different
      and distant locations. As a result, the following situations can occur with respect to the officials
      responsible:
       • a single official is responsible for the entire regional government;
       • an official is designated for the regional government’s presidential office but there is no
         official responsible for the other offices;
       • an official is designated for the regional government’s presidential office but since there
         are no officials designated for the other offices, he or she has de facto responsibility for
         those offices; or
       • officials are designated for the regional government’s presidential office, regional director-
         ates, and/or management offices and projects.

          This diversity in the designation of responsible officials can generate problems with regard
      to the performance of job functions. When the designated official does not hold a high-ranking
      position, he or she may have little influence within the institution to be able to adequately
      respond to information requests (for example, to ensure timely delivery of the information to
      comply with established response times) or to impose his or her criteria to overrule a unit’s
      refusal to provide the information. Another problem is that officials often focus on their regular
      job duties because many already have several other responsibilities in addition to being
      assigned this task.
          The absence of directives within the entities to guarantee and adapt the obligations of
      laws on transparency and access to public information frequently causes the designated per-
      sonnel to fail to adequately comply with the assigned functions.
          For these reasons, participants at the Third National Conference on Access to Public Infor-
      mation concluded that: “It is advisable to prepare guidelines to define the profile and develop
      the functions of the officials responsible for access to information. This is a key rather than a
      secondary function that should be assigned to a high-ranking individual.”75
          In effect, although all officials responsible are not expected to be equal, especially
      since there should be some reasonable differences given the nature of the institutions and
      their functions, it is necessary to establish some common criteria or profiles in an effort to
      guarantee RTI.


      4.4. PROMOTION OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION IN HEALTH, EDUCATION,
      SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING
      No in-depth studies exist on the implementation of LTAIP in specific government sectors or
      entities. This section briefly examines transparency and access to information in two selected
      institutions of the executive branch (the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education) as
      well as in the implementation of social programs and government contracting procedures. In
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                     211




general, the effective compliance with public disclosure obligations and RTI largely appears to
depend on the leadership and organizational culture of each entity.

4.4.1. The Experience of the Ministry of Health

This institution made transparency a management indicator beginning in 2004. The experi-
ence began with INFOSALUD, which is a free, national 24-hour phone service that provides
information, guidance, and advice on health issues and that receives complaints from health
service users.
     The Ministry of Health also redesigned its institutional Web site to better comply with
proactive public disclosure obligations and uphold RTI. The Web site was no longer simply a
link within the portal devoted to transparency and access to information; rather, the Web site
was designed to serve as a channel for access to information for all types of users of health
systems or services. Thus, the Web became the main communication mechanism between the
Ministry and the users of its services. For example, a system was implemented to submit and
respond to requests for access to information through the Web site. This involved using simple
language to facilitate access to information by the average user and digitizing information, a
task that began in 2005. A highlight in this process was the publication, for the first time on the
Web site, of the entire reverse auctions76 process for purchasing medicines. Another important
achievement is that, at this writing, approximately 80 percent of requests for access to public
information are processed electronically.
     Throughout this process, the Ministry of Health focused on interaction with users’ and
other organizations that promote transparency and access to information. Thus, associations of
people living with tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS, which actively seek information on health services,
participate in the decision-making process associated with their treatments or access to ser-
vices and needed medicines. In 2005, the IPYS and the Ministry of Health signed an agreement
to build capacity to respond to requests for access to public information in the General Health
Directorate, specifically the General Directorate of Medications, Supplies, and Drugs.
     These advances in the Ministry of Health reflect this institution’s political will to incorporate
transparency and access to information as management indicators. Each unit has incorporated
transparency and access-to-information targets in their operating plans, thereby ensuring the
necessary budget funds to achieve these targets. Since 2009, the Ministry of Health has had
efficiency indicators for transparency and access to public information.77 As a result, the Health
Ombudsman’s Office, which is responsible for INFOSALUD; the General Communications
Office, which is responsible for the institutional Web site; and the General Statistics Office,
which provides technical support, all have targets, indicators, and a budget (for example,
the modified 2011 budget for the Health Ombudsman’s Office is approximately 250,000
nuevos soles).
     Some statistics highlight the advantages of this institutional policy. In 2004, the Ministry
of Health received approximately 12,000 requests for access to public information; by 2010,
this figure had dropped to approximately 2,500 requests. This trend contrasts with the num-
ber of visits to the institutional Web site.78 In 2009, it received 46,037,552 visits, whereas the
number of visits rose to 40,207,013 in 2010. From January 1 to August 31, 2011, approximately
35,488,185 visits were registered, suggesting that the number of visitors in future years will
exceed those in 2010. The most frequented sites on the Ministry of Health’s Web site (from the
most frequented to least) are: (1) The virtual health library of Peru (BVS Perú); (2) press releases;
212                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      (3) transparency; (4) health campaigns; and (5) employment opportunities. Most requests are
      for: (1) information on legislation; (2) information on health investment projects; and (3) infor-
      mation on Ministry of Health personnel (salaries, contracts, functions, and so on).

      4.4.2. The Experience of the Ministry of Education

      In the case of the Ministry of Education, transparency and access to information are analyzed
      in terms of education quality. This is the responsibility of the Ministry’s Education Quality
      Unit (UMC). The UMC forms part of the Office of Strategic Planning and Educational Quality
      Measurement (PLANMED), an agency of the Strategic Planning Secretariat of the Ministry
      of Education.
          The UMC produces information of significant public interest, especially for users of edu-
      cation services (in other words, education quality statistics). The UMC publishes the results
      of these sample and census evaluations on education quality on the Ministry of Education’s
      Web site. However, this effort is not necessarily part of an institutional policy on transpar-
      ency and RTI, nor does it respond to the desire to strictly comply with LTAIP. Public disclo-
      sure of this information is part of the UMC’s institutional mission: “To offer relevant, reliable
      information on the results of student evaluations and their associated factors to contrib-
      ute to decision-making in the different offices, with a view to improving the quality of the
      education system.”
          This is information on global or general results, which is for both internal and public
      use. Specific or detailed information on each education center is not included in this public
      disclosure regime. This specific information is sent to the education centers and managed by
      pertinent agencies of the Ministry of Education. In exceptional cases, requests for access to
      this information are accepted, delivered under the commitment for its good use due to con-
      cerns that the results could be misinterpreted or only partially disseminated. This concept of
      access to public information violates Subsection 5 of Article 2 of the Constitution and Article 7
      of LTAIP, which expressly stipulates that it is illegal to condition the delivery of the information
      on the explanation of the reasons for the request, its destination, or its use. The possibility that
      the information will be improperly used is not a valid argument for conditioning its deliv-
      ery because this would give a wide margin of discretion to public entities to deny access to
      public information, introducing arbitrariness. The individual who disseminates the information
      obtained through the exercise of his or her RTI is responsible for the effects it may cause.
          In general, individuals who request this information are specialized users who are con-
      ducting research or consultancies. Other users include academic researchers and mining
      companies, which, in the context of their corporate social responsibility policy, implement
      social programs to support schools in their area of influence. On average, the UMC receives
      approximately 10 requests for information per week from these types of users. Requests for
      information from nonspecialized users are infrequent. In the first half of 2011, five requests
      were received, many with deficiencies (for example, they were not specific with respect to the
      information required or the requested information the UMC does not possess).
          These requests are made through the official responsible for delivering information,
      whereas the requests made by specialized individuals or institutions are made directly to the
      UMC. This arrangement was most likely set up because the specialized users know what infor-
      mation the UMC holds.
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                213




4.4.3. Transparency and Access to Information in Social Programs

Social programs are particularly important, sensitive government activities since they are
designed to alleviate serious problems of inequality and social fragmentation that are
expressed in situations of unequal rights. To this end, the government allocates a large amount
of public funds, whose implementation should be transparent, both for program beneficiaries
and the general public. In the framework of its constitutional duties to oversee fulfillment of
the functions of public entities and to defend fundamental human rights, the Ombudsman’s
Office opted to monitor social programs designed to develop human capacities, also known as
social empowerment programs (PSH).
     The Ombudsman’s Office identified three reasons for concentrating its oversight duties on
the PSH: (1) these programs are designed to uphold a large number of rights associated with
the life plans of individuals and the conditions for the exercise of other fundamental rights;
(2) these projects concentrate the largest share of public resources allocated to social pro-
grams;79 and (3) the Ombudsman’s Office received the most complaints about this group of
projects regarding alleged acts of corruption and violations of public ethics.80
     The insufficient level of compliance with public disclosure and information access obliga-
tions was one reason the Ombudsman’s Office chose to supervise the PSH. Between Janu-
ary 2009 and December 2010, the Ombudsman’s Office received 432 complaints concerning
the PSH nationwide, 219 of which were declared admissible. Only one of these complaints
involved a violation of RTI (File N° 0450-2009-000620, reported to the Puno Ombudsman’s
Office). The principal of a school in Puno, in the country’s southern highlands, did not respond
to a request for information associated with the provision of dairy products and other foods for
school breakfasts in the framework of the Comprehensive Nutrition Program.81
     To evaluate the level of compliance with proactive public disclosure obligations in the PSH,
the Ombudsman’s Office assessed the publication of information on institutional Web sites. In
September 2010, the Ombudsman’s Office evaluated PSH portals to determine the percentage
of compliance with the proactive obligations set forth in LTAIP (Web site, budget, contracts and
procurement, personnel, planning, and institutional information).82 Only the Comprehensive
Health Insurance System (SIS) earned a high score. The Integral Improvement of Neighborhoods
program, the Street in my Neighborhood program, and the Comprehensive Nutrition Program
recorded the lowest levels of compliance (17 percent each). Only three social programs (SIS,
Juntos, and the Wawa Wasi programs) had compliance rates over 50 percent.83
     An initial conclusion of this assessment is that most PSHs did not have their own Web sites,
but rather published their information in a section of the institutional Web site of their sector
or implementing agency. The Ombudsman’s Office stated that this hindered access to PSH
information given that individuals had to locate, amid all the data on the Web site, the con-
crete information they needed, which not only involves a significant amount of time, but also
requires special knowledge in navigating Web sites.
     The Glass of Milk Program, which is a PSH of special social significance, does not have a
Web site that provides consolidated information on its implementation. Access to information
on this program is fragmented because the program is implemented by local governments
that have administrative, economic, and political autonomy. Therefore, if a citizen requires
aggregate information on the Glass of Milk Program, he or she must search each of the Web
sites of the implementing government, or send individual information requests to each.
214                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          In addition, the Single Registry of Beneficiaries (RUB) of social programs, which includes
      identity data of beneficiaries as well as their place of residence, cannot be accessed by the
      public. While the Ombudsman’s Office facilitates public disclosure of RUB to enable citizen
      control over access to social programs (to determine if individuals qualified as beneficiaries
      have access to these programs), it also cautions that information that could affect personal or
      family privacy should be confidential.84 Because the RUB is a beneficiary database, its public
      disclosure should be considered, as long as the provisions of Law No. 29733 (Law on Protec-
      tion of Personal Information) are taken into account.85
          Although the Ombudsman’s Office has only received one complaint of violation of RTI in
      a PSH over the past two years, noncompliance with proactive public disclosure obligations
      suggest that similar problems affect response to requests for access to public information. The
      lack of complaints may indicate that the exercise of RTI with respect to PSH is limited, or that
      violations of RTI in PSH are not reported by citizens. Therefore, it is difficult to clearly deter-
      mine the state of the effective exercise of RTI in the framework of PSH.


      4.4.4. Transparency and Access to Information in Government Contracts

      Transparency and access to public information in government contracts are regulated by a
      specific complementary legal regime of LTAIP. Specific mechanisms for transparency and
      access to public information were first implemented in early 2001 during the political transition.
      Although Law No. 26850 (Law on Government Contracts and Procurement) already established
      the possibility of using electronic support for government contracts, the creation of SEACE
      through Supreme Decree No. 031-2002-PCM on May 8, 2002, marked a milestone in this area.
      SEACE was progressively developed and incorporated in Legislative Decree No. 1017, which
      adopted the Law on Government Contracts currently in effect.
          All public entities subject to the Law on Government Contracts must publish all activities
      involved in their selection processes, contracts signed (regardless of the legal regime or source
      of funding), and their implementation in SEACE. Moreover, they must publish their annual
      contracting plans, tender documents, consultations resolved, pronouncements associated with
      contracting processes, bid documents, comparison table and/or minutes used to select the
      winning bid, resolutions to resolve petitions to appeal, and resolutions of appeals for review.
      The information published in SEACE is identical to the final documents issued in the processes
      of selection, contracting, and implementation of contracts. SEACE is an electronic information
      registry of public access that is administered by the Agency for Oversight of Government Con-
      tracts (OSCE).86 If an individual requests information, in accordance with LTAIP, the response is
      to give directions to them on how to locate the information on the SEACE Web site; otherwise
      physical information already published on the Web site will be delivered to the requester. If
      there is a request for information that is not published on SEACE (for example, resolutions of
      contracting procedures), LTAIP will apply.
          Transparency and access to information on contracts through SEACE are complemented
      with the following:87
       • National registry of suppliers: All individuals and corporations interested in becoming
         government suppliers must register with this registry.
       • Ineligibility to become a contractor: All high-ranking officials are prohibited from being
         contracted by the government for a period of 12 months after they leave their position.88
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                    215




 • Annual government contract plan: All public entities must prepare and publish on SEACE
   their annual contracting plan, which contains all goods, services, and works they plan to
   contract out during the year, including the estimated amounts and contracting procedures
   to be followed.
 • Prohibition of fractioning: Contract amounts for the same goods cannot be fractioned in an
   attempt to avoid following the pertinent selection procedure. Therefore, it is not possible
   to procure the same goods more than once during the same fiscal period.

    Notwithstanding the positive aspects of SEACE, the information produced during contract-
ing procedures is difficult for many citizens to understand. Therefore, SEACE should include
windows at which it provides reader-friendly information on contracting procedures.

4.5. THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LTAIP
Civil society organizations have contributed to the implementation of LTAIP through different
initiatives. Some of the main activities of these organizations are listed below.
     The CPP and the IPYS, which played important roles in the passage of LTAIP, have con-
solidated their work concerning LTAIP, exercising leadership in this area. In 2004, the CPP
launched a media campaign to disseminate RTI and LTAIP. The organization also monitors
compliance with proactive public disclosure obligations on transparency portals and the
regular dissemination of results in the mass media.89 Since 2002, the CPP has implemented the
Transparent Municipalities Project, designed to promote the implementation of LTAIP in the
municipalities of Lambayeque, San Martín, Cusco, Piura, and Arequipa. The project includes
activities in training, dissemination, and coaching of public officials and civil society representa-
tives to improve levels of access to information and transparency.90
     The IPYS has implemented several projects on access to public information, such as the
pilot project carried out with the Lambayeque regional government to implement LTAIP. It has
also developed projects to train public officials and civil society representatives (for example,
district judges in the provinces and journalists).91 Four years ago, the IPYS launched the project,
Strengthening the Right of Access to Public Information in Peru, which organizes the National
Conference on Access to Public Information, evaluates annual reports prepared by the PCM,
contributes to the exercise of RTI through requests for access to information (in Lima and the
country’s interior) and engages in strategic litigation.
     In 2005, Informed Citizens (Ciudadanos al Día, CAD) published the consultation document,
Access to Government Information. Legal Framework and Best Practices. CAD has conducted
research on advances and setbacks with respect to transparency and RTI; it publishes the
results in newsletters and reports.92 Since 2005, with support from the Ombudsman’s Office,
CAD has awarded the Best Practices in Public Administration Prize, which includes a category
on best practices in complying with LTAIP.
     The Citizen Proposal Group (Grupo Propuesta Ciudadana, PROPUESTA) oversees com-
pliance with the proactive public disclosure obligations of LTAIP through the Web sites of
regional governments.93 Through Vigila Perú, PROPUESTA’s system for citizen oversight of the
decentralization process, it monitors transparency of mining companies. Although this is not
government information in the strictest sense, it is an interesting case involving information
of public interest associated with the corporate social responsibility of companies that exploit
natural resources.94
216                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Also noteworthy is the work of Suma Ciudadana to promote transparency in the manage-
      ment of development cooperation resources, sworn declarations of income, and curricula of
      public officials. Suma Ciudadana has developed a database (Justicia y Transparencia) of the
      rulings of the Constitutional Tribunal in habeas data proceedings for the defense of RTI.95
           Although it closed in March 2011, another important mechanism was the Social Oversight
      Observatory (OBSERVA). This was a platform of several organizations96 to encourage trans-
      parency and access to public information in regional governments through training and the
      promotion of best practices among officials responsible for providing information.
           Two initiatives stand out at the sectoral level. Between 2008 and 2009, Universidad Coher-
      ente97 developed a project to train 250 university students in the promotion of transparency
      and access to public information. Since 2010, Universidad Coherente has been carrying out a
      project to measure the levels of implementation of transparency and access to public infor-
      mation in 35 public universities in Peru.98 Rights, Environment, and Natural Resources (DAR)
      is an organization that promotes sustainable development in Peru. As part of its activities,
      DAR implements the Promoting Transparency in the Forestry Sector project,99 which publishes
      annual reports on transparency for this sector.100
           As is evident, media organizations were the first to promote and support the implementa-
      tion of LTAIP. Since LTAIP went into effect, an increasing number of civil society organizations
      have incorporated lines of action to promote and uphold RTI and compliance with LTAIP. In
      some cases, new organizations, such as Suma Ciudadana, OBSERVA, or Universidad Coher-
      ente, have incorporated individuals who were associated with pioneering organizations like
      the IPYS. This demonstrates the formative role that civil society organizations have played in
      supporting the application of LTAIP since it went into effect.
           The efforts of these organizations are diverse or specialized, focusing on different
      aspects of LTAIP. In some cases, activities concentrate on promoting the exercise of the right
      and its administrative and judicial defense (IPYS); in other cases, organizations may focus on
      compliance with proactive obligations through Web sites (CPP and PROPUESTA); prioritize
      a specific group of entities subject to LTAIP (Universidad Coherente); or focus on specific
      sectors of activity (DAR). Nevertheless, with few exceptions, the organizations do not link
      RTI with the exercise or defense of other rights.101 Moreover, civil society organizations in the
      country’s interior do not usually work in the area of compliance with LTAIP or in defense of
      the exercise of RTI.




      5. Has Access to Public Information Increased
      with the Adoption and Implementation
      of Law No. 27806?
      Almost eight years after LTAIP went into effect, citizens have more possibilities for accessing
      public information. However, it is difficult to determine if they have more real access to public
      information. The problem lies in identifying information or tools to measure the level of access
      as well as the reliability of that information.
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                 217




    There are three tools to evaluate the exercise of RTI. First is the annual report that the PCM
submits to the Congress. Second are the complaints of RTI violations reported to the Ombuds-
man’s Office. Finally, there are the habeas data rulings issued by the judicial branch and the
Constitutional Tribunal. Although the CGR oversees compliance with some aspects of LTAIP,
there is no report or document that provides information on the results of oversight activities.
The section below examines the information produced by each of these mechanisms.

5.1. THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET TO THE CONGRESS
In accordance with Article 22 of LTAIP and Article 22 of the RLTAIP, all designated government
entities must submit to the PCM information concerning processed and unprocessed requests
for access to public information during the year. With this information, the PCM prepares an
annual report that it submits to Congress before March 31 of each year.
    The submission of information on processed and unprocessed requests for information
takes place in accordance with a timetable prepared by the PCM. In entities that fail to comply
with this obligation, the Secretary General of the entity is held responsible. This is the only
mechanism mandated by LTAIP to provide information on the state of the exercise of RTI
nationwide and the upholding of this right by government entities.
    The annual report is designed as an institutional mechanism to provide Congress with
the information necessary to make any required legislative modifications. At the same time, it
serves to enable Congress to exercise its control functions and to impose possible sanctions or
assign political responsibility in the case of noncompliance with LTAIP obligations.
    The conclusions below are drawn from an analysis of the annual reports from 2004 to 2009.
Only the annual reports of 2005 and 2006 were submitted to Congress by the established
deadline (before March 31 of each year).102
    Through a request for information submitted by the IPYS on August 20, 2010, Congress
was required to provide information on the processing of the annual reports submitted by the
PCM. In accordance with congressional information, the reports from 2003, 2004, 2005, and
2006 were sent to the archive with the knowledge of the Congressional Executive Council.103
The 2007 report was delivered to the archive with the knowledge of the executive council after
copies were sent to congressional groups. The council was briefed on the 2008 Annual Report
that was submitted to congressional groups, but the records do not expressly state whether or
not it was sent to the archive. In light of previous experiences, it was most likely delivered to
the archive. The 2009 Annual Report was submitted to Congress, but has yet to be sent to the
executive council.
    According to this information, the annual reports submitted to Congress did not lead this
body to take any type of action and the executive council was only informed of the existence
of these reports. The annual report does not fulfill its institutional purpose stipulated in LTAIP
because it has not led to any public control action or proposal for legislative reform or public
policy on RTI.
    Table 2 lists the requests for access to public information reported annually by govern-
ment entities to the PCM from 2003 to 2010. The table presents the total number of requests
received as well as the number that were processed and those that were not, in both absolute
numbers and percentages.

          The figures presented may give the impression that RTI is frequently exercised in Peru.
      However, these numbers should be viewed with caution for two reasons. The first is related
      to the accuracy or sufficiency of the information. The second is associated with the fact that
      there are entities subject to LTAIP that do not comply with the obligation to report requests for
      access to information to the PCM.
          On July 9, 2009, Ministerial Resolution No. 301-2009-PCM adopted Directive No. 003-2009-
      PCM/SGP, “Guidelines for reporting requests for access to information to be submitted to the
      Office of the President of the Ministerial Cabinet.” This directive was issued to (1) clarify the
      definition of processed requests for information; and (2) establish what information should be
      excluded because it is not subject to RTI and not included in LTAIP.
          With respect to the first point, until the 2008 Annual Report, a processed request was
      defined only as one that had obtained a positive response, whereas those classified as unpro-
      cessed had received a negative response. Nevertheless, after the aforementioned directive
      was issued, processed requests were defined as all requests that had been answered, regard-
      less of whether the answer was positive or negative, complete or partially delivered. Unpro-
      cessed requests were defined as those receiving no response.
          This modification is criticized by some experts who argue that it is not in keeping with the
      spirit of RTI. They claim that according to the Constitutional Tribunal, RTI is affected in the fol-
      lowing cases:
       • When there is no response to the requests
       • When the information request is denied for reasons not stipulated by law
       • When there is a response but incomplete, outdated, inaccurate, or unclear information
         is delivered.104

          As a result, these experts concluded that:

          “Therefore, currently, when public entities report a request for information as processed,
          this does not inform the leading body on the public policy of transparency on whether or
          not the designated entity has respected the right of access to information.
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                    219




    This information only informs the PCM that the constitutional right has not been violated
    through silence or a lack of response, which is of course one of the most blatant cases of
    its violation. But it does not enable knowledge of whether or not the entity made a legal
    justification for denying the information or if it delivered the information in a complete
    manner.

    While this omission is understood in the context of wanting to avoid further complicating
    the format that public bodies must complete to submit their report the PCM, ensuring
    that it provides information on whether or not the citizen who requested information
    received a response to encourage this conduct of respect; it should also be kept in mind
    that almost all public entities that provide information on this currently report high levels
    of compliance.”105 (Author’s emphasis.)

     The second part of the directive excludes from the content of RTI, and consequently from
the application of LTAIP, requests from citizens, their representatives, or attorneys for infor-
mation about private or personal affairs included in administrative proceedings of the entity
where the request was made, among others. Thus, these requests are not reported by the enti-
ties and, consequently, are not included in the annual reports of the PCM.
     This decision has been criticized because the Constitutional Tribunal qualified these types
of requests as a legitimate exercise of RTI when it admitted several actions of habeas data in
cases involving the Ministry of Labor and its Office of Normalization of Social Benefits deny-
ing information to former workers and pensioners concerning their files, in the framework of
administrative proceedings of these entities to defend their rights.106
     This would, therefore, exclude cases in which the Constitutional Tribunal had identified RTI
violations from a calculation of the number of requests made for public information. The Con-
stitutional Tribunal is the highest-level body for interpreting the Constitution, for which reason
its jurisprudential criteria is binding for all operators and interpreters of the Constitution and of
fundamental rights, such as in the case of RTI.
     Furthermore, the Constitutional Tribunal is characterized by an adequately rights-based
jurisprudence in terms of RTI, irrespective of decisions that may require some fine-tuning or
development. The Constitutional Tribunal has broadly defined the content of this fundamental
right and has established specific procedures for the government to follow when it invokes a
cause for exclusion of information to public access.107

    With respect to the sufficiency of the annual report information, it has been commented
    that: “…the information they report is very aggregated or general, by group of public
    entities; this does not allow for identifying the difference existing within each group, but
    especially, it does not permit the accurate identification of the public entities that are
    seriously threatening this fundamental right, or to the contrary, those which because they
    adequately respect it, even deserve a recognition or an incentive that would encourage
    them to continue with this policy.” (Author’s emphasis.)108

    Furthermore, it is observed that: “The second problem with the annual report is the limited
level of processing of the data it currently presents and that disaggregated data should be
included. As mentioned, the annual report currently does not contain statistical information on
topics as relevant as: which public information is the most requested in each entity; the reasons
220                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      why requests are not processed; the types of information requests that are the most and least
      likely to be processed, etc.”109 (Author’s emphasis).
           In the annual reports, the level of disaggregation varies, given the lack of a standardized
      method. For example, the conclusion section of the 2008 Annual Report states that the Min-
      istry of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation received the most information requests (6,878),
      but it does not specify how many of those requests were processed.
           The 2009 Annual Report does not disaggregate processed and unprocessed requests for
      access to information by ministries; rather, it simply provides aggregated figures. By contrast,
      the 2010 Annual Report presents disaggregated information by ministries in two graphs. That
      year, the ministries receiving the most information requests were the PCM (7,925); the Minis-
      try of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation (4,967); the Ministry of Economics and Finance
      (4,163); and the Ministry of Health (3,851). According to that report, the ministries reporting
      the largest number of unprocessed requests were the PCM (260); the Ministry of Defense (90);
      the Ministry of Culture (88); and the Ministry of Justice (58). As is evident, these methodologi-
      cal discrepancies make it impossible to identify patterns with respect to requests for access to
      public information and responses by government entities.
           Municipal government entities tend to be the public bodies that most frequently fail to
      comply with their obligation to submit information to the PCM for the preparation of the
      annual report. Of a total of 194 provincial municipal governments, only 43 (22.1 percent)
      fulfilled their obligation to send information in 2005. In 2006, only 34 provincial municipalities
      delivered information to the PCM, a number that increased to 75 (38.5 percent) of a total of
      195 in 2007. In 2008, only 68 provincial municipalities complied with the obligation; in 2009,
      this number declined to 56.110 In the case of district governments, out of a total of 1,638 district
      municipalities, only 316 complied with the obligation to send information to the PCM in 2007,
      declining to 264 in 2008, and to 204 in 2009.111
           The analysis of PCM reports on information requests reveals that they are of limited reliabil-
      ity. The documents are a summary of an imperfect information collection process nationwide,
      evidenced by the fact that fewer than half of public entities fulfill their obligation to send infor-
      mation to the PCM. Since there has been no promotion of standardized, transparent informa-
      tion management processes, it is impossible to assess the actual performance of the public
      administration.112 Information problems identified in the annual reports could be resolved if
      Congress used this tool for the institutional function assigned it by LTAIP.


      5.2. COMPLAINTS OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION VIOLATIONS REPORTED
      TO THE OMBUDSMAN’S OFFICE
      Given that the Ombudsman’s Office has a consolidated line of action on RTI and the pro-
      motion of transparency, it is of special interest to examine the complaints this institution
      receives for alleged RTI violations. The analysis below is based on the annual reports of the
      Ombudsman’s Office to Congress, beginning in 2001.
          While the Ombudsman’s annual reports do not include figures on complaints presented by
      year, they do enable the identification of wrongful acts invoked to justify citizen complaints.
          The only report that provides figures on the complaints received on RTI violations is the
      Eighth Annual Report, 2004–2005, in which the Ombudsman’s Office compared the number
      of complaints received during the first year after LTAIP went into effect (2003) with the number
      of complaints processed in 2004. The Ombudsman’s Office received 261 complaints in 2003 and
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                                    221




493 in 2004, representing an increase of 47.05 percent. The Ombudsman’s Office interpreted this
increase as an indicator of a more demanding attitude of citizens with respect to RTI.
    The analysis of the different reports (all annual reports from 2001 to 2010) indicates that
some violations are recurring. Most important among these are:
 • Failure to comply with the legal time limit
 • Undue or excessive charges
 • Allegation of exceptions that are not adequately explained or justified.
 • Requirements that are not stipulated by law (for example, the submission of documents
   or forms)
 • Lack of designation of public officials responsible
 • Lack of incorporation of the procedures for access in a TUPA (a single text on admini-
   strative procedures).

5.3. RULINGS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND
THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL
Another key source of information is the final rulings of the judicial branch and the
Constitutional Tribunal113 in habeas data proceedings in defense of RTI.
     A study commissioned by the IPYS analyzed 150 habeas data final rulings of the judicial
branch and the Constitutional Tribunal published between January 2009 and May 2010.114
An initial key finding is that the public entities involved in the most legal proceedings during
that period were the Office of Normalization of Social Benefits (ONP)—26.2 percent; local
governments—25.4 percent; ministries—13.8 percent; and the judicial branch (9.2 percent).
     In the case of ministries, 70 percent of the claims were filed against the Ministry of Labor
by former employees who demanded information contained in their files that were submit-
ted for inclusion in the reincorporation process, in the framework of the recovery of labor
rights violated during the illegal collective dismissals implemented during the government of
Alberto Fujimori.
     Of the 146 rulings analyzed (four of the 150 selected rulings did not provide the neces-
sary information), requests for information associated with the public interest were denied by
government bodies in 51.4 percent of cases; 48.6 percent of the cases referred to information
related to private or personal interests of the plaintiffs.
     In approximately 60 percent of the cases in which information about personal interests was
requested, the information was associated with the defense of rights to benefits (pensions and
social benefits); the other 40 percent of requests sought to obtain information for the exercise
of other rights, such as that of due process in administrative and judicial proceedings.
     The study classifies the rulings analyzed by types of cases. In the first group of cases, plain-
tiffs demanded information for the defense of their rights to pensions (26.2 percent). The sec-
ond group involved plaintiffs who wanted information to defend their labor rights, which were
affected by the illegal collective dismissals that occurred during the Fujimori government (13.8
percent). The third group of cases involved demands for information about private companies
providing public services (7.3 percent). Interestingly, in this group, the same individual filed all
the complaints. Finally, a fourth group of a cases is of citizens who made at least two requests
because they were denied different types of information on the management of public enti-
ties (salaries, budget, functioning of justice bodies, and so on) in administrative proceedings.
222                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      Finally, the study highlights the persistent allegations of formal arguments being used to deny
      information in administrative proceedings.
           This study contributes important information regarding the precariousness of the exercise
      of RTI in administrative proceedings. In nearly every case in which the Constitutional Tribu-
      nal declared an action of habeas data admissible, the individuals involved did not ultimately
      receive the requested information. In addition, many of these accusations should never have
      reached the judicial branch or the Constitutional Tribunal given that they constitute clear cases
      of RTI violations (for example, in the case of retired claimants or former workers affected by the
      collective dismissals of the 1990s). Moreover, the traditional reticence of judges was evident
      with regard to the possibility of third parties reviewing documents on the processes they
      administer.115
           Because the judicial branch is the first step in the system to guarantee human rights (and
      in this case RTI), the members of this government branch should assume their responsibility by
      using reasonable judgment to maintain an adequate balance between access to information
      and other rights that may be affected.116

      5.3.1. Illustrative Cases of Habeas Data Rulings

      Some concrete cases promoted by the IPYS, in cooperation with a private law firm,117 can pro-
      vide a better understanding of the role of the judicial branch and the Constitutional Tribunal in
      the defense of RTI and the implications for effective accountability.
       • Access to sworn declarations of public officials. On December 17, 2009, the IPYS
         requested Sections 1 and 2 of the sworn declarations on assets and revenues of former
         President Alan García Pérez, beginning in the year he assumed office. On January 12,
         2010, the Office of the President responded to the request, delivering only Section 2 and
         claiming that Section 1 was not subject to public access. On March 23, 2010, in response
         to this refusal, the IPYS filed an action of habeas data. The government defense attorney
         requested that the Comptroller General’s Office be included in the proceedings, a request
         accepted by the judge. On June 23, 2010, the Constitutional Court of Lima, which was the
         court of first instance, declared the action inadmissible. This ruling was disputed and is
         pending review in an appellate court.
              The ruling was based on Article 15 of the Regulations of Law No. 27482 that regulates
         the publication of the Sworn Declaration of Income and of Assets and Revenue of public
         officials. According to the ruling, “In keeping with the rights set forth in numerals 5) and
         7) of Article 2 of the Political Constitution of Peru, the Section 1 shall only be used by
         control agencies or upon an injunction.” Nevertheless, Article 4 of the same law qualifies
         the sworn statements as public instruments, without distinguishing between the sections.
         Likewise, the Constitutional Tribunal, in its ruling published in File No. 04407-2007-PHD/TC,
         established that the information contained in Section 1 of the sworn declarations was of a
         public nature, as long as it referred to: (1) income originating from the public sector; and
         (2) movable and immovable property that can be registered. This criteria was rejected by
         the Constitutional Court, which declared the case inadmissible.
              The information contained in Section 2 of the sworn declarations is aggregated,
         for which reason it is not possible to identify changes in the wealth of public officials.
         While the form in Section 1 could include information whose public disclosure might be
A CASE STUDY OF PERU                                                                               223




   inappropriate and might affect other constitutional rights, the problem is not resolved by
   excluding from public access all information contained in that section. It would seem more
   reasonable to propose a solution that would reconcile transparency and RTI with the other
   rights involved.
 • Information on pardons granted to an individual convicted on corruption charges.
   On December 18, 2009, the IPYS requested from the Ministry of Justice the legal and
   medical reports supporting the decision of then-President Alan García to grant a pardon
   to an individual serving a sentence for acts of corruption during the Fujimori government
   on humanitarian grounds. On January 10, 2010, an action of habeas data was filed and on
   January 13, the Ministry of Justice rejected the action, arguing that it was for information
   contained in reports that formed part of the deliberation process prior to a government
   decision. Nevertheless, the pardon had been granted through a resolution published in the
   official gazette, in which it was expressly stated that the decision was based on the reports
   that had been the subject of the information request. The Constitutional Court declared
   that the action was admissible on July 19, 2010. The Ministry of Justice appealed the ruling
   and the Superior Court declared it null and void, arguing an alleged lack of grounds. The
   case has been returned to the Constitutional Court for review.
 • Reports on a donation from the Congress. On December 18, 2009, a request was made
   to the Congress for the legal and budget documents justifying the donation of US$15,000
   by then-President of the Congress Luis Alva Castro to finance a Peruvian music concert.
   The Congress never responded to the information request. On March 23, 2010, an action
   of habeas data was filed, which was declared admissible on December 9, 2010, by the
   Constitutional Court of Lima. The Congress appealed the ruling, but it was upheld in
   appellate court on June 8, 2011. The ruling is currently being implemented.
 • Closed congressional sessions. On September 18, 2007, a request was made for the
   audiotape and minutes of the session in which a congresswoman was punished for
   improper conduct. The Congress had declared it as a closed session, even though there
   is no mention of this possibility in the Congressional Regulations. The Congress never
   responded to the information request. In September 2007, an action of habeas data was
   filed. After nearly four years, on August 9, 2011, the Constitutional Court declared the
   action admissible. Nevertheless, the congressional attorney appealed the ruling, and it is
   pending a decision in appellate court. In all of these cases (except for the sworn declara-
   tions that are open to discussion), information of public access was requested, but the
   requests were denied or did not receive a response. All the requests were made to high-
   level institutions—Congress, the Ministry of Justice, and the Office of the President—that
   should have expressed a greater willingness to facilitate government transparency.

    Of the four cases presented here, only one was definitively resolved. The duration of
habeas data proceedings frequently cause the delivery of information to be delayed past the
time of its usefulness, if the information was to have been used for control and accountability
purposes. Moreover, litigation against the government requires a level of specialization that
is beyond the capacity of many citizens. These limitations support the need to consider the
establishment of an authority to enforce and monitor LTAIP; this would contribute to account-
ability in public affairs.
224                                             RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      6. Conclusions
      The adoption and implementation of LTAIP marked a milestone in guaranteeing and uphold-
      ing RTI in Peru. LTAIP was the first to develop a systematic legal framework to regulate this
      constitutional right. Its adoption generated a great sense of expectation and stimulated impor-
      tant debates on government transparency.
           Nevertheless, the previous sections describe an inefficient process of LTAIP implementa-
      tion. While transparency and RTI are part of the public discourse and have been incorporated
      as government policies in the National Accord, in practice, there is no implementation strategy
      linked to clear, sustainable objectives. In this context, the efforts of different actors to imple-
      ment the law remain isolated, leading to only partial results.
           Three factors contribute to this situation. First, there is a lack of political will for the effective
      implementation of LTAIP. This is reflected in a type of bureaucratization of the law—an attempt
      to literally comply with its basic contents without necessarily guaranteeing maximum access to
      information and transparency of a public entity. The publication of budget or contract informa-
      tion within the legal time limits, but cloaked in administrative language, the high levels of non-
      compliance of local governments in submitting information for the PCM’s annual reports, and the
      legal proceedings against national government entities are examples of this lack of political will.
      Secondly, a lack of a professional civil service or career public servants has a negative impact on
      the sustainability of efforts to implement LTAIP. The high turnover of public officials causes delays
      and difficulties in the implementation process. Finally, the institutional design for the implemen-
      tation and oversight of compliance with LTAIP is a diffuse model that places responsibility for
      these tasks on several public officials and entities. This model seemed to be the most reasonable
      in the political and institutional circumstances in which LTAIP was adopted, but today it is insuffi-
      cient. The factors identified in this analysis as well as the absence of strong institutional incentives
      for a functioning model (for example, linking compliance with transparency indicators to budget
      allocation) point to the need to promote discussion on the creation of a specialized, indepen-
      dent institution with authority over all of the entities subject to LTAIP. This discussion should take
      into account the characteristics of the Peruvian government and the experience of institutions
      that have demonstrated positive results in the oversight of compliance with the obligations of
      public entities and defense of RTI, such as the Ombudsman’s Office.
           In terms of civil society, the work of different organizations has favored the implementa-
      tion of LTAIP. Ideally, more organizations should associate RTI with the demand for compliance
      with other rights; additionally, there should be more such institutions located in the country’s
      interior. Moreover, consensus regarding the indicators or criteria that the different civil society
      institutions use to measure compliance with LTAIP would enable more effective assessments.118
      This would prevent the same entity from being classified differently by these organizations and
      diminish the potential for submitting partial assessments as proof of an entity’s transparency.
           Despite the obstacles mentioned, LTAIP implementation process has generated important
      learned lessons. As demonstrated each year at the National Conference on Access to Public
      Information, there is accumulated experience in this area in several government sectors. Fur-
      thermore, civil society organizations have made significant contributions. The beginning of the
      new government administration offers the best opportunity for promoting some of the pending
      reforms (for example, a new institutional model for implementation and compliance with LTAIP)
      to contribute to strengthening access to public information and government transparency.119

Notes

1.    Constitution, Article 2. All people have the right to: (…) (Paragraph 5) Request information they need
      without stating a reason and to receive it from any public entity, within the legal time period, at the
      cost the request involves. Information that affects personal privacy is excluded, as is that expressly
      excluded by law or for reasons of national security. Banking and tax secrets can be lifted at the
      request of the Judge, the Attorney General or an investigative committee of Congress in accordance
      with the law and as long as the information refers to the case being investigated.
2.    According to the official definition, “The National Accord is a set of government policies prepared
      and adopted through dialogue and consensus, after a process of workshops and consultancies
      nationwide, with the aim of defining a direction for the country’s sustainable development and for
      affirming its democratic governance.” The National Accord was signed in a solemn act at the
      Government Palace on July 22, 2002, with the participation of then-President Alejandro Toledo,
      the President of the Ministerial Cabinet, Roberto Dañino, and leading representatives of political
      and civil society organizations participating in the National Accord. See (in Spanish): http://www
      .acuerdonacional.pe/an/definicion.html
3.    Ibid. p. 200.
4.    Other relevant norms are Legislative Decree No. 757, the Framework Law for the Growth of Private
      Investment, adopted on November 13, 1991, as well as its Regulations, adopted through Supreme
      Decree No. 094-92-PCM. While these norms broadly regulated access to documentary information,
      their area of application (private investment) limits coverage.
5.    Article 65 of the 1993 Constitution recognized the right of consumers and users to access information
      on the goods and services available to them in the market.
6.    Abad Yupanqui, Samuel. Op. Cit. p. 14.
7.    Many of these cases went to trial and the guilty parties were sentenced. For example, see (in
      Spanish): http://historico.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema/documentos/RN_A V_023-2001-09_260711.pdf.
8.    See Exposición de Motivos del Proyecto de Ley No. 1356/2001-CR, p. 3. The bill was submitted by
      Carlos Ferrero, who was a member of Fujimori’s party but who gradually distanced himself from it,
      demonstrating public discrepancies with the government. See, http://www.congreso.gob.pe/
      comisiones/1998/constitucion /proyecto.htm.
9.    Refers to the government led by Valentín Paniagua, which began in Peru in November 2000 after the
      resignation of Alberto Fujimori at the beginning of his third term, and which ended in July 2001. Its
      mission was to organize and hold new elections to elect a new government.

11.   According to articles 161 and 162 of the Constitution and Article 1 of Law No. 26520 (Organic Law of
      the Ombudsman’s Office), this institution is created as an autonomous constitutional body charged
      with defending the constitutional and fundamental rights of individuals and the community, the
      supervision of compliance with the functions of public bodies and the adequate delivery of public
      services.

14.   Some of the most noteworthy of these norms include: Law No. 27336, on transparency and public
      disclosure in telecommunications; Supreme Decree No. 018-2001-PCM, which establishes the
      obligation of government bodies to have a special procedure to guarantee RTI; Urgent Decree
      No. 035-2001, which establishes rules for allowing access of individuals to information on public

            finances; Law No. 27444, the Law on General Administrative Procedure, whose Article 110 regulates
            the right of individuals to request information held by public entities; Law No. 27482, which regulates
            publication of the Sworn Declaration of Income and of Assets and Revenues of public officials and
            servants as well as its Regulations, adopted through Supreme Decree No. 080-2001-PCM.

      16.   Originally, this committee was called the Working Group on Transparency, Access to Public
            Information and Citizen Participation. However, at the August 26, 2002 session of the Constitution
            Committee, the name was changed at the request of Congresswoman Ana Elena Townsend Diez
            Canseco.

      18.   This is a legal mechanism in Peru to systematize into a single document the different modifications of
            a law. The TUO does not modify the law; it simply integrates the different modifications into a single
            text to prevent normative dispersion on the same topic. The TUO is adopted through a regulatory
            norm called a Supreme Decree. Henceforth, all references to LTAIP refer to the TUO of Law 27806.
      19.   The Ombudsman’s Office disagreed with the decision that LTAIP would have Regulations, stating
            that: The first transitory, complementary and final provision of the Law stipulated that the Executive
            Branch should develop its regulations within a 90-day period. In our opinion, it is not indispensible to
            pass regulations because the Law is sufficiently precise; nevertheless it was decided to develop
            them.” See Ombudsman’s Office. Ombudsman’s Report No. 96. Balance a dos años de vigencia de la
            Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública 2003–2004. 2005. p. 16.
      20.   It was not possible to locate the official record of the discussions on the activities convened by the
            CPP or on the debate of the Working Group chaired by Townsend, for which reason this report offers
            general information, providing generic information on the groups that defended the different
            positions, based on the interviews conducted.
      21.   Habeas data is a constitutional process to access a record or database that includes information
            on an individual. It is a legal guarantee for the adequate management of personal information held
            by third parties. It enables avoiding abuses and rectifying involuntary mistakes in the administration
            and publication of the data. Habeas data is regulated by legislation of several countries and is also
            included in legislation on the protection of personal information. In Peru, habeas data also
            protects RTI.

            may appoint the officials responsible for delivering information in each entity.

27.   Article 377. The public official who illegally omits, refuses or delays any action of his position shall be
      punished with imprisonment of no more than two years and 30 to 60 days—fine.
28.   It was not possible to obtain information for this report on whether or not this sentence was disputed
      and in the event it was, whether or not it was the result of a ruling of the appellate court.
29.   At the time of this ruling, the following text of Article 376 was in effect: “The public official who,
      abusing his authority, commits or orders any arbitrary act that harms someone, shall be punished with
      a prison term of no more than two years. When the facts derive from a procedure of coactive charge,
      the sentence shall be no less than two years and no more than four years.” This type of crime was
      modified through Law No. 29703, adopted on June 10, 2011, increasing the basic prison term to no
      more than three years.
30.   The resolution deactivating the ONA did not mention the reasons for doing so; however, ever since it
      began operations, the need for this office to fight corruption was questioned given that it did not
      have clear functions with respect to other government institutions. The Comptroller General’s Office
      and the Attorney General’s Office publically questioned some of the powers attributed to the ONA
      because they claimed that they interfered with some of the constitutional powers of these
      institutions.
31.   At this writing, the SGP’s Technical Component on Ethics, Transparency, and Citizen Oversight is
      responsible for the functions of transparency and access to public information; it has three members.
      See (in Spanish): http://sgp.pcm.gob.pe/index.php?option=com_content&vie w=article&id=
      81&Itemid=158.
32.   For example, Ministerial Resolution No. 398-2008, of December 2, 2008, through which Directive No.
      004-2008-PCM/SGP was adopted, “Guidelines for the standardization of the contents of transparency
      portals of public entities”; Ministerial Resolution No. 301-2009-PCM, of July 9, 2009, through which
      Directive No. 003-2009-PCM/SGP was adopted, “Guidelines for the report on requests for access to
      information to be submitted to the Office of the President of the Ministerial Cabinet”; Supreme
      Decree No. 063-2010-PCM, of June 3, 2010, through which the implementation of the Standard
      Transparency Portal was adopted; or Ministerial Resolution No. 200-2010-PCM, of June 24, 2010,
      through which Directive No. 001-2010-PCM/SGP was adopted “Guidelines for the implementation of
      the Standard Transparency Portal in Government Entities.” These norms on the Standard
      Transparency Portal were promoted on the initiative of the SGP in response to constant complaints
      and comments from officials responsible for providing information regarding the difficulties in
      updating institutional Web sites. This legislation also addressed the disordered formats, diverse
      content and inadequate quality of the information published on the Web sites. To view the format
      and the applications of the Standard Transparency Portal, see: http://www.peru.gob.pe/
      transparencia/pep_transparencia.asp.
33.   According to the norm that adopted the implementation of the Standard Transparency Portal
      (Supreme Decree No. 063-2010-PCM), this should be implemented within a period of 30 calendar
      days beginning on the date it went into effect (June 3, 2010) in the case of the national government.
      For regional and local governments that had Web sites, the deadline was 60 calendar days. Local
      district governments that did not have Web sites were given a maximum of one year to develop
      them.

      Transparencia en el Estado.” Presentation at the Third National Conference on Access to Public
      Information. Lima. October 2010. Slides 12–17.
35.   The first implementation phase has the following objectives: (1) make it compatible with systems of
      the Ministry of Economics and Finance (MEF), the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion
      (MTPE) and the Agency for Oversight of Government Contracts (OSCE); (2) apply the
      recommendations of the MESICIC: Information should follow the outline of the publication model set
      forth in Inter-American Model Law on Access to Public Information; and (3) promote good practices
      in the public administration. This was chosen as a good practice in the competition organized by the
      Informed Citizens organization (CAD–2010). The second phase has the following objectives:
      (1) improve the users administrative system to facilitate access in accordance with criteria of functions
      or responsibilities; (2) implement a tool that will permit the migration of Excel files to the contracting
      information module; (3) link public investment projects with the SEACE selection process in an effort
230                                              RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT



            to inform on the procedure through the final implementation phase and to incorporate georeference
            data to locate it on Google Maps; (4) develop multimedia tutorials for users and administrators;
            (5) develop a module to monitor updating of Web sites; and (6) prepare a module for registering
            information on corporations under the National Fund for the Financing of Government Business
            Activity (FONAFE).

      39.   Moreover, as proposed during the First National Conference on Transparency (September 2008), the
            purpose of institutional Web sites is sometimes distorted when public officials perceive them as a
            propaganda tool for the entity rather than as a communications mechanism between government
            bodies and society. The effective functioning of the Web sites is essential given that they are closely
            monitored by civil society, whose perception of transparency of government bodies is largely based
            on what is published on these sites. Nevertheless, the Ombudsman’s Office confirmed that this has
            not served to promote improvements, particularly at the local government level.
      40.   The Specialized Bureaus are: Bureau for the Government Administration; Constitutional Affairs
            Bureau; Bureau for Human Rights and People with Disabilities; Bureau for Women’s Rights; Bureau for
            the Environment, Public Services and Indigenous Peoples; Bureau for Children and Adolescents; and
            Bureau for Social Conflicts and Good Governance.
      41.   The thematic programs are: Indigenous Peoples; Decentralization and Good Government; Identity
            and Citizenship; Protection of Rights in Police Agencies; People with Disabilities; Criminal and Prison
            Affairs; and Public Ethics, Prevention of Corruption and Public Policies.

            Pegram, “Accountability in hostile times: the case of the Peruvian Human Rights Ombudsman.
            1996–2001,” Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol. 40, no. 1, February 2008. Several civil society
            organizations work in partnership with the Ombudsman’s Office to promote compliance with LTAIP.
            For example, the CPP implements the Transparent Municipalities project; the IPYS coorganizes the
            National Conference on Access to Public Information with the Ombudsman’s Office; and CAD
            organizes the Award for Best Practices, with support from the Ombudsman’s Office.

            oversight institutions for 2011. Adopted through Comptroller’s Resolution No. 002-2011-CG, of
            January 10, 2011. This Directive establishes supervision of compliance with LTAIP as a priority control
            activity. These documents (in Spanish) can be viewed at: http://www.contraloria.gob.pe/wps/wcm/

      48.   In this regard, the declarations of the former Comptroller General are pertinent. He stated that LTAIP
            was below the Organic Law of the CGR. This opinion reflected the interpretation that an organic law
            is hierarchically superior to a regular law. Nevertheless, the relation between the two laws is nor

      hierarchical but rather of jurisdiction. An organic law is adopted through a more rigorous procedure
      than a regular law and is reserved for regulating specific areas such as functions and organization of
      certain institutions, but is in no way hierarchically superior to a regular law such as LTAIP. Moreover,
      this type of consideration hinders respect for RTI and creates confusion among public officials,
      negatively affecting the implementation of LTAIP (First National Conference on Access to Public
      Information, September 29–30, 2008).
49.   Since 2008, the IPYS has coorganized the National Conference on Access to Public Information with
      the Ombudsman’s Office. This is a space for discussion, debate and exchange of experiences among
      public officials, experts, civil society leaders, journalists and academics. Public officials include mainly
      the secretaries general of national government entities who are responsible for access to public
      information and the transparency portal. This is the only event that brings together a large number of
      public officials responsible for access to public information and therefore constitutes an important
      forum for debate and proposals with respect to the problems that the government faces in this issue
      as well as the advances. Four conferences have been held so far, with 150 to 200 participants each,
      mostly public officials. The conference is organized with financial support from the Open Society
      Institute.

      administrative system.
53.   With respect to the legislation on archives, Law Decree No. 19414, the Law on the Defense,
      Conservation and Increase of Documentary Heritage, of June 16, 1972, establishes the criteria, rules
      and procedures for the conservation of the documentary heritage. Its Regulations were adopted
      through Supreme Decree No. 022-75-ED, of October 29, 1975. Law No. 25323, adopted on June 11,
      1991, created the National Archive System. Its Regulations were adopted through Supreme Decree
      No. 008-92-JUS of June 26, 1992. In addition, Law No. 28296, the General Law on the Nation’s
      Cultural Heritage, adopted on July 22, 2004, establishes provisions to protect the country’s
      documentary cultural heritage. The regulations of this law were adopted through Supreme Decree
      No. 011-2006-ED of June 1, 2006.

      and because they are considered particularly vulnerable to corrupt practices given that they have a
      large number of beneficiaries and a large budget as well as many procurement and contracting

      77.   Through Ministerial Resolution No. 584-2009/MINSA, of September 2, 2009, targets and performance
            indicators were adopted for the anticorruption policy in the Ministry of Health, among other issues.
            Three indicators are associated with RTI and transparency: (1) number of people trained in standards
            for ethics, transparency and the fight against corruption of the health sector. The 2009 target for this
            indicator was to train 400 people; (2) percentage of publication of mandatory documents in the
            Transparency link of the Ministry’s Web site. The 2009 target for this indicator was 93 percent; and
            (3) number of requests information processed in the framework of LTAIP and the fight against
            corruption. The 2009 indicator was 3,000 processed requests. Compliance with indicators (1) and
            (3) is the responsibility of the Health and Transparency Ombudsman whereas the Office of
            Communications is responsible for indicator (2).

            protection of personal information.

                    Implementing Right to Information
                A Case Study of Romania

1. Introduction
After a short period of debate in the media and among the political class, Law 544 on Access
to Public Information, also referred to as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), was adopted
and became effective in Romania in 2001. This was two years after the country was officially
accepted as a European Union (EU) candidate (in 1999) and at the beginning of a period of
rapid institutional reforms aimed at convincing the EU that the Eastern European state lived up
to the higher European standards of public transparency and integrity.
    FOIA’s scope expanded quickly as a result of pressure from civil society, thus creating a
legal basis for free access to public information to all citizens, without discrimination. The FOIA
has been used by the media and civil society since its adoption—especially during the peak of
the electoral cycles in 2004 and 2008–09; in turn, the law has substantially contributed to their
strengthening and professionalization.

1.1. METHODOLOGY
This case study is based on desk research and interviews conducted with relevant
stakeholders—public officials and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with extensive
experience in applying the legislation—as well as previous studies produced on this subject
matter by these stakeholders.
    Interviews were conducted with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Transports, the National Railways Company (CFR), the National Com-
pany for Motorways and Roads (CNADNR), the Ministry of Education, the Heath Ministry, the
Health Insurance Fund, the National Anticorruption Directorate, the National Integrity Agency,
the Prosecutor’s office attached to the High Court of Cessation and Justice, the Suceava Court
of Appeal, the Mures Court of Appeal, and the University of Bucharest as well as journalists
and NGO representatives.
    This case study is organized into seven sections. Section 2 provides a brief history of the
enactment of Law 544/2001 and section 3 describes the law’s main provisions. Section 4 pro-
vides an overview of the implementation measures put in place, with data and some illustrative
cases. Section 5 presents the system of enforcements and sanctions, while section 6 assesses
the impact of the law and the extent to which the law is being used. Section 7 concludes.

      2. Passage of Law: Context and History
      Like many similar cases over the past decade, the main political driver for the passage of Law
      544/2001 was the process of accession into the European Union (EU). For all the countries who
      managed to complete it,1 this was a decade-long process of technical and political negotia-
      tions aimed at aligning their policies and administrations in key areas of common interest.
      Every member country had to transpose into its national legislation as well as implement a vast
      and complex body of EU laws and regulations—the so-called acquis communautaire.2
           Before the technical negotiations even began, potential member states had to be able to
      prove that they fulfilled certain prerequisites: they had to convince the European Commission
      (EC)3 and other member states that (1) their politics were fully democratic and accountable,
      (2) their civil service was depoliticized and effective, and (3) that the rule of law was in place.
      These are dimensions on which progress is difficult to measure objectively; prescriptions for
      reform are hard to operationalize because improvements, when necessary, require profound
      changes in the politico-administrative system. European decision makers have had to rely on
      peer reviews and periodical political reports to assess improvements in these areas. The exis-
      tence of additional mechanisms such as ATI legislation, although not mandatory as such under
      the EU rules, is perceived as a convincing milestone on the road toward public administration
      improvement.
           Governments in candidate states faced substantial pressure from their civil societies to
      implement the required reforms as soon as possible: joining the EU is regarded as a highly
      desirable goal due to its demonstrated prosperity.4 In all of the countries, league tables were
      regularly published and discussed by the media, and government effectiveness judged by
      how well they performed compared to their peers. In the countries that were the least pre-
      pared (Romania and Bulgaria), the public was the most enthusiastic about joining the EU (over
      80 percent), creating tremendous pressure on governments to demonstrate progress with the
      negotiations. As a result, new legislation was adopted in both Bulgaria and Romania in the late
      1990s and early 2000s.
           There is no specific EU-level regulation or directive dealing with overall access to informa-
      tion (ATI). Public procurement is an exception: because the union’s founding principle is a
      free and open common market with no hidden state aid or privilege for domestic actors, the
      process of public procurement is strictly regulated in terms of openness and transparency. But
      other than this, there is no formal obligation for a member state to adopt ATI legislation in
      order to be accepted into the union. That said, EU actors applied political pressure to the gov-
      ernments of candidate countries, formally and informally, to address their well-known lack of
      transparency. A “soft” acquis emerged over the years dealing with the rule of law, anticorrup-
      tion framework, civil service reform, and media access to information, which was regarded as
      a prerequisite to the official start of negotiations on technical chapters. But even as candidate
      countries considered ATI legislation, they overlooked the impact analysis and budget planning
      needed for its effective implementation.
           NGOs5 and members of parliament (MPs), mainly from the opposition National Lib-
      eral Party (PNL), promoted ATI legislation in Romania in 2001. A new cabinet had just been
      installed in Bucharest the year before, the country was still in the early stages of the road
      toward membership, and the ruling party was eager to follow up on the promises made by its
      predecessors when the commission began negotiations with Romania in 1999–2000.
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                               245




     Because this type of law was judged to be popular with the media and public in general, it
was included on the agenda of the media-conscious Social-Democratic cabinet, emulating the
example of New Labour under Tony Blair. Indeed, arguing that mass media institutions should
have privileged ATI (that is, shorter deadlines for response from public bodies), an idea that
was eventually accepted, the minister in charge made explicit references to the best practices
in the old EU member states.6 Meanwhile, the center-right opposition, with largely Liberal lean-
ings, came up with its own alternative text for the law.7 In fact, the opposition’s draft came to
the Chamber floor first, about half a year before the government’s.
     The process of adopting this new law was in the broader context of Public Administra-
tion Reform (PAR), for which a special unit had been created at the prime minister’s level to
coordinate assistance from donors (mainly the EU and World Bank). While there were about
30 chapters of technical acquis communautaire that the candidate countries needed to adopt,
no such formal blueprints existed for PAR or for judiciary reform beyond general requests
that fairness, professionalism, efficiency, and depoliticization be strengthened. Progress on
these dimensions was—and still is—monitored by a system of self-commitments in the form
of agreed action plans, in addition to monitoring performed either by the commission or the
other member states (peer reviewing). Under the new legislation, classification was the only
justified exception to access. Until then, administrative transparency had not been enshrined in
law, but there were laws on state secrets and their protection.8
     In March 2001, a civil society coalition was forged that effectively facilitated consultations
between the government’s Ministry of Public Information (MPI) and the opposition (mainly the
PNL). A facilitator was needed, since NGOs did not have the legal power to push the initiation
of this legislation. A conservative group of MPs (mainly from the ex-Communist party and the
extreme right) were pushing a draft of the Classified Information Act9 in the chamber at the
same time, so the need to move fast and with a reasonably good draft was critical. Both the
modernizers in government (mainly the leadership of the MPI) and civil society perceived this
as a threat,10 not necessarily because of its provisions (although until then the tendency had
been to interpret such clauses primarily as vehicles for restraining media freedom) but because
of its timing.
     If a classified information law was passed before a freedom of information law, then non-
disclosure would be taken as the norm and disclosure the exception simply because that the
latter law would have to reference the former. Due to the high level of public attention to the
issue, the freedom of information law was adopted first (in 2001); the classified information law
subsequently (as Law 182/2002),11 closely following and operationalizing the system of excep-
tions created by the FOIA (see the next section).
     The result was a common agreement by all parties to a draft freedom of information law
(a rare consensus in the Romanian Parliament) that was subsequently adopted by the cham-
bers in September 2001. The PNL caucus in the lower chamber had a strong leader on this
issue—deputy Mona Musca        ˘ 12—who had been close to civil society for years and was a strong
advocate of transparency. They organized two public hearings on the subject, which were
broadly advertised, and the ministry took the unprecedented step of sending top represen-
tatives to these debates. As a result of this bipartisanship, the final version of the law was
a merger between the ministry and opposition drafts, plus articles and concepts proposed
by NGOs and embraced by the legislators. This consultative process represented a best
practice at the time in terms of civil society’s cooperation with the government and other
political actors.

           The conservative groups from Parliament (mainly the far right group that had held sway
      in the recent past) also raised the issue of public archives. How was information on land and
      building registration (which in most countries was public, but in Romania at that time was
      caught up in the process of post-Communist property restitution) to be dealt with? What
      would be the costs and implications of a large volume of archives being made accessible to
      the public with tight and strict deadlines? The notion of “information of public interest” was
      found to exclude such cases and thus limit the bureaucratic implications.
           Another discussion of the law’s provisions took place when some MPs, also from a fringe-
      conservative group, wanted to make it mandatory for journalists to publish everything they
      received as public information during a press conference or following a request, thereby elimi-
      nating the possibility of being selective in news editing. This was rejected during deliberations
      in parliamentary commissions. But similar ideas periodically resurfaced in subsequent years:
      to create by law an ethics code and forms of associations for journalists; to force the prime-
      time news channels to keep a “balance between positive and negative news”; or to conduct
      mandatory psychiatric checks for mass media employees.13 These were regularly turned down
      by the majority, either in the committees or the plenum, but their endurance indicates bureau-
      cratic opinion regarding free speech, at least among a minority of Romanian officials.
           In general, the mass media played a supportive role in the passing of an ATI law because it
      was beneficial to their profession. Their only concern was that the formalization of interactions
      between reporters and the institutions they covered might slow the investigative process, with
      waiting times measured in weeks. In many instances journalists with privileged contacts in the
      institutions they covered had managed to obtain inside information in real time through infor-
      mal channels. With this in mind, the mass media wanted to make sure that the law would not
      be used as a pretext to excessively bureaucratize ATI and slow down communication, postpon-
      ing answers to questions until the legal deadline.



      3. Strength of the Legal Environment
      The Romanian law is generally in compliance with the principles set forth in the model law
      proposed by Article XIX. This includes the scope of the law’s application, principles of free ATI
      held by public entities, mechanisms for filing requests and obligations of public entities to
      answer such requests, timetables for answering requests, including a special 48-hour deadline
      for requests of information that could “safeguard the life or liberty of a person,” methods
      for making information available, and fees that might be charged for the information. The
      Romanian law also includes an obligation for all relevant entities to appoint a FOIA officer, but
      it does not provide for the establishment of an information commissioner. However, reports
      prepared by each institution on the implementation of the FOIA are collected and aggregated
      annually into a national analysis by the Department of Governmental Strategies (DGS), which
      acts in part like a central monitoring agency.
           The right of ATI has been enshrined in the Romanian constitution in Article 31 since 1991,
      but legislation giving it full effect came into force 10 years later. Law 544/2001 further describes
      the content of this right and develops procedures for ATI. To detail the application of the law,
      the government adopted the Methodological Norms 123/2002.
           Two years after the adoption of the FOIA, the Romanian parliament adopted the law
      of transparent decision making in public administration (Law 52/2003). The law provides for
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                              247




publication and public consultation of all draft regulations before adoption. Drafts must be
published at least 30 days before adoption, and there must be a 10-day period for receiving
comments from the public that are evaluated by the initiator (who decides what ideas will
be included in the final version of the laws). These provisions apply at the national and local
levels, but the parliament is not covered. As a result, laws initiated by MPs are exempted
from these provisions but draft laws proposed by the government have to undergo this
transparency procedure.
    Law 52/2003 also states that meetings of collegial bodies in the public administration are
public, and that the timely notice about the location and agenda of such meetings must be
published. These provisions are more relevant for local and county councils and are directly
applicable to them; no secondary legislation has been adopted to detail them further. But
each of the institutions that fall within the scope of the law may include implementation provi-
sions in its internal regulations and must prepare an annual report on the implementation of
the relevant legal provisions, to be handed over to the DGS.


3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The law applies to all public institutions (central and local), as well as to public companies
where the state is a majority shareholder.14 The initial version did not cover public companies
at all, but NGOs argued that because an important part of the state budget is being spent on
these companies, the law should also cover them, taking into account the particular circum-
stances in which they operate. No differentiation is made between various public institutions
and authorities depending on their fields of competence. All information held by these entities
is deemed public unless it is duly classified or related to personal data. In practice, the nature
of the public entity’s activities dictates the degree of openness: city hall will always be able
to provide more public information than the Intelligence Service or the Ministry of Defense,
though all are covered by the law.
     In Romania, the interpretation of the scope of the law relies heavily on the courts. The
precedents created so far—either spontaneously following individual requests or as a result of
deliberate, strategic litigation initiated by civic groups—lean toward a liberal, pro-transparency
notion of the term “public institution.” Public institutions are thus interpreted as bodies that
are financed wholly from the public purse and are subject to the law as well as those governed
by government appointees (such as public companies), especially those operating in a state-
protected monopoly (hence, without competitors for their commercial activities), such as the
postal service, forest management, and state export-promotion banks).
     The emerging doctrine, therefore, is that the government is created not only by treasury
funds, but also by regulation, and that it should be subject to the disclosure law. Some min-
istries (and occasionally, large foreign or domestic investors) were obviously uncomfortable
with such decisions, but in spite of the fact that the enforcement of decisions may in itself take
some time and effort, there is nothing the ministries, off-budget public bodies, or companies
(even multinationals) that have obtained government contracts can do to stop the process.
Examples given in the following sections attest to this.
     In terms of institutional coverage, the law is comparatively broad, creating obligations for
all “public sector” organizations at large. Not only do ministries, central agencies, and local
governments have to comply with the FOIA, but so do public universities, hospitals, and many
off-budget central and local public companies. The fundamental logic is that if you touch
248                                            RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      public funds or exert public regulatory power, you must comply with FOIA. But this process has
      yet to take roots in Romanian institutional culture. In fact, it is in these gray areas of applicabil-
      ity that the public and legal struggles are being fought by the media and civil society in order
      to create precedents and strengthen procedures. Both chambers of Parliament as well as the
      judiciary are covered by the FOIA.15

      3.2. SCOPE OF EXCEPTIONS
      Every institution must review its existing information, identify and compile a list of documents
      that may be sensitive or could pose problems by being publicly disclosed, and then classify
      them according to the standard procedure. The Romanian law thus implies that any informa-
      tion that is not explicitly classified is accessible to the public by default.
           One of the most sensitive areas in any freedom-of-information law is its exceptions.16 The
      Romanian FOIA exempts from free access any information regarding personal data as well as
      classified information on national defense, public order, deliberations of public authorities, and
      national economic and political interests. It is not enough that the information requested refers
      to a sensitive subject matter, the institution holding the information may refuse access only if
      it has classified the data or if the data refer to personal information. Two separate laws have
      been enacted to further describe the scope of classified information and personal data, which
      significantly contribute to the shaping of the definition of public information.
           The courts not only have the authority to observe procedures followed when a particular
      piece of information is classified, but they can also analyze the merits of the decision by the insti-
      tution to classify. Therefore, there is a opportunity for unsatisfied applicants to go before a judge.
      Here, the burden of proof shifts to the public institution, which must demonstrate that in every
      case (1) due process was followed when nondisclosure occurred; and (2) the content of informa-
      tion set aside from public view justifies its nondisclosure, following the letter and spirit of the law.
           It is very important that the judges have full access to all classified information to be able
      to evaluate whether or not cases have merit—not only from a procedural standpoint, but also
      on the substance.17 The FOIA exempts from classification, information that shows unlawful
      behavior within public entities; under no circumstances can this information be exempted from
      public access.
           In addition to these traditional categories of exempted information, commercial informa-
      tion is also exempted from access if the release of it would breach intellectual property rights
      and the principle of fair competition.
           The judicial process is another sensitive area where the FOIA has to be reconciled with the
      provisions included in the various laws regulating judicial proceedings:
       • Information with regard to criminal or disciplinary investigations is generally not public due
         to the confidential character of such proceedings. But according to the European Court of
         Human Rights, regular information must be provided to the public about high-profile cases
         (those involving high-level corruption and organized crime). The practice of prosecutors’
         offices varies across the country: some issue press releases while others are giving the media
         access to procedural acts (such as indictments). This has in itself been a subject of intense
         media debate, with prosecutors alternatively criticized for disclosing too much (in order to
         create a show and put pressure on the courts) or too little. Information regarding disciplinary
         proceedings is usually not given to the public until a disciplinary sanction is applied.
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                                   249




 • Information regarding judicial proceedings may be exempted from free access only if its
   release would breach the right to a fair trial or the legitimate interest of one of the parties.
   Again, the practice of courts is uneven: some give full access to the judicial file; others
   allow the media and public to be present only during the court sessions to hear what is
   being discussed. This maximal interpretation of the FOIA generated various media
   scandals—with phone-tapping recordings and other evidence from criminal files being
   leaked online or to various newspapers.

    The exemption most difficult to implement relates to information involving the protec-
tion of youth; a similarly worded provision appears in the constitution. To date, no consistent
practice exists regarding the scope of this exemption. This exemption, as well as all the other
exemptions, were debated by NGOs and public sector representatives; the list that is included
in the law reflects the consensus achieved between all parties.
    Also important is the fact that the applicant requesting information does not have an obli-
gation to prove s/he has a specific personal interest in accessing the respective information. In
practice, especially in the first years after the adoption of the law, state entities tried to use this
argument to justify the restriction of public ATI, but the courts have consistently ruled in favor
of applicants.
    All persons—natural or legal, Romanian or foreign—are entitled to ask for and receive
public information. This provision is very important as it opens public records not only to
Romanian nationals, but also to foreign citizens and even persons who do not have citizenship,
as long as they can provide a contact address where the response should be sent.


3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
Information requests may be submitted in writing or orally, but the majority of requests are
submitted in writing (both electronically and on paper). The public information officer performs
a prima facie evaluation of the request and decides if the information requested is public or if
it falls within one of the exceptions. Officers also check if their respective institution holds the
information; if not, the public information officer forwards the request to the appropriate entity
and informs the applicant about this.
     The law has established very strict deadlines18 for answering information requests:
 • Five days from the submission of the request—if access is denied. The refusal must always
   be explained in writing.
 • Ten days from the submission of the request—if access is granted.
 • Thirty days from the submission of the request—if access is granted, but the compilation
   of the answer is complex and time consuming. In this case, the information officer must
   notify the applicant about the need for extra time within 10 days of the filing of the request.

     The media benefit from shorter deadlines: information requested verbally should be imme-
diately or within 24 hours at most. Public entities also have an obligation to hold regular press
conferences and allow journalists to actively participate in these events.
     If, in responding to public requests for information, the institution incurs costs for copying
official documents, the law allows for these costs to be supported by the applicant. This provi-
sion was intensely debated and caused problems during the law’s implementation because
250                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      some NGOs claimed it could be used in bad faith by institutions to practically obstruct citizen
      access to important information by setting high prices for the copies (although this has not
      been reported as having occurred in practice).
         Citizens requests should be compliant with the format provided for in the law’s annex.

      3.4. IMPLEMENTING RULES/REGULATIONS
      Implementation norms were adopted by the government in 2002 detailing the provisions of
      Law 544/2001 and making them more user-friendly for public agencies. The main concern of
      NGOs during the drafting process was to keep the risk of limiting the provisions of the primary
      legislation through secondary legislation under control. In the end, the norms did not affect
      the initial text of the law.
          The methodological norms include templates and forms to be used by applicants for easy
      access to information: information requests, administrative complaints, answers to the informa-
      tion requests, answers to the administrative complaints, and the registry for information requests.
      Very few public institutions have such preprinted documents; in most cases, the applicant must
      find the information and prepare the request according to the standards imposed.



      4. Promotion, Capacity, and Monitoring
      Immediately after the adoption of the FOIA, the MPI undertook the task of monitoring the
      implementation of the law throughout Romania, and mobilized resources for capacity building
      of this new institutional function. The first goal of the ministry was to ensure that information
      officers were appointed in various public entities and to build a network among them. Even
      before the FOIA was adopted, information bureaus were set up at the local level and the pro-
      fessionals that staffed them had organized themselves into a countrywide association initially
      supported by grants from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).19
      But these had not been systematic efforts and therefore the MPI tried to coordinate between
      them and commit more substantial resources to the task.
           In retrospect, it can be said that a truly powerful FOIA coordination agency—one that
      could entrust higher visibility and political salience to the task—failed to materialize in
      Romania. While the MPI existed, it organized a few rounds of training for civil servants, but
      there have been no such systematic initiatives since its closure in 2003. Its successors were
      increasingly marginal institutions—first an agency and—since 2009—a small department in
      the government’s Secretariat General. By virtue of law, they continued to collect primary data
      about FOIA implementation based on the standard fiches filled in by every institution. These
      data were used for compiling very brief and descriptive annual reports.20
           There is, however, little control by this department over the consistency of how the activ-
      ity is quantified, as a series of interviews with sectoral and local practitioners made clear:21
      depending on the sector and nature of activity in every institution, there may be ATI solicita-
      tions from citizens that are purely utilitarian or, on the other hand, that do not fulfill all the
      formal FOIA requirements (for example, urgent requests from journalists). As previously
      discussed, other institutions with a plausible role in this activity (such as the ombudsman)
      refrained from taking any action to consolidate various ATI requests from citizens or from giv-
      ing any guidance to public entities about how they should address these issues.
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                                251




4.1. BUDGET
The tasks related to the FOIA in each institution have no dedicated budget; the designated
officers are civil servants with various other duties in the hierarchy who merely dispatch ATI
requests to the relevant departments. In most of the local institutions analyzed and in the two
sectoral ministries where extensive discussions were held (transportation and education), the
task of processing the FOIA requests is assigned to a press and public relations office, which
registers the requests and monitors their circuit inside the bureaucracy. There is no explicit
budget for this activity.
     While in principle program-project budgeting was introduced in Romania a few years ago,
this element of modern public management has largely remained on paper. Without a proper
system of program budgeting, it is difficult to quantify how much the FOIA implementation
costs. Simply adding up the salaries of the designated FOIA officers would be inaccurate
because very few of them exclusively perform FOIA-related activities in their institutions,
and underestimate of the total administrative costs, because most of the time data are col-
lected and responses compiled in the regular, line units, such as the accounting or legal
departments.
     Big public bodies such as ministries, agencies, or the parliament—where the “institutional
distance” between the accounting department and the small unit in charge of the FOIA
implementation is large—find it too cumbersome to collect per-service fees from applicants to
cover their material costs for FOIA processing, though the law does allow it. Smaller territo-
rial branches or local governments may find collecting money easier, but might choose not
to because it may be unpopular with the public or perceived as abusive and challenged by
activists.22

4.2. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
There is a certain inherited discipline in public administration that guarantees the integrity of
the archiving process and the flow of papers in general. In the FOIA cycle, as confirmed by
most central officials interviewed, the difficulties faced in the early years of the law’s implemen-
tation have been overcome, at least as far as the basic provisions are concerned.23
    The handling of data and documents by institutions could be streamlined. Annex 1, which
deals with the Ministry of Education, explains some of these difficulties that are also encoun-
tered by other public institutions having to respond to thousands of requests asking for data
about personal situations, employment records, or old regulations no longer in force. For
example, the repeated changes in the national pension system after 2000 created a huge
demand for information that people had to obtain from one institution and provide in per-
son to another. Most of this information had to be manually retrieved from physical archives
because the introduction of an integrated IT management system was incomplete.

4.3. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)
Because, with a few notable exceptions,24 there is no systematic electronic record management
system within public institutions, IT intervenes in the FOIA cycle in only two ways:
 • The creation of basic Web pages—or sections on the page of the institution—to disclose
   the ex officio information specified by law. In general, there is no interactivity on these
   pages and very little processing of the info to make it more user-friendly for the visitor.
252                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         For example, staff charts or budgets are scanned and attached as graphic files with poor
         resolution and budgets cannot be converted into spreadsheets for analysis.
       • It is possible for the public to send official FOIA requests by e-mail. This channel of com-
         munication, has become more important in recent years for both receiving requests and
         sending answers: the Ministry of Education reportedly receives up to 20 percent of its
         requests by electronic channels (see case 1 in annex 1), which is above the national average
         discussed in latter sections.

          But IT that is used for communication cannot solve the problem of a lack of integrated data
      management within the concerned institutions. Since most of the requests concern individual
      cases, there is a lot of effort invested in manually shuffling the physical archives of ministries
      that have not yet been transferred to e-platforms. Even in the case of legislative repertoires
      where e-databases were created (on the parliament’s Web site or by commercial companies),
      the staff’s tendency is to recover old pieces of legislation from the ministries’ physical archives,
      largely because the object of the FOIA requests is the secondary or tertiary legislation that
      sometimes does not exist in free-of-charge e-repertoires.
          Old employment files or past pension contributions were also not incorporated in
      e-databases. A lack of integrated management of information makes it difficult even for cur-
      rent news to be recovered and quoted in the official responses to FOIA requests, though they
      may exist somewhere. For example, sometimes the FOIA units do not have the resources to
      identify the information that is already posted as an announcement by a different branch of the
      ministry—not to mention the case of cross-sectoral issues—so time is spent documenting and
      writing a response even though a link to the announcement would have been sufficient.25


      4.4. STAFFING AND TRAINING
      The first obligation created by the FOIA was for all the public bodies covered by it, depend-
      ing on their size, to open public relations offices or at a minimum to designate civil servants in
      charge of FOIA compliance within the institution. The process is currently quite formalized and
      uniform across public bodies: applications are received by the designated service (or person)
      and registered; they are then forwarded to the relevant department for a draft response.
      The draft response is checked by the FOIA officer and countersigned alongside the relevant
      department head’s signature. The official response is sent to the solicitor in the form preferred
      (for example, by paper or e-mail).
           In the event of an urgent solicitation from a journalist, the process is much less formal (and
      more expeditious), which is mostly to their advantage. Another positive step is the clear separa-
      tion of FOIA requests from petitions to institutions that have their own circuit and legal regime.
           Information officers are also responsible for disclosing ex officio information, usually on the
      institutions’ Web sites, although they do not have direct control over the content or technical
      parameters of them. Deficiencies in the Web sites is evidence of a lack of capacity, which, while
      not directly related to the FOIA, may affect compliance with it.
           In general, there has been relatively little formal training for the concerned civil servants
      after the law was adopted, although the ministry had initially put a training plan in place. Sev-
      eral rounds of information sessions were organized and a handbook for FOIA implementation
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                                 253




was printed and distributed. After the MPI was terminated in 2003, support for the task was
reduced even further, especially after its successor agency was also dismantled in 2009. Addi-
tional resources were poured into the system by private operators, mainly external donors
operating directly or through NGO projects. These activities, either in the form of capac-
ity building or independent monitoring initiatives were, as a rule, more visible than those
organized by the central coordinators, but they were far from sufficient to cover the entire
administration.
     At present, most central and local public institutions have appointed FOIA officers, and
they have a reasonable level of awareness of the law’s general provisions. The basic contact
information and most of the ex officio items specified in the law can be found in some form
on the institutional Web sites, with the exception of activity reports, the practice of which
is uneven.

4.5. MONITORING
All entities covered by this law have equal obligations. Apart from designating information offi-
cers and information departments, each institution has to publish an annual newsletter strictly
related to the FOIA that includes various statistics on the ATI process, such as: (1) the number
of submitted requests; (2) the number of requests per topic; (3) the number of requests for
which access was granted; (4) the number of requests for which access was denied; (5) the
number of requests sent on paper and electronically; (6) the number of requests from natu-
ral persons; (7) the number of requests from legal persons; (8) the number of administrative
complaints—solved favorably and rejected; (9) the number of complaints to courts—solved
favorably, rejected, and pending; (10) the expenditure of the public information department;
(11) the price of printing; and (12) the number of visitors to the information center.
     Aside from this newsletter, which is a collection of statistics related to the FOIA process, all
institutions concerned have a separate obligation to write an activity report “at least annu-
ally” (article 5). This important document is, in principle, published in the Official Gazette
of Romania—the formal channel and archive of the laws, government decisions, and public
appointments in the country. This sets a very high threshold in terms of institutional effort
and discipline, and most public institutions fail to live up to the standard. Although the law
makes it compulsory for public institutions to publish these reports, administrative practices
are uneven in this respect, and cases where such reports are not published are numerous. But
when explicitly asked to produce these reports, public entities compile and forward them to
applicants, which demonstrates that at least they are aware of their obligations. In principle,
the FOIA’s secondary legislation offers guidelines on how institutional newsletters and reports
should be prepared and national-level integrative reports compiled. The FOIA officers are
expected to know of these provisions and most are formally aware of them and post the text
of the Law 544/2001 on their institutional Web sites. But introducing meaningful activity reports
as a regular practice is an uphill struggle in the Romanian public administration in spite of the
legal provisions because this depends on more than the goodwill and determination of the
FOIA officers. The functioning and reporting for managerial purposes inside the institution
must change, with leadership exerted from the top, for the FOIA officer to be able to compile
proper activity reports. For example, a pilot study conducted by a think tank in late 2010 has
254                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      shown that—even at the topmost level—compliance with this provision of the law is patchy:
      only 4 out of the 15 Romanian ministries published activity reports in an acceptable form.
          The only role the central government played in the process was to annually monitor
      compliance reports on the law enforcement status. This task was entrusted to the MPI while it
      existed; after 2003, it was passed to a lesser agency under the government’s General Secre-
      tariat (the core cabinet chancellery). This body (the Agency for Government Strategies, or ASG)
      had ambitious goals that it struggled to achieve until it was dismantled in 2009 as part of a
      bureaucracy-reduction drive and replaced with the lower-order DGS. The attention paid to the
      issue of monitoring compliance was of minimal consequence.
          The statistical data regarding the FOIA process were compiled and regularly published
      at the national level in the first few years after the passage of the law. But the quality of the
      information in them was sometimes dubious and made the data hard to interpret. Ministries
      often mixed up the FOIA requests with other requests they may have received from citizens in
      their routine activity. Reportedly, the Ministry of Interior included in its reporting all the appli-
      cations for personal IDs, the traffic fine administrative appeals, and so on, which pushed its
      rate of requests into tens of thousands per year; other ministries made similar uncoordinated
      calculations. After accession to the EU, the attention devoted to this topic almost disap-
      peared, along with the fear of governments that they could somehow be penalized by their
      European partners.
          Even information related to the FOIA process is suboptimal. In annex 1, where data from
      the Ministry of Education are provided, some data do not add up. For instance, the total for
      the number of requests received does not correspond in all the tables: the number of oral
      requests in one place is larger that the overall total in the other, the number of e-mailed
      requests received appears suspiciously high when compared to the total, and so on. The
      transportation ministry provides aggregate sectoral data that are even more difficult to make
      sense of and there is little control over how subordinated public companies like the railways
      interpret and report requests.26 These are relatively independent commercial operators and, in
      practice, it is difficult for a middle civil servant in the ministry, entrusted with what is perceived
      as a marginal task, to enforce procedural rules.
          One more glaring example of poor records management and the inefficient use of exist-
      ing IT resources is the procedure for centralizing information on FOIA implementation in the
      DSG. The standard fiches with data (included in annex 1) received from institutions are in Word
      format and often faxed. In such cases, extra processing is needed and data sometimes has
      to be manually retyped onto a spreadsheet in order to generate the national-level report. It
      is unclear why the coordinating agency does not create a universal Excel template to be sent
      exclusively by e-mail, a measure that would facilitate data aggregation.27


      5. Enforcement and Sanctions
      5.1. APPEALS
      In Romania, the process for appealing administration decisions has two phases. First, an
      administrative complaint is filed with the respective agency. If applicants are not satisfied with
A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA                                                                                  255




the answers received, they may file an administrative complaint to the head of the public entity
that refused access. Each public entity has a commission that hears and decides whether or
not these complaints are valid and communicates that answer to the applicant. If this response
is unsatisfactory to the applicant, it can be challenged in court. This procedure also covers
administrative silence: if no answer is provided within the legal time frame, the applicant may
consider this to be a negative response.
     The second line of appeals is to the courts, and enforcement of the FOIA relies almost
completely on the judicial system and the deterrence created by court-dictated sanctions.
When an institution procrastinates, the persons requesting information must go to court to
(re)establish their rights. Therefore, over the years, the law has generated a string of cases
and court precedents, like a type of sui-generis common law system, although the judges’
decisions do not come together easily into a unitary practice—that is, judgments are not
always uniform.
     The Romanian FOIA legislation did not entrust the People’s Advocate with any specific
authority. But given that free access to information is a right guaranteed under the constitution
and the general function of this institution is to foster the rights of individuals in their relation-
ship to the public sector and to publicly sanction the deviation of the public sector from the
norm, NGOs (such as Transparency International Romania) tried to involve the ombudsman
in the implementation of the FOIA. But the People’s Advocate did not have the authority to
sanction breaches of the law, nor could it force public institutions to behave according to the
FOIA. The effectiveness of such an ombudsman—with only an advisory role—depends on local
traditions and administrative culture; for example, the effect on heads of public institutions
who are singled out for lack of transparency by a body without any power to punish them, the
efficiency of the system of checks and balances and the indirect social accountability in a given
area, and the frequency of such transgressions. A large variation exists in this respect between
countries, even within the EU: the ombudsman’s office in Sweden operates much better and is
much more visible than the ones in the new member states.
     In practice, the courts shaped the interpretation of the law and set the boundaries of
the right to free ATI. NGO advocacy programs focused on testing the FOIA were instrumen-
tal in bringing strategic litigation to court, allowing judges to pass rulings in this field. Even
nontransparent entities were eventually forced by the decisions of the courts to open their
doors.28 This method of making the law operational is an entrenched habit in Romania, where
pronouncements are taken into account by other institutions only if the entity generating them
has clear enforcement powers. This tends to be the rule in post-Communist countries, and
probably explains why noncompulsory guidance issued by bodies—such as the ombudsman or
the information commissioner—tends to be disregarded.
     Crucial for the enforcement process—but also for deterrence—is the fact that once a judge
has decided against a public institution, the information must be disclosed immediately. If it
is not, the judge may impose financial penalties that apply to heads of institution individually
or to both the head and the FOIA officer as a fraction of their salaries. The fines accrue daily
until the decision of the court is enforced (that is, until the information requested satisfactorily
reaches the applicant). The data on administrative complaints and court cases are shown on
the following page.

     As the data above show, in the first years after the adoption of the FOIA, there were not
many court complaints: up to 400 in 2003, they reached a plateau of about 1,000 for the inter-
val 2006−09. This increase was mostly due to an accumulation effect. It takes over a year for a
full action before a court to be finalized; therefore, a case is also counted in the following year.
The other explanation for the immediate increase since 2003 is the strategic litigation initiated
by NGOs as a result of unsatisfactory responses received from public entities. Their actions
in the courts—highly visible and covered by the media—may have had an effect both on the
administration, by making it treat such requests more diligently, and on the general public, by
encouraging them to pick up the law and use it. After an initial increase, the number of com-
plaints stabilized in the subsequent years. The practice of the courts also fluctuated—as can be
seen in the charts in figure 2.
     The high percentage of solutions to administrative complaints in favor of the plaintiff,
especially in the first years after the adoption of the law, is probably a reflection of a learn-
ing process: civil servants who were directly responsible took time to understand how the law
worked, and the FOIA process took some time to be institutionalized. It is encouraging that
the heads of institutions, to which the administrative complaints were submitted, have more
often than not stood with the plaintiffs (69 percent in 2003; 92 percent in 2004; 79 percent in
2007; and in more than 50 percent of cases in all years), which demonstrates that there was not
much procrastination regarding enforcement—at least in statistical terms.



6. Compliance
6.1. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
All entities covered by the law must publish proactively (without a prior request) the following
information:
 • the laws and regulations governing the respective entity;
 • the organizational structure, the competences of each department, the opening hours, and
   the schedule for holding audiences;
 • the names of the persons leading the respective entity and the name of the public informa-
   tion officer;
 • the contact details of the entity: headquarters, phone number, fax, e-mail, Web site;
 • financial sources, the budget, and the executed budget;

       • programs and strategies;
       • a list of documents that are of public interest;
       • a list containing all documents generated or administered by the respective entity; and
       • an outline of the appeals procedure if a person is unhappy with the public entity’s answer.

          People may access this information either by going to the public entity’s headquarters or
      by consulting its Web site. Information regarding private29 and public procurement contracts30
      should also be provided to the public at the entity’s headquarters. Many public institutions did
      start to post more information ex-officio on their Web sites after the FOIA was adopted. There
      was a general understanding that the leadership should be identified, contact data should
      exist, the institution’s budget should be made available (although the format of the budgets
      continued to be a problem), and a link to an FOIA officer, with an explanation provided about
      the procedures for requesting information that is not available online. This was generally the
      situation with “core government” institutions; 10 years after the law was passed, public school,
      university, and hospital management remained unaware that they had similar obligations under
      the FOIA.
          The quality and completeness of information posted online is still weak. A top-level deci-
      sion was made to reduce compliance costs across the entire public administration with the
      posting of more relevant information online in the correct format, reducing the need for active
      requests; however, there are few signs of this occurring in practice. On average, 50 percent of
      central institutions used their Web sites to publicize information covered by Law 544 in 2008; at
      the local level, the figure was about 25 percent.

      6.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
      The most encouraging development was the appearance of several active stakeholders in
      civil society who picked up the law and used it: citizens with individual requests; journalists
      conducting investigations; NGOs conducting systematic monitoring that reinforced the rules
      within institutions and witnessed the emergence of a critical mass of court decisions predomi-
      nantly leaning toward disclosure—at least in high-profile, flagship cases. The issue was also
      signaled in cross-country quality of governance ratings; as a result, scores on voice and media
      freedom have improved.31 Applicants also quickly learned how to use the procedures, resulting
      in a decline in the number of rejected requests.
           The total volume of requests was relatively high (see table 3 and figure 3) and the rate
      of response good, according to reports compiled by the central government unit (ASG until
      2009; then DGS).32 Most of the solicitations (70−80 percent in the interval analyzed) came from
      individuals; all others came from legal persons (see table 5). Solicitations were usually turned
      down because (1) the information requested did not exist in the institution (in which case the
      applicant may or may not have been properly redirected); or (2) the information requested was
      exempted from publication under the law. None of the key persons from central institutions
      interviewed was able to explain why the percentage of refusals went up so dramatically—from
      1−3 percent before 2006 to 39 percent in 2008 (see table 3).
           The instruments used by applicants for information (according to 2008 data, table 4)
      are (1) verbal requests (55 percent), (2) written requests (33 percent), and (3) e-mail requests
      (12 percent). Here too a trend is discernible: verbal requests are declining in number; e-mails
      are increasing. The latter were prevalent in the first few years as citizens and companies tended

      to employ Law 544 for getting any kind of utilitarian information they needed in their dealings
      with public authorities. The administration was also likely to report all routine interactions with
      citizens as requests under Law 544, probably as an old reflex to show a high volume of activity
      in the periodical reports.
           The central administration and its subordinated institutions handle between 66–75 per-
      cent of all requests. The deconcentrated, territorial offices of ministries and national public
      companies are also categorized as central bodies, which explains their high number: it is very
      likely citizens go to these institutions to solve their individual problems (such a various types
      of approvals, public services, and so on) and make appeals under Law 544 only in hopes of
      speeding up the process.
           Even in recent years, the public information most frequently demanded had to do with
      normative acts and regulations, including local ones (approximately 40 percent or more).
      This reflects the practical limitations (high monetary and information costs) ordinary citizens
      and companies face when using legal databases online as well as the poor selection of such
      information posted ex officio on the Web sites of the relevant institutions. Information about
      budget allocations and the use of public funds comes next at 25−30 percent, which, from an
      accountability standpoint, is encouraging. This category is on the rise overall, but it is also the
      one in which most administrative rejections have occurred, usually when requests somehow
      involved personal financial data.
           The mass media has attempted to get access to interesting bits of information from vari-
      ous public institutions (such as budgets, projects, tenders, and conflicts of interests). Some
      journalists have learned how to use the law, and with the occasional assistance from leading
      NGOs and media associations, have taken the time and trouble to go to court to establish
      precedents. Public advocacy programs have been carried out by NGOs and think tanks,
      sometimes with donor support, explicitly aimed at creating a string of strategic precedents,
      increased awareness of the law’s provisions, and—by implication—a deterrence effect against
      noncompliance.
           The need for this kind of intermediary role arose from the fact that the Romanian public
      had little experience in requesting access to data that were not immediately useful in indi-
      vidual transactions and little expertise in analyzing the more structured type of information
      that public agencies produce under the FOIA (activity reports, budgets, expenditure reports,
      and so on). Equally important was the need to monitor the responsiveness and compliance
      of public agencies to the FOIA in a more systematic way than random requests from citizens
      could ensure.
           Another important function of such an intermediary is to aggregate and streamline citizen
      requests, thus reducing duplication and the workload of public institutions, including collect-
      ing public information released under the FOIA’s provisions, processing and presenting it in a

user-friendly format, assisting citizens in submitting requests to public agencies, and monitor-
ing the responsiveness of the latter. They also interacted with and advised public agencies (at
their request) on how to release public information.



7. Analysis
The media and civil society embraced the law and, based on its provisions, created practices
and monitoring tools. They did this using a broad array of tools and interventions, sometimes
using institutional support for consolidating good practices in institutions, but more often tak-
ing a confrontational approach by:
 • Quantifying compliance and publishing ranking tables that follow standardized, mock
   requests (case 2 in annex 1). Here, compliance with the law’s provisions—especially the
   existence and quality of ex ante documents that must exist in the public domain—was
   considered not only a measure of institutional openness, but also a proxy for administrative
   capacity in general (examples given in cases 2 and 3).
 • Suing state bodies on the FOIA to test the limits of the law’s applicability and creating valu-
   able and visible legal precedents (cases 2 and 3).

     The creativity of a few civil society actors in exploiting the possibilities offered by the law
has been remarkable. The Center for Independent Journalism ran a series of workshops, train-
ing many investigative and political reporters on how to use the FOIA and provided ready-
made forms for information requests to eliminate the risk that an appeal would be rejected
in court based on a technicality. The Institute for Public Policy (IPP), a think tank, organized
systematic programs for many years to build individual track records of voting (both in the
national parliament and local councils), and established rankings of the office expenditures of
MPs and councilors. Such databases, when published, carry a lot a political weight and gener-
ate media coverage, which is crucial for the intended deterrence effect.
     The Romanian Academic Society (SAR), a Bucharest-based think tank,33 ran a series of proj-
ects for about 5 years to measure the transparency and quality of ex officio public information
on public university Web sites. League tables were prepared based on these scores and made
public in what became a high-profile exercise in “naming and shaming” based on this trans-
parency criteria. Evidence from a second round of evaluations of the same universities showed
marked improvement as a result of this monitoring. The project was modeled after a previous
one carried out by the same organization that had effectively used the same instrument—the
FOIA—to monitor the political integrity of party candidates in the 2004 national elections.34
     The same exercise was performed in several rounds on a sample of about 300 “core” pub-
lic authorities (ministries, territorial agencies, and local governments), by either testing them
on their compliance with the general FOIA provisions or by explicitly requesting more sensi-
tive information, like the full record of public procurement from the previous budget year (see
case 1 in annex 1). In all cases, rankings were prepared and published by sector and institution,
and these became widely debated in the national and local media, including on talk shows.
     Finally, the SAR, the IPP, and several other civic actors appeared before courts with
strategic and visible cases about information of public interest not being willingly disclosed
by public institutions. They won almost all of them, whether the issue at stake was the break-
down of office expenses by an individual councilor—decision: this is not personal information;
262                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      conditions of privatization of a car-making plant with Ford Motors by the State Property
      Authority—decision: confidentiality clauses requested by the investor and accepted by the
      state cannot override the law, so the contract and all annexes should be made public; or public
      relations and service contracts concluded by the state-owned export-promotion Eximbank—
      decision: these contracts are not covered by the banking secrecy rules because these apply
      only to clients, not to subcontractors (more details in case 2, annex 1).
           The fact that, on average, the central and local public institutions have responded favor-
      ably to 95–98 percent of requests received is encouraging and testifies to the strong deter-
      rence effect created by the flagship court cases initiated and popularized by the media and
      civic activists. In interviews, leaders of journalism associations explicitly mentioned such
      initiatives triggered good practices in public institutions that have become more forthcoming
      since these high-profile campaigns. In another widely publicized initiative in 2005 (see note 32),
      APADOR-CH, a human-rights nonprofit association, sued the General Prosecutor’s Office over
      data on phone tapping by the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), the only agency entrusted
      with phone surveillance in Romania. They sued after they had obtained a mandate from the
      magistrates asking the SRI to produce the data on the number of surveillance operations and
      subjects there were in the previous year. By tradition, putting such reports in the public domain
      would have been unthinkable, as state secret laws automatically covered all such operations.
      But the courts finally adjudicated in favor of the plaintiffs and forced the SRI to prepare a
      report summarizing data on the surveillance operations. Tackling head-on one of the most
      sensitive areas of public policy—state intelligence services and the telephone surveillance
      system—the activists thus created a landmark precedent that probably influenced not only
      subsequent court decisions, but also the functioning of the state bureaucracies who learned
      that there are rules to be complied with even in domains that had seemed closed to public
      scrutiny.
           In principle, the media was supportive of such initiatives. But the situation was complicated
      by the fact that in a small media market,35 the higher journalistic agenda is often superseded
      by the narrow interests of the owners, which are often more political than economic. As a
      result, while praising transparency and anticorruption measures in principle, some media chan-
      nels hosted public campaigns against the very champions of such moves: civic activists and
      public officials who were promoters of the reform.
           In theory, businesses would be one of the beneficiaries from a more open and accountable
      administration, but to date, no critical mass has appeared among entrepreneurs in favor of this
      position. This is probably due to a difficult operating environment that creates a free-riding
      dilemma: whoever makes the first move will incur the full cost, while the benefits, if any, would
      accrue to all.

Annex 1


7.1. CASE 1. HOW FOIA-RELATED TASKS ARE PERFORMED IN A LARGE
SECTORAL MINISTRY: EDUCATION
Like most large central institutions that have extensive interaction with the public, the Ministry
of Education has a Press and Public Relations (PR) Service which is officially in charge of
processing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests received by the headquarters.
Similarly, the 41 county-level branches of the ministry (education inspectorates) have smaller
communication units—usually consisting of one person—to fulfill the same function. The Press
and PR Service in the ministry centralizes the standard fiches from the region and sends the
aggregate data to the DGS once a year. The regular petitions to the ministry follow a separate
path for processing and reporting and are not mixed up with the FOIA requests.
     Although the Ministry of Education is a big structure, the Press and PR Service is a rather
small unit made up of three civil servants. Their duties are largely threefold: (1) to monitor the
media and organize the ministry’s official communications, such as press releases and press
conferences; (2) to receive, register, and process FOIA solicitations; and (3) to organize the
proactive disclosure of public information, according to the law. This unit does not have its own
budget as such, nor is the ministry’s annual budget programming process organized to take
into account the actual volume of the FOIA activity and budget. The only concrete element of
resource programming for the FOIA tasks are the salaries of the three civil servants.
     Another issue is that of the administrative fees, which by law public institutions can charge
to applicants whose FOIA requests involve a substantial amount of work and use of public
resources. In practice, though, this provision is difficult to apply, especially in large institutions
like ministries: the Press and PR unit has no procedure for charging and collecting money from
applicants and the ministry’s accounting department is in a different location and too over-
worked to find time to create procedures for collecting what they perceive as trivial sums.
     The final result is that, because the Press and PR unit prefers not to charge for the copies
or other expenses, and in order to avoid cumbersome procedures that might end up being
more annoying for the applicant in terms of time rather than money, a modest source of extra
revenue is lost that could have supplemented the usually tight budget for materials and con-
sumables. Not surprisingly, the territorial branches (inspectorates), being smaller institutions,
find it easier to organize the charging of service fees. According to existing data, in 2009, they
incurred a net benefit from this activity: they collected about $10,000 in revenues from charges
against costs of about $7,000. However, these numbers, especially regarding costs, should be
regarded with caution.
     In terms of content, the vast majority of FOIA requests are somewhat utilitarian in nature
(see table 6): teachers inquiring about various pieces of legislation on regulations, mostly
related to salary arrangements or promotion exams; students with individual problems or
grievances; or retired teachers asked by the pension fund to produce documents from their
active period. After 2005, there were a few rounds of pension recalculations done by the
264                                                   RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      government to rectify some imbalances, but due to the poor organization of the national
      pensions archives, the process ended with many people having to individually document their
      salary regime during the various stages of their active life. As a result, the ministry’s FOIA unit
      was burdened with a lot of archival work, frustratingly done on a case-by-case basis.
          Apart from these run-of-the-mill tasks, the units also receive occasional requests for
      information of authentic public interest from NGOs or investigative journalists, such as those
      related to the use of public resources, tenders and public contracts, and performance indica-
      tors of the education system. Each request is registered at the Press and PR unit and directed
      to the relevant ministerial department, the majority going to the legal service; others to the
      economic directorate, the curriculum unit, and so on. The draft responses from the department
      come back to the unit, are rechecked by the head of the service, and are sent to the solicitor
      and to the head of the sectoral department who prepare the draft to be signed. According to
      the head of one FOIA unit who would occasionally meet and have discussions with his counter-
      parts in other ministries and central institutions, there were some problems in the first two or
      three years after the law was passed with the interpretation of some of its provisions and in the
      organization of the flow of documents, but that in the last few years, “the practice has stricken
      roots and became reasonably well institutionalized.”36
          Though not explicitly requested by law, in some cases of “sensitive requests”—such as,
      minister’s actions, important policy changes, or significant contracts and tenders—the head
      of the Press and PR unit also consults the minister’s advisors before sending the reply to the
      applicant. Also, according to the head of the unit, solicitations coming from the mass media
      are given preferential treatment in this ministry and others in the sense that they are processed
      faster and not delayed until the legal deadline.
          In terms of numbers and categories of requests received by this ministry, the last year for
      which information was officially reported (2009) shows the following numbers (categories follow
      the format of the standardized fiche provided by the law):

      7.2. CASE 2. MONITORING OF TRANSPARENCY BY SAMPLING INSTITUTIONS:
      THE CASE OF PROCUREMENT
      In 2009, a sample of 281 public institutions from all sectors and tiers of government was devel-
      oped by the Romanian Academic Society (SAR), a Bucharest-based think tank, to test them on
      the actual implementation of the legal provisions on transparency in public procurement.
          The requests for data using the standard forms under Law 544/2001 were sent to each of
      the institutions by fax or/and e-mail, with follow-up requests to those who did not respond on
      time. The quality and completeness of the answers were quantified as well as the timeliness
      according to the law, the aim being to monitor the whole procurement process in the respec-
      tive institution. A public procurement list of contracts above €5,000 was requested for the
      previous year, which included details such as: (1) the type of procurement procedure, (2) the
      justification of the type of procurement procedure chosen, (3) the types and quantities of
      products/services purchased, (4) the suppliers who won the contracts, and (5) the total value of
      the procurement. The scoring system is explained below and the following table summarizes
      the results.
       • Speed of response (code): (1) within 10 days; (2) within 30 days; (3) after 30 days;
         (4) none.
       • Completeness of response (code): (1) everything requested in the reasonable form
         (directly, functional Web site), friendly style; (2) reasonable but telegraphic; (3) partial;
         (4) unsatisfactory.
       • Quality of the existing documentation (dispatched, accessible online, and so on), under-
         standing of the procurement process (code): (1) the procurement process compliant with
         type of procurement versus contract value and with explicit justifications for exceptions;
         (2) the procurement process seems to be compliant, but justifications are not complete;
         (3) the procurement process is not justified from the viewpoint of the contract value; or
         (4) this point has been ignored.

7.3. CASE 3. STRATEGIC LITIGATION ON LAW 544/2001
To supplement the data collection (case 1), gain a better insight into the practice at the subna-
tional level, and investigate particular cases closer, the monitoring system also included a more
intensive component based on the direct request of access to the whole procurement dossier
to evaluate its accuracy and completeness. Local investigative journalists with an interest and
some experience in public procurement were selected. They were further trained by the SAR
and assisted in the submission of applications for access to all procurement dossiers in a list of
29 cases considered “sensitive” (having high visibility, dealing with suspicions of fraud aired in
the media, and so on).
    The 29 procurement/concession contracts surveyed were:
 • AVAS (state privatization agency): selling of an automaker to Ford Motors.
 • The National Authority for Mineral Resources (ANRM): offshore oil exploitation,
   Petrom-OMV.
 • Bucharest metro company (Metrorex): contract for advertising spaces.
 • Eximbank (state bank): contract for the acquisition of publicity and promotion services.
 • Local government of District 1, Bucharest: large garbage collection contract.
 • Cluj County Council: concession contracts for shopping mall, Nokia factory, and traffic
   monitoring cameras.
 • Agro University of Cluj: real estate concession.
                       ¸ a: eight contracts with press and publicity agencies, security firms,
 • Town Hall of Constant
   and park maintenance companies.
268                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




            ¸ ov County Council: work contracts for offices, social housing, and sports grounds.
       • Bras
                         ¸ ov: road and school rehabilitation contracts.
       • Town Hall of Bras
       • Municipal Transport Company, Oradea: purchase of streetcars.
       • Oradea University: The construction of the University Library.
       • Rural municipality of Sânmartin: sale of forested land.
       • Bihor County Council: rehabilitation of roads.
                        ¸ i: services contract for towing vehicles.
       • Town Hall of Ias
           ¸ i, two hospitals: contracts for rehabilitation of premises and purchasing medical
       • Ias
         equipment.

           The main results from this evaluation showed a high variability of local practices, from
      full disclosure to complete opacity. In general, off-budget institutions such as hospitals and
      schools were surprised to learn they were covered by the FOIA and must, as a result, make all
      their proceedings public. A similar thing occurred with the state export-promotion bank, which
      actually pretended that their purchase of PR and legal services was covered by the bank’s
      secrecy laws and with the state privatization agency, which blamed its private partners for pres-
      suring it into including confidentiality clauses in the contract. The court found these clauses
      groundless so the privatization file was made public.
           To build a visible portfolio of best-practice cases, to clarify who has the obligation to
      provide public information and who doesn’t, and to establish the extent to which a public
      authority may accept the idea of some contractors/associates introducing confidentiality
      clauses in their contracts, the SAR initiated legal action in the public interest based on Law
      544/2001 against the above-mentioned institutions. Based on resources available, six institu-
      tions were selected for the strategic importance of the judicial precedent to be created: AVAS,
      ANRM, Metrorex, Eximbank, the local government of District 1-Bucharest, and the Town Hall of
      Constant  ¸ a. The actions were introduced in 2009, and the think tank won all six cases, including
      the three for which the institutions appealed the first-order court decision.
           These decisions are important because they reinforce the doctrine that even “special”
      public institutions that are market-based and have commercial revenues, such as the state-
      owned Eximbank, are subject to Law 544/2001 with regard to their procurement process (but
      not their banking operations), and that even “strategic” privatizations or offshore oil explora-
      tion contracts must meet the requirements of transparency applicable to normal procurement
      operations. The law has been an effective tool for achieving such results.

Notes

8.    The first round of European ex-Communist countries (eight) were accepted into the EU in 2004,
      together with Cyprus and Malta. Romania and Bulgaria were still unprepared at that time and only
      managed to join, after substantial efforts, at the beginning of 2007.
9.    The body of laws and regulations governing the EU.
10.   The executive of the Union.
11.   Support for EU membership in public opinion polls differed from one country to another, but the
      general majority was in favor everywhere.
12.   Among which were the Helsinki Committee; the Freedom House, Romania; the Romanian Academic
      Society (SAR); and various journalists associations (see list of interviews in annex 2).
13.   Interview with Vasile Dâncu, former Minister of Public Information, Cluj, May 2011.

19.   See note 8.
20.   Among the promoters of such ideas in subsequent years were the ex-senator Gheorghe Funar
      (extreme right) as well as ex-senator Ioan Ghise and deputy Silviu Prigoana, both individual mavericks
      from otherwise centrist parties.
21.   Article 2(a) of Law 544/2001.
22.   With reasonable exemptions granted for documents pertaining to investigations or pending court
      cases (see next section).
23.   Article 12 provides for the following exceptions: (1) information regarding national defense, safety, and
      public order, if it is classified information; (2) information regarding the deliberations and that
      regarding the economic and political interests of Romania if it is classified information; (3) information
      regarding the commercial or financial activities if its publicity breaches the intellectual property rights
      or the principle of fair competition; (4) personal data; (5) information regarding criminal or disciplinary
      investigations if, through its publicity, the investigation is endangered or confidential sources are
      disclosed, or if the life, personal integrity, or the health of a person related to the investigation is
      endangered; (6) information regarding judicial proceedings if the right to a fair trial or a legitimate
      interest of one of the parties is breached; and (7) information that would endanger the measures for
      the protection of the youth if made public. It is article 12 of the law, as indicated, transposed into
      shorter language.
24.   For example, when a local NGO appealed in court against the secrecy of the file on the Craiova car
      factory privatization by Ford Motors, the judge’s access to the full tender dossier was crucial. Finally,
      the decision went in favor of the NGO, and the government had to disclose the tender
      documentation.
25.   The implementing norms specify that the deadlines shall be calculated taking into account the
      number of working—not calendar—days.
26.   Telephone interview with Valeriu Guguianu, expert, DGS, Bucharest, August 2011.
27.   The last two issues, 2008 and 2009, are two of the sources of hard data included in this report.
28.   See annex 2 with the names of interviewed local-level FOIA officers.

      29. This was true in some cases: obstructive local governments imposed unreasonable high fees that were
          subsequently challenged in court, creating a lot of negative publicity for the political leaders of the
          institution. Interviews with Dan Tapalaga ˘ (journalist), Codru Vrabie (activist), and local FOIA officers (see
          list in annex 2) in Bucharest (August 2011) and Sinaia (April−May 2011).
      30. Interviews with Tomoni and Buzasu, from education and transportation, respectively (list in annex 2),
          Bucharest, August 2011.
      31. For example, the budgets in spreadsheet format or some legal databases.
      32. This was mentioned in relation with tenure competitions in the school system, for example. Interviews
          with local FOIA officers (see list in annex 2).
      33. Interview with ex-secretary of state Buzasu, note 26.
      34. Apparently the reason is that the exact form provided as an annex to the law must be used, which is,
          of course, in text format.
      35. For example, the General Prosecutor’s Office was ordered by a court decision in 2005 to provide
          information to APADOR-CH (the local affiliate of the Helsinki Committee, a human rights watch
          organization) on the number of phone tappings performed during the previous year with its approval
          by the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI).

                    A Case Study of Uganda

1. Introduction
Until 2010, Uganda was one of only four countries in Africa1 with an access-to-information law,
the Access to Information Act (ATIA), which was passed by Parliament in 2005, and formally
came into effect in April 2006. Undertaken as part of a series of reforms in the lead up to the
2006 multiparty elections in the country, the passage of the law operationalized Article 41
of the Constitution, which provides citizens with the formal right to information (RTI) from
the government.
    The establishment of a legal right to government information by citizens is a critical
principle in the quest for more accountable governments. The high profile examples of India
and Mexico and, to some extent, South Africa, have created enormous expectations for RTI
laws. Throughout much of Africa, focus on the passage of RTI laws has been one of the key
issues of civil society activism. Unlike primarily promotional instruments that focus on promot-
ing proactive disclosure by the government, the establishment of RTI shifts the balance on
information control from a presumption of secrecy to a presumption of disclosure; citizens now
have a formal, enforceable right enshrined in law to access a range of government informa-
tion—everything that is not included in the list of exemptions. This is a significant step in the
establishment of a key principle of accountable governance and represents a major develop-
ment in governance systems characterized by archaic secrecy laws.
    But, as is clear from the example of Uganda, the establishment of the law is a critical but
inadequate step in the direction of instituting accountable governance. Sustained changes in
transparency and accountability require concerted actions along several fronts. In Uganda, the
theoretical victory clearly did not translate into a practical transformation in the accountability
relationship between civil society and the government for the first six years of implementation.
The passage of the law provided civil society groups a platform for engagement with govern-
ment and advocacy efforts for greater accountability. But beyond this, the law did not succeed
as a tool to mobilize or operationalize latent demand among citizens for information, nor did it
serve as a tool for making government officials responsive to such requests. Very few measures
were taken to enable the implementation of the law, and critical stumbling blocks rendered
the other measures ineffectual; the most marked among them was the absence of regulations
to operationalize the law for several years after its passage. Somewhat proactive civil society
groups2 did consistently lobby for the operationalization of the law, but awareness about its


                                                                                                      283

      existence—even among civil society groups, aside from governance-focused NGOs—remained
      limited.3 The handful of requests for information that have been filed using the ATIA have failed.
           This paper assesses the experience of Uganda during the six-year period after the adop-
      tion of the 2005 Access to Information Act. The study is undertaken as part of a series of case
      studies on the implementation of access-to-information reforms in countries with a diverse set
      of experiences, range of income levels, and institutional capacity, and relative capacity and
      influence of civil society.4 In the comparative perspective, the experience of Uganda on imple-
      mentation is lagging that of other countries significantly.
           The study is intended to serve three key objectives:
       • To contribute to the drawing of comparative insights into the challenges and lessons of
         implementation.
       • To assess the progress of implementation of ATIA, highlighting shortcomings, and propos-
         ing steps that could be taken to improve the implementation apparatus for access to
         information (ATI), drawing especially from the example of other countries and aimed at
         implementers and policymakers in Uganda.
       • To provide a resource for other policy professionals and advocacy groups working in Africa
         and elsewhere in that the study highlights the fact that gaps in both design and imple-
         mentation can be significant stumbling blocks to ATI laws. It would be useful for other
         countries in the region to examine the Uganda example to assess where the constraints to
         implementation could arise.

           The study looked at three key dimensions of the operationalization of the ATIA: (1) whether
      the key mechanisms for implementation had been set in place; (2) if the law was being used as
      an instrument for enabling information access by citizens (either through proactive disclosure
      or responses to requests); and (3) whether the ATIA was enabling a change in the accountabil-
      ity relationships between state actors and civil society—a key objective of the law.
           The study found that the answer on all three dimensions was negative. The various indica-
      tors used to assess the extent of the operation of the law show that efforts to implement it
      have been very limited. Some measures have been taken, including the identification of a
      nodal implementing agency, the preparation by the nodal agency of a fairly detailed imple-
      mentation plan, and the appointment of dedicated information officers (IOs) in some minis-
      tries, departments, and agencies in response to an ATIA-related circular. But implementation
      has been stalled by an absence of key mechanisms, particularly implementing regulations.
           With regard to the second dimension, research revealed only a few instances where the law
      was cited to request information. These were high profile cases or efforts to test the ATIA by
      civil society groups through requests; in every instance, they were met with denial or nonre-
      sponse, revealing the weaknesses of the implementation regime. While several advances have
      been made in the overall management and dissemination of information, the use of ATIA
      has not, to date, resulted in the disclosure of any secret information. With regard to proactive
      disclosure, many ministries have a range of initiatives to make information available, but they
      were not in response to the ATIA mandate per se.
           Regarding the third dimension, the relationship between an ATI law and accountability is
      more complex. The existence of the law has two advantages. First, the law itself represents
      an important principle, making it an important part of the institutional development of the
      country that can be the basis for future transparency. Second, ATI laws can provide an impor-
      tant platform for civil society for engaging the government on accountability issues and keep
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                               285




these issues in the forefront of the public debate, as has happened in Uganda with numerous
workshops and activities of NGOs. But the ATIA has not translated into an instrument for any
changes in policy, control of corruption, or improvements in service delivery.
    The research also showed that the experience of implementation of ATIA reflected
broader trends in the environment for accountability in the country. In the 2010 Transparency
International ranking,5 Uganda declined to a ranking of 127th, with a score of 2.5, down from
2.6 in 2008. Uganda was also ranked as having the highest implementation gap on laws in the
world—over 50 percent by the 2009 Global Integrity Report.6
    As the other country case studies in this series demonstrate, three major stakeholders
have an important bearing on RTI—whether or not laws get passed, implemented, or succeed
as instruments to heighten accountability: the political regime, bureaucrats, and civil society
groups. The dynamics between these groups is explanatory, to a large extent, of the experi-
ence with implementation of the laws. In Uganda, the relatively lower capacity and influence
of key institutions of accountability—in particular that of civil society groups—has been the
primary reason for the limited progress made on ATIA.

1.1. METHODOLOGY
The discussion is based on a detailed set of interviews, a review of key documents and policy
statements procured from various government departments, and secondary sources (such as
media and academic articles). The data on the passage of the legislation was secured from
stakeholders closely connected to the process. Data on implementation was garnered from
interviews conducted with the Directorate of Information and National guidance in the Office
of the Prime Minister (OPM), the main agency in charge of implementing the ATIA—from
documents made available as well as from interviews and visits to government agencies and
civil society groups.
     The case study also focuses on two departments—health and education. Looking at the
dynamics of information sharing and dissemination through this sectoral lens is important
because it is the sectors, ministries, agencies, and departments at various levels in each sec-
tor that are ultimately responsible for disseminating information and responding to requests.
Information dissemination is critical to both sectors, both as a means of improving the ability of
citizens to access their entitlements and to enable civil society groups to hold service providers
accountable. The vulnerability of these sectors to corruption—in procurement, in the construc-
tion and rehabilitation of health and school facilities, and in the distribution and use of drugs
and supplies—also makes transparency imperative (Hallak and Poisson 2007). It is important to
clarify that the information gained from the health and education department are not evidence
of implementation across all departments. In practice, the extent to which there is transparency
(the way in which ATI is operationalized) will have different dynamics depending on the sector.7


2. Passage of the Legislation
Uganda predates its African counterparts in the passage of ATI legislation by several years.
Civil society groups in several African countries have launched active movements for the adop-
tion of ATI laws in the last decade,8 and some countries are now putting such laws in place
after long and difficult processes.9 In Uganda, the support of the ruling National Resistance

      Movement (NRM) party for the law meant that it was passed relatively early and easily in 2005
      when only a handful of developing countries had such laws on the books.
           The legal foundation for the ATIA was provided by the 1995 Constitution that incorporated
      a guarantee on ATI to all citizens. This came directly from concerns about the human rights
      abuses of the preceding decades by the progressive Uganda Constitutional Commission led
      by Justice Benjamin Odoki. Article 41 of the 1995 Constitution reflects the commission’s belief
      in the importance of the fundamental freedom of expression and the right of every person to
      information, seeing them as core to the rule of law and democracy: “Every citizen has a right of
      access to information in the possession of the state or any other organ or agency of the state
      except where the release of the information is likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of
      the state or interfere with the right to privacy of any other person.” Article 41 (2) also requires
      the parliament to make laws regarding procedures for obtaining access to that information,
      including timelines and complaint mechanisms.
           These concerns and principles were also reflected in a series of governance reforms under-
      taken by the NRM regime, which came into power in 1986. Since the electoral victory in the
      2011 elections, the NRM party has been in power for well over two decades, but even so, the
      political environment in the country has improved in the direction of political pluralism, with
      multiparty elections, political parties, and oppositional media and civil society voices becom-
      ing increasingly vocal. Radio and print media have grown and are relatively vibrant and vocal.10
           The early years of the NRM movement—coming out of a debilitating two decades of
      human rights abuses, civil war, and crippling poverty—were charged with idealism, interna-
      tional support, and the visions of a new Uganda (Robinson, 2005, 2009). Progress on macro-
      economic reforms, poverty reduction, and political stability was accompanied by a series of
      governance reforms and progressive policies on open media through the 1990s. Governance
      reforms in this period ranged from civil service restructuring, the creation of a series of semi-
      autonomous public agencies, reforms in public expenditure management, decentralization,
      innovations in service delivery, and legal and institutional measures to combat corruption
      (Robinson 2005).
           In 2001, the NRM party won the single-party election with 69.33 percent of the vote.11 While
      the proposal for multiparty elections in 2001 was defeated by a referendum, a challenge to the
      NRM’s dominance of the political scene was already emerging. Various governance reforms
      were undertaken in the run up to the 2006 elections. At the international level, Uganda, signed
      and ratified several international and regional conventions on governance, including the
      United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Prevent-
      ing and Combating Corruption. Uganda also signed on to several international and regional
      treaties and declarations that advance the right to ATI, such as the International Covenant on
      Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, and the Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights.
           Domestically, a new Inspectorate of Government Act clarified and strengthened the pow-
      ers of the Inspector General of Government (IGG). In response to public and donor criticism of
      its poor record in prosecuting corruption cases and inefficiencies in its management structure,
      the IGG was restructured to strengthen its work and improve its effectiveness in discharg-
      ing its constitutionally mandated duties (Nkata 2010). Key pieces of legislation were passed
      to improve accountability and transparency: the Budget Act (2001), the Public Finance and
      Accountability Act (2003), the Leadership Code (2002), the Inspector General of Government
      Act (2002), and the Public Finance Act (2005). The 2005 Access to Information Act was part of

this complement of reforms. However, the ambivalence of the regime was evident from the
fact that a number of restrictive laws were also passed during this period, including the Anti
Terrorism Law (2002), the pretext for which being the wake of the terrorist attack in the United
States on September 11, 2001; the Uganda People’s Defense Forces Act (2002), and the Police
Act (2005).
     Between 2002 and 2005, a number of prominent civil society groups—Advocates Coali-
tion for Development (ACODE), Foundation for Human Rights Initiative (FHRI), and the Anti
Corruption Coalition of Uganda (ACCU)—were engaged in trying to promote ATI, actively
advocating for it as a tool for development and to fight corruption. In 2004, a group of civil
society organizations (CSOs) moved toward introducing a private members bill in Parliament
through a prominent Member of Parliament (MP), Abdu Kutuntu.12 However, the government
requested the withdrawal of that bill on the promise that it would introduce an ATI bill within a
few weeks. The subsequent bill was introduced by the then Minister of Information, debated
and passed by the Parliament, and assented to by the President in July 2005, coming into
effect on April 20, 2006.
     Interviewees attribute the passage of progressive laws, including ATIA, to the imperative
faced by the NRM to seem progressive and reformist in the wake of the 2006 elections, espe-
cially as perceptions about a decline in the political and governance environment increased
and pressures of aid agencies to open up the political space grew. A number of governance
assessments of the country, such as the 2005 Good Governance Assessment by USAID,
indicated that the government was limiting the space for political participation. The USAID
assessment (USAID 2005) pointed out, “The present analysis reaffirms that…although seri-
ous issues of inclusion, governance, and fragility persist and have the potential to fuel future
conflict, the predominant issues in Uganda relate to competition…Unless there are significant
positive developments during the lead-up to the 2006 elections, the analysis outlined in this
assessment suggests the desirability of a progressive disengagement from direct support to
central government institutions in the DG (democratic governance) sector…and an increased
emphasis on support to civil society, the media and the operation of political parties in
Parliament.”
     At the same time, access to international resources, such as the U.S. Millennium Challenge
Account, was premised on the idea of improving governance. The introduction of a constitu-
tional amendment to remove the presidential term limits may also have prompted the govern-
ment’s active promotion of the ATI bill, as a way to counter public perception that the changes
compromised government accountability; it may also have been a way to build public confi-
dence that the constitutional amendment would not undermine transparency.13



3. Legal Environment
Laws are useful because they set in place the rules of the game and can only be effective when
they are both comprehensiveness and clear. Although the Access to Information Act set in
place a legal foundation, both critical flaws in the design of the legislation and contradictions
with other elements of the broader regulatory environment for accountability created contra-
dictory incentives.
    Section 3 of the 2005 ATIA declares the purpose of the law as giving effect to Article 41
of the Constitution. The following analysis of the 2005 ATIA against global best practices
288                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      is largely based on an analysis of the ATIA undertaken by the U.K.-based global advocacy
      organization Article XIX.14 It also draws on the critiques of the law by civil society as well as
      interviews with civil society groups. The Article XIX analysis notes that, for the most part, the
      law was progressively drafted when assessed against good standards for right to access leg-
      islation. The Ugandan law follows many of the elements of global good practices for ATI laws,
      but with some significant exceptions. Although civil society groups saw the law as a progres-
      sive step, they identified a number of specific gaps, such as limitations in scope and the lack
      of an independent appeals mechanism. The strengths and weaknesses of key provisions are
      discussed below.15

      3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
      The law applies to all information and records of government ministries, departments, local
      governments, statutory corporations and bodies, commissions, and other agencies, but not to
      private bodies, corporate bodies, or civil society organizations, even when their activities affect
      the rights of citizens.16
           The law does not cover private companies even if they are publicly funded, as service
      delivery companies are in Uganda, such as electricity, water, and sanitation. As more and
      more public services are contracted out to private companies, this becomes a very important
      omission because companies using public funds are not held accountable to the public. An
      illustration of this omission is the case in Bushenyi district, in which a private company was
      awarded a contract to construct a stadium but did not deliver on the contract. Public demands
      for the accountability of the funds, and attempts to obtain the contract certificates and bills
      of quantity—were not successful, and CSO groups were not able to use the ATIA to request
      this information. Many private companies use public funds to carry out works but they do not
      have to disclose any information because the confidentiality clauses protect their contracts.17
      This argument has been raised more visibly and emphatically in the refusal by government and
      private companies to share and make public details of production sharing agreements (PSAs)
      on oil in Uganda. However, the members of the 9th Parliament are making a bid to compel the
      Ministry of Energy to produce these agreements to Parliament for discussion and debate. In an
      unprecedented bipartisan move, a section of MPs in the 9th Parliament are in the process of
      seeking signatures from one third of all MPs for a recall of Parliament during recess to discuss
      PSAs between the government and private oil companies, including Heritage and Tullow Oil.
      This follows the widely held view by the public that Uganda has an empty deal and stands
      to lose from existing PSAs based on the example of the ongoing arbitration case in London
      between the Government of Uganda and Tullow Oil with regard to taxation of oil proceedings
      in the form of s capital gains tax equivalent of US$404 million.18

      3.2. SCOPE OF EXCEPTIONS
      The ATIA has a fairly narrowly drafted system of exceptions, including a developed set of
      exceptions to exceptions (Mendel 2008). The exceptions are largely in line with standard
      freedom-of-information legislation; the law also provides for circumstances under which
      mandatory disclosure is exempted.19 Exceptions to disclosure include several categories of
      information, including minutes of cabinet and cabinet committee meetings, records of court
      proceedings before the conclusion of a case, proprietary information relating to privacy,
      commercial information of third parties, protection of safety of persons and property and
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                               289




other areas, and information whose disclosure could endanger the life or physical property
of a person.20
    Civil society asserts that the exemption for cabinet records, which are accessible only after
a minimum of seven years, is a key weakness of the law because policymaking in Uganda is
mainly conducted at the cabinet, ministerial, and sectoral levels.21 Civil society groups also
emphasize the importance of having clear guidelines, making the scope of exemptions as
specific as possible and subject to the strict tests of public interest and harm.22 Exemptions for
national security are standard provisions of most RTI laws, but the definition of what constitutes
national security and the protection of privacy can be a vast grey area that is subject to abuse
by those meant to provide information. The definition of national security has been increasing
around the world, expanding to cover environmental and economic issues. The fact that the
Ugandan ATIA does not limit the scope of the definition of national security to a traditional
understanding creates a risk for the abuse of the provision to limit information access.23

3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
Calland and Neuman point out that much emphasis must be given to the procedures for legal
challenge (especially when and if the exemptions are used to shield information). Issues such
as mandatory publication of certain information, time limits for completion of information
requests, administrative duty to assist the requester, costs for requests and copying, sanctions
for failure to comply, reporting requirements, and appeals procedures must receive much
greater attention. These practicalities will ultimately determine the value and usability of the
law for ordinary citizens (Neuman and Calland 2007).
     The ATIA has well-established procedures for requesting and accessing information. The
chief executive officers of departments are designated information officers. The ATIA provides
for notice and timelines within which information should be processed and responses made
(within 21 days) as well as fee schedules. But concerns have been raised about the lengthy
timelines, the often complex and protracted procedures to access information, and the poten-
tial high costs.24 Advocates have called for a reduction in the timeline from 21 to 15 days for
standard information, fewer days when information is required by journalists to meet dead-
lines,25 and a 48-hour turnaround when information concerns the life and liberty of persons as
provided under Article 23(4) of the Constitution (FHRI and UPPA 2004).
     An analysis of the recently published ATIA regulations26 further highlights other procedural
challenges, including the multiplicity of forms (up to 15 different types) that must be used to
access information and the requirement to provide a name and physical address, eliminating
the option of submitting an anonymous request.27 Failure to use the right form does not auto-
matically preclude access to information,28 but sifting through the various forms and identifying
the right one to use for the particular type of information being sought likely adds another
step in the process of accessing information, especially given the limited access to the Internet
and difficulty obtaining government-printed forms.29

3.4. IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS
One of the most significant stumbling blocks to the success of the ATIA was the absence of
implementing regulations. Section 47 of ATIA provides for detailed rules and procedures for
implementation to be laid out. Such implementation regulations are particularly important
290                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      in the Ugandan context to operationalize several elements of the law and to provide offi-
      cials with the guidance needed to implement the law and provide the formal rules for
      due procedure.
           Initially, there were several delays in the regulations being issued by the Minister of Infor-
      mation and National Guidance, according to section 47 of the Act. Subsequently, regulations
      were sent to the Parliamentary Council in 2008, signed by the Minister of Information and
      National Guidance, under the Office of the Prime Minister, and presented to the cabinet in
      February 2009. They were intended to be printed in the official gazette within 60 days and to
      become operational no later than July 2009.30 However, the draft regulations were not released
      by the cabinet for a couple of years.31 There was no official explanation of why the regulations
      were not released earlier, but according to civil society groups, it was a result of deliberate
      stalling by the government. The regulations were finally passed in April 2011, gazetted in May,
      and published and publicly released in July 2011.32
           The absence of regulations was not a formal barrier to requests for information; citizens
      could still request information citing the law, despite their absence. However, government offi-
      cials point out that for public officials and civil servants, the absence of the regulations, com-
      bined with the Secrecy Law still being in force, created a lack of clarity about their obligations,
      the procedures, and the functioning of the law. On the other hand, the absence of regulations
      could also be used as an excuse not to implement the law in practice, but rather to continue
      to exercise a large degree of discretion over decision making and the release of information.
      Now that the regulations have been published in the official gazette, they are accessible to the
      public, removing any ambiguity about their content and scope.
           The regulations have generally been welcomed by stakeholders and the public and should
      finally pave the way to wide scale implementation of the ATIA. However, some concerns33 have
      been raised regarding their effectiveness in enhancing ATI, given the potentially high cost,
      procedural complexities (including multiplicity of forms and processes), and lack of guidance
      for implementing agencies, largely leaving the individual information officers with the discre-
      tion to interpret the various provisions. A number of areas identified for further explanation in
      the ATIA are not expounded on in the ATI regulations, which do not give sufficient guidance
      to public officials and could cause ambiguity in the implementation of the ATIA. For instance,
      ATIA Section 47(1)(e) provides for the development of “uniform criteria” for information
      officers to apply when deciding what records to make available; these have not been devel-
      oped. The regulations provide for a cost per request, currently set at Shs. 20,000 per request
      to cover the actual cost of retrieval and reproduction. While this fee can be waived in specific
      instances,34 it is prohibitively high. There is also the high potential for multiple charges because
      the fees are assessed on a per request basis.


      3.5. BROADER LEGAL ENVIRONMENT
      A major challenge to the ATIA remains the archaic and inconsistent laws that are still on
      the statute books. Unlike global best practices regarding access to information, the Ugandan
      law does not provide for it to supersede the Official Secrets Act of 1964. The Official Secrets
      Act entrenches a culture of secrecy in all matters of public administration, with broadly framed
      provisions that obstruct the free flow of information from official sources. It is also clogged
      with severe criminal sanctions for infringement of any of the provisions. In sum, this law is
      disguised as a law to enhance and protect state security, but really serves to limit access
      to information.
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                291




     Under the Oaths Act Cap 19, every civil servant, on assumption of office, must take an oath
of secrecy against disclosing information received in the discharge of official duties. The Fourth
Schedule of the 1995 Constitution also requires such an oath. Article 9(1) of the Public Service
Act (1969)35 and Article 22 (12) of the Education Service Act (2002), criminalize the disclosure
of information by public servants (Uganda, 2002a). Even though the ATIA was passed, the
existence of these laws on the statute books make it difficult for an information officer who has
taken an oath of secrecy to disclose information to the public.36 However, it can also be argued
that the biggest impediment is not the in the existence of the laws on the statute books but in
the attitudes of the public officials set on secrecy who have yet to acclimatize to the new law
that requires openness and the sharing of information.
     A key attribute of the ATIA is its protection against legal, administrative, or employment-
related sanctions for persons releasing information about wrongdoing, including corruption,
dishonesty, and maladministration regarding a public body. The Whistleblowers Protection Act
was adopted in 2010, and regulations for its implementation are currently being developed by
the Directorate of Ethics and Integrity.
     The overall regulatory environment for civil society also prevents it from playing a signifi-
cant or influential role or serving an effective channel of accountability. The relatively weakened
position of CSOs is reflected in a regulatory environment that governs their functioning. NGOs
operate under the strict legal scrutiny of the NGO Act 2006 and subsequent 2007 regulations.
All NGOs in Uganda must be approved and registered by a government-appointed board
composed mostly of government officials, including security officials, before they are allowed
to operate. The board has used its powers to delay and deny the legal registration of some
NGOs that it deems too controversial.37 The government has deregistered NGOs whose
operations it considered excessively political, such as the Uganda Human Rights Education
and Document Center (UHEDOC); it significantly delayed registration for the National Orga-
nization for Civic Education and Election Monitoring (NOCEM) and the National NGO Forum
(NNF). Freedom of assembly has also been restricted; meetings of more than seven people
require permission from the Resident District Commissioner.38
     Similar restrictions characterize the functioning of the media. Media professionals inter-
viewed pointed to censorship measures and limitations of press freedom undertaken by the
government in the recent years. They pointed out that, even as the political system seems to
be becoming more pluralistic, especially with the multiparty elections in 2006, this has caused
the regime to put more limitations on the media. Several laws and regulations curtailing press
freedom and imposing punitive economic measures (increasing taxes on news print) have
been adopted.39 Since 1986, at least 40 journalists have been charged with a variety of criminal
offences and taken to court; several other court cases are pending. Journalists even claim that
private newspapers fear losing much-needed revenue from government advertisements and
will engage in self-censorship rather than displease high officials, often giving in to political
pressure not to publish information, or to fears of nonrenewal of licenses, closures, or sanc-
tions. All these measures contradict the spirit and letter of the ATIA.



4. Promotion, Capacity, Oversight
Implementation of ATI laws is a challenge in many countries. In the context of implemen-
tation in other countries, “Experience has proven that passing the law is the easier task.
Successful implementation of an open information regime is often the most challenging
292                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      and energy-consuming part for government” (Neuman and Calland 2007). In Uganda, this
      challenge has been particularly pronounced. Unlike in countries such as India and Mexico,
      where similar ATI laws became an instrument for civil society demanding transparency and
      accountability from public officials, in Uganda, the promise of the legal instrument remains
      largely unfulfilled.
          The 2009 Global Integrity report says that, of all the countries covered in the report,
      Uganda, along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, has the biggest “implementation gap, ”that is,
      the gap between anticorruption laws “on the books” and the actual enforcement of those
      same laws. The report points out that in Uganda, auditing and monitoring of the declared
      assets of elected officials has proven itself to be ineffective despite a strong asset disclosure
      legal regime.40
          The implementation gaps have also been highlighted in the recently launched IG Report
      on Corruption in Uganda (October 2010), an outcome of the Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM)
      that seeks to track trends and the response to corruption based on national sources, including
      surveys and audit reports. The implementation gap goes beyond the laws and policies to the
      enforcement of decisions and implementation of recommendations. An example is the follow
      up on recommendations in audit reports on the recovery of funds or the sanctioning of impli-
      cated officials at the national and subnational levels, such as chief administration officers, head
      teachers, and medical officers.

      4.1. LEAD AGENCY
      A specialized ATI implementation oversight and coordination unit is useful in providing clar-
      ity of responsibilities, sustained attention to the issue, and enhancing the ability to conduct
      long-term planning, enabling users to interface more easily with the government and prevent-
      ing officials with less training and resources from being excessively burdened. Such units are
      typically responsible for assisting and monitoring implementation, raising awareness about the
      new right to information, and providing a clear focal point for all efforts.
           In Uganda, the Directorate of Information and National Guidance, directly reporting to the
      Office of the Prime Minister, was placed in charge of ATIA implementation. There are differ-
      ing views about the value of placing an accountability reform such as this within the purview
      of the top executive. In general, championship by a prominent official with sufficient seniority,
      respect, and power can be an important impetus for implementation and a signal to other
      parts of the administration that there is political will behind the law (Neuman and Calland
      2007). Direct oversight from the top of the executive can also be positive, signaling champion-
      ship and support for the program from the top of the administration (as in Jamaica and Nicara-
      gua); this increases the likelihood of political support and acquiescence by the other ministries.
      On the other hand, when implementation is spread across line function ministries, as is the
      case in South Africa,41 there is a possibility that peer ministries will ignore directives and that
      implementation efforts will wane (Neuman and Calland 2007).
           In other countries, however, keeping the responsibilities for implementing the law within a
      technical ministry or independent agency has actually provided more autonomy. In India, for
      instance, the responsibility for implementation is vested in the Department of Personnel and
      Training (DoPT) because it is the agency in charge of human resources with overall responsibil-
      ity for the civil service. While DoPT’s engagement with the RTI law has been mixed (and it has
      resisted reforms to strengthen the transparency regime), 42 DoPT has also taken several imple-
      mentation measures. In Mexico, the model has been to keep implementation responsibilities
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                   293




in the autonomous Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI). When staffed with pro-
gressive commissioners, such a model can be the most effective in accelerating implementa-
tion, as evidenced by the number and speed of progressive initiatives implemented by IFAI.43
     The positioning of an organization charged with a mandate to improve accountability
throughout the government within the Office of the Prime Minister was an opportunity to
mainstream ATIA. But in practice, it seems to have hampered the independence of the direc-
torate to push through the reform process, especially because the political leadership has not
been focused on promoting the law.
     The staff of the directorate seemed very supportive of the implementation of ATIA; they
believe it to be an important element in the attempt to create more transparency in the
regime. Interviews with members of the directorate revealed fairly progressive views in sup-
port of the ATIA. The directorate spearheaded the drafting of the regulations, developed a
National Access to Information Program (ATIP) and issued a memo for the appointment of
information officers within public bodies. An implementation plan was developed in 2008 to
promote awareness of ATIA, to put in place procedures for accessing information, to cultivate
a culture of openness, to build the capacity of the public bodies for effective management, to
coordinate and disseminate information, and to monitor and coordinate implementation.
     This strategy has not been implemented because of a lack of funding. The directorate
is severely under-resourced and has relied heavily on civil society and donor interventions
to undertake activities in the past. Workshops, trainings, study tours, and publications have
largely been facilitated by civil society in collaboration with the directorate. The OPM44 indi-
cates that plans are underway to engage ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) as well
as local governments, using existing resources within the budget and existing platforms while
seeking external funding from donors. However, a more consistent approach and funding is
required if the unit is to reach out and sufficiently engage stakeholders in promoting the right
to ATI.
     Civil society groups have also engaged in several promotional initiatives. For instance,
the Coalition on Freedom of information (COFI) works with state agencies to promote ATIA
through workshops, publications and study tours. Its members—FHRI and Human Rights Net-
work (HURINET)—are represented on the National Committee on the Implementation of the
ATIA, coordinated by the Directorate of Information and National Guidance, and run programs
of research and advocacy for the promotion of ATI. ACODE has partnered with Green Watch
on Training for Judicial Officers in environmental law. The Uganda Debt Network is piloting a
project in 11 districts to enhance ATI on budgets, resources, and expenditure at the local level.

4.2. BUDGET
When the ATIA was enacted, no significant resources were allocated for its implementation. The
Directorate of Information, working with other stakeholders, including civil society, has designed
a program of approximately 4.5 billion shillings45 aimed at implementing the ATIA over a five-year
period through simplification, translation, dissemination of the ATIA, awareness-raising for the
public, and training of public officials, in addition to other activities. But separate resources have
not been allocated for this, neither to the directorate nor to individual ministries.
    Given the current state of information management in the ministries of education and
health, when ATIA becomes operational, enabling responsiveness will require significant
funding to streamline information services, overhaul archaic information management sys-
tems, restock resource centers, and fund the publication and dissemination of information.
294                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      4.3. STAFFING, TRAINING
      Section 7 of the ATIA requires every public body to appoint information officers within six
      months of the law coming into effect. Six months after the ATI law was passed, all public
      agencies were directed to appoint information officers using the formal rules and procedures
      for appointment and management of civil service personnel and the institutional structure of
      public agencies.
           In 2009, four years after the implementation of ATIA, fewer than 20 public bodies had
      appointed information officers or public relations officers (PROs). In most cases, staff members
      are assigned the role of IO or PRO in addition to their other responsibilities and oftentimes
      they are not sufficiently empowered within the organization to access and disseminate infor-
      mation.46 Currently, the volume and demand for information is low so IOs and PROs are able to
      juggle their existing work with process requests for information. However, it is likely that with
      increased advocacy and awareness, the demands will rise sharply.
           Clear guidelines on the role and profile of IOs and PROs have not been published. Training
      in information management and public relations work is also very limited. There is a general lack
      of capacity among information officers. The capacity constraints at the district level include inad-
      equate or nonexistent human resources, infrastructure, equipment, and logistics; this hampers
      the flow of information and accessibility to relevant policies and documents. In most public agen-
      cies, the lack of capacity also relates to the ability to handle document requests.
           The Ministry of Education and Sports has recruited several officers for collection, publica-
      tion and dissemination of information, but CSOs claim that this has not made any difference
      to improving access. Furthermore, there was a perception among the officials in the Ministries
      of Health and Education, who were interviewed that using the law would create more work for
      staff that was already over stretched.
           Local government districts have also appointed information officers. The law says they should
      be designated as district information officers (DIOs) for ATIA but it is unclear if any of these
      have been formally designated to handle ATIA.47 Capacity building at the district level has also
      largely been left to the CSOs with little help from the Directorate of Information. More than 70
      DIOs have been trained countrywide,48 but their orientation is more toward public relations; they
      need to be oriented toward an ATI regime. While about 20 percent of departments have training
      manuals, most staff members do not use them or are not aware of their existence.
           While senior officials and the people in charge of the resource center emphasized the
      importance of information and outlined the various measures that had been adopted to
      facilitate the collection and dissemination of it, they contended that some information should
      be kept secret from the public. Civil society groups point out that it is the information that is
      not in disclosed documents that is significant. “Sensitive” information, particularly the kind
      that would enable the exercise of oversight and accountability is not available.49 Civil society
      groups also point out that at the district level, education officers do not share information with
      interested parties.50

      4.4. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
      The Department of Records Information Management in the Ministry of Public Service is
      mandated with overseeing records management countrywide, providing support and advisory
      services to registries in MDAs and to local governments, developing regulations and proce-
      dures for records management, and training the staff of registries in record management.
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                 295




    Interviews with the officials of these various ministries revealed a lack of clarity with regard
to the responsibilities of the different institutions and the perception of fragmentation of
institutional responsibilities for the management, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of infor-
mation. The Ministry of Public Service is considered to be in charge of records management
and storage, while the Ministry of Information and National Guidance is in charge of retrieval
and dissemination.
    The state of records management is very weak in the central government ministries and
agencies and probably worse at the local governmental level. The capacity of records staff
within MDAs and at the local government level is weak. Documents that have historical impor-
tance have almost been destroyed because of poor storage. There is no defined strategy for
archiving and disseminating information at the local government level. The country’s telecoms
sector policy review (UCC 2008), sanctioned by the government, concluded, “almost all minis-
tries, departments and local governments lack the infrastructure required to deliver anything
apart from rudimentary e-Government services.”51
    In individual departments, the capacity to manage and maintain records varies. The Minis-
try of Health (MoH) is attempting to put a large number of its resources online, but the Ministry
of Education’s resource center, which houses much of the ministry’s information, is poorly
resourced and lacks adequate space and efficient management. Fragmentation of informa-
tion across departments also makes retrieval difficult. Information on funding is in the finance
department; statistics on teachers, schools, facilities, and students are in the Department of
Education Planning. While these departments are supposed to provide copies to the resource
centers for easy access, information is still kept on office shelves, not at resource centers.
According to education and health CSOs interviewed, the resource centers contain obsolete
information. For example, an information request by the Africa Freedom of Information Center
(AFIC) to the Ministry of Education with respect to the teacher transfer policy, student admis-
sions, and enrollment was had not yet been responded to eight months after the information
request was made.52 Capacity constraints on records management are magnified at the district
level, where most of the information on community development is kept.
    The World Bank is supporting the construction of a national archive in Kampala with a
records storage facility worth approximately US$10 million.53 In addition to constructing the
center, the World Bank will provide institutional support, including developing a records
policy, strengthening capacity of staff to manage the archives and operationalizing the
archives through the provision of equipment, such as scanners, and furniture. The World
Bank is currently providing ongoing support to archive existing documents prior to the
center’s construction.


4.5. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The deployment of information technology for information management and sharing is rela-
tively limited, although promising applications are emerging for the electronification of infor-
mation and for information sharing between different departments. The Ministry of Health has
introduced a number of initiatives to introduce information technology in the management of
information and makes available a large set of data—both through publications and electroni-
cally, including information on budget flows and expenditures at the local level. The establish-
ment of the Health Management Information System has increased the level of information
sharing among different institutions and organs in the sector.54 The education sector has also
296                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      undertaken reforms to harmonize information sharing between the Ministry of Education
      and the districts that, under decentralization, are now key players in the provision of educa-
      tion in Uganda (Ablo and Reinikka 1998; Hubbard 2007). The introduction of the Education
      Management Information System has been instrumental in harmonizing the available infor-
      mation at the central government, district, and school levels about staff, student enrollment,
      and facilities.
          But several challenges remain, including the need to provide regularly updated informa-
      tion to enhance the utility of generated data, to overcome weaknesses in reporting and acting
      on information generated, and to enhance credibility and timeliness of data and informa-
      tion generated. For example, in 2010, a senior official in the MoH was arrested and charged
      with drawing money to prepare progress reports and then providing information drawn from
      previous reports. A final challenge is the high cost of implementing management information
      systems based on cost of equipment (software and hardware) and extending them to the local
      level. As information systems are further developed, a key challenge that will likely emerge is
      to make this information user-friendly and accessible to citizens.

      4.6. MONITORING
      Under Section 43 of the ATIA, ministers are required to submit an annual report to Parliament
      on requests for access to records or information and responsiveness. No public body has come
      up with a manual or presented an annual report to Parliament in fulfillment of the requirements
      of the ATIA, and Parliament has not asked for either these documents or information. Most
      ministries do not keep records of the types of information requests received or their responses
      to them. No MDA has prepared a report on implementation of the ATIA as required under law.
      Hence, no submissions have been made to Parliament by the ministry as the responsible entity.
      In the interview with the director of National Guidance and Information, she indicated that it
      was not possible for MDAs to present reports because there were no regulations and hence
      there was no official tracking of information provided to the public. She also noted that while
      officials did indeed provide information, it has not been possible to track and collate data to
      provide a report to Parliament because this information was often provided informally. There
      are some emerging civil society initiatives in this area. For example, HURINET has established
      an ATI monitoring tool that is a self-generated system with slots showing those allowed or
      denied ATI.



      5. Enforcement and Sanctions
      An independent appeals and enforcement mechanism is considered critical for the effective
      implementation of ATI laws, legal provisions that guarantee “a right to appeal any decision,
      any failure to provide information, or any other infringement of the right of ATI to an inde-
      pendent authority with the power to make binding and enforceable decisions, preferably an
      intermediary body such as an Information Commission(er) or specialist Ombudsman in the first
      instance with a further right of appeal to a court of law”(Carter Center 2000). Although coun-
      tries vary in the design of their enforcement mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that
      the optimal system should be independent from political influence, accessible to requesters
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                               297




without the need for legal representation, affordable, timely, and staffed with specialist com-
missioners because ATI laws are complex, requiring delicate public interest balancing tests.55
There are different models for enforcement in different countries.56
     Under the model of direct judicial review, which, in addition to Uganda, is used in countries
such as South Africa, Bulgaria, and at the federal level of the United States, when a request
for information is denied, the requester must appeal directly to the judiciary.57 Courts have
the power to order the release of information if it has been inappropriately denied, possess
wide-ranging powers of investigation, and have clearly established mechanisms for punishing
agency noncompliance. But high legal costs, case backlogs, and a lack of specialist knowledge
make a direct appeal to courts on administrative matters a difficult proposition, especially in
countries where the judiciary has capacity constraints and courts are inaccessible to most citi-
zens. In such instances, the deterrent effect that courts often play is minimized and may actu-
ally encourage a perverse incentive among some civil servants to ignore the law or arbitrarily
deny requests. There might also be a lack of trust in a judiciary that may not yet have matured
into a strong, independent branch of the state.
     Independent commissions or appeals tribunals (such as in India and Mexico) usually have
the power to issue rulings and binding orders. Appeals to such bodies are more accessible
and affordable because there is no need for legal representation and no court costs or other
fees, and in the best cases, it is highly independent. This system can allow decision makers to
become ATI specialists. With the power to order agencies to act or apply sanctions, this model
serves as a deterrent to the government and can alleviate the need for further court appeals.
Binding decisions are issued through a written ruling, which in mature jurisdictions creates
a body of precedent that can guide future internal agency and commissioner decisions and
facilitate settlements. In some instances, information commissions or ombudsmen have more
limited faculties for enforcement (such as at the federal level in Canada, Hungary, Sweden, and
New Zealand) and can only issue recommendations to the relevant administrative agency or
public functionary.

5.1. APPEALS
The Ugandan ATIA provides for appeals against the denial of information—not to an indepen-
dent appeals tribunal, but to the courts. ATIA provides for aggrieved persons who have been
denied information the option of appeal to the Chief Magistrate and subsequently to the High
Court. The law also provides courts with the right to inspect public documents and take reme-
dial action. The rules committee of the judiciary is required to make rules of procedure for the
court within six months of the commencement of the ATIA. To date, these rules have not been
made, because of which the assumption is that the normal court procedures apply.
    Civil society groups pointed out that the Ugandan judiciary has several weaknesses. The
lengthy judicial process discourages citizens from using the courts as a means of redress.
Several critiques and reports have been issued and many see the judiciary as not being inde-
pendent of political influence.58 The funding allocated to the judiciary has been steadily scaled
down since 2003, which has forced the courts to scale down their operations up to 60 percent
in some respects (IBA 2007). Challenges to governance in the judicial system, lengthy trial
processes, poor staff capacity, financial constraints, and current case backlog levels within the
courts are all deterrents to the effective enforcement of ATIA.59
298                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         BOX 1. THE TULLOW OIL CASE
        In 2009, senior reporter Angelo Izama and Charles Mwanguhya Mpagi of Uganda’s leading
        independent newspaper, Monitor, filed a case to appeal the refusal of Uganda’s attorney
        general to provide them with certified copies of oil exploitation agreements because of
        alleged confidentiality clauses in the documents, according to news reports.60 The journal-
        ists argued that the information was of public interest: Ugandans must be able to hold the
        government and its partners accountable for the exploitation of the oil.
             However, Chief Magistrate Deo Ssejjemba said in his ruling that the petitioners had
        not proved either the benefit of disclosing the information to the public, according to
        news reports. The journalists, along with their partners the Open Society Institute’s East
        Africa Initiative and HURINET, intend to appeal the ruling.




           The implications of this are yet to be tested because the record on requests for informa-
      tion is very limited. The record of judicial appeals on one high profile case—that of Tullow Oil
      and more broadly on accountability issues—shows that the appeals process to the judiciary is
      problematic and that the judiciary does not have the specialist technical capacity to address
      ATIA issues.
           According to civil society members, this case demonstrates that the judiciary, especially
      at the lower level, does not have specialized capacity to interpret the ATIA. When the rul-
      ing is appealed in the High Court, it may have a different result because it tends to be more
      independent and have better technical capacity, but such appeals are unlikely for regular
      ATIA requests.61
           Views have been divided in Uganda about the feasibility and desirability of an indepen-
      dent agency. The experience of some of the other nonexecutive institutions like the Uganda
      Electoral Commission, the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC), the Inspectorate of
      Government UHRC, and the Auditor General, the fairly advanced level of technical exper-
      tise, and the independence displayed by these organizations suggests that an independent
      agency could be a good solution. But some interviewees suggested that a proliferation of
      independent agencies is not an ideal solution for a capacity-constrained state.62 There is a
      partial ban on establishing new public or oversight bodies due to resource constraints; the
      other investigative and oversight bodies are also underfunded, lack capacity, and are not
      fully independent, as demonstrated by several instances of interference of their operations
      by the executive. Most agencies also lack the power to prosecute; that function rests with the
      Directorate of Public Prosecutions. But the low rate of prosecutions and the failure to check
      large-scale corruption by senior political figures has eroded the legitimacy of these institu-
      tions (HURIPEC 2011).
           One suggestion advanced was that existing institutions such as the Uganda Human Rights
      Commission or the IGG could integrate this role within their functions. The Inspectorate of
      Government Act (2002, Act 5) provides the Inspectorate with powers to enforce the Leadership
      Code of Conduct and “summon any person, who in the opinion of the Inspectorate is able to
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                  299




give information…and to furnish and produce any documents, papers or things that may be in
possession or under the control of that person.63
    The law also provides for both sanctions and penalties—both financial and imprisonment
for denying access, destroying, altering, concealing, or falsifying information.

5.2. SANCTIONS
The ATIA64 provides for sanctions for officials who intentionally denies a citizen with the right
of access under the law by destroying, damaging, altering, concealing, or falsifying a record;
committing such an offense makes the official liable to a fine not to exceed 240 currency points
imprisonment not exceed three years, or both. But to date, no public official has been charged
in a court of law for denial of the right to access information.
    An interesting twist to this however, could be evidenced with the unfolding events in the
9th Parliament. An unprecedented move has been made by MPs led by the chairperson of
the Parliamentary Forum for Oil and Gas65 and the Shadow Attorney General66 to compel the
Attorney General of Government to bring oil PSAs that the government signed with explora-
tion companies to Parliament for scrutiny. At least 163 signatures have been collected from
MPs to call for a special session of Parliament, which is currently on recess (under Article 95 (5))
to discuss these agreements. After a protracted and heated debate, the Speaker finally bowed
to pressure and has recalled Parliament to discuss the issues raised in the petition on October
10, 2011. Copies of the PSAs have also been provided to the members of the Parliamentary
Legal Committee for scrutiny.67 While this is not a sanction as envisaged under the ATIA, e the
scenario is still unfolding, and it is unclear what direction it will take, this action by Parliament
could provide another avenue for compelling public officials to provide ATI, especially in sensi-
tive matters like the oil agreements.



6. Compliance
6.1. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
The law contains only a limited regime for proactive or routine publication of information. It
provides for mandatory publication of some information, including a manual of functions and
an index of records of the public body within six months of the coming into force of the ATIA,
automatic availability of certain records every two years, and publication of general information
about the organization in existing directories. District officers have an obligation to accurately,
regularly, and consistently document and make available information on planning, budgets,
and expenditures.
    Civil society interviewees felt that two years for publication of several records is excessively
long, and ongoing disclosures and shorter interval periods for mandatory proactive disclosures
are needed. However, even the limited provisions of the ATIA on proactive disclosure have not
been implemented in practice. Although government departments are making advances in the
management and dissemination of information, as evidenced by the experience of the health
and education ministries,68 systematic disclosure of the documents mandated by ATIA has
not happened. The ministries have not set in place systems or mechanisms to be responsive
300                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      to the 2005 ATIA per se. In fact, awareness of the ATIA and any measures toward systemati-
      cally implementing it have been so poor that the information management and dissemination
      activities within individual departments and ministries have largely been developed quite
      separately from the ATIA.

      6.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
      It is useful to distinguish between two kinds of information. The first is personal, routine
      information that people demand on a day-to-day basis. Much of this information is routine,
      nonsensitive, and does not require a legal instrument such as ATIA to make it available. In fact,
      this kind of information might be more dependent on the capacity of agencies—in terms of
      information technology, skills, quality of personnel, and an overall culture of serving citizens
      and being responsive. In such cases, the formal legal instrument could, in theory, provide a
      tool for civil society groups to hold officials responsible for performance and responsiveness.
      The second kind of information is more sensitive information—information that could poten-
      tially reveal instances of corruption or other forms of the exercise of discretionary authority not
      in the public interest.
            The institutionalization of RTI laws does provide access to the type of information that
      might otherwise be out of the public sphere. The critical question to ask is not simply if more
      or less information is available in the public space, but if the information necessary for civil
      society groups to effectively monitor and oversee public officials is easily available and if the
      absence of access to this information is proving to be a critical, binding constraint to the
      accomplishment of development objectives, such as, for example, the transparent and efficient
      awarding of contracts in the road sector or information about entitlements to services.
            The evidence from Uganda shows that the passage of ATIA itself has not stimulated more
      requests for information. Both in-depth interviews conducted during the research as well as
      other studies demonstrate that responsiveness to information requests continues to be a
      challenge. Although it used a very small sample size, a study conducted by HURINET in 2010
      showed that of the survey participants who had requested information from a public institu-
      tion, such as from the police, the local government, or the Ministry of Education,69 as many as
      70 percent had not received a response.
            Some CSO interviewees contended that more than 50 percent of Ugandans requesting
      information about resource allocations, local government affairs, or cases with security agen-
      cies get turned down.70 The HURINET study suggests that a majority of the respondents—
      71.2 percent—got their information within 21 days, which the law requires, but CSOs point
      out that this is atypical; citizens usually have to face lengthy delays in getting access to
      information.
            With support from the Open Budget Initiative, the Uganda Debt Network (UDN) also
      carried out a study floating requests. It filed five requests to different ministries: Finance, for
      aid from different donors and when these were approved—Global Fund and USAID; Health,
      for information on expenditures on drugs, that is, how much was budgeted for drugs, what
      percentage of the drugs were imported and when, and whether or not the correct drugs were
      being received; Water, Environment, and Energy for information on oil subsidies given to pri-
      vate investors; and Mineral Development and Education. The overall conclusions of the study
      were as follows.
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                301




• Control over information has payoffs associated with it. Both interviews and the
  HURINET study suggested that often information officers stalled when releasing informa-
  tion, claiming the need to get “authorization” from a superior—really a ploy for bribes,
  the paying of which would get the information released. Officials used many ways to delay
  information requests, refusing information based on procedural reasons, including formal
  request letters and identification cards; administrative reasons, including Information not
  in work plan of the government; information still in raw form; restrictions, like confidential
  or classified information with security implications; and claims that the same informa-
  tion is available in the newspapers so there was no need “to burden us with something
  already known.”
• There is a range of information that is considered “sensitive” and not easily disclosed.
  Interviewees—both government officials and CSOs—agreed that “sensitive” information
  is usually not disclosed or its release is delayed pending approval from higher authori-
  ties. Interviewees highlighted different kinds of information that usually comes into this
  category: expenditures; information on the establishment or presidency, the state house,
  the army or security organizations; recruitment procedures and criteria for appointment
  to key positions;71 reports of commissions of inquiry; road contracts; oil contracts, such as
  Tullow Oil; public accounts committee reports; minutes of the Presidential Appointments
  Committee, Parliamentary Commission, or the committees of Parliament where pro-
  ceedings are closed or held in camera as provided for under the Parliamentary Rules of
  Procedure.72 Some expenditures, such as by MPs for the Constituency Development Fund,
  are not openly published but are available on request.73 On the other hand, many catego-
  ries of information are easier to access, such as the national strategic plans for HIV action
  and national health policy information.
• There is divergence in the ministries in terms of responsiveness and willingness to
  share information. Interviewees suggested that the Ministry of Defense and the State
  House are completely closed off from the public. In the UDN study, requests were sent
  to different levels of the finance ministry over a five-month period with no response. The
  Ministry of Energy was the only one that acknowledged receipt of the request. The Ministry
  of Health was the worst in responding and in the end, access to the requested information
  was denied. The Ministry of Education provided the information requested; it is seen as
  having more of an open door policy. Most of the information is available on the websites,
  except information on contracts.74 It is also easier to get national level information than it is
  to get district- or local-level information.
• Capacity and awareness constraints can lead to the withholding of information. Some
  CSOs pointed out that the withholding of information is not always deliberate, but is
  instead due to a lack of capacity, efficiency issues, and resource constraints.75 Public offi-
  cials are often unaware of the law, and because they do not understand it and its relation-
  ship to their work, they have reservations when it comes to giving out information, with the
  standard question of what the status of the requester is in demanding this information.76
  Delays in other governance processes can also be a constraint. Audits are two years behind
  schedule and they cannot be used because they have not been passed by the cabinet
  yet. The Auditor General’s Office is understaffed and overworked, and PAC has to discuss
  audits before it can release the information to the public.77
302                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




       • Accessibility depends on personal networks. In the course of the research for this paper,
         several NGOs were interviewed, most located in Kampala, including several service-
         delivery NGOs working closely with the government, and fulfilling particular functions of
         delivering services. Service-delivery NGOs encompass a wide range of areas, including
         education, health, poverty reduction, and gender equity. NGOs mainly exist as service
         providers and, to a large extent, are either the government’s partner in implementing its
         programs or fill gaps in service delivery. The nodal coalition of health NGOs—UNHCO—
         sits on the Health Advisory Committee and has access to policy making. For other smaller
         NGOs, there are limitations to their ability to access information.
              Other NGOs pointed out that information is not easily accessible in the absence
         of strong personal networks with public officials. Organizations such as the ACCU have
         floated numerous requests using the ATIA, writing to the Ministry of Education, Energy,
         and Health using RTI request forms. ACCU contends that the ministries have stonewalled
         with a lot of back and forth communication but no information. Health Rights Action Group
         (HAG) tried to ascertain if drugs intended for districts had actually reached them but was
         not able to find any information on this, although HAG’s contention about this was refuted
         by the Ministry of Health.78
       • Even when information in available, it is not always easily accessible. Dissemination
         is hampered because the number of copies available is limited, copies of documents
         are large, and soft copies of documents are not available or they are difficult to upload.
         They are often too technical and irrelevant to the request, and statistics are often difficult
         to grasp.79
       • Awareness continues to be a problem. Interviewees suggested that awareness about
         the law is very low. Most of the CSOs consulted, and even government officials charged
         with implementing the law, pointed out that the public’s awareness of the law was poor.
         Although the HURINET study is a very small sample, it confirms the relatively low levels
         of awareness—only a small percent of the respondents knew about the law. Interestingly,
         respondents also did not know where to seek information, who to approach, or the proce-
         dures for getting information.

          Although the study did not look in detail at the information-sharing mechanisms at the
      local level, in an interview, the local chapter of Transparency International recounted that they
      had requested information from the Kampala City Corporation (KCC) about the state of the
      road repairs in Kampala. Transparency International was asked to provide evidence that they
      were citizens of Uganda, had to write twice before getting a response from the relevant per-
      son, and the whole process took nine months.
          Even when budgets are displayed, communities find it a challenge to interpret figures. The
      main problem with accessing information is that even when it is given, it is rarely in an acces-
      sible form that can by easily understood by the general public, such as contract information.80
      At both the national and local levels, it is difficult to get disaggregated data on expenditures.81
          Civil society groups pointed out that, at the local level, there is incomplete data on the
      flow of funds because not all funds expended in the health sector are channeled through the
      government budget or reported. There are still several challenges to accessing information
      and local participation in health relating to capacity gaps, the lack of consistency in gathering,
      documenting, and disseminating vital health information. Regarding health, information on
      procurement is very difficult to acquire.82
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                303




   BOX 2. ATIA AND ACCOUNTABILITY
  Various other examples from Uganda suggest that enhanced levels of transparency can
  lead to greater accountability and better outcomes, including the classic case of the
  Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, where publication in newspapers of school expendi-
  tures led to an increase in the percentage of the funds allocated to schools actually going
  to them (Reinekke and Svensson 2005).
      More recent examples of civil society groups holding officials to account have also
  emerged. In Katakwi, community monitors acquired information around procurement
  related contracts in the district and documents about the substandard work on roads and
  schools as well as breaches of contracts.83 In Mpigi, village health teams demanded that
  staff at medical centers work their full hours because of the information they had received
  on mandated working hours. They were also able to begin to register the staff at the
  heath centers and to monitor drug use, allocation, and supplies through access to drugs
  stock lists.




7. Analysis
While the establishment by law of a formal right to information is already a significant principle,
the existence of the law has not caused either an increase in transparency or in accountability.
The various cases cited by civil society groups show that, unlike in countries such as India and
Mexico, CSOs have not even been able to get responses to their ATIA requests, much less use
this information to force the government to be held to account.
     The implementation of ATIA seems to come from a minimal or partial commitment from
the government, a lack of demand from civil society groups, and governmental capacity
constraints. Some public officials still pay more allegiance to the secrecy oaths taken upon
assumption of office than to ATIA or to the Whistleblower’s Act, and fear releasing embarrass-
ing information that could lead to sanctions. Further, an assessment of the gaps can only be
made on a case-by-case basis, sometimes determined by whether or not individual officers are
willing to give the information or whether or not they have capacity to do so.
     The lack of capacity can also explain the gap between the law and its implementation.
Getting information is an arduous task that takes time, especially when those charged with it
are ill-equipped and poorly trained to handle requests, and when there are no systems in place
to process the information.84 The passage of RTI laws might have strong incentives associated
with them; the adoption of them tends to have high visibility and high profiles. Implementa-
tion, however, does not benefit from the same political incentives. While passage of a law can
be driven by several factors, implementation is likely to be conditioned by more fundamen-
tal factors, especially the capacity of CSOs to meaningfully engage with and influence state
institutions. In fact, over the last five years or more, there seems to have been a backward slide
with regard to accountability relationships. Limited avenues for continued pressure, limited
capacity, and other factors have meant that there has not been a sustained momentum for
implementing ATIA.

      Role of political commitment. The commitment of the NRM to improving governance in
      Uganda facilitated the introduction of several reform initiatives. In its initial years, the NRM
      was responsible for opening up the space for better information flows. Movement politics was
      about consensus and the need to engage in a participatory process. Technocrats had more
      powers and were given a great deal of leeway to deal with issues. Robinson points out that the
      initial successes in key governance reforms eventually translated into a loss of momentum or
      reversals of gains in the face of the imperative of what he calls “regime maintenance.”85
           This explanation seems to be applicable to the experience of implementing ATI reforms
      as well. The incentive for sustaining reform momentum was strong when there were politi-
      cal payoffs (in terms of the regime’s progressive image in the run up to the 2006 elections). In
      the aftermath of 2006 election, the government became more guarded about ATI. Since the
      multiparty elections, however, it has created more restrictions, and the impetus for disclosure
      appears to have weakened.86 The move to multiparty elections and the removal of presidential
      term limits that resulted in a change the constitution have come with the tidal change back-
      wards. NGOs claim that this has to do with regime maintenance and the survival of the NRM
      in power.87 The key lesson from this is that continued political will and political championship is
      important in maintaining the momentum for reform.

      The nature of state–society relations. RTI laws have emerged from different sources—some
      with state sponsorship, as in Mexico; some as part of larger democratic movement or historical
      event, as in Eastern Europe and South Africa; and some as part of grassroots movements, as in
      India—but the experience across countries demonstrates that the momentum for implementa-
      tion of reform has been most effectively sustained in countries with a strong foundation of civil
      society groups. The Ugandan case, especially when cast in comparison with RTI regimes in
      other country contexts, shows that the relative capacity and influence of civil society is a neces-
      sary condition to make RTI laws effective accountability instruments.88
          In countries where civil society played a significant role in advocating for the law and lobby-
      ing around the key provisions, the information regimes have worked better; examples include
      South Africa, Bulgaria, India, Mexico, Peru, and Jamaica.89 On the other hand, in countries
      where civil society was not engaged in the debate, the right to information has atrophied and
      the laws have not been fully implemented.90 In Uganda, the passage of the law was eventually
      state-sponsored, and civil society groups had relatively little influence on its final passage, even
      though they did bring a bill to Parliament prior to the state-sponsored law going into effect.
      The passage of the law derived from other political and international considerations by the
      regime, as discussed in section 2, rather than being reflective of civil society influence over the
      policy process.
          Although there are very strong advocacy groups that continue to push for the implemen-
      tation of ATIA and for amendments that would plug some of the most important gaps in
      the law, for the most part, the government sees these NGOs as strongly antagonistic to the
      regime rather than as legitimate and important actors in a participatory governance space.
      HURINET, AFIC, and FHRI are three of the most prominent NGOs working on ATI. Other
      NGOs, such as ACCU, UDN, and ACODE are very active in the anticorruption and broader
      accountability space. These groups have coalesced around the ATIA. COFI,91 which is coordi-
      nated and hosted by HURINET is forging links with similar advocacy groups in other countries,
      keeping an active media presence, and undertaking advocacy and awareness workshops. In
      some instances, they work in close collaboration with the Department of National Guidance,
A CASE STUDY OF UGANDA                                                                                305




organizing joint workshops, but overall, governance and accountability NGOs are only able to
exercise limited influence over policy reform.

The capacity of civil society groups is also constrained. Most CSOs, except the larger and
more prominent ones, have capacity constraints that hamper their ability to meaningfully
participate and understand technical issues and key policies.92 Activism on this issue seems to
be largely restricted to these more prominent NGOs in the capital. This study did not go to the
district level, and was not able to assess levels of awareness about the law at the district level.
However, discussions with CSOs based in Kampala, many of whom are also active at the dis-
trict level, revealed that information problems are even more challenging at this level. Clearly,
civil society activism has not translated into the kind of social mobilization that has occurred
in India. In India and elsewhere, the widespread popularity of RTI as a tool for empowerment
has led to sector-specific NGOs—and NGOs across the countries also working in this area—to
actively mobilize citizens. Poor literacy among citizens and a belief that information and power
are the state’s preserve further exacerbate the problem.
     CSOs pointed out that civil society activism and free media are relatively new in the coun-
try. Community monitoring is a challenge because people are uncomfortable with holding
authority figures or leaders to account. There is the need for a mind shift that will allow for
the creation of grassroots pressure to hold leaders accountable. People need to be able to
embrace the idea of rights, and this is difficult because of Uganda’s history.93 Lastly, the capac-
ity investigative journalists, especially at the regional and local levels, is limited.

Politicization of ATIA. Interestingly, championship of the ATIA, both by media and prominent
civil society groups that the government considers antagonistic, has led to the politicization
of the ATIA, which is seen as a political rather than a developmental tool. Like civil society, the
media are highly polarized. Some media outlets are seen as being very close to the regime,
while the regime has a very antagonistic relationship with other media outlets. The media has
played a role in raising or flagging critical issues around ATI, highlighting cases, popularizing
the ATIA, and petitioning Parliament to operationalize the law through the passing of regula-
tions. But ATIA has come to be seen as a media issue, as an instrument that can be misused by
the opposition and by a belligerent and antagonistic media. Interviews revealed that the law
is seen much less as a service delivery issue, and service delivery NGOs tend to be distanced
from the potential of the law as a tool to get critical information that would make service pro-
viders accountable.94

The bureaucracy has very little independence to push through reforms. The bureaucracy
follows the lead of the political class. Unlike other reform measures, ATI reforms were not left
in the hands of technocratic or independent officials. The lack of momentum from the top
has translated into bureaucratic inertia with regard to the implementation of the law. A lack of
capacity and resources among information officers to translate the law into the efficient and
timely release of information, especially at the district level, has been another constraint. The
absence of regulations has created lack of clarity about the content or details of the law, the
process for its operationalization, and the responsibilities of the different agencies under it.

The informal norms in the bureaucracy lean toward secrecy and control over information.
Several interviewees pointed out that the bureaucratic culture is one of secrecy and control
over information. The bureaucracy is underpinned by a very strong top-down culture95 with
306                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      a hierarchical decision-making structure. Typically, information requests must be channeled
      through the permanent secretary. The overall implementation of the law is vested in the chief
      executive officer of each public body,96 who is required to maintain a manual which includes
      the nature of all informal and formal procedures available to facilitate a request for informa-
      tion.97 The standard practice is for technical officers to seek permission before releasing any
      information, especially “sensitive” information. Chief executive officers, particularly, the perma-
      nent secretaries of ministries, should be systematically engaged98 to participate in the design
      and implementation of reforms aimed at improving ATI at the institutional level.



      8. Conclusion
      The key lesson that can be drawn from the implementation of ATI reforms in Uganda is that
      successful implementation requires continued momentum and push from the top of the politi-
      cal leadership and the building of capacity. But, it also requires a progressive expansion of
      space for civil society action, especially for those engaged in the governance area.
           There is some debate in the literature about whether or not it is useful to adopt legal
      instruments like the ATIA if the capacity for full implementation is not present. Uganda, set in
      a comparative perspective with other countries in the region, demonstrates that when there
      is a window of opportunity, it is very important to get a law passed. Most other countries in
      the region have had long struggles in their attempts to get the RTI legislation passed. Liberia
      and Nigeria have only recently managed to get RTI laws on the books. While not fully imple-
      mented, the existence of the ATIA has formed an important locus for an interaction between
      civil society groups and the government and a platform for advocacy by civil society groups.
           The presence of the ATIA means that Uganda is already several steps ahead of its African
      counterparts in terms of this critical accountability mechanism. However, it will be important
      to take several measures in order to realize the potential of this legal instrument, and to move
      toward greater transparency and more openness—key elements for improved service delivery.
      These would include the repeal of the Secrecy Law; the development of training programs for
      information officers; the employment of officers with some knowledge of the law or who are
      trained to handle legal requests; and enhancing district-level capabilities.
           The prospects for the implementation of regulations for ATIA or for a major implementa-
      tion initiative look difficult in the immediate (pre-election) term. But, as part of the broader
      governance agenda, some potential avenues of support could be considered in the medium
      term, as follows.
       • Supporting ATIA as Part of Sectoral Social Accountability Initiatives. Awareness about
         the ATIA could be usefully integrated into other initiatives and programs on social account-
         ability, undertaken in the sectors or as part of a larger governance initiative. Greater aware-
         ness and use of ATIA as a tool to request information could provide an important channel
         of pressure on the government to become progressively responsive and to undertake
         implementation measures. It can also serve as a means of strengthening civil society aware-
         ness and understanding of their rights and entitlements under the law and to serve as a
         catalyst for greater participation and involvement by civil society groups.

• Institutionalizing the Law. Second, it is important to continue to push for the institution-
  alization of the law: putting the necessary regulations in place and passing amendments to
  so it would supercede the Official Secrets Act.
• Support for the Directorate of Information’s Implementation Plan. The Directorate
  of information has prepared an implementation plan with a focus on training. Even
  though the political will to take on this set of reforms seems to be limited at this time, the
  Directorate includes some very progressive officials. It is possible—perhaps in conjunc-
  tion with development partners—to support awareness-raising and training activities to
  create the capacity and momentum for the implementation of the law. It might be useful
  to explore how such capacity-building measures could be supported as part of broader
  governance initiatives.
• Working at the Local Government Level. There appears to be a fairly significant
  constraint to information at the local level. The study was not able to go to the local gov-
  ernment level, but most stakeholders interviewed pointed to this as an issue. It would be
  useful to look at the constraints to both information access and accountability at the local
  government level and to assess the possibilities for strengthening these systems at the
  local level.
• Parliamentary Monitoring of ATIA. While, to date, the courts have not been proactive
  in interpreting the provisions of the law, the 9th Parliament is increasingly looking to the
  courts as an avenue through which efforts to promote ATI could be realized. It could be a
  very positive and productive step to integrate efforts to monitor the ATIA by Parliament
  into this process.

      24. Under the law, the electoral commission is compelled to provide participating parties and candidates
          with information, including updated registers. However, this is often not done in time, or only provided
          in part and in soft versions, as was done prior to the 2011 elections when bulky information containing
          almost 10 million registered voters was given in soft copy with the expectation that the requester
          would print the material at very high costs. It was also reported in the Global Integrity Report 2008 that
          access to electoral commission vote registers costs 10 million shillings (US$5,263).

      32. See article 47 and 48 of the ATI Act 2005, page 60–62; CSOs played an active role in expediting the
          passing of the regulations, beginning in November 2010, when AFIC requested reports from
          Parliament under Section 43 of the Act on Ministers reporting. This request revealed the
          noncompliance of the ministers and elicited a promise to enforce the laws this year. Another request
          was to the Prime Minister’s office in February 21, 2011, to which the Prime Minister responded with a
          request to the Information Minister to provide the information requested under the law. The response
          from the Minister of Information on April 15, 2011 was, in effect, that they had not complied; this was
          accompanied by a promise to pass the regulations. During a public dialogue organized by AFIC on
          May 2, 2011, to mark World Press Freedom Day, the Director for Information and National Guidance,
          representing the minister, announced that regulations had been gazetted, but it was not until July that
          they were officially published and released to the public.
      33. See Larsen, Excell, and Veit 2011.
      34. ATI Regulations, S.7(3): the access fee can be waived when the request is in public interest or if the
          information is likely to benefit a large section of the public; however, no guidelines are provided on
          these exemptions.
      35. The Public Service Act declares that “it is an offence for any member or officer of the Commission
          [government department or organization] and any other person to knowingly publish or disclose the
          contents of any document, communication or information whatsoever that has come to his notice in
          the course of his duties in relation to the Commission without the written permission of the
          Minister,”Chapter 277, Article 9.

      39. Views expressed by journalists in round table discussion on June 18, 2009. There is an ongoing
          constitutional case filed by the East Africa Media Institute and Andrew Mwenda to declare sedition
          laws unconstitutional and hence null and void. However, this case has been in the drafting stage in the
          constitutional court for the last four years; therefore, these sections are likely to remain on the statute
          books for a while.
      40. The report points out that these two countries are also among the largest recipients of international
          donor assistance, supporting the argument that aid-dependent countries establish laws and
          institutions to meet donor requirements but do not necessarily implement them. Despite massive
          amounts of foreign aid, including a significant amount of aid for good governance and anticorruption
          efforts, there is little evidence to suggest that ordinary citizens are benefiting from the proliferation of
          legal and regulatory reforms on paper.
      41. In South Africa, responsibility for the final passage of the law was transferred to the Ministry of Justice,
          one of the busiest departments of government and one that has proved singularly ill-equipped to
          master the challenge of implementation.

45. Approximately US$1.6 million based on current dollar rates.
46. It should be noted that a difference was evident in the capacities and resources of PROs in line
    ministries and those in agencies and bodies like the Parliament and NEMA. The latter were specially
    trained and well-resourced with staff and finances and had sufficient clout and responsibility to make
    public comments and statements on behalf of their respective organizations.

    the Uganda AIDS Commission Partnership Committee, the technical working groups, the National
    Health Assembly, and the Joint Review Missions.
55. Increasingly, the notion of enforcement has been conflated with supervision or oversight. In the latter,
    an agency or body is tasked with reviewing compliance and ensuring the proper functioning of the law
    through training of civil servants, preparation of guidance manuals and materials, public information,
    and annual reporting. Though some countries have fused the responsibilities for enforcement and
    oversight into one body.

    information on the effects of corruption on society. The law proclaims that information in its possession
    is privileged. It states: “Subject to any law which enjoys the disclosure of classified information,
    anything said, information supplied, document, paper or thing produced in the course of inquiry
    under this Act shall be privileged in the same manner as if the inquiry were a proceeding of court of
    law, and a report of the Inspectorate shall be privileged in the same manner as if it were a record and
    judgment of a proceeding in court”(Uganda, 2002c, Article 23).

    campaigns that consist of the publication of monthly disbursement figures. It conducts regular audits
    and commissions reports on the flow of funds from disbursement through the entire system.

      69. The kind of information included the local council committee minutes; procedure of district contracts
          committee; information relating to district hospitals or health centers especially the nonexistence of
          drugs; oil contracts (Tullow Oil and BIDCO Oil projects, among other oil related inquiries and
          operations) and their impact on the environment; development funds (accessing funds from the
          government’s poverty alleviation program and from the NUSAF project for the reconstruction of
          Northern Uganda); crime and police-related information (detention centers, police procedures; crime
          statistics, treatment of juveniles, and so on).

      84. As an example, AFIC requested information on the ATI regulations in November 2010; by end of
          January, there had been no response to the request. When AFIC inquired about the status of the
          request, it was informed that ministers were not reporting on the ATIA because there were no
          regulations, even though regulations are not a prerequisite for reporting.
      85. When political priorities change and the politics of regime maintenance prevail over constructive state
          intervention, the sustainability of successful reforms becomes increasingly problematic. The Ugandan
          experience highlights the difficulty of sustaining successful reform initiatives over a long period of time
          when benign intentions can be compromised by other political prerogatives.

      88. Caveats are the way in which we characterize “capacity”and “influence” of civil society; there are no
          absolute measures. It is a qualitative discussion.
      89. Neuman and Calland (2007). Through the campaign for a legislated right to information, organizations
          became vested in the law’s success, there was more significant buy-in from society, and the laws
          enjoyed greater credibility and use, although the relative strength of implementation, varies across
          these countries.
      90. Neuman and Calland (2007). The authors point to the example of Belize. Belize passed its Freedom of
          Information law in 1994, one of the first countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to do so. It was
          accomplished with little public or parliamentary debate and no civil society involvement. For the past
          decade, the law has been used only a handful of times and rarely with success. NGO leaders indicated
          minimal knowledge of the law and little faith in its ability to promote greater transparency.
      91. It came into being in 2005. The coalition has since grown from a membership of eight CSOs in 2005 to
          include media and communitybased organizations across the country.

                                    A Case Study of
                                the United Kingdom

1. Introduction
This case study analyzes the development and implementation of access to information (ATI)
in the United Kingdom, enshrined in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). The United
Kingdom was sometimes described as a laggard in this field; many of its democratic peers
enacted comprehensive access laws decades earlier. This case study argues that, despite an
apparent late start, ATI in the United Kingdom is relatively effective and firmly entrenched.
     There are several reasons for this. The structure of electoral competition and policymaking
in the United Kingdom means that ATI has long been—and is likely to remain—a prominent
matter of political debate. Fundamental changes to state and society alike since the 1980s
have altered the structure of political accountability and administrative authority in ways that
incentivize those in positions of power—at all levels—to support openness. Finally, the United
Kingdom has a vibrant civil society and independent press that defend existing gains and
lobby for greater transparency.
     In addition to these fundamental structural contributors, the FOIA has also proved rela-
tively successful because it is a strong law whose implementation was reasonably well-planned
and well-executed. Five years elapsed between the passage of the law and the entry into force
of the right of access to official documents. This time was used to provide training, to improve
records management, and to proactively publish mechanisms within the public sector. The
law’s success is also due in no small part to the existence of an information commissioner with
extensive powers and an appeals process that functions reasonably well despite some early
problems with delays. Implementation is also facilitated by the fact that public authorities
in the United Kingdom are sufficiently well-funded so that they can usually bear the cost of
compliance, and there is a strong official culture of taking one’s duty to the law seriously—even
when it might be inconvenient to do so, as is sometimes the case with FOIA requests.
     The conclusions of this case study are positive but do not justify complacency. The United
Kingdom has become more open over recent decades because several features of British

      politics and the administration encourage the framing of disputes over power in terms of
      disputes over ATI. Despite this debate, and despite the profound social and administrative
      transformations that have occurred since the 1970s, several features that historically under-
      pinned the United Kingdom’s regime of widespread official secrecy remain in place, notably
      the centrality of the cabinet in the overall political system. ATI is likely to remain contested in
      the foreseeable future, and future gains are likely to continue to depend on the active, ongo-
      ing support of politicians, public servants, and civil society.

      1.1. METHODOLOGY
      This case study is based on primary and secondary documentary research as well as interviews
      with senior officials and representatives of the major stakeholders in the ATI policy domain
      (a full list of interviewees can be found in the appendixes). It focuses on the development
      and implementation of ATI provided by the FOIA as it applies in England, Ireland, and Wales
      (but not Scotland, where a separate law applies). The distinction is important, since ATI in the
      United Kingdom has also been secured under a range of other laws, especially at the local
      level, where a good deal of basic service provision in the United Kingdom is undertaken. These
      other laws and initiatives, some of which still exist and continue to apply, are surveyed briefly
      toward the end of this paper, but are only discussed in detail to the extent that they affect the
      implementation of the FOIA itself.




      2. Passage of ATI Legislation
      Narrowly construed, the FOIA was just less than 10 years in the making. Work on drafting the
      bill began early in the Blair government’s first term in 1997. The law was passed in 2000, and
      entered into force progressively between November 30, 2000, and January 1, 2005 (when the
      right of access to official documents came into effect).
           The historical roots of freedom of information in the United Kingdom are much older than
      this, however. The Labour Party first promised to introduce ATI legislation more than 25 years
      earlier, but had not yet followed through on its commitment when it lost office to the Conser-
      vatives in 1979. The party’s adoption of this commitment came at a time when people at all
      levels of society in the United Kingdom were recognizing that state control over information
      was a problem whose solution lay in securing public rights of access. This recognition, in turn,
      formed part of a much longer history of disputes over state secrecy and political control that
      can be traced back to the foundation of the modern British state in the late nineteenth century.
           This historical context meant that debate over the principles and legal structure of the
      FOIA was already mature well before its drafting. Since the mid-1970s, politicians, officials, and
      campaigners produced a string of proposals, white papers, electoral commitments, and even a
      few bills that made some progress through the parliamentary process. Several limited forms of
      access had been secured well before 2000, and these significantly affected both the structure
      of the FOIA and its implementation. These are discussed below (see 3.5. Broader Legal Envi-
      ronment on Transparency).
           Civil society organizations (CSOs) and politically connected professional groups were the
      most consistent advocates of freedom of information during this period. The first demands
      for access laws arose in the 1960s among professionals on the margins of formal political
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                   325




organizations: lawyers, journalists, academics, and occasionally backbench members of the
two main parties or members of smaller parties. The central concerns of these groups were the
threats to individual liberty posed by the growth of the administrative state and the inability of
existing political mechanisms to adequately address them. From the early 1970s onward, they
were joined by public interest, environmental, and health and safety campaigners interested
in harnessing the power of the state to overcome the challenges of collective action in dealing
with the spillover effects of large-scale industrial production. The Campaign for Freedom of
Information (CFOI), founded in 1984, was an alliance between these two camps; organization-
ally, it drew heavily on support from environmental and public interest campaigners, but it
drew a good deal of intellectual inspiration from politically-connected individuals. The cam-
paign was directed by a small group of highly engaged policy professionals,1 but benefitted
from the support of more than 100 organizations, including churches, trade unions, advocacy
groups, and librarian associations, among others.2
     Despite a long history of mobilization and support from a wide range of social and political
interests, the success of the ATI movement in the United Kingdom depended, above all, on
the cabinet’s receptiveness to their demands. Mrs. Thatcher was well known for her opposition
to the FOIA, and little progress was made during her premiership. One of the earliest signs
that the New Labour Party would follow through on its long-standing commitment to introduce
ATI legislation came when then-opposition leader Tony Blair personally associated himself with
the idea at the CFOI’s annual awards ceremony in 1996.3 The introduction of the FOIA also
appeared as an explicit commitment in the New Labour Party’s 1997 election manifesto.4 Work
on a bill began soon after the election with the publication of a white paper.5 Advocates wel-
comed the progressive nature of the proposals and the fact that David Clark, the paper’s prin-
cipal architect, appeared to enjoy the close personal support of Lord Irvine, the lord chancellor,
and an extremely influential senior member of the early cabinet of the New Labour Party.6
     Initial optimism, however, quickly gave way to concern, as the balance of power within the
cabinet shifted toward the opponents of ATI legislation. The reasons for this shift remain some-
thing of a mystery7 and have led some to question whether or not Tony Blair was ever as com-
mitted to ATI legislation as he had appeared prior to the election. He certainly seemed to have
either lost interest in the issue or been subject to countervailing influence by opponents within
the cabinet at a relatively early stage of his administration.8 This was reflected in the transfer
of responsibility for ATI legislation from David Clark to Jack Straw, who was understood to be
personally less sympathetic to the cause than Clark, and from the Cabinet Office that had been
responsible for open government initiatives since 1992 at the latest, to the home office, which
was responsible for the police, security services, immigration, and other areas of government
not usually noted for their enthusiastic about freedom of information.9 With these changes, the
task of securing ATI became the responsibility of ministers and officials who were more inclined
to believe that it “brings nothing but pain for governments.”10
     The government’s consultation bill11 was significantly weaker than the white paper propos-
als and contained much broader exemptions, less effective enforcement and appeal mecha-
nisms, and more restrictive public-interest test.12 It is possible that senior government figures
would have preferred to abandon the legislation altogether at this point, but their election
commitments and the white paper had stirred so much public interest that this would have
been too risky.
     The bill was altered considerably during its passage through Parliament. It was severely
criticized by select committees in both the House of Lords and House of Commons,13 resulting
326                                        RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      in several features that FOIA advocates found most objectionable being removed or amended
      by the second reading in early December 1999.14 Further concessions were made during
      the committee stage and in the later stages of the third reading on the floor of the House,15
      although some commentators argue that these were superficial concessions that did not affect
      the basic structure of the legislation.16 The changes included a halving of the time frame (to
      20 working days) within which authorities were required to respond to requests, the adding
      of a requirement that authorities give reasons for refusals, and the removal of the power of
      authorities to restrict the way in which information disclosed under the FOIA could be used by
      requesters.17 Several of the more significant changes made between the consultation draft and
      the final legislation are discussed below.



      3. Strength of the Legal Environment
      The FOIA draft drew inspiration from several sources, including earlier domestic proposals for
      ATI, existing rights under other laws, such as the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and FOIAs in
      Australia, Canada, and New Zealand which were introduced in the early 1980s—not long after
      the New Labour Party first committed itself to ATI legislation. The United Kingdom’s FOIA is
      longer and in some sections more detailed than these other laws but, except for the issues
      discussed below, similar in its structure and intent.
          Those interviewed for this case study identified some features of the law as problematic,18
      particularly the absence of a purpose clause; this was also identified as a potential problem
      during parliamentary debates when it was argued that a clear statement of the purposes to
      be served by enshrining in law the principle of access (subject only to specified exemptions)
      would aid the Information Commissioner in evaluating the discretionary decisions of authori-
      ties. But the inclusion of such a clause was rejected by the government on the grounds that it
      would add unnecessary “confusion” to the law.19 As a result, the various appellate bodies have
      occasionally had to rely on parliamentary debates in order to infer the purposes of the FOIA in
      cases for which the meaning of specific clauses have proved ambiguous and their interpreta-
      tion difficult.20

      3.1. COVERAGE
      The coverage of the law was specifically mentioned in interviews as a strong point.21
      According to legal expert Professor Patrick Birkinshaw, the United Kingdom’s FOIA is “the
      most comprehensive FOI legislation” with which he is familiar.22 It covers more than 100,000
      separate public authorities—from the summit of the state in Westminster and Whitehall to
      local services, including schools, parish councils, and medical practices as well as a wide
      range of autonomous bodies at all levels. The authorities covered are explicitly identified in
      Schedule I, which also specifies that certain bodies are covered only with respect to particu-
      lar functions. In addition to the authorities listed there, s84 excludes “the Security Service,
      the Secret Intelligence Service or the Government Communications Headquarters” from the
      definition of a government department, while s80(2) excludes Scottish political and adminis-
      trative authorities covered by the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (FOISA). Finally,
      an absolute exemption23 in s23 applies to information held by or related to 13 security and
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                    327




intelligence authorities and their related tribunals and commissions that are, consequently,
excluded from the FOIA.
     It was not always obvious that the FOIA would be quite as extensive in its coverage as it
turned out to be. One of the drivers of demand for an access law, especially in the 1980s and
early 1990s, was discontent with the central government’s increasing use of quasi-autonomous
organizations or “Quangos” (the official term is “nondepartmental public bodies” [NDPBs]),
which were often criticized for their opacity, lack of democratic accountability, and for foster-
ing an uncoordinated and incoherent policy and administration. Since the 1970s, both of the
main parties had promised to reduce their number when they were the opposition parties,
but when in power actually increased their number in order to achieve a range of outcomes,
including developing policy, providing expert advice, regulating, and even directly providing
some services. In the early years of the Blair government, there was concern that NDPBs would
fall outside the scope of the FOIA24 and early government proposals were in fact narrower in
scope than the law as eventually passed.
     The replacement of the government’s original proposal that the FOIA should apply to a
relatively narrow range of authorities with a law of much broader scope was a moral victory for
transparency advocates, but it occurred without the strenuous resistance of ministers. Cover-
age was discussed in Parliament25 but was not a matter of major debate, and the government
explicitly identified breadth as one of its goals in the Lords’ discussion of the bill.26 Moreover,
some members of the New Labour Party leadership viewed the FOIA as a means of legiti-
mizing a new kind of British state (one characterized by decentralized governance) and of
regulating relations between largely autonomous NDPBs and the public.27 The introduction
of the FOIA was, at least in part, a response to this specific structural transformation of the
British state.

3.2. EXEMPTIONS
The FOIA contains 23 sections exempting various kinds of information. Since some of these
sections contain more than one exemption, the total number of exemptions is slightly higher
and relatively large when compared with similar legislation from other countries. For example,
the Australian FOIA contains 17 exemption clauses, the Canadian law contains six broad
exemption clauses, and the New Zealand law includes the equivalent of 19 exemptions spread
across two clauses. The number of exemptions dismayed the activist community28 who criti-
cized both the consultation draft and the bill tabled in Parliament.29 In retrospect, the number
of exemptions appears to be less problematic than initially feared, perhaps because each
specifies in detail the kinds of information that can be withheld (as opposed to earlier acts
like the Swedish and American laws that rely on a smaller number of more general exemption
statements). The law’s specificity in this regard has limited the tendency of officials to exploit
ambiguities in the law and circumvent the spirit of it.
     Two aspects of the exemption regime were discussed at some length in Parliament.
The first concerned the two kinds of exemptions that appear in the legislation. Nine are
“absolute”—they allow information that falls into certain categories to be withheld without
an assessment of whether or not there is a countervailing public interest for disclosure. This
includes information held by or relating to the national security agencies (mentioned above),30
court records, documents whose disclosure would infringe on parliamentary privilege, informa-
tion provided in confidence, and information specifically prohibited from being disclosed by
328                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      other laws. The remainder are “qualified” exemptions, requiring authorities to assess whether
      or not there is an overriding public interest in disclosure.31 There are two types of qualified
      exemptions: class-based, covering particular types of information, such as that “relating to the
      formation of government policy” (s35), and harm-based, requiring the authority to demon-
      strate that disclosure would prejudice important public or third-party interests.
           The introduction of the absolute exemptions is a significant point of difference between
      the government’s consultation bill and the white paper.32 This continues to be relevant to the
      Information Commissioner’s powers. In the case of absolute exemptions, she33 can determine
      if particular information falls within a particular exemption, but she is not empowered to order
      an authority to release information after the application of an exemption has been determined
      to be correct. In the case of qualified exemptions, the commissioner can conduct a de novo
      review of whether or not the public interest lies in disclosure and she can order the release of
      that information. This power was introduced in committee;34 the government’s bill only allowed
      the commissioner to make an advisory recommendation that the authority was free to ignore if
      it saw fit to do so. This debate formed part of a broader discussion about the balance of power
      between the commissioner and the elected government, as discussed below.
           The second main focus of debate in the House of Commons concerned the specific kinds
      of material exempted from disclosure. Each exemption was discussed in detail in committee,
      but those interviewed for this case study identified two exemptions as particularly noteworthy.
      The first concerns the results of health and safety investigations (for example, product safety
      reports, pollution investigations, and documents concerning workplace accidents). The consul-
      tation bill exempted this information, a decision that was considered symptomatic of the trans-
      fer of responsibility from the Cabinet Office to the home office.35 However, this exemption was
      removed by Parliament under pressure from civil society groups like the CFOI. As previously
      noted, “These groups emerged as a political force in the early 1970s to address issues such as
      land use, product safety, human health, and environmental pollution.”36 Their support of ATI
      legislation was motivated by a desire to break the close relations that had developed between
      regulatory authorities and industry. Regulators had historically sought to preserve these close
      relations by, among other things, invoking the Official Secrets Act (OSA) and by refusing to
      divulge the results of inspections to interested third parties (such as members of the public
      whose quality of life was affected by industrial pollution). The elimination of the proposed
      exemption covering these reports represents a clear instance of CSOs prevailing over the
      interests of the administrative state. Other evidence of this includes a narrowing of exemptions
      covering commercial interests and information provided to governments in confidence (that is,
      by regulated industries to regulators).37
           Another subject of debate with enduring relevance concerned policy advice that con-
      tinues to be protected under the FOIA (s35). It is clear from the parliamentary debates that
      many Members of Parliament (MPs) believed that one of the main purposes of the FOIA was
      to provide access to information used by ministers and senior civil servants to decide policy.
      These debates focused on the possibility and desirability of distinguishing between the factual
      material upon which policy recommendations are based and the specific advice that ministers
      receive from the civil service. It was not actively disputed that the latter could be legitimately
      kept confidential; rather, critics emphasized the fact that ministers and civil servants alike
      routinely refused to divulge the former despite decades of regulatory attempts in favor of its
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                    329




disclosure. Jack Straw’s claim that most of the statistics on which policy decisions were made in
his area of responsibility were already publicly available did little to convince these critics.38
    One of the major outcomes of this debate was the transformation of the government’s
proposed absolute exemption for policy advice into a qualified exemption. This has probably
resulted in the disclosure of far more information than the government anticipated because of
the way that the Information Commissioner and courts have interpreted the public interest.39
It has been suggested that the government may not have opposed this change because it
assumed that the new enforcement bodies would take the same line as the parliamentary com-
missioner for administration had taken in enforcing the existing Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information: that the disclosure of policy advice was prima facie harmful to the
public interest. One result of the FOIA has been the considerable narrowing of the protected
space for policy development that British governments once enjoyed. Although information
can still be withheld while policy is being developed, once decisions have been made, there
are now far fewer grounds for withholding information.40 Tony Blair’s admission in 2010 that he
considers the FOIA to be one of his greatest mistakes (because it impinges on the ability of
ministers and civil servants to discuss policy proposals frankly and privately) suggests that this
effect was not anticipated.41


3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
Several procedural provisions were identified by interviewees as having proved particularly
conducive to overcoming bureaucratic resistance and fostering public ATI, including the duty
to provide advice and assistance to requesters (s16) and to consider any written request for
information as an FOIA request, regardless of whether or not the requester explicitly men-
tions the law. During the parliamentary debates, MPs identified these provisions as particularly
important because of the length and complexity of the law,42 and they have significantly con-
tributed to the change in the attitudes about openness among bureaucrats by shifting several
practical burdens from requesters to the state.43


3.4. IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS
The FOIA provides fairly extensive regulation-making powers, allowing the government to
determine the commencement of many of its provisions (87(3)), to alter the authorities to which
it applies (ss4–5), to set fees (s9), and to allow prescribed authorities longer time frames within
which to respond to requests (s10(4))—there is a maximum upper limit of 60 working days.
These have been used regularly since 2000, but except for commencement decisions (dis-
cussed below), have not materially affected the operations of the law. The FOIA also requires
the government to promulgate two codes of practice that cover procedures for handling
requests (s45) and records management (s46).


3.5. BROADER LEGAL ENVIRONMENT ON TRANSPARENCY
As noted earlier, the FOIA is one of many legislative instruments regulating public access to
official information in the United Kingdom, and it is by no means the oldest. One of the most
important laws is the Official Secrets Act (OSA), originally passed in 1889 and amended several
330                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      times over the course of the 20th century. Prior to its 1989 amendment, the infamous Section 2
      of this law technically forbade any unauthorized disclosure of any state-held information by any
      public servant. This was controversial from its very inception and was subject to persistent criti-
      cism from official inquiries, the press, and civil society since the late 1960s.44 The OSA remains
      on the books, but in 1989, its scope was restricted to the disclosure of information harming
      national security.
           Apart from the FOIA, which, as noted earlier, applies to England, Wales, and Northern
      Ireland, the most important existing instruments favoring access to official information are the
      FOISA, which regulates ATI held by Scottish authorities; the DPA, which regulates access to
      and the processing and storage of personal information by organizations in both the public
      and private sectors; and the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) 2004, which provides
      ATI on the environment even when it is held by private authorities, as is sometimes the case.
      For many decades prior to the passage of the FOIA, local government assemblies and authori-
      ties were subject to a range of more focused access laws, including the Public Bodies (Admis-
      sion to Meetings) Act 1960, famous mainly because it was proposed by Margaret Thatcher at
      her maiden speech to Parliament in 1959. In some cases, local authorities are still subject to
      disclosure requirements beyond those that apply to the central government.
           The FOIA and the DPA also replaced a number of partial access regimes at the national
      level. Perhaps the most general of these was the regulatory Code of Practice on Access to
      Government Information introduced by John Major in 1993. They also replaced a number of
      laws providing access to specific kinds of information (mostly personal information held by
      service-providing agencies or local authorities. Examples include the Access to Personal Files
      Act 1987, the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988, and the Access to Health Records Act 1990.
      Many of these laws had been introduced with active support from the CFOI as a way of making
      progress on ATI despite Mrs. Thatcher’s hostility toward a comprehensive freedom of informa-
      tion law.




      4. Promotion, Capacity, and Oversight
      A good deal of the early success and early failure of the FOIA can be attributed to the way the
      government prepared for the law between 2000–05.45 The interval between the passage of
      the law through Parliament and its full entry into force was intended to give public authorities
      the time to put in place the necessary training, human resources, records management, and
      other measures that would allow its effective implementation.46 In most cases, central authori-
      ties used this time productively and were, by and large, well-prepared. At the local level and in
      NDPBs, arrangements were more mixed; interviewees attributed this inconsistency to resourc-
      ing and the anticipated level of requests.
           Unfortunately, preparations at all levels were disrupted—and the effectiveness of the law
      in its early years hampered—by a significant change in the overall implementation strategy,
      determined at the central political level. The government’s original stated intention was to
      conduct a phased introduction across the public sector, starting with central departments (on
      the grounds that they should lead by example), followed by local government (which had been
      subject to disclosure laws of limited scope for several years), and finally semi-autonomous
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                  331




administrations, such as the National Health Service and the police services. This phased-in
introduction of the law was abandoned in late 2001, when a decision was made to introduce
the law across the whole of the public sector in a single, so-called “big bang” on January 1,
2005. It is widely assumed that the electoral concerns of senior ministers significantly influ-
enced this decision.47
    The “big bang” had several serious consequences, some of which were not overcome
until 2010. Most notably, significant delays in handling complaints by the Information Commis-
sioner’s Office (ICO) rapidly built up. The overall preparations for and the disruptions that the
change in timing caused are discussed below.

4.1. ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The preparation for the entry into force of the FOIA was led by the Cabinet Subcommittee
on Freedom of Information and Data Protection, chaired by the Lord Chancellor.48 The subc-
committee was supported by two interdepartmental committees: the Senior Group and the
Practitioner’s Group on Freedom of Information. These were composed, of senior civil servants
and lower-level officials with knowledge and practical experience, respectively. The arrange-
ments were complemented by the Advisory Group on Implementation, composed of public
sector representatives and independent experts. The nodal authority leading implementation
of the FOIA within the central government has changed several times since the law was origi-
nally passed; it is currently the Ministry of Justice (MOJ).49
     Prior to the FOIA’s entry into force, initial efforts focused on developing publication
schemes for the central government, on developing and issuing the Codes of Practice under
sections 45 and 46 of the law, and on repealing and amending legislation prohibiting the dis-
closure of information (a power provided to the secretary under Section 75). This work was led
by the nodal agency, the ICO, and the National Archives. The nodal agency promoted the law
within the government and assisted public authorities in their organizational and operational
preparations; it also promoted cultural change by publicizing good practices and conducting
case studies.50
     The nodal agency continues to provide advice to the rest of the central government about
its responsibilities under the law. The Access to Information Central Clearing House51 was
established as a unit within the nodal agency in September 2005 to ensure the consistent
application of the three main access regimes in the United Kingdom: the DPA, FOIA, and
Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). The clearing house has been criticized for delays
in responses and a rise in appeals, especially when requesters realize that authorities may have
been willing to disclose information except that they were blocked from doing so by the cen-
tral government, similar to problems in countries with equivalent legislation, such as Canada.52
On the other hand, the clearing house gave several advantages to those charged with imple-
menting the law. In the early years of implementation, it was a central source of advice for
many authorities, especially those that received few requests or lacked the in-house resources
to develop comprehensive expertise on the FOIA. It also ensured consistency in the applica-
tion of the law if similar sensitive requests were filed with multiple authorities.53
     The clearing house still exists but its staff has been progressively reduced to a handful
of officers; its prominence wanes as authorities become more experienced with the law and
processes for handing FOIA requests and complaints become embedded in normal operating
332                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      procedures. It does continue to be a source of expertise for the coordination of responses to
      sensitive requests and for handling cases referred to the commissioner, tribunals, and courts
      (it ensures that the government’s position is adequately represented in proceedings whose
      outcomes constitute legally-binding precedents).54

      4.2. BUDGET
      Public authorities are expected to meet the costs of compliance with the FOIA from within
      existing budgets, supplemented through fees. Below a certain threshold, authorities may only
      charge for costs directly incurred in providing the information (for example, photocopying and
      postage). This threshold is £600 for central government and Parliament; £450 for other public
      authorities. Once the total cost of meeting a request passes this limit, authorities may refuse
      to grant the request or may ask the requester to pay the full cost of provision. As discussed
      below, it was anticipated that authorities would reduce the cost of compliance below these
      limits by improving records management.
           There is no reliable data on the actual cost of compliance with the FOIA. The nodal agency
      publishes extensive quarterly data on processing activity, but data on expenditures incurred
      as a result of the activity are not available. The most recent, comprehensive, cost estimate of
      the FOIA was commissioned by the Department of Constitutional Affairs in 2006. It estimated
      the average cost per request at £293 and the total cost to government at £35.5 million (about
      0.007 percent of total public sector expenditures in that year).55 This estimate was immediately
      criticized for inflating projected request numbers and systematically overestimating individual
      cost components.56
           Opinions on the budget implications of the FOIA differed between interviewees. The Asso-
      ciation of Chief Police Officers, which coordinates the handling of FOIA requests among the
      43 regional police forces in England and Wales, reports that it has experienced significant but
      not unmanageable resource implications.57 Costs are mainly incurred due to the need to train
      staff in the legal and strategic requirements of responding to requests and the practicalities of
      redaction and information management. But other interviews suggest that resource implica-
      tions are highly variable and that many authorities receiving fewer requests have been able
      to incorporate response processes into their existing legal or public relations functions with
      minimal disruption.58
           In addition, practices vary so considerably from authority to authority, even within a single
      sector, that none of the interviewees would give an estimate of the average budget impact
      of the FOIA. Historically, most authorities have tended to place FOIA handling either in the
      legal team or in central corporate services;59 the choice was usually based on the resourcing
      and prevailing views as to whether or not FOIA was a matter of legal compliance or (political)
      management of relations with external stakeholders and client groups. Where the authority in
      question was headed by an elected official (that is, a minister), it was not uncommon to hear
      that all FOIA requests were routed through the minister’s private office, especially in the early
      period of implementation, resulting in some inflation of costs.60 A number of interviewees indi-
      cated that constraints caused by public sector austerity might encourage authorities to look
      for cost savings by co-locating FOIA handling into other functions, such as complaint handling,
      but they also indicated that it was too early to identify any definite trends.61
           Even if they cannot be quantified, the crucial determinants of budget impact appear to be
      the volume and sensitivity of requests. The police sector receives a high volume of requests,
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                     333




many of which pose considerable problems of coordination and consistency because they take
the form of similar requests submitted simultaneously to multiple regional forces. Furthermore,
the police often hold information provided by other agencies—including those responsible
for national security. Thus, requests to the police often involve the consideration of numerous
political and operational issues. The FOIA states that the decision about whether or not to
release information lies with the authority holding it, rather than with the authority that origi-
nally provided it; in practice, however, it is routine for all affected authorities to consult with
one another. This approach is desirable from an overall information management perspective,
especially in circumstances when the information in question is of a sensitive nature, but it
imposes organizational overhead as well as financial costs.

4.3. STAFFING AND TRAINING
There are no figures available on the total number of FOIA officers employed in the United
Kingdom, and arrangements for meeting obligations under the law vary considerably from
authority to authority. Prior to the FOIA’s entry into force, the nodal agency coordinated an
effort among public authorities to put in place appropriate organizational structures, admin-
istrative procedures, and record management processes to ensure effective compliance
with the law.62 Authorities were given considerable leeway in determining their own arrange-
ments. This flexibility was considered desirable given the range of authorities subject to the
law, the differing resources available to each, and the diversity of the relationships they have
with the formal political system and with external stakeholders.63 Smaller authorities have
tended to delegate the administrative handling of FOIA matters to their legal teams or to
their corporate services divisions;64 larger authorities and those receiving a high volume of
requests have set up dedicated teams. The choice of staffing and organizational arrange-
ments have also been influenced by available resources and prevailing views on whether
or not the FOIA is a matter of legal compliance or (political) management of relations with
external stakeholders and client groups.65 Many interviewees were extremely reluctant to
make generalizations about implementation at all, even within authorities in their own sec-
tors, given the broad coverage of the law and the range of mechanisms in place. Any precise
estimate of staff numbers or other data would be both speculative and misleading. As of late
2011, the ICO employs 328 full-time equivalent staff within lead agencies, and the Cabinet
Office and nodal agency each have a small number of officials responsible for developing
information policy.66
     The interviewees rarely referred to human resources issues as an influence on the FOIA,
and the subject is largely absent from the secondary literature as well. The only significant
exception to this is overall staffing levels: it is generally thought that authorities across the
government dedicate insufficient resources to FOIA compliance, but it is also widely recog-
nized that this is the result of budgetary issues rather than incompatibilities between the FOIA
and human resource policies.67 Other potential human resource issues appear to have been
preempted by the significant centralized training efforts that occurred during the preparation
phase (2000–05) that formed part of the promotion effort; this is discussed below. Since the
entry into force of the right of access, responsibility for training has been largely transferred to
the authorities themselves, although the ICO retains an important role in promotion. Several
private sector organizations, including the CFOI, run courses on data protection, freedom of
information, and other information rights.
334                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      4.4. PROMOTION
      The main mechanism for publicizing the FOIA to the public was the 1996 election and the
      subsequent legislative process itself; these factors made the FOIA a matter of high-profile
      public debate; it was widely covered by the press. The main efforts at promotion occurred
      between 2000–05, principally focused on raising awareness within the government. These
      efforts have continued, mostly under the aegis of the commissioner (who is responsible under
      s47 of the FOIA for promoting the observance of the law within the government) rather than
      the nodal agency.
          Prior to the law’s entry into force, the nodal agency provided training to public authorities
      in cooperation with the ICO and CFOI. This included several “road shows.” At the most senior
      level, they involved ministers visiting authorities to emphasize the need for a positive attitude
      toward meeting FOIA obligations. CSOs reported that ministers responsible for promoting the
      FOIA, especially the Lord Chancellor, were extremely positive but lacked strong across-the-
      board support within the cabinet; they suggested that the FOIA had a few strong supporters
      and opponents, but that most ministers “remained quiet,” refusing to commit themselves one
      way or another.68 At the official level, these road shows involved the provision of some training,
      familiarization, and—above all—encouragement to authorities that they engage in more train-
      ing of their staff in FOIA-relevant responsibilities. Such training, specific to the organizational
      context of each authority, included efforts at raising awareness and effecting cultural change
      within the public service.
          However, a lack of widespread support within the cabinet proved particularly significant
      after the decision to shift to the “big bang.” It introduced an unanticipated delay between
      the provision of training and the enforcement of the FOIA’s access provisions, demoralizing
      the supportive constituency of trained officers among public authorities that had been built
      in anticipation of an early entry into force. It also exacerbated the natural tendency of orga-
      nizations to lose expertise in areas that are inactive or that are not part of ongoing business
      priorities. An example is the loss of staff with experience and training because of transfers into
      positions with different responsibilities. Some interviewees implied that the eventual entry into
      force of the access provisions arrested this loss of expertise, particularly among authorities that
      received sufficient requests to build up and maintain in-house expertise.
          There are no central records on the number of staff trained during this period; the costs of
      training were met from existing budgets.


      4.5. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
      Prior to the FOIA, the systematic management of records was governed largely by the Public
      Records Act 1958, which covers the management and storage of records that will eventually
      be transferred to The National Archives. This law only applies to some of the records public
      authorities produce in the course of their activities and, outside its requirements, the effec-
      tiveness of records management systems varied considerably from authority to authority. The
      implementation of the FOIA developed in parallel with efforts to improve record management
      systems, and the two initiatives fed off each other in a number of ways.
          Effective records management was widely recognized as a precondition for an effective
      FOIA regime. The government’s white paper had included a commitment to impose obliga-
      tions on authorities to improve records management in line with “best practice guidance.”69 This
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                     335




was eventually operationalized in the form of a goal to implement governmentwide electronic
records management by 2004 and with the inclusion of section 46 in the FOIA, which requires the
government to develop a code of practice for records management. This code was developed
and is maintained by The National Archives (the lead agency for records management in the
United Kingdom), in cooperation with the Information Commissioner. It covers both the manage-
ment of records held by authorities subject to the FOIA during their useful life and the transfer of
records to the public archives covered by the Public Records Act 1958.
     Public authorities meet the costs of records management and FOIA compliance from within
existing budgets. Concerns about the FOIA’s implementation costs were, in part, addressed with
the claim that they would be offset by savings gained through more effective records manage-
ment. The experience of the police suggests that, in practice, these cost savings may not be
realized, a conclusion also supported by interviewees from The National Archives.70 There are
several reasons for this. Authorities that handle sensitive requests require records management
systems and coordination mechanisms that cover the creation, storage, indexing, and—when
appropriate—the destruction of records and that will withstand public scrutiny.71 Establishing
such systems or strengthening existing arrangements so that these goals are achieved usually
costs money and, historically, authorities have usually considered good records management
as an overhead cost rather than as a benefit in its own right. The interviewees from the National
Archives suggested that effective records management tends to exist at agencies dependent
on accurate records to conduct core business and at which missing or inaccurate records are
likely to be identified as a problem in the normal course of business.72 They also suggested that
this view of records management as an overhead cost explains why, historically, only the larger
authorities have put in place dedicated records managers.73

4.6. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Technological change has been a driver of information policy in the United Kingdom since the
1970s; several interviewees expressed the belief that the FOIA was motivated in part by a real-
ization that the Internet was changing social expectations about the availability of government
information.74 This was reflected in the parallel efforts discussed above to improve electronic
records management.
     Despite this, the law only makes passing reference to information technology or the “digi-
tal revolution” (for example, s8, which stipulates that electronic requests cannot be rejected
simply because they are electronic; and s11, which states that authorities should make reason-
able efforts to provide information in the form the requester prefers). Detailed engagement
with the potential for greater use of information technology appears to have occurred princi-
pally as a part of the reform to records management discussed above.
     Under the banner of its “Transparency Agenda,” the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition elected in 2010 has sought to use information technology as a tool for public sector
accountability and as a driver of public sector reform. Its Protection of Freedoms Bill, which
was passed by the House of Lords in late 2011, amends the FOIA to insert an explicit right to
many types of public data sets (aggregate numeric data held in electronic form). The coalition
has also mandated the online publication of a great deal of information about public sector
spending, salaries, and contracts, and is supporting efforts to publish data in comparable,
interoperable formats and on terms that favor reuse. This is likely to provide additional encour-
agement to authorities to better manage their records, especially those stored as electronic
336                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      databases. It is too early to make any considered judgments on its effects, but the Transpar-
      ency Agenda is supported by a small but active group of CSOs composed of journalists, tech-
      nologists, and FOI campaigners.

      4.7. MONITORING
      The monitoring of compliance with the FOIA is carried out by the Information Commissioner
      and the nodal agency. The ICO discharges its duties in a number of ways. Apart from hearing
      appeals and working with authorities to improve their internal handling processes, it main-
      tains a Web site providing comprehensive documentation, guidance, and model publication
      schemes for various kinds of public authorities. The commissioner also supports research
      into transparency, conducts public information campaigns, and is empowered to report to
      Parliament on issues of concern on an ad hoc basis. To date, these reports have mainly focused
      on issues of surveillance and privacy. But the commissioner also reported to Parliament after
      both instances of the exercise of ministerial veto (discussed below), explaining the decision not
      to appeal for judicial review.
          The nodal agency publishes online quarterly and annual reports that cover activities in
      44 governmental bodies, including all major departments of state and a number of bodies with
      “significant policymaking, regulatory or information-handling functions.”75 The reports cover
      request volumes, outcomes (requests granted in full, partially, or refused, with refusals broken
      down by exemption), and appeals; they are available for every year since 2005. Figures in this
      document are based on these data.



      5. Enforcement
      The FOIA is enforced by the Information Commissioner. The commissioner has the power to
      order authorities to disclose information if a decision was made to withhold it on the basis of
      an exemption subject to a public interest test. This order can be overridden by a ministerial
      veto, but in the absence of this failure to comply with the commissioner’s decision renders the
      authority liable to being found in contempt of court under s54.
          Enforcement was a significant point of debate during the drafting of the FOIA. The main
      question was whether the final decision to release information should be made by an indepen-
      dent Information Commissioner or a cabinet minister. Ministerial concerns over this issue were
      arguably among the main reasons why the United Kingdom was so late in passing legislation:
      opposition to the idea of an access law among senior politicians was often justified on the
      grounds that it would empower judges to overrule ministers on fundamentally political matters
      for which ministers were normatively responsible to Parliament and accountable to the elec-
      torate. This concern was reflected in parliamentary debates, during which it was argued that
      ministers should retain the ultimate authority on what should be released in order to uphold
      parliamentary supremacy. Behind this argument was the idea that the public had elected its
      government to govern, with the implication that elected officials should not be beholden to
      the whims of unelected appointees whether they be judges or quasi-judicial figures (like infor-
      mation commissioners). Critics countered that the absence of independent review would make
      ministers into judges for their own cause and allow governments to identify their own electoral
      interests as “the public interest.”76
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                    337




     In an attempt to reconcile these competing concerns, the draft bill sought to protect
ministerial control over information in several ways. For qualified exemptions, it proposed that
authorities should be the final arbiters of whether or not disclosure is in the public interest. As
noted above, this proposal was abandoned in the face of criticism, and the application of the
public interest test was made subject to the adjudication of the Information Commissioner. As
an alternative mechanism for protecting political considerations, the government proposed
a power of veto over ICO decisions to override authorities’ public interest assessments. This
proposed veto was originally available to all elected bodies at both the local and central levels,
but the final bill provided only for a ministerial veto (under s53), the use of which is subject to
judicial review.77 At least one interviewee suggested that this may have been the government’s
desired outcome all along, and that the original expansive veto proposal was merely a gambit
made in anticipation of heated debate.78
     Even in its restricted form, the veto proposal was controversial. The CFOI feared that it
might undermine the law entirely by becoming the main means of resisting politically unwel-
come disclosures.79 The government responded to these concerns during parliamentary
debates by agreeing that the veto should be exercised by cabinet—not individual—ministers.80
In the end, the veto has rarely been used, despite the many decisions by the commissioner
and the tribunal that the government “cannot have liked,”81 including two decisions to protect
cabinet papers and one to protect the names of the private staff of MPs. Judicial review was
not sought in any of these cases. While on paper the veto appears to weaken the law substan-
tially, the very rarity of its use suggests that its effects may not be quite as serious as feared.
The veto is politically costly since its use amounts to an open admission by the cabinet as a
whole that the law is being temporarily suspended, leaving the cabinet open to accusations of
resisting democratic accountability for political gain.

5.1. THE APPEALS PROCESS
There is a five-step process for appealing refusals to disclose information under the FOIA,
(figure 1). The first step is to request that the authority concerned reconsider its decision. The
procedures for this vary from authority to authority and are regulated by the FOIA only to the
extent that the code of practice issued under s45 specifies general principles to be followed.
Under s50(2)(a), the commissioner is allowed to refuse to accept a complaint if it appears that
this remedy has not been exhausted. The ICO reports that this relative lack of legal speci-
ficity as compared with provisions covering responses to initial requests and subsequent
appeals has sometimes been a source of difficulty for requesters because it allows authori-
ties who want to withhold information in specific cases to significantly delay the resolution
of disputes.82
     The second step is to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner whose powers
vary depending on the specific exemptions invoked by the authority; this is discussed earlier.
     The third step involves appealing decisions by the Information Commissioner to the Infor-
mation Rights Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body specializing in RTI in the first tier of the United
Kingdom’s system of administrative tribunals. Cases are heard by panels appointed by the Lord
Chancellor composed of a tribunal judge and two members from outside the legal community.
     The fourth step is to appeal the tribunal’s decisions on questions of law and, in certain
circumstances, to request a judicial review of ministerial decisions; these appeals are heard
by the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal.83 Appeals against ministerial

      certificates issued on grounds of national security under ss23–4 and those issued in response
      to the commissioner’s decisions are automatically heard by the Administrative Appeals
      Chamber rather than by the Information Rights Tribunal. The government has not yet relied on
      certificates under s23 or s24.84
          The fifth and final step is to appeal the decision of the Administrative Appeals Chamber with
      the Court of Appeal. The final two steps differ from the first three in that their processes are far
      more formal and legalistic; steps 1–3 usually involve less formal and more requester-friendly pro-
      cedures. The two final steps also differ from the first three in that their decisions constitute bind-
      ing legal precedents. Decisions at all levels of this appeals hierarchy are, however, increasingly
      treated as de facto precedents by many stakeholders, including the Information Commissioner.

      5.2. SANCTIONS
      The Information Commissioner’s coercive powers are extensive from an international perspec-
      tive, but they are not unique. By virtue of s52, she can make binding recommendations that
      documents be released. As in Ireland and Slovenia, these decisions are binding in the sense
      that failure to comply with one is considered a criminal offense or contempt of court, depend-
      ing on the circumstances. This differs from laws overseen by ombudsmen who usually only
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                 339




have oversight authority allowing them only to make recommendations.85 The commissioner is
also more powerful than a parliamentary commissioner for administration in the sense that she
is empowered to undertake own-motion reviews rather than being restricted to investigating
issues that are brought to her attention through complaints.
     There was a general consensus among interviewees and in the secondary literature that
the ICO was better prepared for some aspects of the FOIA than it was for others and that its
performance has improved with time. The most serious problem in the immediate aftermath of
the entry into force of the right to request documents in 2005 was the lengthy delays in exam-
ining complaints and issuing decision notices.86 One study by the CFOI suggested that some
cases took more than four years to resolve.
     The delays within the ICO undermined the law in several significant ways. They diminished
the commissioner’s authority when dealing with underperforming public authorities. Authori-
ties who wanted to avoid their responsibilities could effectively secure a temporary exemption
by delaying their own responses as long as possible. They could then rely on further delays
within the ICO, so that, in some instances, information could be withheld for years. In many
cases, this was not much different than an outright exemption, especially if a request was made
by a member of the press or was for politically sensitive information. In 2010, the commissioner
increased the number of staff dedicated to resolving appeals and reported that the number
of open cases dropped significantly, especially among those that had been open for more
than six months.87 Because it is now routine for cases to be resolved within six months, public
authorities are under greater pressure to handle requests in a more timely and positive fashion
and cannot excuse their complacency by blaming the ICO.
     Several factors contributed to these delays. One was the “big bang”—the decision to
introduce access rights across the public sector on a single date rather than in a phased man-
ner as originally planned, resulting in a build-up of demand and ensuring that the ICO received
a large number of complaints in a single burst. Another factor was that the ICO was arguably
under-resourced and unable to allocate sufficient staff to handle the load.88
     Another contributing factor was that early complaints were complex in unanticipated
ways.89 In the lead-up to January 1, 2005, the ICO had made considerable efforts at developing
guidance and policy on the interpretation of exemptions. It had assumed, partially because of
its prior experience administering the DPA, that applications would consist of a neat bundle of
papers containing the disputed information and a summary of the authority’s reasons justifying
the refusal to disclose.
     Many early disputes focused on whether or not the authority actually held the informa-
tion in question. This has been an ongoing problem because, quite understandably, many
requesters do not know exactly how authorities internally operate or manage records. In
some cases, requesters ask for documents that exist and are readily communicable; in oth-
ers, information might exist in some form but is not readily available. Since the FOIA provides
access only to documents already in existence, the process of matching requesters’ expecta-
tions with the operating structures and records management processes of authorities has
proved challenging.
     Aside from the initial problems with delays, CSOs and public authorities also identified
problems with the way the ICO prioritized and handled different cases. The CFOI suggested
that the ICO erred in the first few months by focusing almost exclusively on failures to meet
time limits and disputes over whether or not information was held; decision notices on sub-
stantive policy matters were not issued for almost a year, resulting in neither requesters nor
340                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      authorities receiving guidance on how to handle borderline cases for a long time. Many early
      decision notices were not helpful because they recited legal provisions without providing full
      and informative expositions of the reasons behind the commissioner’s decision.90 The tribunal,
      in its criticism of this, claimed that it hampered the commissioner’s appellate function and
      reduced the usefulness of his decisions as precedent. Strictly speaking, the commissioner’s
      decisions are not precedents in that they are not binding on future decisions, but they are
      effectively treated as such by many in the requester community and among concerned authori-
      ties until overruled by the tribunal.
           A second complaint involved the perception that the commissioner tends to provide full
      decision notices only when overturning a decision by an agency, resolving instances of uphold-
      ing agency decisions informally with the requesters to ensure that the requests or appeals are
      simply withdrawn. This issue was identified by the Association of Chief Police Officers as prob-
      lematic because it contributed to a relative lack of jurisprudence in support of an authority’s
      decision to employ particular exemptions.91 The ICO has acknowledged that this is a problem
      but questioned its seriousness given the considerable amount of other guidance it has pro-
      duced for authorities.92 Dispute resolution procedures, if employed at all, are informal because
      complainants and authorities alike often want expedited rather than formal resolutions, and
      these are more cost-effective for the commissioner. The ICO has attempted to address agency
      concerns by employing a better triage system: informal resolution is employed early to elimi-
      nate straightforward cases and to identify those that require more detailed consideration (and
      that will be subject to formal notices).93



      6. Compliance
      6.1. PROACTIVE PUBLICATION
      Public authorities published a considerable amount of information prior to the FOIA, but
      responsibility for selecting what would be published, cataloged, and archived usually rested
      with the authority concerned. One study found that approximately 20 percent of administra-
      tive publications were produced by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO); and the remainder
      was mainly produced by ministries, departments, NDPBs, and other organizations (such as the
      British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC], British Library, and Central Office of Information).94 The
      total number of non-HMSO publications produced was 20,000 annually for the central govern-
      ment and approximately 2,500 for the local government.
           The FOIA seeks to encourage authorities to proactively publish more information and to
      do so in a more systematic manner, principally through ss19–20, which mandates every public
      authority to adopt a scheme for the proactive publication of information that is approved by
      the Information Commissioner. Apparently, the drafters of the FOIA intended for publication
      schemes and the right to request documents to form a virtuous cycle: publication schemes
      would inform the public of the information they had a right to expect as a matter of course,
      which would thereby help to identify the kinds of information that would require explicit
      requests. Meanwhile, requests would help authorities identify the types of unpublished infor-
      mation that their stakeholders considered valuable and that might be proactively published.
           There has been a distinct convergence in the publication schemes that authorities have
      adopted, partly because of the actions of the ICO. This occurred in three phases. In the years
      after the passage of the FOIA, tailored publication schemes were developed for many different
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                     341




types of authorities. After some time, it became clear that most of these schemes were dealing
with seven basic kinds of information; more recent efforts have focused on developing a smaller
suite of schemes for adoption across a wider range of authorities covering: (1) organizational
structure and constitutional and legal governance; (2) projected and actual income and expendi-
ture, tendering, procurement, and contracts; (3) strategy and performance, plans, assessments,
inspections, and reviews; (4) policy proposals and decisions, decision-making processes, internal
criteria and procedures, and consultations; (5) current written protocols for delivering functions
and responsibilities; (6) information held in registers as required by law and others relating to
the functions of the authority; and (7) advice and guidance, booklets and leaflets, transactions,
and media releases on the services and activities of the authority. The third phase, which is now
beginning under the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat government’s transparency agenda,
focuses on the proactive publication of public sector data sets (that is, standardized, factual non-
personal data that are stored in electronic form). This is being centrally coordinated though the
Cabinet Office, but amendments to the FOIA that are currently before Parliament would provide
a right of access to data sets held by any public authority.
      Evidence of compliance with proactive publication schemes is patchy, and it is difficult to
draw any firm conclusions from it. There is a high level of compliance with the requirement to
adopt a scheme, but evidence of impact or effectiveness is lacking. This is partly because these
schemes are intended to preclude the need for members of the public to formally request
information, and there are no systematic statistics on how many people access published
documents. The ICO reports that it receives very few complaints about publication schemes,
although it is not clear whether this is indicative of general public satisfaction with the schemes
or of a lack of awareness of their existence.95
      Anecdotal and circumstantial evidence suggest that implementation was not always as
thorough as it might have been. It appears that many authorities were slow to realize the
potential of the Internet as a means of meeting their obligations under these schemes. The
ICO suggests that this may have been the result of a widespread institutional separation
between business units responsible for IT and FOIA requests.96 This has gradually changed;
it is possible that the availability of information would have improved even without the FOIA
simply because of technological change.97 At present, the ICO reports that the major ongoing
problem with publication schemes is a failure to publish up-to-date material.
      On the other hand, it seems the drafters’ goal of establishing a virtuous circle between
publication schemes and the right of access has been realized to some extent. Pressure from
CSOs has encouraged the proactive, routine publication of some information that was initially
handled on a case-by-case basis.98 A prominent example of this is salary information for offi-
cials employed by local authorities who earn more than £100,000; the central government is in
the process of extending this requirement to salaries of more than £68,000.

6.2. REQUESTS AND RESPONSIVENESS
The nodal agency publishes quarterly and annual statistics covering approximately 40 depart-
ments of state and other monitored bodies with “significant policymaking, regulatory or
information-handling functions.”99 The Statistics cover requests to which authorities would not
have responded except for the existence of the FOIA (so-called “nonroutine requests); they
provide details on response times, outcomes, fees, exemptions, internal reviews, and appeals
to the commissioner. The distinction between routine and nonroutine requests is a matter of
interpretation left to the authorities concerned.
342                                        RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      FIGURE 2. Combined FOIA and EIR Requests per Quarter100




          According to these data, requests were at their highest immediately after the FOIA entered
      into force: in Q1 2005, almost 8,000 requests were made to departments of state and almost
      6,000 to other monitored bodies, reflecting pent-up demand, due in part to the “big bang.”
      The number of requests to departments of state dropped to about 4,000 during the following
      quarter, and has grown steadily—if unevenly—since; as of Q4 2010, it stands at just less than
      7,000 per quarter. Requests to other monitored bodies stabilized at approximately 4,000 per
      quarter in early 2007.101
          Data through 2010 (the most recent available from the MOJ) suggest that between three-
      quarters and nine-tenths of all requests receive a response within the required time frame and
      that performance has improved in recent years (figure 3). Just more than half of all requests




      FIGURE 3. Outcome of Resolvable Requests, 2010102
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                       343




FIGURE 4. Exemptions Invoked in Withholding Information in Full, 2010103




are granted in full, a quarter are refused in full, and the remainder are partially granted or were
still under consideration at the time the data were collected. The most common exemption
(by a substantial margin) invoked when partly or fully refusing information was that the request
pertained to third-party personal data.104 Appeals to the ICO have increased steadily since
2005, but appeals to higher authorities have remained constant at roughly 20 percent of refus-
als (figure 4).
      It is difficult to make any firm claims about the identity of users. Part of the reason for this
is that the commissioner and the tribunal have ruled that a request for information should
be considered without reference to the identity of the requester or the reasons behind the
request.105 Even if this were not the rule, questions of identity are difficult to resolve because
distinctions between individual citizens, members of campaign organizations, and members
of the press are not always easy to draw. Further, such distinctions are not always informative:
request volumes are so small that even minor shifts in behavior can alter results from year to
year and across different parts of government. A comparison with the early years of imple-
mentation in other similar countries (such as Canada, Ireland, and Australia) suggests that the
United Kingdom’s law is average in terms of use.106 In all cases, the percentage of the overall
population making nonroutine requests for nonpersonal information is tiny: 0.06 percent on
average for the United Kingdom between 2005–07; 0.21 percent in Australia in the equivalent
three years (1982–84); and 0.01 percent in Canada. The consensus among those interviewed
was that three types of requesters (individuals, members of organizations, and the press) are
responsible for roughly a third of requests each. Attempts to back up these assumptions with
hard evidence (through surveys of requesters) have not proved successful, partly due to low
response rates.107
      There are no centralized data on the types of information being requested; data are only
provided on the proportion of requests received by each authority (figure 5).
      Among all monitored bodies, 86 percent of requests are handled within the 20-day dead-
line, and 91 percent within the permitted deadline or with a permitted extension. Overall, the
performance of the departments of state is slightly worse than other monitored bodies: 83 per-
cent of the state departments met the 20-day deadline as opposed to 91 percent of the other
bodies; 88 percent of the state departments met the permitted deadline compared to 95 per-
cent for the other monitored bodies. The 10 best-and worst-performing monitored bodies, as
measured by the total number of requests met within the deadline and permitted extensions,
are shown in figure 6. For clarity, mid-range performers have been omitted.

      FIGURE 6. Percentage of Requests Met within Permitted Timeframe109




          With certain exceptions, FOIA compliance across different authorities varies primarily with
      regard to the volume of requests received by authorities, the resources allocated to handling
      them, and the attitudes of senior officials toward the value of proactive stakeholder relations
      management. These three factors are frequently interrelated: authorities that receive a large
      number of requests experience greater pressure to establish dedicated units for handling
      them. When the high volume of requests is due to the sensitivity and political interest of the
      information held by the authority—as in the case of police services—the business impera-
      tive to establish robust handling procedures is greater.110 Major exceptions to this are central
      government departments primarily responsible for handing sensitive political issues and
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                345




FIGURE 7. Requests Met within Extended Time Frame by Several Central Departments111




coordinating whole-of-government policy, especially the Cabinet Office and the treasury. For
example, the Cabinet Office has signed an undertaking with the ICO, an act that has been
widely recognized as a reprimand for its poor performance in meeting its obligations under
the FOIA.112
    The Ministry of Defense (MOD) was one of the best performers in the early years of the
FOIA as measured by the number of requests fulfilled within required time frames; the good
performance may have been to compensate for the many areas of its work in which informa-
tion cannot be disclosed for reasons of national security and defense. Recently, however, the
MOD’s performance has declined; it has signed an undertaking of its own with the ICO.113 By
contrast, the Department of Health was a poor performer initially, but its performance has
shown recent improvement, due in great part to the considerable efforts by the ICO to help
the department improve its internal processes. Response rates for these two authorities are
shown in figure 7.



7. ATI and Accountability
The general consensus in the academic literature and among interviewees is that the United
Kingdom’s FOIA, despite some early problems relating to delays and weak enforcement,
has been reasonably successful in achieving its immediate aim of improving transparency
and thereby of strengthening accountability. Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide concrete
evidence of this positive effect without resorting to anecdote, as the only major study of the
impact of the FOIA notes.114
    Several of the interviewees pointed to the 2009–10 parliamentary expenses scandal as
evidence of the FOIA’s potential to improve overall accountability.115 Several MPs have been
charged, reprimanded, or suspended over claims they made illegal or unethical claims under
the parliamentary expenses system. Data on expenses were originally sought through a
series of FOI requests lodged by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and investigative
346                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      journalists. They were resisted by Parliament for a considerable period; they were even the
      focus of an unsuccessful attempt in 2007 to amending the FOIA to exempt the material. Even-
      tually, the information was leaked to the Telegraph newspaper, not released under the FOIA,
      but the leak only occurred after the information tribunal had ruled that the information would
      have to be released to the requesters. Thus, it seems reasonable to attribute the release of
      parliamentary expenses data and the subsequent scandal to the FOIA.
          A further difficulty in assessing the effects of the FOIA is that its most beneficial effects
      may lie in its encouragement of officials to anticipate being held accountable, altering their
      behavior so that retrospective accountability is not necessary. This effect is likely to manifest
      itself in ways that are difficult to measure with standard techniques like media content analysis
      and statistical analysis of request data; two examples cited by interviewees may illustrate
      the point.
       • Prior to the 1990s, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food was regularly criticized
         in the press and by NGOs for its pervasive secrecy and tendency to favor producer groups
         over public interests. As of 2001, this ministry no longer exists; its functions have been
         transferred to a range of other authorities responsible for food standards and environmen-
         tal protection. The immediate catalyst for this was the inability of the ministry to satisfacto-
         rily handle an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Along with its dissolution, debates over
         its secrecy and poor decision-making have vanished from political discourse.
       • Similar changes have occurred in nuclear safety,116 not only an example of retrospective
         accountability as an identifiable actor, but as a tool for profound structural transforma-
         tion designed to prevent mistakes from occurring in the first place. This is achieved by
         transforming the nature and identity of the responsible parties; in other words, retrospec-
         tive accountability becomes unnecessary by ensuring that correct decisions are made at
         the outset.



      8. Analysis
      ATI is a broad policy with several stakeholders whose interests could influence its implementa-
      tion. This section discusses the influence of several stakeholder groups that were influential in
      the drafting of the FOIA.

      8.1. POLITICIANS
      The single most influential stakeholders in the establishment of the FOIA were politicians,
      especially senior members from the two main political parties. Their support remains a crucial
      factor in its ongoing development in that high-profile instances of ministerial refusal to disclose
      information are often politically motivated or widely understood to be so while proposals to
      extend access often have advocates or supporters at the political level because of their elec-
      toral appeal. Both attitudes flow from the structure of the Westminster system, which central-
      izes both political and administrative authority in the cabinet, thereby giving senior political
      figures a great deal of influence over both the law and the behavior of the bureaucracy. This
      system also centralizes electoral accountability in the same group, providing a complex set of
      incentives to control the distribution of official information; sometimes this aligns in favor of
      the right to full access, sometimes it encourage opposition to it.117
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                      347




8.2. BUREAUCRATS
Prior to the 1990s, the civil service was widely seen as the most consistent source of opposition
to the FOIA. Some commentators see all bureaucracies as inherently secretive (for organiza-
tional reasons first systematically laid out by Max Weber),118 but a close examination of the
British case suggests that a more nuanced explanation is warranted.
     One reason for traditional bureaucratic opposition is the combination of a highly politi-
cized executive and a permanent civil service. Ministers and civil servants alike have an interest
in ensuring a neutral civil service capable of providing independent policy advice. Official
secrecy supports this interest by ensuring that individual civil servants are not publicly associ-
ated with particular policy positions, thus able to present themselves as nonpartisan advisors
to successive ministers.119 Ministerial desire to preserve this source of confidential advice was
directly linked to the refusal to introduce access rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.120
     Official secrecy is not a necessary outcome of bureaucracy; it is instead affected by politi-
cal concerns, suggested by the fact that the attitudes of the most senior civil servants have
changed over time. The First Division Association121 affiliated itself with the CFOI in 1984—
the first occasion it had chosen to align itself with any external group. This was apparently
intended to publicly signal that it was not interested in maintaining secrecy for its own sake
but only because it protected the bureaucracy’s capacity to provide independent and impartial
advice to ministers.122 It is no coincidence that the decision to affiliate itself with CFOI occurred
at a time when the politicization of the civil service attributable to Mrs. Thatcher’s reforms was
a matter of public debate.
     Bureaucratic tendencies toward secrecy have been mitigated by the profound structural
reforms put in place by the Major and Blair governments: the introduction of performance
management and the “Third Way” reforms under the New Labour Party. These provide incen-
tives to authorities with managerial independence to build constituencies among their stake-
holders as a means of improving their own legitimacy and influence within government. These
external incentives have proved to be a major incentive for openness, perhaps even more than
the FOIA, and are partly responsible for the “sea-change” in state-society relations discussed
in section 8.7. “Informal Norms.”

8.3. CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS
Despite their active lobbying for its establishment, all CSOs have not found the FOIA useful. It
appears to be most helpful to NGOs for whom the preservation of a close, cooperative work-
ing relationship with government officials is not a high priority.123 This includes NGOs seeking
the disclosure of information that the government is expected to resist or whose goals place
them in an inherently adversarial relationship with government. Campaign organizations with
objectives that are controversial in society at large were mentioned by many interviewees as
prominent users of the law, notably Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Campaign Against
the Arms Trade, animal welfare groups, and public interest groups interested in combating
(real or perceived) agency capture by industry groups.124 Official interviewees at national and
local levels suggested that these groups rely on the FOIA because they are unable to develop
the kinds of ongoing cooperative relationships that might provide opportunities for informal
disclosure of official information. They also suggested that groups interested in establishing
cooperative relations, such as those with an interest in ongoing influence over policy develop-
ment or implementation, might find recourse with the FOIA counterproductive inasmuch as it
348                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      would be perceived an unnecessarily adversarial act by officials or at the very least as evidence
      of the absence or breakdown of the type of cooperative exchanges that these groups probably
      want to establish.125

      8.4. MEDIA
      Historically, the press was one of the most significant organized opponents of official secrecy in
      the United Kingdom.126 This was due in no small part to the OSA effectively criminalizing politi-
      cal reporting for most of the 20th century—a legal technicality that was limited in practice only
      because of a traditional unwillingness of attorneys general to prosecute.
           Despite this, and even with their obvious structural interest in ATI, the media’s use of the
      FOIA has been uneven. Within national media organizations, it appears that the FOIA is used
      intensively by a small group of journalists rather than being embedded in the ongoing prac-
      tices of organizations. This concentrated pattern has become semi-formalized within the large
      newspapers and among broadcasters in the form of FOIA specialists: individuals who develop
      considerable practical expertise, with the support of their managers, and who are expected
      to advise their colleagues in making use of FOIA.127 The knowledge that these individuals
      develop seems to travel with them when they move instead of remaining with the former
      host institution.128
           Outside the major media institutions, there are a small but significant number of freelance
      journalists who make use of the FOIA as a research tool, especially—but not exclusively—at
      the local level.129 The ICO also reported increasing use among the specialist press in the
      health, IT, and police sectors. Local government information officers informally distinguish
      between two types of media requesters.130 The first are investigative journalists who use
      the FOIA as one tool among many to pursue important issues and who produce stories for
      broadsheets or television. Reportedly, information officers view these kinds of requests as an
      inconvenient but legitimate use of the law. Stories based on this approach have often had sig-
      nificant impact: journalists Heather Brooke and Jon Ungoed-Thomas of The Sunday Times and
      Ben Leapman of the Sunday Telegraph requested information about the expense claims of
      14 MPs in 2005; these requests eventually led to the disclosure of the parliamentary expenses
      data discussed above. The second type of requester is the freelance reporter who submits the
      same request to every council, hospital, or police force in the country. Results are then collated
      and used to identify “worst offenders.” Stories based on these data are sold to local or tabloid
      papers to print on “slow news days.” This strategy is viewed much less favorably by informa-
      tion officers since it imposes administrative costs on authorities and undermines trust in public
      authorities without an identifiable benefit in return. On the more general question of their rela-
      tionships with information officers, journalists think that their requests, regardless of content,
      are seen as less legitimate—and certainly more inconvenient— than those from “ordinary”
      members of the public.131
           There has not yet been any comprehensive study of uneven journalistic engagement with
      the FOIA. The interviewees for this study suggested several possibilities. First and foremost,
      journalists are likely to find the law less useful than the average citizen because they are
      interested in politically sensitive information that is explicitly exempted from disclosure or that
      officials are inclined to resist disclosing through procedural means.132 The statutory 20-day
      response time frame is too lengthy for most journalists whose deadlines are measured in
      hours.133 This claim is consistent with the fact that the heaviest journalistic users appear to be
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                    349




those working on longer time frames: investigative journalists, those who use it as their primary
research tool, and those who sell “slow news day” stories. Lack of use may also simply be a
matter of habit: some journalists who might have been willing to make more systematic use of
the law in the early years were discouraged from doing so by the extensive delays; they have
therefore come to rely on their existing contacts.134


8.5. BUSINESS INTERESTS
British businesses were not a major influence on the genesis of the FOIA but were expected to
make use of it after its introduction like their counterparts in the United States.135 As it turned
out, however, business use was initially so low that it surprised some observers. It is now on
the rise, but the rate of use of the law by business is still far lower than in the United States.
Businesses that do make requests appear to be using the law for three purposes:136
 • To obtain background information on tenders, including previous submissions made
   by competitors and background information held by the public authority. Businesses
   appear to be much more reticent to use the law for this purpose than their counterparts in
   the United States. This reticence seems to be motivated by a concern that public officials
   view such requests as an inappropriate use of the law; businesses fear their own submis-
   sions might be considered in a less favorable light if they are identified as requesters,
   despite the fact that any such retaliation would be contrary to the spirit of the law and to
   the commissioner’s guidance. As a result, businesses that use the law in this way often
   make their requests anonymous by directing them through solicitors. Moreover, businesses
   that have made submissions are reluctant to allow details of their contracts and pricing
   information released to competitors. The incidence of so-called reverse-FOIA suits is
   increasing, and local councils have started to adopt the practice of asking successful bid-
   ders to indicate the information they consider to be commercially sensitive.137 Although
   these schedules are not conclusive evidence of sensitivity, they are considered prima facie
   evidence of a belief on the part of the company concerned.
 • To obtain data for resale or reuse at a profit. Government files represent a significant
   potential source of information that firms can process, combine, and republish for profit,
   including maps, legal texts, and statistical data on the natural, economic, and social world.
   The FOIA constitutes one mechanism by which companies gain access to this information,
   particularly when it is not already held by public authorities in a centralized form. One
   example mentioned by several interviewees was requests for the procurement plans of
   public authorities, although officials view these requests are even less favorably than those
   from journalists.138 It is important to recognize that the FOIA has partly driven and partly
   evolved in parallel with efforts to provide access to public sector data on terms favoring
   commercial reuse; the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition is legislating to
   include a “right to data” in the FOIA and has established the principle of publishing gov-
   ernment data sets, salaries, and contracts at central and local levels.
 • Public relations. One particularly interesting recent development is the use of the FOIA
   by companies to provide the factual basis of publicity campaigns. A hypothetical example
   discussed by some interview subjects was using the law to collect data on accidents at
   pedestrian crossings to generate sales of safety equipment. This use does not appear to
   be common; it was mentioned because it was unexpected and rare.

      8.6. FORMAL INSTITUTIONS
      Formal institutions have played an important role in the development and implementation of
      freedom of information in the United Kingdom. The FOIA was not associated with the intro-
      duction of a new set of democratic institutions or even with the radical transformation of an
      existing set: it is part cause and part outcome of an ongoing process of evolution within a
      relatively—but not perfectly—stable political system.
           The United Kingdom’s competitive two-party system contributed decisively to the emer-
      gence of freedom of information as a topic of political debate. Two-party systems are struc-
      turally favorable to electoral competition on the basis of access rights because they feature
      clear lines of electoral responsibility and encourage opposition parties to demonstrate their
      trustworthiness to the electorate by promising to introduce mechanisms to strengthen retro-
      spective sanction voting.139 The politicization of access rights in this way has been a recurring
      pattern in British political life since the early 1970s. Controversy surrounding the use of secrecy
      to prevent reporting and criticism of British involvement in international events such as the
      Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Biafran War in the 1960s eventually led to a comprehensive review
      of the OSA under Lord Franks. This review stopped short of calling for ATI legislation, but
      it opened the door to it by explicitly identifying the Swedish and American laws as possible
      sources of inspiration for reform.140 Controversy surrounding the secret actions of the British
      state abroad continued under both the Thatcher and Major Governments in the 1980s and
      1990s; the 1989 amendments to the OSA were, in part, a response to the failure of high-profile
      prosecutions of public servants who leaked information to the press. The release of the Scott
      Report into the Matrix Churchill affair in 1996 brought the issue to public attention during the
      election that eventually brought the New Labour Party to power and provided Tony Blair with
      the opportunity to compete with the Conservative Party on the issue of trustworthiness by
      promising to combat secrecy and reinforce accountability. In his own words, Matrix Churchill
      made the case for the FOIA “unanswerable.”141 The current Conservative-Liberal Democrat
      Coalition’s “transparency agenda” has been presented in terms that suggest an attempt to
      consolidate electoral support, demonstrating a firmer commitment to retrospective demo-
      cratic accountability than the outgoing New Labour Party government.142
           Precisely because of its clear lines of accountability, however, the two-party system also
      discourages ministers from actually implementing access rights. The difficulty faced by parties
      in balancing the competing imperatives inherent in the party system can be readily seen in
      the New Labour Party’s repeated attempts to back away from its electoral commitments to
      freedom of information—successfully in the 1970s and “unsuccessfully” in the late 1990s. In a
      sense, the very existence of the FOIA is testimony to the fact that the imperatives of electoral
      competition in the United Kingdom can sometimes trump the long-term institutional self-
      interest of those competing.
           The centralization of political and administrative authority in a cabinet exercising decisive
      influence over a parliament that is itself the supreme political institution is also an important
      but complex contributor to access rights. It has reinforced the tendency to politicize access
      rights by encouraging the framing of dissatisfaction with the expansion of the welfare state
      (and the associated expansion of bureaucratic control over information) as a political prob-
      lem best solved through collective political action rather than as an administrative problem
      best solved through the courts (as was the case in Germany and France).143 It simultaneously
      encouraged the executive to exert extremely tight control over the disclosure of all official
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                     351




information: ministerial responsibility for the whole of the state—however imperfect it may be
in practice— implies that all the information about and held by public authorities is potentially
relevant to electoral assessments of government performance.144
     As noted earlier, the civil service has historically been one of the main sources of opposi-
tion to the introduction of access rights. The structural basis for this opposition was substan-
tially transformed by the public sector reforms undertaken by the Thatcher, Major, and Blair
governments. At the risk of grossly oversimplifying an extremely complex and contested
period of political history, this transformation occurred in three stages. Under Margaret
Thatcher, extensive privatization and reinforcement of cabinet control over the parts of the
state that remained in public hands laid the groundwork for reform, despite the PMs personal
opposition to a freedom of information law. The introduction of outcomes frameworks and
performance management and the creation of agencies with focused goals and managerial
autonomy145 separated responsibility for policy development and implementation and estab-
lished structured communication between the two as a basic public sector management tool.
     Under Major, a slight but significant shift in emphasis occurred. His Citizen’s Charter146 rep-
resented an attempt to subject the parts of the state that could not be privatized for whatever
reasons to marketlike pressures by disclosing timely, accurate information about their perfor-
mance to the public, not just to the cabinet. This reform explicitly sought to harness the power
of public opinion by casting citizens as consumers. To that end, it mandated the publication
of information that would allow the public to exercise meaningful choices between different
service providers: charters of service, reports of performance against the outcomes in these
charters, and independent inspection reports by specially established bureaus.147 Major also
introduced a nonstatutory Code of Practice on Access to Official Information designed to
reinforce the devolution of operational responsibility, encourage responsiveness, and facilitate
dispute resolution.148
     The code received a lukewarm reception from civil society, and, looking back, the consen-
sus is that departmental resistance and lack of political support resulted in a low number of
requests and the release of less information than might ideally have occurred.149 Nevertheless,
it represented a major advancement in two respects. It mandated the proactive publication of
a range of information that had previously been kept secret, including the membership of cabi-
net committees, the reasons for administrative decisions, and background information on past
policy decisions. It also included a request mechanism—the first enforceable right of access in
the United Kingdom.150 Thus, it smoothed the way for the eventual introduction of the FOIA by
easing traditionally secretive departments into the idea of establishing a more open relation-
ship with their constituents.151
     The third phase occurred under the Blair government, which introduced the FOIA partly in
fulfillment of long-standing electoral commitments to democratic renewal, and partly because
it formed part of its “Third Way” reform agenda, which relied extensively on distributed public
governance.152 The election of the Conservatives as part of a coalition in 2010 ushered in
yet more proactive disclosure of information as a public sector governance tool, albeit one
with more similarities to the Thatcher and Major approaches than to Blair’s. A public sector
transparency board has been established within the Cabinet Office to drive this transparency
agenda. It is too early to gauge its results but it is clear that the proactive publication of gov-
ernment data sets will be a major emphasis, and an amendment to include a right to data in
the FOIA is currently before Parliament.153

      8.7. INFORMAL NORMS
      Changes in informal norms have affected the implementation of the FOIA on several levels.
      The operation of the FOIA in the United Kingdom has also been facilitated by the widespread
      norm among public servants that their first responsibility is to faithfully carry out their duties
      under the law even when these may prove inconvenient. Several interviewees mentioned that
      majority of public servants seem to approach freedom of information in this manner most of
      the time, with the implication that they comply without being particularly motivated by the
      underlying democratic rationale.154 A study by University College London found no hard evi-
      dence of the so-called chilling effect when officials deliberately alter the records they create or
      refuse to record some decisions in writing to avoid disclosure under the FOIA.155
          In contrast with this duty-based approach, several nongovernment interviewees mentioned
      that the manner in which public organizations respond to requests matter as much or more
      than specific decisions in influencing the perceived success of the law. Requesters, especially
      professionals who make frequent use of the law, expressed more positive views of those
      authorities that were seen to be handling requests promptly, consistently, and fairly, even when
      those authorities rejected specific requests. All parties mentioned delays in responding to
      requests as particularly likely to lead to dissatisfaction; one journalist indicated that, if forced
      to choose, an FOIA that worked quickly but that released less information would probably
      be more useful than one that released more information but did so more slowly.156 This point
      about appearances resonates with a broader point made by the interviewee from the CFOI.
      The CFOI’s training courses often brought together requesters with the officials responsible
      for handling their requests.157 It is apparently quite common for requesters to adopt far more
      positive attitudes about the likelihood of obtaining information after they meet officials who
      are positive about the principle of access even if the officials do not work in the authorities
      receiving their submitted requests.
          At the highest level of abstraction and over the long term, the FOIA is part cause and part
      outcome of a sea change in relations between the British state and its citizens: the develop-
      ment of an “open government.”
          Prior to the late 1970s, these relationships were highly paternalistic and characterized by
      pervasive, selective opacity on the part of the state. Officials sought to maintain control over
      policy development and implementation and were generally reluctant to seriously consult with
      interest groups other than industry and trade unions.158 This closed style of government was
      associated with the tendency of officials to reserve the right to determine what information
      should be disclosed to the public at large; they often actively resisted attempts by journalists,
      NGOs, and citizens alike to obtain it.
          A classic example of this traditional British approach was the regulation of industrial
      production processes.159 Regulators in such areas as pollution control; health and safety
      inspections; and food, medicine, and product safety routinely refused to disclose informa-
      tion like the names of companies they had prosecuted or that were in breach of regulations.
      This was sometimes justified on the grounds that regulators needed to avoid jeopardizing the
      industry’s willingness to share information by exposing regulated companies to the “double
      punishment” of negative publicity. This was clearly an informal norm because regulators were
      empowered through legislation to compel the disclosure of the information required but they
      chose to act as if they had to rely on cooperation.
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM                                                                      353




     By the 1990s, this kind of selective, secretive engagement had virtually disappeared,
although vestiges remained in pockets of the state that were relatively insulated from direct
contact with the public. The prevailing norm is now one of more active engagement and nego-
tiation with a broad range of stakeholder groups and of acceptance at high levels that public
ATI is both legitimate and desirable.
     This newfound openness at the political level has allowed freedom of information to have
a self-reinforcing effect at the lower levels of public service. The existence of a legal rule favor-
ing disclosure allows officials to answer informal requests from and engage in discussion with
external groups much more freely. This is because all parties know that requesters will prob-
ably be able to access information if the matter is put to the test and because the law provides
clear standards for justifying the withholding of genuinely sensitive information if the need
arises. In other words, the law does not just empower requesters; it also makes it easier for
officials engage openly with them when they are so inclined.


9. Conclusion
Overall, it seems reasonable to conclude that the FOIA has achieved modest success in its pri-
mary aim of improving transparency, that is, ensuring the release of information that would not
have been publicly available without it.160 One measure of its success is the degree of consen-
sus among those interviewed, from both government and the various requester communities,
that requesters have been able to obtain information that governments would have preferred
not to disclose (for example, documents relating to policy decisions) or that it actively sought
to withhold (for example, parliamentary expenses). A second measure of its success is that the
FOIA provides a set of rules for conducting disputes over what type of information should be
available, and these rules have generally proved beneficial to requesters. CSOs have also been
able to use requests and appeals to their strategic advantage, and some types of information
the government may not originally have anticipated would be released are now available by
request (for example, some policy-relevant information); others are routinely published despite
early refusals to do so (for example, salary data for local governments).
    This study has identified several contributors to this success. The interviewees frequently
identified institutional contributors. The two most significant of these are the law itself, which
is not perfect but compares favorably against similar laws around the world,161 and the exis-
tence of an information commissioner with strong formal powers. The particular importance of
effective practical oversight and enforcement mechanisms was underscored by the problems
caused by the appeals backlog that built up in the first few years after the law’s implementa-
tion, and by the way this undermined both the commissioner’s moral authority and compliance
within other public authorities. More generally, the prevalence of the rule of law and the rela-
tively high infrastructural capacity of the British state mean that authorities have generally been
able to implement the law within existing resources despite occasional inconveniences. Sec-
ond, the existence of a strong and varied domestic constituency was an essential contributor
to the development, preparation, and the implementation of the FOIA. Repeated requests by
journalists and CSOs, coupled with strategic appeals, have unquestionably led to the proactive
publication of information that was routinely withheld in the first few years. The two examples
discussed in this document are parliamentary expenses data and salaries.
354                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




            Although the FOIA has been reasonably successful in achieving this immediate aim, its
      impact has not been uniform. Information about how much money the government spends,
      for example, is considerably easier to obtain than information about policy discussions,162 even
      though the former was a much less prominent matter of debate in the lead-up to legislation
      than the latter.163 This variability of impact suggests that, rather than radically transforming
      the underlying structure of power in the United Kingdom, the FOIA has been influenced by
      it. The release of spending data is the result of a combination of pressure from CSOs (such as
      the Taxpayer’s Alliance, which was founded in 2005, partly to take advantage of the opportuni-
      ties offered by the FOIA164) and a series of decisions by the commissioner and tribunal that
      have made it more difficult to withhold such information. These changes are exemplified by
      the disclosure of salary information that was initially considered a matter of some sensitivity
      by authorities like the local councils.165 Over time, a consensus has emerged that information
      concerning senior staff salaries is a legitimate matter of public interest, although the scope of
      disclosure varies from authority to authority, with some publishing information on lower officials
      or salaries and others not.166 Many councils proactively publish this information on their Web
      sites now, and the current Conservative government’s transparency agenda has extended this
      still further by mandating the proactive disclosure of all local government spending above
      £500 along with a wide range of data on central government spending. By contrast, policy-
      relevant and politically sensitive information remains a controversial and contested topic, and
      although there have been some gains in this area, not as much of this type of information has
      been released as advocates had initially hoped.
            The introduction of the FOIA was the outcome of several long-term trends in the United
      Kingdom, notably the contradictory nature of party competition and centralization of authority,
      and a slow, ongoing separation of political authority from responsibility for routine adminis-
      trative processes that was occurring in the context of an increasingly mediated and digitized
      society. Together, these suggest a cautious optimism about the prospects for transparency
      over the long term, but its ongoing entrenchment cannot be taken for granted in the short
      term. The principle of ATI will likely remain contested for the foreseeable future, and strong
      transparency mechanisms and a vibrant civil society will continue to be essential guarantors of
      its development.

            “You idiot. You naive, foolish, irresponsible nincompoop. There is really no description of stupidity,
            no matter how vivid, that is adequate. I quake at the imbecility of it,” in Tony Blair, A Journey

      48.   The Lord Chancellor is one of the “Great Officers of State.” These Officers have existed for centuries,
            and were originally Ministers of the Crown (that is, ministers appointed by the monarch, as opposed
            to cabinet ministers who held office by virtue of winning an election under the modern parliamentary
            system). Several Great Officers still exist today, but most now have only ceremonial functions. The
            position of Lord Chancellor is distinctive, in that it has become a cabinet position with responsibility
            for the administration of the courts and the legal system. The position is distinct from the Secretary of
            State for Justice, although both positions were held by Jack Straw under New Labour and both are
            also held by his Conservative successor Kenneth Clarke.
      49.   The original nodal agency was the Lord Chancellor’s Department, which was responsible for
            administering the courts and judicial system. This was merged into the Department of Constitutional
            Affairs in June 2003, which was renamed the Ministry of Justice in 2007 following the transfer of
            responsibility for probation, prisons and prevention of reoffending from the Home Office. These

                   Implementing Right to Information
                                  Part 2 Introduction
A second round of four indicator-driven case studies was conducted in 2014 under the direc-
tion of Stephanie E. Trapnell. As part of the project design, indicators were discussed, vet-
ted, and revised by researchers involved in the project so that the indicators could be used
to guide data collection for the case studies. The indicators were intended to capture key
features of agency practices, monitoring and oversight arrangements, enabling environments,
and performance data.
    Variables for investigation were selected based on an understanding of RTI systems as

1. embedded in public administration functions at the agency or ministry level,

2. requiring centralized government oversight of implementation processes and compliance
   with legal mandates and a multi-level, accessible process for grievance redress, and

3. part of an ecosystem of transparency and accountability that includes actors from politics,
   the public sector, civil society, media, and the private sector.

   Case studies are organized into several sections that move from the legal framework
and monitoring arrangements, to agency-level practices, and ending with the enabling
environment.
 • Legal framework and compliance is about the RTI laws and decrees and the extent
   of implementation from a national perspective: Scope of coverage, Exemptions and
   Balancing tests, Information requests, Appeals and Sanctions, Monitoring and oversight
   arrangements, Proactive disclosure
 • Agency practices are those activities, processes, and procedures that support RTI func-
   tions within an agency: Leadership, Human resources, Performance monitoring systems,
   Responsiveness, Records Management, Budget, Training and public outreach
 • Capacity and influence of civil society is an important supporting factor that operates
   from outside government: Individual citizen involvement/demand for RTI, Civil Society
   Organizations, Media, Private sector
 • Broader political environment frames the context of RTI implementation and influences it
   in both direct and indirect ways: Political will, Open government efforts, Governance as it
   relates to RTI




                                                                                                 361

          Although a pilot set of indicators served as the frame for investigation, not all aspects of
      RTI implementation are captured through indicators. In particular, indicators are not designed
      to capture the complexities of causal mechanisms (i.e., why? why not? how?). Indicators and
      related data points simplify a complex reality. In-depth examination of causal mechanisms,
      however, requires investigation of the reasons for indicator values, Comprehensive case stud-
      ies such as those undertaken for this project help to explain the complexity of relationships,
      behaviors, and contextual constraints in RTI implementation.
                                                                                                363

                     A Case Study of Jordan

1. Introduction and Findings
1.1. INTRODUCTION
Jordan adopted the Law on Securing Access to Information (LSAI) in 2007, after other legis-
lation had been passed to promote greater openness and improve competition in specific
sectors, such as communications and the media. The involvement of different stakeholders was
limited during the passage of the LSAI, but since its adoption, many civil society organizations
(CSOs) have emerged as the main actors working to raise awareness of the access to informa-
tion (ATI) law and monitor its implementation by public agencies. Many observers considered
this an opportunity to modernize the State, enhance respect for human rights and promote the
accountability of public institutions.
     The Official Communiqués of successive Prime Ministers asking public institutions to
implement the LSAI prove that this exercise is incomplete. These executive orders show how
difficult it is to enforce the ATI law in the absence of a central independent agency in charge
of the implementation and monitoring of the LSAI. Moreover, the LSAI gave the Information
Commissioner (ICO) legal responsibility only for the information produced and archived by his
department, thereby significantly limiting the scope of his powers.
     Jordan amended its Constitution in 2011 and integrated into it some specific reforms
under the influence of the developments that were taking place in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region. The reforms did not proclaim ATI even though some CSOs were
demanding for the adoption of ATI in the Constitution. On the other hand, the Council Of
Ministers (COM) introduced amendments to the LSAI in 2012, though they have not yet been
adopted by the Parliament. Many CSOs are asking for greater reform that will entail significant
amendments to the LSAI or the adoption of a new law on ATI in line with international stan-
dards and best practices.
     This case study will focus on the implementation of the LSAI by the Ministry of Agriculture
and the Ministry of Environment. These examples will help to highlight the progress and limita-
tions of LSAI implementation at the agency level, and to identify some general trends that
could help in an analysis of the level of compliance of public agencies with ATI legislation.

          The significant changes happening in the MENA region, and the membership of Jordan in
      new voluntary initiatives, such as the Open Government Partnership, should empower the gov-
      ernment and different stakeholders, especially those involved in the governance and account-
      ability sectors, to look forward and propose new reforms that will improve the pace of reforms
      in Jordan. The efficient implementation of ATI would be a significant step in that direction.

      1.2. FINDINGS: DRIVERS OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE
      Jordan passed the first ATI law in the MENA region in 2007. The law did not take into con-
      sideration different international standards and best practices to ensure its successful imple-
      mentation and effective access to information for citizens. Various aspects of the LSAI and its
      implementation are considered as drivers of failure. These include:
       • The absence of a central independent agency to support implementation of the LSAI and
         monitor its enforcement by public agencies.
       • The dependence of the ICO on the Information Council (IC) and its Chair, the Ministry of
         Culture, makes this agency’s mandate very limited. It limits the capacity of the ICO to chal-
         lenge the Executive and pressure public agencies to implement the LSAI.
       • The ICO is the head of the National Library; he is responsible for the information kept in
         this department and not the information kept in other public agencies. His decisions are
         not binding for other public agencies.
       • The process of classification and categorization of information at the agency level was
         launched only in 2012, after the majority of public agencies had ignored this LSAI require-
         ment for more than 5 years.
       • There is no use of new information and communication technologies in processing
         requests for information. A citizen wanting public information has to go to the specific
         agency and fill in a form (if it exists) to request it.
       • The details and personal data required from individuals requesting information can dis-
         suade them from presenting requests for information.
       • The Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Documents (1979) covers the secrecy of
         public information, and this has constituted a serious obstacle to the implementation of
         the LSAI. Other existing legislation also hinders implementation of the LSAI such as the
         Law on publications and the press code.
       • The absence of sanctions in the LSAI has contributed to the current weak compliance,
         as there are no consequences for public officials and agencies that ignore the law’s
         requirements.
       • The broad scope and use of exemptions and the limited success in processing appeals
         limit the use of the LSAI.
       • The High Court of Justice is the last recourse for appeals against decisions pertaining to
         ATI. Giving the High Court of Justice this responsibility constitutes a serious challenge to
         ATI because of the nature of the Court and the costs that it involves to appeal the deci-
         sions of public agencies.

   Some positive aspects arising from the Jordanian context are considered drivers for suc-
cess. These include:
 • A vibrant and active civil society has started focusing its advocacy on ATI and has
   conducted monitoring exercises to determine the extent to which the LSAI is being
   implemented.
 • The membership of Jordan in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) has already made
   the government pass new amendments to the LSAI, even if civil society advocates and
   other engaged stakeholders consider these reforms very limited. The OGP process could
   improve implementation of the LSAI and highlight its current constraints, especially if the
   process allows the full engagement of CSOs.
 • The quality of the recent ATI laws adopted in the MENA region and the engagement of
   local and international organizations in the monitoring of their implementation can lead
   to an increased emphasis on the Jordanian experience. This, in turn, may strengthen the
   advocacy for significant amendments of the LSAI and empower different actors to make
   implementation of ATI in Jordan more effective.


2. History of Access to Information in Jordan
Passage of the Law on Securing Access to Information and Its History

The Law on Securing Access to Information2 no. 47 of 2007 was passed at the end of the fourth
exceptional session of the 14th parliament in Amman, Jordan. Its entry into force coincided
with its publication in the Official Gazette on 17 June 2007. This law, by its nature and scope,
was the first legislation on ATI to be adopted in the MENA region.
    Many observers3 who assisted in the development of the ATI bill are of the view that
the new piece of legislation did not receive much attention in the parliament and its vote
was speedy. Moreover, there were no significant discussions of its content and no consulta-
tions were conducted with other stakeholders before the adoption of the law. It is important
to describe the context during the adoption of the law in Jordan. There was no significant
demand by CSOs or other supporters of ATI and there was a significant lack of public engage-
ment and debate during the preparation of the ATI law. Journalists, CSOs, professional asso-
ciations, private sector organizations and academia were totally absent during the formulation
of the law. The process was very quick and there was no organized demand for the law in
the country.
    Yahia Shukkeir,4 an expert working on ATI who contributed to the drafting of Jordan’s ATI
law, relayed the events leading to the adoption of the law. During his work at the Higher Media
Council, government officials asked for recommendations on improving Jordan’s rank on the
Press Freedom Index run by Reporters without Borders (RSF).5 Among others, the adoption
of an ATI law was then suggested. The Amman Center for Human Rights declared in its 2007
annual report that “the joint legislative committee—the Freedoms and Legal Committees—
endorsed the draft in 30 minutes, while the House of Representatives took no more than
30 minutes to vote on the law.”6
376                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           The process of adoption of the LSAI has had a significant effect on its implementation and
      promotion. Because the LSAI was adopted with little public discussion, its implementation had
      to start from scratch and required a concerted effort to involve all stakeholders and ensure
      their understanding of the significance of this new right. By adopting the law in these circum-
      stances, the government did not gain any advantage for its promotion, with the result that RTI
      was recognized more in theory than in practice.
           The LSAI was adopted after Jordan had ratified many international conventions and
      covenants. Jordan had adopted the Rio Declaration that includes the principle on access to
      environmental information, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
      and on 24 October 2005, Jordan ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption
      (UNCAC). The UNCAC promotes in its articles 10 and 13 specific fundamentals related to RTI,
      especially the promotion of transparency and ensuring that the public has access to informa-
      tion so that it can participate in the fight against corruption.
           Back in 2007, Jordan was considered regionally as a leading country for the process of
      reform in the MENA region (e.g., liberalization of the media, adoption of the ATI law), but this
      will not remain the case as different national and international observers will soon point out the
      shortcomings of the ATI legislation and its failure to incorporate important international stan-
      dards. Even though the 2007 law did not integrate some specific international standards, it was
      seen as an opportunity to modernize the administrative system and change the relationship
      between citizens and authorities.7 The RTI is therefore considered the cornerstone for press
      freedom and public participation in public affairs.
           Implementation of laws is vital for the rule of law and functioning institutions, especially
      when it concerns accessing rights. However, the implementation of RTI in Jordan has been very
      limited since the law came into force. Some improvements have occurred in the last 2 years,
      but the interviews conducted with different stakeholders indicated the limits of the implemen-
      tation of the LSAI and the continuous challenges for ATI effectiveness.
           Different public agencies have responded differently to the LSAI. Since 2012, some public
      institutions started integrating the procedures of the LSAI into their internal processes and
      launched new ones to adapt to this legislation. Moreover, they started the process of classifica-
      tion and categorization of information and communicated to the IC basic data on the number
      of requests for information they have received. Other agencies, however, are still not taking
      into consideration the existence of the LSAI.
           After several years of existence, it seems that the law has not been largely known by institu-
      tions and citizens, and it has not constituted a significant move towards an easy and effective
      flow of information to citizens.8 The culture of secrecy that was relatively common in some sig-
      nificant government institutions has not been challenged by the existence of the ATI law. The
      results of surveys conducted by some CSOs and research centers show that a large number of
      public institutions have no knowledge of the law and have not integrated the content of the
      law into their services.
           After a long process of deliberation and a multi-stakeholder debate, the IC proposed
      amendments to the ATI law, which were validated by the Cabinet in September 2012. These
      amendments will (i) affect the composition of the IC by adding representatives of civil society
      (a representative of the Bar association and a representative of Journalists), (ii) guarantee ATI
      to foreigners with reciprocity rights, and (iii) reduce the timeline for responding to requests for

  BOX 1. THE WASTED RIGHT:9 RESULTS OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED
         BY CDFJ IN 2012
 The Wasted Right presents the results of the study conducted by the Center for
 Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in 2012. It seeks to describe the actions taken
 and applications developed by public departments in relation to the ATI law.
     The Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) sent questions to the Office
 of the Prime Minister, 6 ministries and the National Library (in its capacity as ICO) about
 specific aspects:
  • The categorization of their information and data;
  • The proportion of information classified;
  • The number of requests received since 2007 from researchers, specialists and ordinary
    citizens and their outcome; and
  • The existence of an official request for information form, as required by the law.

 The conclusions of this research showed that:
  • Most of the ministries have no previous information about the ATI law;
  • Some of the questions sent to the ministries were lost, with the exception of 3 minis-
    tries out of 7 and the National Library;
  • No focal point or Information Agent (IA) is available at public institutions to deal with
    requests for information (RFI);
  • There are no RFI forms except at the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice and
    the National Library;
  • Some of the ministries, including the Ministry of Social Development, admitted that
    they were not committed to the enforcement and application of the LSAI in classifying
    the information in their databases;
  • There was a problem in some cases in understanding the law and its applications. The
    Ministry of Health formed a committee to study the mechanisms of enforcing the ATI
    law after receiving the questions of the CDFJ and other journalists;
  • The answers that CDFJ received showed that no one had submitted a request to the
    Ministry of Social Development in the past, while three requests had been filed with
    the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Education informed the project’s team that they
    did not turn down any request, but the Ministry did not say how many requests had
    been filed with its departments; and
  • The ministry or department concerned failed to give a receipt against the submitted
    request, and did not even give the request a number in the official incoming registry,
    which violates the law. These practices have been frequently reported with regard to
    some agencies.

      information and appeals from 30 days to 15 days. These amendments have not yet entered
      into force; they still have to be presented to the Legislative Committee of the Parliament and
      then voted on by the Parliament and the Senate.
           The amendments presented and validated by the COM have been widely criticized for
      their limited scope. In particular, two civil society groups are developing efforts to pressure the
      parliament in order to achieve basic amendments that will conform to international standards.
      Moreover, increased demand for public information and the insistence of civil society are cru-
      cial to change the ATI rules as applied since 2007. Such changes will provide a new opportunity
      to make ATI efficient and implemented on a broad scale.
           The following analysis of the implementation of the law will show its significant limitations
      compared to existing international standards. In particular, the ATI law does not promote
      sanctions if the law is not implemented. In addition, the IC is very dependent on the executive
      branch and does not have the powers to seek public information from other public agencies.

      with the Law
      Jordan’s present legal system is based on the Constitution, the Court Establishment Law of
      1951, and a civil and criminal code, in addition to Islamic and ecclesiastical laws regulating
      specific sectors like the family code. The legal system has been influenced by many sources:
      The system developed from codes of law instituted by the Ottoman Empire that was mainly
      inspired by French law; British laws during the mandate period; and Islamic law, which has
      been influential, modifying in many ways the European models.
           Jordan amended its Constitution in 2011 under the influence of the events that emerged
      regionally and integrated some specific reforms. The reforms did not proclaim Access to Infor-
      mation among other fundamental rights recognized in Chapter 2 (on the Rights and Duties of
      Jordanians), such as the freedom of the press and the freedom of association. Some amend-
      ments proposed by CSOs concerning the integration of RTI did not find their way into Article 15
      of the Constitution, which was amended by specifying in more detail the obligation of the State
      to secure freedom of opinion and freedom of the press within the limits of the law.10
           The Law on Securing Access to Information (LSAI) was adopted in 2007 and became the
      first legislation on ATI in the MENA region. An important limitation to the effectiveness of the
      LSAI is that it does not supersede any other existing legislation currently in force. The Protec-
      tion of State Secrets and Documents Provisional Law No. 50 of 1971 is still in force, and this
      is the biggest obstacle to ensuring the Right to Information. The LSAI does not conform to
      international standards on ATI and presents many limitations. The lack of independence of
      the ICO and the IC, and the broad scope of exceptions limit significantly the effectiveness of
      this legislation.

      3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
      A cornerstone of good ATI legislation is the inclusion of provisions in the law that (i) pre-
      sume that all government documents and meetings will be open unless the custodian can
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                  379




demonstrate a legitimate basis for non-disclosure, and (ii) place a burden of proof on the State
to establish that there is a legitimate reason for non-disclosure. The LSAI does not explicitly
promote proactive disclosure and it limits the access to information to the existence of a legiti-
mate interest and reason presented by the requester for public information. It states in article 7
that each Jordanian citizen “is entitled to have access to the information he/she requests
pursuant to the provisions of this law, if he/she has legitimate interest or cause for that.” The
LSAI grants access to information exclusively to Jordanian citizens and requires requesters for
information to demonstrate what their interest is in accessing the requested information.


3.2. SCOPE OF EXEMPTIONS AND CATEGORIZATION OF INFORMATION
The law bans public requests for information involving religious, racial, ethnic, or gender dis-
crimination (Article 10), and allows officials to withhold all types of classified information, under
very broad categories (Article 13).11
    Article 13 of the Law enumerates the grounds upon which a public records custodian is not
required to disclose information considered as a specific exemption:
 • Secrets and documents protected under any other legislation;
 • Classified information obtained through an agreement with another state;
 • Secrets of national defense, national security, or foreign policy;
 • Information which contains analysis or recommendations, proposals or advice offered to an
   official before a decision is taken thereon, and correspondence and information exchanged
   between various governmental departments;
 • Information and personal files on a person’s educational records, medical records, career,
   bank accounts or professional secrets;
 • Correspondence of a personal or confidential nature whether postal, telegraphic or by
   telephone or through any other technical means with government departments, and
   answers thereto;
 • Information, the disclosure of which would influence negotiations between the State and
   any other country;
 • Investigations by the general prosecution or judicial enforcement or security agencies
   on any crime or case within their jurisdiction, as well as investigations by the competent
   authorities to detect financial or customs or bank irregularities unless the competent
   authority authorizes such disclosure; and
 • Information of a commercial, industrial or financial or economic nature, and information on
   bids or scientific research, the disclosure of which would lead to an infringement of copy-
   right and intellectual property, fair and legitimate competition or would lead to unlawful
   profit or loss for any person or company.

    All these elements make the list of exemptions broad and not really well defined.
This gives the public agency or the Information Agent (IA) the freedom of choice as to
whether or not to provide the information, especially when there are no sanctions involved
and other existing laws can make him/her responsible for revealing information that “may
cause harm.”
380                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          Each department, as stated by the LSAI, is required to classify and organize all information
      and documents held by its agencies. The department is responsible for determining which
      information and files shall be considered protected and classified in accordance with the appli-
      cable laws. The LSAI did not provide any restrictions on information disclosure in other existing
      legislation.
          The Prime Minister’s Communiqués 17/2007, 24/2007, and 13/2008, as well as the Com-
      muniqués of 7 April 2009 and 27 March 2011, ordered each public entity and department to
      categorize and organize all its information and documents. They were given three months after
      publication of the LSAI in the official gazette, as stated in article 14 of the LSAI, to determine
      which information shall be deemed protected and classified in accordance with the applicable
      laws. These public entities were also asked to communicate to the IC the list of documents
      considered secret.
          Despite constitutional protections of freedom of information, there remain several laws
      that hinder free expression and access to information. These include the Jordan Press Associa-
      tion Law (1998), the penal code (1960), the Defense Law (1992), the Contempt of Court Law
      (1959), the Protection of State Secrets and Classified Documents Law (1971), and the Press
      and Publications Law (1999 and its amendments of 2012). In this context, existing legislation,
      especially the Archives Law and the Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Documents
      (LPSSD), will limit significantly the information that may be accessed. The LPSSD states that
      classified government documents may be declassified after 30 years. Moreover, it does not
      outline a clear mechanism for the classification of government documents that may be exempt
      from disclosure.
          The LSAI in its article 19 refers to the COM as the authority to adopt the necessary opera-
      tional legislation to ensure implementation of the law on accessing public information. How-
      ever, the COM has adopted only the framework for fixing the fees for copying and reproducing
      information and the forms to be completed when submitting RFIs.

      3.3. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
      The requesting procedure requires citizens to fill out a form of two pages in the offices of
      the agency that holds the information. Filling out the form requires sharing personal infor-
      mation (name, address, National Identification Number, etc.) and explaining the purpose of
      the request. The formal procedure requires the IA to complete two pages referring to the
      request and to write the decision as to whether the information has been released or not. If
      the response is negative, the IA has to give in-principle reasons for the refusal. The LSAI in
      its article 9 states that the IA should provide a reason if access to information is denied to
      the requester; on the other hand, it considers the mute refusal of a public agency valid as
      a response.
           The timeline provided by the LSAI is 30 days for the IA to respond to a request for public
      information. The timeline to send a complaint to the ICO is of the same duration (30 days), and
      the last recourse, which is an appeal against the decision of the IC or the public agency, has a
      similar timeline of 30 days.
           The institution that received the largest number of RFIs in 2012 is the Department of
      Statistics with 1798 requests, followed by the Royal Jordanian Geographic Centre with
      170 requests. Some CSOs and observers criticized the accuracy of these statistics on the basis
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                381




FIGURE 1. Requests for Information Received by Public Institutions in 2012




that the number of requests was overestimated and did not consider RFIs exclusively.12 These
critics believed that even requests that had been presented without filling out the forms were
considered as requests, especially in the case of the Department of Statistics.

3.4. FEES FOR ACCESSING PUBLIC INFORMATION
Article 18 states that an allowance has to be paid to the department that provided the informa-
tion to cover the costs of copying information and reproducing the information in a specific
“container” (CD, tape…). The LSAI refers to the COM as the authority to approve the regula-
tory framework to fix the fees to be paid by requesters for copies of documents and to cover
the costs for the reproduction of various types of information. The IC proposed a framework,
which was sent to the Prime Minister on 1 November 2007 and 8 January 2008, proposing
the fees to be paid for each type of information support and for photocopying documents as
stated in article 18 of the LSAI. The Cabinet approved the framework proposed by the IC and
this entered into force on 23 January 2008.
    The framework adopted set some basic principles as stated by the LSAI. The fees are paid
to cover the cost of the reproduction of information and not the information itself. This frame-
work recommends that every agency should provide a copy of the pricing list together with the
RFI forms to inform the public about the fees. It also lists all types of information and fixes the
price for each type. Some information types (maps and plans) do not have a fixed price, and
the agency can fix the price in accordance with the document’s characteristics.
382                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           No data is available on the amounts collected through fees by public agencies. The limited
      number of requests registered since the adoption of the law is an indicator of the limited sig-
      nificance of these fees.


      3.5. LACK OF SANCTIONS AGAINST AND INCENTIVES FOR PUBLIC AGENTS
      The LSAI does not provide for any types of financial or disciplinary sanctions against public
      agents who do not release existing public information. By contrast, if public agents release
      administrative documents without the approval of the minister or the minister’s representative,
      they risk disciplinary measures and sanctions under several laws.
           The absence of sanctions in the LSAI, in addition to the existing laws that contradict some
      of its fundamentals, creates confusion for public agents in charge of ATI in the absence of clear
      instructions and classification standards. Public agents will possibly not release the information
      to avoid being responsible for releasing secret or sensitive information.13
           On the other hand, no incentives have been formulated in the LSAI for public agents or
      agencies who work on the promotion of ATI. Moreover, even the ICO who is the central piece
      in this architecture does not receive any kind of compensation for ATI functions.


      3.6. LIMITED NUMBER OF APPEALS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT
      OF JUSTICE
      Article 16 designates the High Court of Justice (HCJ) as the last resort for an appeal against a
      refusal to release requested public information or to respond to a request. If access to informa-
      tion is denied and the response of the IC to the appeal is negative, the requestor has to pres-
      ent an appeal to the HCJ within a period of 30 days, starting from the day that the decision
      was received. A lawyer represents the requester before the HCJ, which has the authority to
      consider the agency’s decision to refuse a request for information or not to respond to such a
      request. The LSAI does not set any deadline for the HCJ to provide a decision.
          There are no statistics on ATI cases presented before the HCJ, although the ICO referred
      to 2 to 3 existing cases. Interviews with journalists and CSOs indicated that, after many
      attempts to appeal to the HCJ, the court on many occasions found procedural errors and other
      reasons for not taking any action on ATI cases. Some interviewees also presented the cost of
      the appeal as an obstacle to an appeal (around 2,500 JD14) with the likelihood that plaintiffs
      would not win their cases.
          In September 2010, journalist Majdoleen Allan filed the first appeal to the HCJ against the
      Department of Lands and Survey for its refusal to disclose information about the price at which
      public property was sold and the identity of the buyer.15
          First, Allan submitted the appeal on behalf of the NGO Arab Reporters for Investiga-
      tive Journalism (ARIJ). The prosecution found that ARIJ had not disclosed its budget, had
      not renewed its registration and the Court established that ARIJ does not have a legitimate
      interest to access this information. Allan later submitted the appeal as a journalist. The Court,
      however, dismissed the application on the grounds that the applicant was not a registered
      journalist and therefore decided that she is ineligible to request such information. The jour-
      nalist appealed a third time to the Court as a Jordanian citizen, but the appeal failed again
      because the HCJ found that the requester had no legitimate interest.16
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                383




    The Court system proved to have major limitations for the implementation of LSAI. The
choice of the HCJ to look into complaints is a serious challenge because of the nature of
the Court and the costs that it involves to appeal the decisions of public agencies on ATI. All
cases presented before this court were considered to have formal defects (irregularity in the
procedure) or the requesters were considered to lack the legitimate interest to request public
information.

3.7. THE OVERSIGHT INSTITUTIONS CREATED BY LSAI: THE INFORMATION
COUNCIL (IC) AND THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER (ICO)
The LSAI establishes the IC and states in article 3 that it will be composed of (i) the Minister of
Culture as the chair, (ii) the ICO, who is the Director General of the Department of the National
Library, as the vice chair, and (iii) the following seven members:
 • The Under-Secretaries of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior and the Higher
   Media Council;17
 • The Director General of the Department of Statistics;
 • The Director General of the National Information Technology Center;
 • The Director of the National Guidance Directorate at the Jordanian Armed Forces; and
 • The High Commissioner for Human Rights.

     The IC is in charge of promoting access to information and looking into appeals filed by
applicants whose requests were refused by public agencies.
     The IC is required to validate the annual report on the implementation of ATI, which is
prepared by the ICO, and to present it to the Prime Minister. The report describes the efforts
initiated by the ICO and the IC in promoting ATI and presents figures and statistics on appeals
received by the IC and the number of requests handled by public agencies.18 Although article 4
of the LSAI provides for the production of the annual reports, there is no requirement for their
publication. Accessing the report of the IC has been a serious challenge for the public. A Jorda-
nian graduate student submitted a request to access the IC’s annual report to use it in his PhD
thesis on ATI in Jordan. He was initially denied access, and so he decided to sue the IC. He then
negotiated with the IC representatives, who finally agreed to provide the student with a summary
of the report.19 Prior to this event, CSOs had requested the report from the IC but were not given
access to it.20
     Article 6 describes the responsibilities of the ICO. These include supporting public agen-
cies in developing the RFI forms, and centralizing the appeals/complaints presented by citi-
zens and submitting them to the IC for resolution. The LSAI assigns to the National Library the
task of providing professional and administrative services to the IC and ICO.
     The IC and the ICO have no control over other public institutions on ATI. The ICO receives
appeals, as described in the LSAI, through a form that is completed by citizens for this pur-
pose. Once the appeal is received, the ICO analyzes the matter and asks for a meeting with
the other members of the IC within 10 days. After deliberation with the members of the IC
who attended the meeting, the ICO sends his response to the initiator of the appeal inform-
ing him/her of the result of the appeal, granting the release of the information or its refusal. If
the response is positive, the ICO informs the initiator of the appeal that the public institution
concerned has been notified in writing to release the information.
384                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      The Limited Role of the Oversight Institutions

      The LSAI places restrictions on the scope of work of the ICO by limiting his functions to the
      legal responsibility of managing only the information produced, archived and related to his
      department. The ICO has no mandate to request information from other public agencies. He
      has the mandate of filing the received appeals and presenting them to the IC, for it to resolve
      the case. The ICO then sends the decision to the agency that was the subject of the appeal
      and the requester.
           The limited powers of the ICO, together with the lack of a central institution in charge of
      the implementation of the LSAI, reduces significantly the possibility of the effective promotion
      of ATI in Jordan. In addition, the effectiveness of the law has been undermined by the lengthy
      request procedure and the lack of ATI progress monitoring by the government. Moreover, the
      IC does not interfere in the classification and categorization process. The IC merely receives a
      list of existing information and its categorization from the public institutions.21

      Appeals Received by the ICO

      The ICO has received few appeals since the adoption of the law, although the number
      increased significantly in 2013 compared to previous years. According to the ICO, this situation
      has resulted mainly from delays in starting to develop and implement the procedures for the
      classification of information at the agency level, and in the appointment and training of the IAs,
      which only started officially on January 1st, 2012.22
           The IC has received 28 appeals since the adoption of the LSAI, at least 15 of them in 2013.
      The most appeals (10) targeted universities, followed by different ministries.
           Journalists and university students are the main requesters of information using the law.23
      Concerning appeals, journalists have submitted 25 out of the 28 appeals made since the adop-
      tion of the law.24 In 2013, 67% of the appeals concerned information requested from universi-
      ties. The 10 appeals targeting universities resulted from exercises conducted by Radio Al Balad
      and ARIJ.25 CSOs have initiated monitoring exercises to highlight the limited implementation
      of ATI. These efforts have probably affected the number of appeals addressed to the IC in the
      last two years.
           The IC’s 2012 annual report stated that the IC organized 10 meetings during the previous
      2 years to develop resolutions on specific appeals and discuss the set of LSAI amendments
      presented to the COM. It gives information about the number of IAs designated by public
      institutions as being responsible for communication with the IC. Forty-two public departments
      and agencies communicated the contact details of 48 IAs appointed during 2012. Civil society
      advocates believe that there are more than 120 public departments and agencies covered by
      the LSAI.

FIGURE 3. Distribution of Appeals to the ICO in 2013, by Agency




     Based on the results of their monitoring exercises, CDFJ filed appeals26 with the IC against
four ministries that did not adhere to the time limit stipulated by the law. The IC issued its decision
number 4/2012 indicating that, on 10 November 2008, the Ministry of Interior provided the IC with
a list of subjects and files indicating the information that was classified as confidential and pro-
tected, and it did not include the information related to the request filed by CDFJ. The resolution
of the IC issued on 24 July 2012 accepted the applicant’s appeal and requested that the Ministry
of Interior provide the CDFJ representative with the requested information. Based on this deci-
sion, the CEO of the CDFJ on 23 August 2012 sent a letter to the Minister of Interior. The same
steps were observed with the other ministries and the same resolutions were issued.

           The responses received from the IC show that the ministries in question admitted clas-
      sifying some of their documents as confidential, but it was noticed that these categories were
      not founded on a clear basis for all the ministries. Each ministry made its own categorization
      according to its opinions. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce
      admitted having not received any RFI before the one presented by the CEO of CDFJ.
           The ICO did not mention in his communication of 2013 the number of public institutions
      that had completed the process of classifying their information.27 The statistics of the public
      institutions that reported the number of requests received in 2013 show that a total of 14 agen-
      cies received requests. The IC’s 2012 annual report shows a total of 2,286 requests, and only
      100 requests did not get a response.
           Ninety-two out of 110 focal points (IAs) were trained during 2012, and they have started
      formulating the list of secret documents in their institutions to provide to the IC. The IC finds
      the public institutions generally cooperative, even if its decisions are not binding by law. Sev-
      eral training sessions are organized in cooperation with CSOs, namely the Amman Center for
      Human Rights and the CDFJ.

      3.8. PROPOSED LSAI AMENDMENTS AND THEIR ASSESSMENT
      BY CIVIL SOCIETY
      After Jordan became a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), the government
      of Jordan announced in its first action plan that the LSAI would be amended. After a long pro-
      cess of deliberation and a multi-stakeholder debate, the IC proposed amendments to the ATI
      law, which were validated by the COM in September 2012. These amendments will affect:
       • The composition of the IC, by adding representatives of CSOs (a representative of the Bar
         association and a representative of Journalists);
       • The ATI for foreigners with reciprocity rights;
       • A reduction in the timeline for responding to RFIs and appeals from 30 days to 15 days.

           These amendments have not yet entered into force; they still have to be presented to the
      Legislative Committee of the Parliament and then voted in the parliament and the senate.
           Civil society advocates interviewed believe these amendments are lacking the scope that
      will empower the ICO to become independent and they only target the same government
      agencies that are currently subject to LSAI. Moreover, they argue that the LSAI should be
      expanded to include private institutions financed by the government.
           Additionally, these amendments include a requirement that the IA must provide the
      requested information or refuse the request within 15 days. Another amendment allows the
      requester to submit an appeal to the IC within the next 15 days (previously 30 days) if the
      request is denied. The IC must then issue a decision on this appeal within 15 days. If denied,
      the requester has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court within 60 days (previously 30 days)
      after receiving the IC’s decision.
           While these modifications constitute a step in the right direction, they are not sufficient to
      bring the law up to international standards. Further reforms are needed to ensure the Right to
      Information.28 CSOs focusing on ATI are rallying MPs and political parties to stop the vote on
      these amendments and consider either extending the scope of the amendments or introduc-
      ing a new bill that will improve ATI effectiveness in Jordan.29 CSOs previously rallied different
      stakeholders in 2011–2012, asking for a reform of the LSAI, and proposed amendments that

  BOX 2. MEMORANDUM OF THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR LEGISLATIVE REFORM
         ON THE LSAI
  The Memorandum proposed important steps to make a fundamental change to the exist-
  ing RTI law
   • Changing the composition of the IC with a greater representation of civil society and
     independent judicial bodies and professional associations of lawyers, journalists and
     non-government media.
   • Including in the definition of information, the documentation of oral statements.
   • Avoiding the limitation of RTI that refers to legitimate interest or reason.
   • Adding in article 4 describing the functions of the IC, “the monitoring of irregularities
     and the publication of reports and studies that expose obstacles to the exercise of the
     RTI, and clarify how to overcome them.”
   • Modifying article 7 to grant “RTI to all persons (not only Jordanian citizens).”
   • Changing article 9 of the law to disallow mute refusal and require that a reason be
     given for a refusal to release information.
   • Reducing the duration of response and appeal.
   • Removing article 10 that is considered a limit to the right to information. This article
     states that information “that may bear the stamp of religious discrimination or racial or
     ethnic discrimination” cannot be requested.
   • Modifying article 17 by giving Courts of first instance the mandate to judge on the
     decision to give or refuse to give the information issued by public departments,
     instead of the High Court of Justice.
   • Adding representatives of CSOs to the composition of the IC and making the Chair

were based on international standards and best practices, although they bear some similarities
to the current changes being proposed.
    The CDFJ facilitated a participative process to develop a Memorandum of the National
Coalition for Legislative Reform on the LSAI (see Box above). These amendments were a
component of the 2012 Campaign “Ask…it’s your right to know”. They proposed the basic
principles that a new ATI law should develop and made specific recommendations for chang-
ing the law.
    The proposed principles focused on limiting the scope of the exceptions and making
access to information the rule, by narrowing the conditions when information cannot be
released, and by limiting the possibilities of inaction by public agents. They also recom-
mended limiting the cost of ATI and imposing sanctions on public agents who do not release
information without good reason. They also asked for the protection of IAs if they release
information in error.

         In addition to the work of CDFJ,30 Al Quds Center for Political Studies31 through its Jor-
      danian Media Monitor32 organized in 2013 a series of multi-stakeholder debates to propose
      amendments to all legislation on the work of the press and media in Jordan.33




      4. Public Sector Capacities and Agency-level
      Practices: The Ministry of Agriculture and the
      Ministry of Environment
      Since its adoption in 2007, the ATI law has shown little progress in the scope of its implementa-
      tion. Some relevant steps have been taken in the last two years, and that proves that the law
      seems to be gaining significant interest resulting from the advocacy of CSOs and the member-
      ship of Jordan in the OGP. The mobilization of specific CSOs and their collaboration with the
      ICO, through developing initiatives and activities focusing on ATI, have succeeded in attract-
      ing more governmental participation in ATI and improving the implementation of the ATI
      legislation.
           LSAI implementation has been very limited and largely ineffective for many different rea-
      sons. Some factors are related to its content and others are more associated with the context
      and the conditions of its implementation. In addition, some needed amendments of other leg-
      islation, such as the LPSSD, are crucial to support an effective implementation of ATI in Jordan.
           Reasons for ineffective implementation include:
       • Lack of consultations with stakeholders. Since the LSAI was adopted without any prior
         consultations, its implementation was adversely affected by the lack of participation of
         different stakeholders. Surveys conducted by CSOs (discussed below) show that the level
         of knowledge about the existence of the law among significant stakeholders is still very
         limited.
       • Lack of leadership. There is no strong leadership supporting the implementation of
         the LSAI and the decisions of successive Prime Ministers were not fully considered in the
         implementation of this legislation. The last executive order issued through Communiqué 4 of
         2013 recalled the content of Communiqué 19 of 2012 ordering all public agencies to appoint
         their Information Agents (IA) to become specialized in ATI and act as focal points between
         ministries and public agencies and departments, and communicate their contact details to
         the IC. This Communiqué showed that the IC received 52 responses from different public
         institutions listing 56 IAs.
       • Lack of authority of the ICO and IC. The role of the ICO and the IC is mainly consultative
         and this has limited significantly the implementation of the LSAI. Stakeholders interviewed
         considered the role of the ICO central in the implementation of the law and its effective-
         ness. They criticized the lack of power characterizing the functions of the ICO under the
         LSAI and described the need for significant advocacy and lobbying of MPs to vote for a
         new RTI law guaranteeing the independence of the ICO from the Executive.
       • Lack of coordination. There are significant disparities in the level of implementation of
         LSAI. The agencies studied in this case study show how implementation of LSAI at the
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                              389




   agency-level can be fundamentally heterogeneous. In Jordan, each agency is responsible
   for the implementation of LSAI and the coordination of implementation efforts is not
   organized.

    The description of ATI implementation at the agency-level would be incomplete without the
inputs of some reports and surveys developed by Jordanian CSOs, since the information devel-
oped and provided by agencies and oversight institutions is very limited in time and scope. This
report will focus on two agencies: the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment.


4.1. PERSONNEL IN CHARGE OF ATI AT THE AGENCY LEVEL
In the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Environment (MOE), the person-
nel in charge of ATI are not working exclusively on promoting and developing ATI. There is
no specific department or staff in charge of just ATI. The personnel working in the Office of
Communication with the Public undertake the general functions of IAs. In both agencies, the
IAs have taken part in training sessions organized by the ICO and CSOs.
    In response to a survey on ATI,34 MOA indicated that all RFIs are dealt with immediately or
transmitted to the departments that are supposed to have the capacity to provide responses.
The classification of information is done by the Center of Information of the MOA and this
department has the authority to categorize the information produced or archived by the MOA.
    At the MOE, the information advisor and the official public relations officer were appointed
as IAs and they are in charge of undertaking all functions related to ATI. They also organize
press conferences and take care of interviews with journalists and the media.


4.2. LACK OF SPECIFIC BUDGETS
There is no specific budget for ATI activities at any level. The ICO and the IC carry out their
role without any financial compensation, and the same situation is to be found at the agency
level. IAs were appointed to cover the ATI functions in addition to their original jobs. There is
no specific budget to cover the IAs’ responsibilities for the implementation of the LSAI and to
promote ATI within different departments and sections of the agency.
    Activities of ATI promotion have to be funded by different lines of the agency budget. The
majority of the activities related to ATI promotion and training were organized in collaboration
with CSOs and funded mainly through international cooperation arrangements.
    There is no specific line item for ATI in agencies’ budgets. Instead, the ATI is funded from
agencies’ administrative budgets. The MOE has no specific budget for ATI activities and it is
funded as part of the public awareness activities budget that has approximately USD150,000
per year.35 This total amount is intended to cover the activities of raising awareness developed
by regional delegations and the associations that manage environmental reserves, in addition
to ATI activities.


4.3. PROCESSING OF REQUESTS
Requesters can only present their RFIs in paper form. They have to fill out the specific request
form and present it to a particular agency. At the agency level, information can be provided
by reproducing it on paper or electronically (CD-ROM, tape, etc.). The MOA and MOE do not
receive requests or send information to requesters by e-mail.
390                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          The basic step for public agencies to implement LSAI consists in developing their own
      request form based on the model proposed by the ICO and adopted by the Prime Minister.
      The MOA has not yet adopted a request form. The representative of the MOA stated in our
      interview that: “information can be shared more efficiently with journalists and requesters by
      phone or other means rather than by following the procedure for requests and its timeline.”
      The agency is not implementing the LSAI and it is continuing to handle requests in the way it
      did before the law was adopted.
          The procedure for requesting public information as set out in the LSAI is considered time
      consuming and inefficient by the MOA representative. The flow of information is considered
      to be faster and more effective when the MOA answers journalists’ requests by phone or fax,
      although requesters can submit written questions to the MOA’s Office of Communication with
      the Public.36 There are no statistics about the number of requests received by MOA and there
      is no mention of this agency in the annual report of the IC that contains all the statistics on
      requests and appeals collected in 2012.
          The MOA claims that all requests have been responded to even though they were not pre-
      sented as formal requests using a request form, but as questions presented in writing to the
      Office of Communication with the Public or through phone calls with MOA officials.
          For the MOE, citizens wanting to request information have to fill out the request form
      and hand it to the Office of Contact with the Public. The MOE established a committee with
      responsibility for categorizing the information and this will state if the information can be
      released or not. The legal unit, under the supervision of the Communication adviser, the Secre-
      tary General and the Minister, is responsible for the categorization of information. An Executive
      Board is responsible for giving the final approval for releasing documents that contain sensitive
      information or could carry risks.
          The MOE responded fully to all 6 requests received in 2013.37 According to the IA, the main
      requesters of information are researchers and university students.
          The MOE does not publish an annual report, although some studies and reports on the
      environment are published on its website. The 2012 Annual Report of the IC indicates that the
      MOE received 20 requests in 2012 and they were all fully answered. All the executive orders
      on implementation of the LSAI were implemented in 2013, and so the categorization of MOE’s
      information and the designation of the IA have been in place since January 1, 2013.

      4.4. PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEMS
      No Performance Monitoring Systems have been developed or used by the IC, and its role
      is limited to the promotion of ATI without being able to supervise the performance of other
      public institutions by initiating binding decisions.
           In 2012, the IC, for the first time, gathered information on the number of requests made to
      some public institutions. By Communiqué 19 of 2012 and based on a request from by the IC,
      the Prime Minister ordered public agencies to provide statistics on RFIs received and asked
      them to detail their results by indicating which requests were responded to and which requests
      were refused. The reasons for such refusals should be provided.
           The IC received statistics on the use of ATI from 14 public institutions subject to the ATI
      law, but the remaining public institutions did not provide this information.38 It is probable that
      these institutions do not collect this information or do not implement the ATI law. The MOA
      corroborates this situation.
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                             391




    Moreover, no initiatives have been developed to measure the performance of the IC or
other public institutions on ATI. Some ATI monitoring exercises were initiated by certain CSOs,
but they were limited in time and scope.
    The RTI rating developed by CSOs39 at the global level ranks Jordan 90 out of 95 countries
with a score of 55 points out of 150. This ranking measures the strength of the ATI legislation
and compares it to specific international standards. The absence of an independent central
agency in charge of ATI implementation, limited ATI for nationals, the timelines for ATI and
appeals, and the need to give a reason/interest for ATI are examples of why the LSAI is per-
forming poorly at the global level.
    CSOs in Jordan did not launch any internet platform or tool to monitor the implementation
and use of ATI in Jordan. At the regional level, some current efforts are emerging, particularly
in Tunisia,40 to develop participatory tools for measuring the implementation and use of ATI by
public institutions and other stakeholders.


4.5. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
The collection, retention and preservation of records are not regulated by the LSAI. Instead,
the Law on Archives governs records. This constitutes one of the main challenges to the
implementation of the LSAI at the agency level. The timeline for keeping records is long and
accessing them is not well organized.
    The majority of public institutions have an information center that is supposed to gather
the information of the agency and organize it so it can be accessed by the public. These
information centers are not organized the same way in all agencies and their resources are very
variable depending on the priority that each agency gives them. These centers are considered
more as libraries than offices and are responsible for organizing the information produced by
their own agency.
    There is no specific policy at the MOA or MOE to manage records. These two agencies
have their own information centers, but their procedures are not described and their linkage to
the IA is not detailed in any policy.
    The MOE classified and categorized its information and submitted the details to the
ICO. A specific commission with representatives of the Minister of Environment was set up to
accomplish this task and to look into RFIs that contain requests for sensitive information.41 In
contrast, at the MOA, there is no indication that such categorization has been undertaken.


4.6. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE AND OPEN DATA
The statistics and data on the use of the LSAI are not available on-line. The IC does not have a
website, while the National Library’s website has just a page that gives the content of the law
and the entitlements of the IC. An exclusive website for the IC is being developed by one of
the institutions represented in the IC, the National Information Technology Center.42 No proac-
tive disclosure policy has been developed by the IC and the report of the IC was not available
to the public in the past. The IC is not included in the Open Data portal of the Government
of Jordan.43
    The MOA has a functioning website and some general information and statistics can be
found on the main page. The website is updated and presents reports dated from 2013. It fea-
tures a section for requesting information through an electronic form.44 The MOA publishes an
392                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      annual report that contains information on imports, exports and the situation in the markets.
      There is no mention of RFIs either in the annual report or on its website.
          The MOE has an up-to-date website that allows environmental complaints to be submitted
      electronically, but not RFIs. The MOE does not publish an annual report, but some studies and
      reports are published on the website. There is no mention of the number of requests or envi-
      ronmental complaints received through the website. The website does not give a definition of
      environmental complaints, but they are considered distinct from RFIs.
          The Open Data portal is a page hosted on the E-gov Website: http://www.jordan.gov.jo/
      wps/portal/. The information presented on this page is not organized in any specific way—not
      by sector or department. It is mainly dated 2010 and 2011.
          Jordan’s Anti-corruption Commission and the Audit Bureau started publishing their annual
      reports for the first time in 2011. These reports were not available to the public in the past.

      4.7. TRAINING AND PUBLIC OUTREACH
      The MOA and MOE did not launch any specific efforts on training and increasing public
      outreach in relation to the LSAI. The MOE develops campaigns in partnership with its regional
      offices on preserving the environment, but there is no specific mention of the use of ATI as a
      tool to seek or report specific information about the environment.
           All the campaigns for public outreach were mainly organized by CSOs in partnership with
      the ICO. The ICO is very responsive to these initiatives but he does not launch his own cam-
      paigns because of the lack of resources.
           Representatives of the MOA and the MOE attended the sessions of ATI training organized
      by the ICO in collaboration with some CSOs, mainly CDFJ and the Amman Center for Human
      Rights. The training was limited to two sessions and focused on general aspects of ATI without
      developing any specialization. From all public agencies, 92 out of 110 focal points (IAs) were
      trained during 2012.



      5. Capacity and Influence of Civil Society
      The Civil Society Index report on Jordan45 recommends the establishment of a leadership and
      good governance institute that can focus exclusively on developing leadership and administra-
      tion skills in CSOs. It also urges the activation of conventions on best practices regarding the
      good governance and transparency of CSOs, as well as the adoption of policies on environ-
      mental standards, paid work, and equal work for women. The report also notes the need to
      place additional importance on awareness programs, training, and capacity building with
      regard to building networks and alliances, as CSOs must gain the necessary skills for coordina-
      tion and exchange of information and services. The report emphasizes the importance of plac-
      ing the values of tolerance, dialogue, and acceptance of others and the culture of non-violence
      on the agenda of civil society in Jordan, taking into consideration that the role of civil society in
      the promotion of non-violence and dialogue is still limited.
           The report encourages civil society to develop and apply its media and communication
      skills, to help familiarize the public with the activities and programs of CSOs. In addition, the
      report asks the national registry of societies at the Ministry of Social Development in Jordan
      to provide qualitative data on registered organizations, and suggests that other relevant
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                 393




ministries follow these steps. The report emphasizes the need to develop databases on CSOs
and publish their content periodically on websites or in annual reports.
    The report concludes that CSOs based in the capital and the main cities enjoy acceptable
infrastructure and communication capacities, but for those working in rural and remote areas
the reality is very different. Civil society has a diverse structure and is mostly independent, both
financially (dependent on international cooperation and not local funding) and administratively
(even if the registration process is quite complex, CSOs can register with different ministries).
CSOs operate in a politically conservative and biased general environment that supports the
state’s interventionist role in their affairs, which in turn weakens their impact. The majority of
CSOs have poor practices in terms of leadership turnover and limited financial transparency.
They still lack adequate financial resources, while negative perceptions of foreign funding
affect public confidence in CSOs. Civil society’s collective capability to launch a dialogue
with the state, the private sector and foreign donors is weakened in the absence of a holistic
national action strategy, which allows too much scope for foreign donor influence.

5.1. POLICY IMPLICATIONS
In 2007, when the law was adopted, the focus of CSOs on ATI was very limited and they did
not contribute to the adoption of the law. In fact, the process of promulgating the LSAI was
fast and did not allow any public consultations with or participation of interested stakeholders,
including CSOs.
     Following adoption of the LSAI, some CSOs started focusing on ATI and developed spe-
cific projects to analyze the implementation of the law and monitor the institutions in charge
of promoting ATI. CSOs also developed training sessions for IAs and prepared reports on ATI.
In the last two years, CSOs have organized conferences to debate the content of the law and
proposed amendments to the ATI law.
     Many CSOs working on promoting human rights and defending journalists have devel-
oped their advocacy for better implementation of ATI. In addition, some research centers have
started investing in initiatives and projects on ATI in collaboration with international partners.
     Al Quds Center for Political Studies, the CDFJ and recently the Jordan Transparency Cen-
ter (JTC) have mobilized groups of CSOs to propose amendments to the ATI law. These CSOs
and other civil society groups have organized activities on ATI and collaborated with the ICO
to raise awareness and discuss the law and the functions of the ICO and the IC.
     Al Quds Center through its Jordanian Media Monitor organized in 2013 a series of multi-
stakeholder debates to propose amendments to all legislation relating to the work of the press
and media in Jordan. These events gathered MPs, judges, lawyers and media representa-
tives to discuss the content of the legislation governing the work of the press and the media
and aimed to develop proposals to amend existing legislation toward more freedom and the
abolition of restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with international
standards.
     There was a specific recommendation to abolish the 1971 law on the protection of state
secrets and documents. In the section dedicated to ATI, the Center proposed a matrix with the
existing articles of the law and proposed changes; it also proposed additional articles for the
law and the bodies that should be established.
     In 2013, Al Quds Center also organized meetings with MPs, especially the National Com-
mittee for Orientation and the Legal Committee. These MPs and other public officials take
394                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      part in events organized by CSOs and they exchange opinions and maintain a good relation-
      ship with each other. The Center organized regional meetings in four different regions (Arbid,
      Alkarak, Almafrik and Azzarkae) between February and June 2013, and three other meetings
      in the capital Amman. These meetings aimed to raise awareness about ATI and explain the
      content of the ATI law and the proposed amendments developed by the Center. These meet-
      ings mobilized CSOs, political parties and organizations, academia, youth organizations and
      university students.
           The CDFJ is the pioneer organization working on ATI in Jordan. This organization has orga-
      nized different events and a training session with the IC. To celebrate the Right to Know day of
      2012, CDFJ mobilized different partners to organize a national campaign “Ask…it’s your right
      to know.” The aim of this campaign was to raise awareness among the public and the institu-
      tions about the ATI law, and the need to implement it to improve integrity and accountability,
      fight corruption and establish a free and professional media. The campaign used flyers show-
      ing an RFI form and explained to citizens the importance of making use of ATI. This campaign
      was organized in collaboration with the IC.
           The JTC46 also organized different meetings, leading a group of CSOs in early 2013 to
      propose amendments to the ATI law. The amendments were presented to the legislative com-
      mittee of the parliament on 28 May 2013, and the organization is reaching out to MPs to move
      forward with these reforms.
            The JTC criticized the lack of coordination between NGOs to create synergies and
      develop greater advocacy and lobbying power. The representatives of the organization also
      criticized the “events-driven” policy of some NGOs who work on specific topics just because
      of the availability of international funding. The JTC advocates for more training for MPs and
      public institutions on ATI.47
           These efforts are important, but unfortunately they are still more personal or linked to a
      specific project of a given CSO; there is no coalition or network of CSOs creating synergies
      and increasing decisively the level of organization and advocacy to move forward with amend-
      ments and influence effectively48 the parliament and other institutions of the State. ATI is still
      regarded as a topic to be discussed by experts rather than by citizens who can see the impor-
      tance of reforms that ATI could bring. There is a need for more efforts to develop knowledge
      around ATI and encourage its use, especially among government departments responsible for
      its enforcement. CSOs can play a significant role in explaining and promoting the use of ATI
      and facilitating the flow of information to citizens and journalists.
           The amendments proposed by different civil society groups are quite similar and they are
      based on international standards and best practices. The keys in this process are leverage and
      the capacity to develop advocacy and lobbying in order to amend the LSAI. These groups
      have developed the proposed amendments in a participative way, involving a range of stake-
      holders in formulating recommendations.

      5.2. THE CAPACITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS
      TO LEVERAGE ATI
      Jordanian CSOs have developed different projects in recent years to raise awareness and train
      professionals about ATI. Media groups, especially ARIJ and CDFJ, have conducted surveys
      about the use and level of implementation of the law.
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                395




     The community of CSOs and professionals working on ATI has progressed significantly
during the last few years, but it is mainly members and specific partners who know about their
work. There are no strong ATI campaigns and messages to foster the use of RTI in Jordan. It
is also important to build institutions to make RTI sustainable. Campaigns can mobilize the
population to use the LSAI, but if there is no organized infrastructure to receive their RFI, ATI
campaigns can have an adverse effect. In fact, CSOs should ensure that the infrastructure for
ATI exists before they start focusing on the use of an ATI system. Specific monitoring exercises
can be relevant and can be used for advocacy goals, but if citizens request information repeat-
edly and never get responses, they will stop using ATI and they will also talk negatively about
it and consider it an invalid tool. CSOs cannot reach the public to any great extent without
the support of the government. This support can be direct through funding and opening
channels for collaboration in developing campaigns and training. On the other hand, the ICO
could develop its own campaigns on ATI, but for the moment, it lacks the financial and human
resources to do so.

Promotion of ATI through Investigative Journalism

Majdoleen Allan, an investigative journalist who prepared ARIJ’s study on the monitoring
and follow-up of the implementation of ATI, highlighted the lack of any government mecha-
nism to record the number of requests by either journalists or ordinary people. The IC only
records the number of complaints against government refusals. For the study, Allan submitted
10 requests to various government agencies to test their responsiveness; she then reported
on the outcomes of those 10 requests. Only one agency provided the information in a timely
manner and two other responses provided partial information. The rest of the responses were
irrelevant or agencies refused to give information on the grounds of confidentiality and lack of
legitimate interest.
     In an interview, the Executive Director of ARIJ49 described the efforts made by the orga-
nization in launching appeals before the HCJ and conducting follow-up exercises on ATI
implementation in Jordan. ARIJ organizes training courses at the regional level to empower
journalists and develop their skills in investigative journalism. ATI is one of the tools developed
in the training modules. She considers that informality in journalism is the rule, and the major-
ity of journalists prefer to get information through their family contacts or other means rather
than by following the ATI procedure, because it is long and can be costly when having to refer
appeals to the Courts. She also mentioned the lack of professional expertise and, sometimes,
the financial means to appeal decisions as the long procedures require lawyers’ fees and
other expenses. She finds that the interest in ATI is quite seasonal in Jordan, and there are
no significant coalitions that are developing a sustainable approach to this work, based on a
programmatic lobbying of the relevant bodies and individuals to change the law and improve
its implementation.
     The level of ignorance about the ATI law and human rights and their mechanisms is signifi-
cant, and the projects developed with international cooperation focus mainly on the political
interests of the donors.50 The cases presented before the HCJ were all turned down by the
Court because they had a formal defect (such as an irregularity in the procedure), and, in her
view, this is indicative of the current shortcomings on the political front for efficient implemen-
tation of the ATI law.

      Example of Civil Society Efforts and the Impact on ATI

      A recent experience of RASED,51—the civil society coalition that monitored the elections on
      23 January 2013—provides some insight about ATI. RASED reports that the information released
      was shared in password protected PDF files, which did not allow for copying or conversion
      of the data for purposes of review, audit and analysis. In addition, the Independent Electoral
      Commission (IEC) failed to publish the executive regulation for the counting and announcing of
      the results. RASED filed several requests with the IEC in order to receive the final results of the
      elections in Excel formats, in order for its teams to carry out further audits and a statistical review,
      but no positive response has been received from the IEC at the time of writing this report.
           Access to information was also impeded by the IEC in relation to the outcome of its investi-
      gations into the electoral violations documented by RASED. RASED had provided the IEC with
      reports on multiple violations by voters, candidates and IEC staff; however, no concrete actions
      have been taken by the IEC in this regard, posing questions about the transparency of the
      electoral administrator’s accountability.
           RASED conducted also a monitoring exercise on the performance of the 17th Jordanian
      Parliament52 during its work in the Non-Ordinary session of 2013. The report provides a repeti-
      tion analysis for MPs’ speeches during the session’s confidential deliberations (Figure 3 in the
      report); this shows that the ATI law was mentioned by 2 MPs, making it the least mentioned
      topic. Corruption was cited by 104 MPs as the most mentioned topic.
           In an interview with the General Director of Al Hayat Center for Civil Society Develop-
      ment,53 who is the coordinator for RASED, many aspects of the implementation of the ATI law
      were discussed and especially the work with MPs for amending several laws (e.g., ATI law, Elec-
      tions law, Political parties law, Municipalities law). The Center is developing a shadow report
      for the OGP on the participation of Jordan and coordinating different initiatives between CSOs
      and MPs. He considers that the public does not trust CSOs and the majority of MPs do not
      take them seriously. Creating trust is a long process where face-to-face meetings are periodic
      and productive, and it is worth taking the time to establish long-term relationships. He also
      sees a need for a sustainable means for tracing and tracking information.
           He commended the work carried out by CDFJ before the elections in proposing to candi-
      dates that they sign a commitment to work with MPs to raise awareness about the limitations
      of the proposed amendments of the ATI law. He also raised a serious issue about the transpar-
      ency of CSOs and their management of funding, which is mainly from international sources. He
      considers that many cases of cross-funding exist, with many organizations hiding the sources
      of their funds. While possibilities for collaborative work with the government on ATI exist,
      many organizations, including community based organizations, are not involved in such work.
      Moreover, the scope of work of the main organizations working on ATI covers only journalists
      and some CSOs. CSOs generally prefer to take undemanding actions even though there is a
      serious need for the monitoring of service delivery and of the use of ATI as a tool to fight cor-
      ruption. He concludes by stressing the crucial role for international organizations in developing
      transparent criteria for the funding of projects, sharing the information about these projects
      with the public, and reporting the outcomes.


      5.3. THE MEDIA SECTOR AND THE LIMITED USE OF ATI
      The Jordanian media sector has experienced a rapid transformation over the last decade
      in response to the mass digitalization of information and the liberalization of the visual and
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                  397




audio sector in 2002. The number of radio stations in Jordan could be counted on one hand a
decade ago; it now has numerous entertainment and news-oriented stations, broadcasting in
both Arabic and English, with new channels constantly coming on the air.
     The number of newspapers has also increased rapidly, alongside many free advertising
publications. The television segment of the media sector in Jordan remains the only segment
that has not experienced significant growth. Jordan Television (JTV), a state-owned radio and
television broadcaster, was the sole television broadcaster in Jordan prior to the introduction
of the Audiovisual Media Law in 2002.
     The development of internet and technological convergence has led to a significant
change in the traditional media sector. The high penetration levels of internet has meant that
paper newspapers are losing their importance globally as the main source of news, as more
and more people are turning online to access on-line news media.
     On the limited use of ATI by the media, the Executive Director of ARIJ54 attributes this to
“lack of community pressure as it was not the outcome of a systematic struggle by civil soci-
ety.”55 In her view, it is the relationship that journalists have with public institutions that makes
it possible for them to access information without using the procedures in place. Journalists, in
general, can rely on their relations and acquaintances in order to obtain information, without
filing an official request. A 2009 survey shows that 42% of journalists do not know about the
ATI law.56
     The procedures in place are also criticized for making the work of journalists almost impos-
sible if they have to follow those procedures. Saad Hattar, Head of the Investigative Journal-
ism Department at ARIJ, has noted that journalists encounter problems due to the complexity
of procedures when they file the request, the one-month time period while they await the gov-
ernment response, and the complicated litigation procedure when there is a refusal to provide
the requested information.57
     During a panel discussion on World Press Freedom Day on 3 May 2011, Communication
Minister Odwan said that “Journalists do not create enough pressure to get more access to
information. They should be professional and find the right sources through which to access
information. Documents will be classified in all ministries of Jordan and archived in accordance
with the Access to Information Law.”58
     As part of a study, the Jordanian Media Monitor undertook a survey among 504 journalists
in March–April 2012 to evaluate the level of “soft” containment of the media by the govern-
ment.59 The study found that 84% of the participants believe that the government uses differ-
ent “soft” means to contain the media. This is a significant increase from 2009, when the figure
for the same study was 70%. The means used for soft containment are categorized as: (i) gifts
and grants (70%), (ii) facilitation of transactions with officials (42%), and (iii) nomination to a
government position and participation in official conferences, missions and trips (36%).

Al Ra’i Newspaper

Al-Rai60 (meaning The Opinion) is an Arabic daily newspaper in Jordan founded in 1971. The
newspaper is owned and published by the Jordan Press Foundation, which is government-
owned (the Social Security Corporation is the Company’s largest shareholder, with an owner-
ship stake varying between 55% and 65%, followed by the Arab Bank with a 10% holding).61
It is the official newspaper in Jordan and has more than 200 journalists. It also owns 35 news
websites. The Jordan Press Foundation also owns the Jordan Times,62 an English-language
daily founded in 1975.

          The interview with the representatives of Al-Rai focused on the limited use of RTI by Al-Rai
      journalists because they have the possibility of using other means to access public information.
      They consider the ATI procedure very long, and their privileged situation of being part of one
      of the oldest and most widely respected Jordanian newspapers helps them to find sources of
      information in an efficient way. They also collaborate with some CSOs to cover campaigns and
      activities, but generally they do not cover very sensitive information. They support the new
      amendments to the Press and Publications Law, because they believe this will improve the
      organization of the electronic media sector. They also find the level of knowledge and aware-
      ness about ATI very low, attributing this to the absence of sanctions in the ATI law, and the fact
      that the decisions of the ICO are not binding.

      Radio Al-Balad

      Radio Al-Balad was founded as an independent radio station through AmmanNet.Net in 2000
      as the first internet radio station in the Arab region. This radio received a ten-year FM license
      in 2005 and has been broadcasting news, alternative music and special programs since then.
      Since this station focused a lot of its work on empowerment of different segments of society,
      the community radio station in Amman has become a model community radio providing train-
      ing services and networking opportunities for local, regional and international groups.
          Radio Al-Balad’s efforts have not been without problems. AmmanNet.Net’s publication63
      reports that the speaker of the Jordanian parliament stopped their unique (for the region) live
      radio broadcasts of the parliament; governors in various districts have banned the Radio from
      holding public events and debates; and the mayor of Amman has continued to prohibit the
      Radio from broadcasting live the capital’s monthly council meeting. The Radio survived some
      legal lawsuits and others are still not resolved. The efforts of the Radio to establish radio sta-
      tions in some regions of Jordan were rejected by the government without any explanation, and
      their advocacy for the reform of Jordan’s Audio Visual law, which adds extra fees for stations
      that broadcast news and politics, has yet to produce results.
          Radio Al-Balad has helped citizens reach government officials and find solutions to their
      requests. Examples of such cases relate to service delivery and access to basic rights such as
      education, the National Aid Fund and essential services.
          Radio Al-Balad is one of the main initiators of RFIs and their follow-up. The Radio launched
      an Investigative Unit that is working on a daily basis on important cases, and they try to use
      ATI to get the information they need about stories in the daily news about cases of corruption
      or misuse of public services. The Investigative Unit received correspondence from the IC on
      24 April 2013 responding to different cases that had been appealed.
          This correspondence, consisting of eight responses, presents some statistics that are
      not published in the Annual Report of the IC, and indicates that, for many RFIs, the informa-
      tion is not released because it is considered an exception under Article 14 of the law: These
      responses are:

            i. Number of appeals since the establishment of the IC. The response mentions
               25 cases where the IC decided not to accept the appeal and thus not to ask the
               public institution to release the information, considering it an exception. In some
               cases, the expression “taking into consideration article 14 of the law” was added to
               the response to provide a legal basis to consider this information as an exception.
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                      399




      ii. Annual Reports of the IC. The requester of the Annual Reports of the IC was directed
          to request such reports since 2008 from the Prime Minister and not from the IC.
      iii. Appeals before the HCJ. In response to a request for statistics regarding the number
           appeals before the HCJ, the IC directed the requester to request this information
           from the Court itself.
      iv. Number of IC meetings. The IC has held 28 meetings since its establishment.
       v. Minutes of IC meetings. The minutes of the meetings of the IC are not available to
          the public but the agenda of the meetings can be requested.
      vi. Classification of documents. In response to the letter of the IC, 92 ministries and
          public institutions indicated that they have classified their information and provided
          the IC with the titles of the secret documents in their possession.
     vii. Expert opinion. The IC invited some experts from the civil service to give their opin-
          ions about some cases (e.g. the legal adviser of the National Library).
     viii. ATI law amendments. The last response denied the request to give the content of
           the proposed amendments of the ATI law because they are classified under the
           exceptions, as stated in article 14 of the ATI law. However, the IC could give the
           names of the persons and institutions who contributed to the amendments. The IC
           proposed to the requester of this information to contact these contributors to find
           out about their proposed amendments.

     The interview with Radio Al-Balad64 showed that some of the media professionals do not
trust the IC’s decisions and they have concerns about the transparency of the official statistics
provided. They also claim that knowledge of the ATI law among public institutions and the par-
liament is very limited. They also criticize the IC for its lack of initiative and its limited diligence.
They find accessing public information very hard and sometimes the requester has to negoti-
ate to get the information.
     Media professionals consider the interest of many CSOs working on ATI as just seasonal,
because there are no organizations working exclusively on ATI, as a result of the limited fund-
ing available. The work on ATI takes place at the time of the celebration of the Right to Know
day and there is no sustainable support for litigation. They find the role played by CSOs really
limited and centralized in the capital. They also describe the situation as suffering from a sig-
nificant lack of political will, with the existing initiatives generally feeding relationships with the
elite and attracting approval from the government.


5.4. INVOLVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR
IN CREATING THE DEMAND FOR RTI
The LSAI considers all requesters of public information as individuals (Jordanian citizens) and
does not allow organizations or companies of any type to submit an RFI.
    Citizens’ involvement in developing a sustainable demand for ATI is limited, which can be
explained by the Jordanian context. Political participation of the public is relatively limited and
the membership of CSOs working on ATI is very limited. Some pioneers, who have funded
CSOs that are working on ATI, and a limited number of advocates, who have undertaken
research and become actively involved in advocacy work, are demanding better ATI in Jordan.

         BOX 3. THE WASTED RIGHT:65 RESULTS OF TWO SURVEYS CONDUCTED
                AMONG JOURNALISTS
        The results of these surveys show that:
         • The number of professionals who make use of the ATI law is still very small, and there
           is clearly confusion between accessing information through using an approved official
           RFI form and the traditional means used by media professionals and journalists to
           obtain information.
         • It is evident that media professionals obtain information in a decreasing order through:
           1- phone; 2- fax; 3- E-mail; 4- hand delivery; 5- direct interview and/or friends.
         • Most of the information requested by the information professionals does not include
           written, photographed or electronic documents, which reveals that the information
           obtained by the information professionals is actually oral and not supported by
           documents.
         • Only 1.8% of those surveyed have asked for the official request form, while 98.2% have
           never asked for any form because they have never made requests in this way.
         • The timeline used by officials to respond to official requests fluctuated between
           60 and 150 days; in exceptional cases, it was much less, sometimes less than 12 hours
           and sometimes between 3 to 5 days.
         • Most of the applicants who do not receive answers to their requests do not resort to
           filing complaints or appeals against the public institution concerned.




          Stakeholders interviewed do not consider the private sector as an actor involved in advo-
      cacy for better ATI. Some CSOs are considering how to engage the local private sector in such
      advocacy, but these efforts are still very limited. CDFJ is considering the integration of ATI into
      a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative that will target the private sector with the aim of
      getting it involved in the ATI agenda and its implementation.



      6. Broader Political Environment
      The realization of other rights, such as the freedom of association, freedom of speech and
      freedom of the press, affects the level of awareness and implementation of ATI. The mobiliza-
      tion of a group of journalists since the adoption in 2012 of the amendments to the Law on
      Press and Publications shows how this has resulted in the marginalization of these activists
      and the extent to which they have lacked support.66 Although the Jordanian government does
      not engage in extensive blocking of websites, behind-the-scenes pressure for private entities
      to delete or block content on their sites or servers continues. In 2012 the parliament adopted
      amendments that require news websites to register with the government. Meanwhile, online
      tools—particularly news websites and the social media—have played an important role in
      mobilizing public protests to oppose restrictions to free expression and to call for broader
      political reforms.67 Different articles published on the internet describe the blocking of over
      200 websites, mainly news and political websites.68
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                              401




6.1. POLITICAL WILL FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Since adoption of the LSAI, no central agency has been in charge of its promotion and imple-
mentation. All recommendations initiated by the IC have had to be adopted by the Prime
Minister and implemented through an executive order. Since 2012, and after Jordan’s adoption
of the OGP Action Plan, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation—in addition to
the Minister of Culture who heads the IC—started advocating and focusing on the implemen-
tation of ATI. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation presented some recom-
mendations on ATI in the framework of the OGP, which were implemented by executive order
following adoption by the Prime Minister.

6.2. EMERGING EFFORTS FOR MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LSAI
Since the adoption of the LSAI in 2007, there has been a critical lack of implementation, and
the majority of Executive Orders for its enforcement have not received the full attention of
public institutions.69 Moreover, civil society advocates consider the ATI amendments proposed
by the Government to be negative. They criticize these amendments because of their limited
scope and, in their view, the amendments will not change significantly the effectiveness of ATI
in Jordan. On the other hand, the membership of Jordan in the OGP seems to be giving impe-
tus to a new set of incentives that might have a positive effect on the implementation of ATI.
    The number of ATI training courses and events has increased significantly since 2012. It
seems that ATI is becoming an important element in the governance agenda and that is why
more efforts are being conducted in support of the consistent and widespread application of
LSAI procedures.
    Civil society advocates70 believe that particularly strong efforts have been made in the last
2 years to implement LSAI. Two specific factors, if not more, can explain the change of attitude
and the better communication about ATI among different stakeholders. First, specific CSOs
have focused their work on ATI and developed some advocacy tools to promote better imple-
mentation of LSAI; they point out the limited quality of LSAI in comparison to new legislation
promoted in the region (Tunisia and Yemen). Second, the membership of Jordan in the OGP
has definitely brought a new incentive to deliver on the implementation of ATI and make it an
indicator of the government’s progress in general.71

6.3. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT
The Constitution of Jordan and especially its recent amendments and the commitments formu-
lated in the National Charter in the early 1990s provide strong support for freedom of expres-
sion, access to information and the role of the media. However, an assessment of Jordan’s
media law framework, based on UNESCO Media Indicators, reveals that there are a number of
ways in which free speech and the rights of the media are undermined in legislation, regula-
tions and practice.72 The Jordanian media environment is relatively diverse, but reporters often
lack adequate expertise, ignore professional standards, and indulge in self-censorship because
of biases, employers’ affiliations, fear of legal consequences, if not sometimes also fear of
physical threats in a context of impunity, and lack of accountability by duty-bearers. Media
professionals are also aware of “red-lines-not-to-cross” (if not taboo topics), mostly related to
the monarchy as well as to religious and ethnic issues. Investigative reporting and reporting on
certain topics of common interest such as the environment, gender equality and human rights
are not encouraged.73
402                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           The relative political openness that Jordan has experienced since the 1990s has led,
      despite fluctuations, to a better environment for the growth of CSOs, in which they have been
      able to practice their activities more freely. Increased political openness has also attracted
      international attention to its civil society and enabled it to benefit from substantial support
      from various sources.
           The limited number of public institutions implementing the ATI law illustrates the limited
      awareness of the existence and the content of the LSAI. As shown in different surveys,74 there
      is a serious lack of knowledge and use of RTI. To remedy this situation, during the last two
      years, some training courses for government officials, MPs, CSOs and the media about the
      benefits of making use of the ATI law have been conducted, mainly by national CSOs with
      international funds.

      6.4. JORDAN’S PARTICIPATION IN THE OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP75
      The Jordanian government explains the reason for and the importance of its participation
      in the OGP as follows:76 “Jordan’s successful management of its reforms will not only secure
      Jordan’s stability, but will also offer a model to follow for other countries in the region by pro-
      viding a successful road map for stabilizing and developing effective reforms.”
           The COM approved Jordan’s participation in the OGP in August 2011, and the Prime
      Minister formed an Ad-hoc Committee in October 2011, chaired by the Ministry of Planning
      and International Cooperation, comprising representatives from the public and private sectors
      in addition to CSOs. This Committee had to work on developing the Action Plan pertaining to
      Jordan’s participation in the OGP, and on identifying the reform measures to be undertaken by
      the Government of Jordan in the area of governance.
           The OGP is considered important for Jordan to move forward with the democratization
      of the development process, and to further strengthen the foundations for political inclusion,
      social stability, good governance, an efficient public sector, improved service delivery, as well
      as the rule of law.77 To this end, Jordan’s OGP National Action Plan has a specific focus on the
      following targets:

      1. Improving public services
      2. Increasing public integrity
      3. Managing public resources more effectively

          Some of the commitments under the OGP action plan have the specific objectives of
      increasing public integrity through promoting transparency and access to information and
      enhancing citizen participation in decision-making. The commitments linked to ATI were:
       • An Administrative Court would be established in order to increase transparency in public
         sector performance and enhance the specialization of the Judiciary.
       • Access to information would be improved through adopting amendments to the existing
         Access to Information Law; such amendments would not only further improve access to
         information but also ensure that the law is consistent with international best practices.
       • The annual reports for 2011 of the Audit Bureau and Anti-Corruption Commission would
         be published in the first half of 2012.
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                               403




     Jordan’s first progress report78 on the National Action Plan was published in February 2013.
In the section on “Promoting transparency and access to information, enhancing citizen partici-
pation in decision-making,” the report describes developments concerning the new Electoral
law and the creation of the Constitutional Court. There is just one mention of the amendments
to the LSAI: “The Council of Ministers approved in September 2012 the amended Access to
Information Law. The amendments facilitate the public’s access to information and enables
non-Jordanians to access information in compliance with international agreements that Jordan
has signed. Added to that, the law improves civil society organizations’ representation in the
Information Council.”
     The report does not mention the fact that the amendments have not yet entered into force
because they need to be reviewed by the legislation committee of the parliament and then
adopted by a majority of deputies in the parliament and the senate.
     The participation of Jordan in the OGP and the publication of its action plan and the prog-
ress report show that there are some departments willing to develop new initiatives and raise
the bar on matters of transparency and accountability, but the participation of CSOs on this
front is still limited or even non-existent. CSOs need to be more actively engaged, particu-
larly in following up on the commitments made by the government and in playing their role
as watchdogs.
     In the UN e-government Index, Jordan moved from position 51 in 2010 to 98 in 2012,
even though in 2012 six new e-services were created. The government is also developing its
Financial Management Information System, but raising awareness about the use of ATI is still
an increasing necessity that is recognized by the government itself.79 It is hoped that the OGP
mandate will strengthen the emphasis on ATI, bring support for more reforms and enable the
achievement of better benchmarks. Public sector integrity is intended to improve gradually,
along with the strategic reform of ATI.
     The Government recently launched a consultative multi-stakeholder process to develop an
Integrity Charter with the participation of 12 governorates and aims to develop an action plan
for its implementation.



6.5. CHECKS-AND-BALANCES INSTITUTIONS
The Ombudsman Bureau (OB) of Jordan80 receives and investigates group and individual
grievances. In coordination with the related public institutions, OB tries to reach just solutions
for the parties involved. The OB was founded on February 1, 2009 and had received more than
8,000 complaints by February 2013. The OB resolved 78% of the submitted complaints in which
the public administration was found to be in error, according to the OB President.81
     The mandate of the Ombudsman is not directly related to ATI, but many observers pro-
posed this organization as structural support to ATI implementation. In some of the proposed
amendments to the ATI law, some CSOs proposed that the OB Chair should serve as the Chair
of the IC instead of the Minister of Culture. The OB makes it possible for requesters to file a
complaint against refusals to release information by public institutions. In one specific case
described in the 2010 report of the OB,82 the OB helped a citizen employed by a university to
access information withheld by this public institution.

          During 2013, the role and mission of the OB were questioned after the decision was made
      by the National Assembly to merge the OB with the Anti-Corruption Commission. As a result,
      the future institutional framework of the OB remains unclear. Moreover, the appointment of the
      President of the OB ended on June 23, 2013 without being extended.


      6.6. EFFECTS OF OTHER LEGISLATION ON ATI EFFECTIVENESS
      Existing legislation prior to the adoption of the LSAI in 2007 has continued to hinder access to
      public information. The LSAI did not introduce any new measures to limit the scope of those
      laws, and so they have neutralized the effectiveness of the LSAI and limited the possibility of
      good implementation of ATI. The laws apply to many aspects of the administration’s environ-
      ment and the categorization of public information.
          Despite constitutional protections of freedom of information, several laws continue to
      hinder free expression and access to information. These include the Jordan Press Association
      Law (1998), the Penal Code (1960), the Defense Law (1992), the Contempt of Court Law (1959),
      the Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Classified Documents (1971), and the Press and
      Publications Law (1999 and its amendments of 2012). In this context, existing legislation will
      limit significantly the amount of accessible information, especially the Archives Law and the
      Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Classified Documents.

      The Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Documents (LPSSD)

      The LPSSD (No. 50 of 1971), and especially articles 3, 6, 8 and 10, contradict and, in many
      cases, preempt application of the LSAI. The LPSSD was originally drawn up as a temporary law,
      but it is now considered the biggest obstacle to the application of the LSAI. The scope of clas-
      sified information is overly broad in this legislation, and it fails to identify either the competent
      body in charge of classifying information and documents or an independent agency to verify
      and review the classification system. The Law mandates that classified government documents
      must be declassified after 30 years. However, it does not outline a clear mechanism for the
      classification of government documents that may be exempt from disclosure.

      ATI Law and the Press and Publications Law

      Freedom to access, obtain and circulate information and ATI, particularly from the govern-
      ment, has become a central element of freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of the
      press. The ATI legislation is crucial for journalists to fulfill their role as government watchdogs
      and encourage discussion and deliberation on issues of public concern.
          Many international and national observers consider that the Jordanian Press and Publica-
      tions Law (PPL) is very ineffective in regard to journalists’ right to access information. Further-
      more, although the LSAI provides additional guarantees and support for freedom of the press,
      unfortunately both laws have significant limitations.
          The media-specific laws that relate to freedom of information are the PPL No. 8 from
      1998 and its amendments of 2007, 2010 and 2012, and the ATI law. The right of journalists
      to obtain information is stipulated in the PPL, Articles 6 and 8. Article 6 was included in the
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                 405




original 1998 PPL and was not amended in 2007 or 2010. Article 6(c) states that freedom of the
press includes:
     “The right to obtain information, statistics and news of interest to citizens from various
sources and the right of analysis and circulation, publication and comment on the same.”
     Article 8 of the same law, significantly amended in 2007, addresses access to information in
subsections (a) and (d) stating that:
     (a). “The journalist has the right to obtain information, and the official bodies and public
institutions are obliged to facilitate his/her mission and allow him/her to view their programs,
projects and plans. The competent authority shall provide the requested information as soon
as is necessary according to the nature of the news or requested information if described as
urgent, and within a period of not more than two weeks if not described as such.”
     (d). “Within the limits in the exercise of his/her profession, and in accordance with the reg-
ulations prepared for this purpose by the authorities concerned, the journalist has the right to
attend public meetings and court hearings and public meetings of the Senate and the House
of Representatives and the meetings of the general assemblies of political parties, professional
unions, clubs and associations and other public institutions, unless such meetings or sessions
are closed meetings or confidential by law, regulation, or applicable instruction.”
     The amendments to the PPL broadened the definition of a press publication to include
electronic websites. Therefore, they are subject to the provisions of the PPL on licensing and
prohibitions. The amending law also subjected electronic information platforms to sanctioning,
such as heavy fines for violating the law’s prohibitions. Pursuant to Article 48 of the revised PPL,
non-compliance with the registration requirement may result in a fine of between JD 1,000 and
JD 5,000 (approximately USD 1,400 to 7,000). Article 49(g) also requires the Press and Publica-
tions Department to block any website that violates any provision of the amended PPL, or any
other law.
     This problem is exacerbated by the lack of procedural protections or oversight. Although
Article 42 of the amended law designates a specialized court to deal with publication related
offenses, such as civil defamation suits and security-related crimes, Article 49(g) blocking
orders are imposed by the director of Jordan’s Press and Publications Department. The court
appears to have no role in determining whether or not the blocking of websites is legitimate.
This is a clear breach of the rule, noted above, that registration systems should be overseen by
bodies which are independent of government.

The National Charter

After the elections of 1989, a royal committee was designated to prepare Jordan’s Second
National Charter of 1990. The Charter was promoted to lay the foundations for diverse political
activities based on constitutional principles and to facilitate Jordan’s transition to a more dem-
ocratic system. The Charter gained national consensus and acquired a unique status subordi-
nate to the Constitution, but no mechanisms or procedures were formulated to implement it.
    Chapter Six of the Charter on “Information and Communication” highlights the role of
mass media in “strengthening the democratic process,” and provides that “Citizens must
have the right to know and to access information from legitimate transmission and publica-
tion sources within Jordan and abroad.” It states, “The circulation of news and data must be
406                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      regarded as an indivisible part of the freedom of the press and information. The state must
      guarantee free access to information to the extent that it does not jeopardize national security
      or the national interest.”



      7. Conclusion
      The absence of consultation prior to the vote on the ATI law in 2007 meant that no stakehold-
      ers were involved, and CSOs, in particular, had to develop their capacities to acquire the
      necessary expertise and raise awareness about this new right that “has been offered.”83 CSOs
      and some media professionals played a key role in addressing the ATI situation by carrying out
      studies and analysis to show the gaps in the implementation of the ATI law.
           The analysis of the implementation of ATI in Jordan shows the importance of investing
      in the building blocks before aspiring to new dynamics of change. The development of ATI
      needs strong public institutions with the capacity to deal with the potential demand for public
      information. However, in Jordan there was no great demand, and this is very closely intercon-
      nected with the limitations of the institutions in place to implement the ATI law. The right to
      access information was conveyed in an administrative environment where secrecy was the
      rule, and the LSAI did not change this reality. At its origins, the LSAI had several shortcomings
      compared to other existing models of ATI and this contributed continuously to the failure of its
      implementation.
           Depending on the lens we use to analyze the Jordanian experience in implementing ATI,
      very different conclusions can be drawn. Almost seven years have passed since the adoption
      of the LSAI and the main surveys developed by CSOs show that its implementation is still very
      weak. The progress made during the last two years has exceeded by far the progress that was
      achieved during the first five years of implementation. However, some developed countries
      that approved new ATI laws in the past have dedicated a significant amount of time to prepar-
      ing for this cultural shift in the local administration and developing the basic mechanisms for
      implementation of the law. What is surprising in the Jordanian case is the absence of prevailing
      logic to explain why its ATI legislation was adopted after 30 minutes of debate in the parlia-
      ment, with all the consequences that it would create for all the stakeholders involved.
           The recent emergence of new ATI laws in the MENA region, especially in Tunisia and
      Yemen, and the better quality of legislation being adopted in the region are raising the bar of
      ATI standards at the regional level. If Jordan used to be the exception after 2007, this reality
      has changed within the last few years and increasing voices are advocating for amending the
      ATI law in Jordan. The political changes that have happened in other countries in the region
      and their consequences on the enactment of new ATI legislation in Tunisia and Yemen and the
      constitutionalizing of ATI in Morocco have highlighted the limitations of Jordan’s experience
      with ATI. Such changes elsewhere in the region have given CSOs and observers some bench-
      marks to advocate for a better ATI law and pursue its substantial implementation.
           Many initiatives have been developed in the last few years to work with MPs and govern-
      ment institutions to raise awareness about the existence of the law and identify its shortcom-
      ings. Because of these developments, the Government presented minor amendments to
      the Parliament in 2012, but major CSOs mobilized different stakeholders and especially MPs
      to block these amendments and pursue more significant changes. Without these important
A CASE STUDY OF JORDAN                                                                                407




measures, successful implementation and better benchmarking at the regional level are almost
impossible.
     Furthermore, the recent membership of Jordan in the OGP in 2011 is bringing a set of new
commitments and reforms on transparency and accountability that is creating momentum for
improving the ATI agenda. However, this will require a more significant mobilization of CSOs
and the public to create major pressure on the parliament and state bodies to enact better
legislation and develop the critical means to monitor its implementation.
     To improve the quality of the existing ATI law and strengthen its implementation, CSOs
have to increase their ability to cooperate and work in partnership with the parliament and
senators to raise a critical majority that may force the government to withdraw the existing
proposed amendments and increase their scope and quality. An alternative, albeit harder,
approach would involve reaching a more significant number of deputies to propose a new ATI
law and lobby for its vote.
     More extensive efforts are needed to develop knowledge around ATI and encourage its
use, especially among government departments responsible for its enforcement. CSOs with
sufficient support, especially at the local level in governorates, can play a significant role in
explaining and promoting the use of ATI and facilitating the flow of information to citizens and
journalists.
     Finally, the tour de force of the whole ATI situation in Jordan consists in increasing the use
of the existing LSAI. If the demand for ATI with its existing limitations grows, this will result
in greater political and societal support for reform and will create sustainable dynamics for
change. The government will then be in a position to adapt to the new reality by making fun-
damental adjustments to the LSAI and improving the environment for its implementation.

Annex 1. Methodology


The World Resources Institute, in collaboration with different partners, is conducting the
World Bank RTI Implementation project to provide a greater understanding of the key issues
surrounding current RTI implementation practices and enforcement in Jordan, South Africa,
Thailand, and the United States through a case study analysis.
     The first phase of the project consisted in developing and refining the methodology to use
in effectively evaluating RTI implementation in these four countries presenting varying states of
RTI development and implementation. The project aims to develop a case study to assess RTI
legislation, its implementation, enforcement and performance.
     In Jordan, the study started with a desk research to identify and review all the studies
developed in Jordan on ATI since the enactment of the law in 2007. The second step consisted
in looking at the formal institutional mechanisms set up to build public sector capacity and
incentives for compliance with RTI, as well as the broader enabling environment that drives
how the RTI regime functions.
     It is important to take into consideration the limited years of existence of the ATI law in
Jordan and its limited implementation for a benchmarking exercise. The most recent data
is available, but no information was collected before 2012 on the number of RFIs submit-
ted to institutions covered by the law. The agency-specific data on ATI is not available for
all agencies, and where it exists, it is partial and does not allow for a breakdown of agency
performance.
     The desk research was conducted in September and October and the interviews and the
field research were carried out in Amman, Jordan from 20 October to 1 November 2013. More
than 25 interviews were led in situ with different stakeholders (government and public agen-
cies, media and civil society). A first list of interviewees was established before the mission with
all the existing organizations and experts who have produced reports on ATI or have taken part
in regional and global meetings. The list was finalized with other stakeholders who are work-
ing directly or indirectly on ATI, and their feedback was crucial to analyze and comprehend in
detail the functioning of the ATI system in Jordan.
     The report focused on evaluating three government agencies: the Ministry of Agriculture,
the Ministry of Environment and the Information Council / Information Commissioner.
     The case study highlights the latest data available on ATI implementation and tries to
cover all studies developed by different stakeholders. CSOs’ work on ATI is more accessible
and they are the main actors assessing the implementation of ATI and the performance of the
mechanisms in place.

     A Case Study of South Africa

1. Introduction and Summary of Findings
1.1. INTRODUCTION
After enduring a long struggle against oppression and autocratic rule under the apartheid era,
South Africa cemented its transformation into a modern democracy with the historic general
elections of 1994. Culminating with the passage of the Constitution of the Republic of South
Africa in 1996, South Africa created a broad foundation for an open and accountable govern-
ment. The protection of human rights was highlighted in the embedded Bill of Rights. This
inclusion of socio-economic, political, and civil rights was seen, by most, as a commitment from
political leaders to a more representative, participatory form of governance in South Africa’s
public institutions.1
     Included in this broad list was the right to information (RTI). Section 32 of the Constitution
guarantees the “right of access to any information held by the state and any information that
is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights.”2
Because control of information and enforced secrecy were such essential tools of the apart-
heid government,3 it is significant that this section of the Constitution not only includes the
right to access state information but the right to access information held by a private body or
individual as well. There is widespread recognition among academics and RTI advocates that
this broad inclusion of access to information represented one of the most unique and powerful
delineations of RTI in law at the time.4
     The final constitution came into effect on February 3, 1997. It required the passage of
enabling legislation for the right to access information within three years. This requirement
is the genesis for South Africa’s Promotion of Access to Information Act of 2000 (PAIA). PAIA
recognizes in its preamble the fundamental connection between access to information and
democracy. It states that “the system of government of in South Africa before 27 April 1994,
amongst others, resulted in a secretive and unresponsive culture in public and private bodies
which often led to an abuse of power and human rights violations.”5
     Almost immediately after and consistently since its passage, PAIA implementation has
been tracked and analyzed by a broad range of stakeholders.6 In practice, implementation
of PAIA has not lived up to the noble ideals and exuberant expectations surrounding the


                                                                                                      425

      end of apartheid and passage of this RTI law. A host of implementations issues have been
      documented and the limitations within the law have been highlighted. This case study briefly
      outlines the passage and legislative scope of PAIA. It analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of
      implementation and the key actors involved during its 13-year history.

      1.2. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
      PAIA implementation has been both positively and negatively impacted by a wide range of
      overlapping and interconnected issues.
         The factors that have influenced the success of PAIA implementation include:
       • The overall strength of the law and a strong foundational support for access to informa-
         tion within the South African Constitution. The law is comprehensive and includes a clear
         procedural outline. PAIA was also the first law to allow the submission of requests to
         private bodies.
       • The strong, independent and internationally well respected Constitutional Court. In most
         cases the court has ordered the release of information in PAIA cases. These cases have
         played a central role in shaping PAIA’s enforcement as well as in elaborating its scope.
       • A vibrant and active civil society. Civil society organizations (CSOs) have a long history of
         advocating for access to information. They engage in a wide range of tactics and strate-
         gies to improve the legislative strength of PAIA, its compliance and implementation, and
         broader goals of using PAIA to improve the human and civil rights of South Africans.
       • A competent oversight and monitoring institution. The South African Human Rights
         Commission’s PAIA unit takes its PAIA mandate seriously despite consistently limited
         resources and a lack of political support.

         Drivers of failure that have impeded effective PAIA implementation include:
       • The lack of an independent, enforcement and compliance mechanism outside the court
         system. Litigation as the only recourse results in a slow, expensive, and complicated pro-
         cess. It limits the number of requests that can be challenged and reduces the effectiveness
         of the law.
       • The overall lack of political will and awareness of PAIA by senior Ministry officials. Together
         with the subsequent lack of prioritization within public institutions, this has resulted in
         inadequate staffing, limited budgets, poor training, and unclear information request
         procedures.
       • The low use and lack of awareness of PAIA within the general population. This has con-
         tributed to government officials’ justifications for ignoring PAIA requirements. It has also
         fueled the perception that PAIA is only effective for a small group of elite organizations.
       • The overuse and appearance of arbitrary use of PAIA exemptions. This has led to the
         perception that information officers are not well versed with PAIA requirements and proce-
         dures and are motivated to limit the amount of information released. This overuse has also
         increased the number of cases taken to court.
       • Lack of sanctions outlined in PAIA. This has contributed to ongoing poor compliance as
         there is no consequence for ignoring PAIA requirements.

 • Insufficient resources. Institutions do not have the budgets to adequately support staff-
   ing, training, records management, or strategic planning and communication. The South
   African Human Rights Commission has repeatedly cited the lack of resources as a signifi-
   cant impediment to carrying out its PAIA mandate.
 • Poor records management. The use of manual records management systems, minimal
   budgets, and a lack of support from senior management has impacted the capacity of
   government officials to locate and produce requested information.
 • Weak political support for improving PAIA implementation. Despite repeated efforts by
   civil society and the South African Human Rights Commission to persuade political leaders
   to address poor PAIA compliance, no political champions have come forward to ensure
   these issues are addressed. The lack of support has contributed to the perception that
   political leaders are more interested in limiting access to information as a screen for hiding
   corruption.

    The cost, complexity, and expense of pursuing appeals will be addressed by the Protection
of Personal Information Act (POPIA) and the creation of an Information Regulator. Passed by
Parliament in September 2012, POPIA has not been implemented to date. However, the Infor-
mation Regulator will have powers to investigate and mediate PAIA conflicts. It will also have
the power to oversee compliance, monitoring, and promotion of the law.



2. Passage of PAIA: History and Context
In 1994, Deputy-President Mbeki appointed Advocate Mojuanku Gumbi to chair the Task
Group on Open Democracy. The Task Group’s goal was to develop a set of policy proposals
needed to give effect to the enabling legislation.7 Initially, the Task Group sought to include
broader constitutional principles of public participation, accountability, and transparency.
Inspired by a wide range international RTI legislation including the laws of Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States,8 these policies were pre-
sented to Parliament in 1996 as the draft Open Democracy Bill. It included five important open
and democratic governance principles:9

1. Proactive publication of government information;
2. Access to government records;
3. The correction and protection of personal information held by governmental and private
   bodies, including privacy protections;
4. Access to government meetings; and

5. Protection of whistleblowers.10

    However, the larger governmental political transition was proving to be a difficult and time
consuming process and the debate over priorities influenced the development of the law. Dur-
ing this time the executive and other governmental departments made substantial changes
to the bill.11 Citing a desire to only address the issue of access to personal information and
no other privacy related concerns, the data protection chapter of the bill was removed. The
428                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      open meetings chapter was removed as well. Cabinet records were excluded after concerns
      were raised about the unintended consequences of unrestricted access to information.12 While
      the importance of whistleblower protection was confirmed, the Parliamentary Joint Ad Hoc
      Committee on the Open Democracy Bill agreed it was not appropriate to include it in legisla-
      tion dealing with the right of access to information, so it was also removed and taken up under
      separate legislation.13
          Further, the enforcement provisions attracted controversy and were contested.14 Modeled
      on the Information Commissions seen in other countries, the Task Force originally recom-
      mended the development of an Open Democracy Commission to provide for the promotion
      and monitoring of the law and a separate Information Court to handle complaints and appeals
      (after internal appeals decisions were exhausted at the public institutional level).15 After a long
      process of consultation and deliberation, however, the Cabinet instead provided for disputes
      to be litigated in the High Courts. The promotional and monitoring duties were given entirely
      to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC).16
          The Committee noted that other jurisdictions had created an Information Commissioner
      and that “this system enjoys great success,” but they also were “aware of the lack of financial
      and other resources, and it is not intended or advisable to allow for a proliferation of commis-
      sions, despite the desirability of such alternative less adversarial type of enforcement mecha-
      nisms in our nascent democracy.”17 However, because the committee recognized that the
      existing formal court procedures would not allow for the easy settlement of informal disputes,
      the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJCD) was requested to inves-
      tigate the feasibility of establishing an enforcement mechanism like the Information Commis-
      sioner and report back to the committee within 12 months after promulgation of the bill.18
      However, in reality this type of enforcement mechanism has only recently been considered.
          Eventually in October 1997, the Open Democracy Bill was published for comment before
      being introduced to Parliament in July 1998. The Justice Portfolio Committee Chairperson,
      Mr. J De Lange, called the Bill “the most complex piece of legislation since the Truth and Rec-
      onciliation Commission Bill.”19 In 1999, the National Assembly’s Portfolio Committee on Justice
      took up the bill and held public hearings. South Africa’s second democratic elections were
      held in June 1999. With the constitutionally mandated deadline looming, the bill was passed
      to the Parliamentary Ad Hoc Joint Committee who took up the task of developing the final
      piece of legislation and held a second round of consultations. By the time the bill was passed,
      the scope had been narrowed significantly and the name had been changed to the now more
      appropriate Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA). Overall, the legislative changes
      made over the course of debate foreshadowed many of the implementation and enforcement
      challenges documented by PAIA stakeholders and government officials.
          Passed in 2000, PAIA was warmly welcomed by most South Africans who knew about it,
      especially by social justice activists who saw the possibilities for using PAIA to access informa-
      tion around apartheid-era human rights violations.20 Inspired by the grassroots movement of
      India, advocates were also eager to apply PAIA for the protection of socio-economic rights
      including the right to have access to adequate housing, healthcare, water, sufficient food, and
      basic education.21 PAIA’s goal is to “foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public
      and private bodies by giving effect to the right of access to information and actively promote
      a society in which the people of South Africa have effective access to information to enable
      them to more fully exercise and protect all of their rights.”22

3. Legal Environment and Compliance
PAIA came into effect on March 9, 2001. Although the right to information under PAIA is more
limited than that under Section 32 of the Constitution,23 its governance takes precedence over
other legislation that may restrict access to information. The Access to Information Europe and
Center for Law and Democracy’s Global Right to Information rating places South Africa 14th out
of 95 countries when evaluating RTI laws in comparison to international best practice, citing its
strong legal framework based on a clear constitutional right to access all government informa-
tion and “backing by a robust promotion regime.”24


3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
All people have a right to access information including non-citizens and non-residents of
South Africa as long as they comply with the Act’s requirements.25 A company or association
is also allowed to request information. PAIA allows information to be requested from national,
provincial, and municipal departments as well as Chapter 9 Institutions,26 but limits the right of
access to records or recorded information (regardless of form or medium). Requesters do not
have to specify a reason for submitting information requests to these public bodies. The law
also allows public bodies to make requests for information to private bodies, but specifically
prohibits them from making requests to other public institutions.
     Records of the Cabinet, its committees, or individual members of parliament and provincial
legislatures are excluded from release requirements. Judicial functions of a court or special tri-
bunals or decisions regarding the appointment of a judicial officer are exempted as well. PAIA
applies to all records regardless of when they were created, an important fact given the sordid
history of records management under the apartheid governmental era.27
     South Africa was the first country to give individuals the right to access information from
private companies. However, to gain access to this information, a person must show that the
information is required to protect another right. Thus, unlike with public body records, the
ability to access private records is limited and requires the requester to state what right they
wish to exercise or protect, the record required, and why that record is required to exercise
or protect that right.28 The courts have determined that political parties are defined as private
bodies for the purposes of PAIA requests.29
     Despite this unique inclusion in the law, very few requests are submitted to private bod-
ies.30 CSOs have said it is challenging to demonstrate that a record requested from a private
body is required for the exercise or protection of a right. This challenge has been exacerbated
by legal interpretation that the requester has to show that the records requested are “essential
or necessary” rather than “useful or relevant” for such exercise/protection.31


3.2. EXEMPTIONS
PAIA contains a long and detailed list of exemptions including protections for commercial
information of third parties, trade secrets, financial, commercial, scientific, or technical infor-
mation, or information supplied in confidence. Most exemptions are subject to a harm test.
Exemptions must also be balanced against a public interest test that requires disclosure if the
information shows a failure to comply with the law or a serious public safety or environment
430                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      risk. It also applies in cases where the public interest clearly outweighs the harm. This public
      interest clause in PAIA trumps all exemptions, even in cases of national interest. Specifically,
      if a requester can show that obtaining the information is more important than the harm from
      disclosure, information should be released.
           Public and private bodies must refuse access if the request involves the unreasonable
      disclosure of personal information about a third party, including a deceased person. A private
      body must also refuse a request for access if the request:
       • Contains commercial information;
       • Constitutes a breach of a duty or confidence;
       • Can reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of an individual;
       • Contains privileged information from production in legal proceedings; or
       • Contains information about research being carried out.

           Civil society stakeholders interviewed have expressed concern regarding the overuse of
      PAIA exemptions by government officials responsible for PAIA implementation.32 They believe
      officers have taken more of a “menu or checklist approach” when determining if and what
      exemptions can be used to deny a request instead of taking the time to determine accurate
      grounds for refusal.33 Stakeholders believe the overuse has contributed to a high rate of refusal
      of information requests in general. This overuse also has increased the number of the PAIA
      related litigation cases based on disagreements over the appropriate use of these exemptions
      and application of the public interest test. One interviewee suggested that “negotiating what
      is and is not an exemption appears to be part of the information request process.”34

      3.3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
      Requests must be submitted to a designated Information Officer using a prescribed form. The
      law defines this officer as the administrative head of a public institution responsible for PAIA
      implementation. The Information Officer has the power to designate a Deputy Information
      Officer to take over the responsibilities of PAIA, including receiving and responding to
      requests. PAIA stipulates information officers are “necessary to render the public body as
      accessible as responsibly possible for requesters of its records.”35
          The request form can be submitted by mail, fax or electronic mail. It must also identify the
      record requested and the applicant. A separate form is required for information requests sub-
      mitted to private businesses although information required on this form is essentially the same.
          A requester who is unable to submit a written form may make an oral request. Similarly,
      government information officers must provide “reasonable assistance, free of charge, as
      necessary to enable applicants to make requests.”36 Government information officers must also
      take reasonable steps to make records available in an appropriate form for a requester with a
      disability. Private bodies are not required to provide any of these services.
          Information must be granted in the requested language if it exists in that language. There
      is no obligation to translate a record into the preferred language of the requester. The law
      contains detailed provisions for the transfer of requests whenever the record requested is in
      the possession of a different public body. It requires the transfer to occur as soon as possible
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                           431




or within 14 days. Further, the original officer is obliged to inform the requester of the transfer
and the name of the officer to which it was transferred.
     Both public and private bodies may charge applicants fees for requests including for the
reproduction of the record and for search and preparation. The DOJCD establishes the sched-
ule of fees. There are income threshold exceptions to payment as well as Minister authorized
exemptions.
     Public and private bodes must notify a requester of the decision to grant or refuse access
within 30 days of receiving the request. Partial disclosure of information requested is allowed
under the law. The period for response can be extended for another 30 days when a request is
for a large number of records or would unreasonably interfere with the activities of the institu-
tion. The applicant must be notified of any time extensions. Failure to respond to a request
within the prescribed time is defined as a deemed refusal of access. There are no provisions for
responding to urgent requests.
     However, despite the clear request procedures outlined in the law, in practice stakeholders
including the SAHRC, have highlighted a number of barriers to access to information resulting
from the way these procedures have been drafted. Despite efforts after the end of apartheid
to make the regulatory process more accessible by creating simplified language require-
ments, language remains a significant obstacle for the use and awareness of PAIA.37 South
Africa has 11 official languages including English, Afrikaans, and Zulu. Only a minority of the
African population speaks and understands English, yet English remains the primary language
of government.38 Further, the form uses bureaucratic language that many people find difficult
to understand.39
     Having a form-based information request procedure can be an obstacle for illiterate low-
income community members who may not have easy access to the form, technology (printers,
email, internet, etc.) or the information on procedures needed to submit a request.40 Further,
most civil society stakeholders interviewed believe the support provided by government
officials is not easily or readily obtainable in practice.41 In a 2003 information request analysis,
the Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC), an important CSO leading access to information
work in South Africa, found that 70% of oral requests could not be submitted.42 In particular,
blind and illiterate requesters were found to experience severe obstacles in making requests.
Though some departments, including the Premier of the Eastern Cape and the Department
of Defense displayed some commitment to assisting disadvantaged requesters, the study
concluded that “PAIA is inaccessible for the illiterate.”43
     Charging a fee can impede access for many community members who may not be aware
of the procedure for requesting a waiver. The implementation of charging a fee has also been
documented as a problem.44 In one incident, ODAC submitted an information request, was
sent letters asking for the fee, and then after payment, never received a response to their
request.45
     CSOs have also documented an increase in the use of time extensions for responding to
requests and have suggested it may reflect the need for more institutional resources or the
overuse of the third party notification requirements.46 This overuse, in conjunction with the lack
of a provision for urgent applications, diminishes the “contextual seriousness” of complying
with the time periods.47
432                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      3.4. APPEALS/COURT
      Presently there are two levels of appeals under PAIA: an internal appeal within the public body
      and after that avenue has been exhausted, application to the courts. A requester can lodge an
      internal appeal using the appropriate form if the public body has
       • issued a refusal,
       • failed to respond to a request at all (a deemed refusal),
       • surpassed the time period,
       • charged an inappropriate fee, or
       • granted access in a form other than that requested.

            A third party is also permitted to lodge an appeal against a decision to release information
      that affects them. There is no provision, however, for an internal review at private institutions.
      Requesters must go straight to court when an information request is denied.
           In refusal cases, an information officer must state adequate reasons, including the provi-
      sion of the act relied upon to make a decision, and inform the requester on his or her right
      to lodge an internal appeal. There is a growing body of case law on the adequate level of
      justification required.48
           A request must be refused if disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the
      life or physical safety of an individual. Notwithstanding exclusions in the public interest, public
      bodies must also refuse requests pertaining to the police docket law, enforcement and legal
      proceedings, legally privileged records, revenue collection information, as well as requests
      considered frivolous or vexatious.
           PAIA includes little enforcement or sanction provisions. It is a criminal offence to destroy
      damage, alter, conceal or falsify a record with intent to deny a right of access. Regulations
      issued by the Minster of Justice in 2006 also make it an offense for an information officer to
      fail to make Section 14 or 51 manuals available or to charge a fee for reviewing or copying
      this publicly available information. However, PAIA also ensures no person shall be liable for
      anything done in good faith.
           The institution of the Public Protector receives complaints against government agencies
      and officials and has the power to investigate and take appropriate remedial action. This man-
      date includes the power to resolve disputes related to PAIA through mediation, conciliation,
      or negotiation. However simply refusing a request for information is not sufficient cause for
      action; a claimant must show a right was violated, making this a difficult avenue for resolution.
      Further, it is up to the office to determine what cases it pursues and the inability to final-
      ize cases quickly limits the usefulness of this office.49 The SAHRC is also empowered to hear
      complaints, but because it can only make recommendations and cannot formally sanction, its
      enforcement responsibilities are, by definition, limited.50
           The lack of an independent, intermediate compliance and enforcement mechanism has
      been consistently raised by virtually all PAIA stakeholders inside and outside the govern-
      ment as a major weakness in the law.51 It is one of most important explanations cited for poor
      enforcement and a formidable disincentive to ordinary individuals to use their right to access
      information.52
           The cost, complexity, and expense of pursuing appeals has been cited as a primary reason
      only a handful of cases have been taken to the courts.53 This issue was directly addressed in
      the recently signed Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). Introduced in August 2009,
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                           433




this bill was passed by Parliament in September 2012 and signed by the President. Although it
has not been implemented to date, all stakeholders interviewed are hopeful this legal frame-
work improvement will help strengthen PAIA implementation and access to information for all
South Africans.

Information Regulator

POPIA will regulate and protect access to personal information, although the request proce-
dure under PAIA will continue to apply. The bill establishes an Information Regulator that will
have powers to investigate and mediate conflicts surrounding other components of the per-
sonal information bill and PAIA. The PAIA compliance, monitoring, and promotion responsibili-
ties of the SAHRC will be transferred to this office as well. The Regulator will be empowered to
assess whether a public or private body generally complies with the PAIA policies and imple-
mentation procedures. The Regulator will be independent and accountable to the National
Assembly of Parliament.
    Once the internal appeal process has been exhausted, a requester (or third party) will be
able to submit a complaint to the Information Regulator. The Regulator will also hear cases
where an internal appeal was refused because it was submitted past the deadline.
    After receiving a recommendation from the enforcement committee, the Regulator can
serve a public or private body with an enforcement notice. The Regulator will have the power
to confirm, amend, or set aside the initial decision. It will also have the authority to require the
body to take or refrain from taking action. A body that refuses to comply with an enforcement
notice can be found guilty of an offense and liable upon conviction to a fine and/or imprison-
ment for no more than 3 years. Decisions of the Regulator may be appealed to the courts.


3.5. IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY OF THE OVERSIGHT AGENCIES
South African Human Rights Commission

The Human Rights Commission Act 53 of 1994 established the SAHRC. It was launched on
March 21, 1996 with a mandate to promote respect for human rights and a culture of human
rights; promote the protection, development and attainment of human rights; and monitor
and assess the observance of human rights in the Republic. SAHRC’s leadership consists of up
to 11 Commissioners and a Secretariat, although there are rarely 11 Commissioners appointed
at one time. Commissioners provide strategic leadership and direct policy. They are appointed
by Parliament on a seven-year term and can be reappointed to an additional term.54
    SAHRC’s PAIA specific responsibilities include:
 • Promoting the right of access to information by developing a guide and education pro-
   grams aimed at raising awareness on the right to access information;
 • Monitoring and assisting both public and private bodies with the compliance and imple-
   mentation of PAIA;
 • Conducting training for Information and Deputy Information officers;
 • Assisting communities in exercising their right to access information; and
 • Informing and monitoring legislative development and contributing to law reform by mak-
   ing recommendations and submissions on legislation that may have a bearing on the right
   to access information.55
434                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           The Commission executes its mandate through the PAIA unit, based at the Commission’s
      head office. With a minimal 2013 budget of R759,000 (approximately $74,000) and current
      staff of 5, this office produces numerous publications for public institutions and the general
      population including an official PAIA annual report, which it submits to the Portfolio Commit-
      tee on Justice and Constitutional Development of Parliament. It holds hearings, workshops
      and consultations and offers training and assistance to various public and private institutions
      on PAIA compliance. The SAHRC also conducts an annual PAIA compliance audit of public
      institutions. A consolidated audit aggregating results from 2008–2012 has also been published.
      The SAHRC website contains numerous sources of PAIA information for citizens, government
      officials, and private institutions including the majority of SAHRC’s PAIA publications.
           Because of limited resources and the fact that private body requirements for publication of
      Section 51 manuals were delayed, SAHRC has not focused its time or efforts on private body
      PAIA compliance.56 To date there has also been very little formal investigation of the imple-
      mentation and usage of PAIA in the private sector.57
           SAHRC efforts to co-host the National and Provincial Information Officers Forums and
      Golden Key Awards provide an illustrative example of their promoting and monitoring efforts.
      The National Information Officers Forum (NIOF) was established in 2003 by SAHRC, the
      Department of Justice, ODAC, and other CSOs to support government officials after the
      newly passed PAIA. The goals of the NIOF include providing a platform for sharing issues and
      challenges relating to PAIA and encouraging access to information practitioners to “embrace
      the culture of openness and accountability.”58 These efforts provide capacity building tools to
      increase compliance and implementation of PAIA. They also offer another opportunity to link
      the right to access information to the realization of socioeconomic rights and service delivery.
      SAHRC and ODAC launched a similar Provincial Information Officers Forum in 2010.
           Launched in 2006, the Golden Key Awards (GKA) are conducted along with the NIOF. Both
      are co-hosted annually on the International Right to Know Day by SAHRC and ODAC. The
      research process for determining the awards helps identify institutions that have not done well
      in implementing PAIA. It also highlights best practices by national, provincial and municipal
      public institutions. In 2012/13 awards were provided for:
       • Best Deputy Information Officer (DIO),
       • Best User of PAIA,
       • Best Promoter of PAIA,
       • Pest Performing National Department of PAIA,
       • Best Performing Provincial Department, and
       • Best Performing Municipality.

           Overall, most PAIA stakeholders interviewed believe SAHRC has taken its PAIA mandate
      seriously and has attempted to perform its duties admirably over the past 13 years.59 How-
      ever, SAHRC is faced with a number of institutional constraints that limit its ability to carry out
      its PAIA mandate. First, SAHRC’s education and public awareness responsibilities under PAIA
      are required only “to the extent that financial and other resources are available.”60 Further,
      Section 85 of PAIA states, “Any expenditure, in connection with performance of the HRC’s
      functions in terms of this Act must be defrayed from moneys appropriated by Parliament to
      that Commission for that purpose.”61 This lack of dedicated funding for PAIA has created
      a dependence on the “fiscal goodwill of the government”62 and ultimately has resulted in
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                            435




financial and human resources constraints within the PAIA unit.63 SAHRC has stated directly
that the lack of a dedicated PAIA budget remains a major hindrance to the operations of
the Commission.64
    For example in 2013, the SAHRC recommended using the management performance
assessment tool developed by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in
the Presidency to monitor compliance with the PAIA. This decision was based in part on the
fact that SAHRC could only afford to randomly select a small number of institutions for its com-
pliance audit instead of the over 300 public departments that currently exist in South Africa.65
    Second, despite being described as “watchdogs” that help keep the government in
check, all Chapter 9 institutions including the SAHRC do not have the power to take disciplin-
ary action against government officials.66 This structural deficiency, in conjunction with the fact
that PAIA does not provide SAHRC with enforcement power, further limits its ability to ensure
compliance with PAIA obligations.
    On the 10-year anniversary of South Africa’s attainment of democracy, Professor AK Asmal
chaired a committee evaluating the progress of Chapter 9 Institutions. The subsequent report,
generally referred to as the Asmal Report, documented the historical problems with the
oversight of the commissioners that have impacted the work of the SAHRC. These included
internal dissent, an unclear division of roles and responsibilities amongst the commissioners
and between the commissioners and staff, and the appointment of an inadequate number of
commissioners. The SAHRC has also experienced gaps in commissioners’ terms, often as a
result of the Parliament failing to fill vacancies.67
    The Asmal Report concluded that the SAHRC needs to adopt a more aggressive stance
toward the implementation of PAIA, particularly regarding reporting provisions for private and
public bodies and assistance in bringing matters to the courts. It highlighted the difficulties
experienced by the SAHRC when dealing with PAIA requests, especially in regard to the lack of
cooperation from government officials in departments non-compliant with PAIA.
    The Asmal report, as well as other civil society advocates interviewed, suggests that the
SAHRC has taken an “overly timid approach and a poor use of resources” by not using its sub-
poena power more frequently.68 Interviewees also felt the commissioners, as political appoin-
tees, often make decisions that are more reserved and overly diplomatic, and that this remains
an issue for ongoing efforts to strengthen PAIA.
    In 2012, the SAHRC responded to concerns regarding the lack of visibility of the program
and the amount of resources dedicated to it by elevating the PAIA unit to the Office of the
Chief Executive Officer.69 This change has given the PAIA unit a more important strategic role
and senior management oversight is improving.70
    Despite these obstacles, the PAIA unit at SAHRC has attempted to champion access to
information principles. SAHRC’s annual PAIA reports systematically and bluntly highlight the
significant implementation and compliance problems for government officials, Parliament,
and the public at large. Through events such as the NIOF and GKA, SAHRC has repeatedly
reached out to other PAIA stakeholders, including CSOs, to develop deep and meaningful
relationships and work cooperatively on a number of initiatives. Further, as part of its annual
submission to DOJCD, the PAIA unit has repeatedly provided recommendations for the
regulatory improvement of PAIA including in 2013 a long list of amendments for strengthen-
ing PAIA based on the African Union’s recently passed Model Law on Access to Information.71
SAHRC has also consistently highlighted the importance of understanding access to informa-
tion in the context of social rights, and the essential role it plays in the delivery of services. In
436                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      2013, SAHRC followed up a series of hearings on water and sanitation issues with specialized
      community training on PAIA to reinforce this connection.72

      Other Oversight Institutions

      In addition to the SAHRC, the Public Service Commission (PSC) shares responsibility for moni-
      toring PAIA as a sub-function of its role to promote sound principles of public administration.
      The mandate of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJCD) also
      includes ensuring that applications to all government public institutions for access to infor-
      mation are provided within the legislated 60-day time frame. Secondly, DOJCD assists other
      public institutions, through training and other relevant interventions, to comply with PAIA.

      3.6. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE
      Legal Requirements

      Most RTI advocates stress the importance of the proactive disclosure of information.73 By
      maximizing the information publicly available without the need to submit a request, proac-
      tive disclosure is an essential tool for ensuring efficient and effective access to information.
      Not only is the bureaucratic burden on public bodies reduced when the scope and number of
      information requests are limited, but citizens are provided with an expanded amount of easily
      available information.
          Under PAIA, each public body is required to compile a manual with information about its
      information disclosure process. The content requirements of the manual are set out in Section 14
      and include:
       • information about the structure and function of the public body including the address and
         contact information,
       • the procedures for making an information request,
       • what to do if your request is refused,
       • services available to the public, and
       • a description of how to participate in or influence the formulation of policy.

           Section 14 manuals must also provide an outline of the categories of records available on
      request, the records routinely or proactively available as well as the records which cannot be
      disclosed. The manual must be published in three of the official languages, updated annually
      and disseminated publicly including posting it on the institution’s website, having it available at
      all of the institution’s office branches, and sending a copy to the SAHRC.
           The SAHRC is also tasked with publishing a guide in all 11 South African official languages
      on how to use the law. Section 10 sets out in some detail what must be included in the guide,
      including the names and contact details of every information officer of every public body,
      the procedures for requesting information and assistance available through the Commission.
      Interestingly, Section 16 of PAIA requires the Government Communication and Information
      Services (GCIS) to publish in every telephone directory postal and street addresses, phone,
      and fax numbers, and if available, electronic mail addresses of the Information Officers of every
      public body.
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                            437




     Section 15 of PAIA requires public bodies to annually submit to the DOJCD a description
of the categories of records that are automatically available without a request. This list must
also be available through the DOJCD website.
     Civil society advocates have raised a number of concerns about the strength of these pro-
visions.74 Because there are no requirements for determining the quantity or quality of informa-
tion disclosed, public and private institutions have a high degree of discretion in determining
what is proactively available.75 Further, providing a list of categories is a poor reflection of what
specific data and information is actually accessible.76
     Private bodies are similarly obligated through section 51 to publish lists of proactively avail-
able information. However, private companies within certain sectors are now exempted from
compiling and submitting these manuals until December 31, 2015. They are not exempted
from complying with the rest of the Act.
     Public bodies also submit an annual report, a Section 32 report, to the SAHRC with sum-
mary details on the number of requests received and the outcomes including the total number
of requests refused, the number partially refused, and the number of times a specific section of
the law was used to justify the refusal. Recording the number of applications submitted to the
courts and complaints lodged with the Public Protector is also required. Section 32 reporting
requirement definitions under PAIA are broad and ambiguous.77 This has created interpretation
problems for public bodies and other stakeholders interested in using the data.78


Proactive Disclosure Compliance

Sections 14, 15, and 32 of PAIA place important proactive disclosure obligations on public
and private institutions. These manuals and reports help monitor PAIA compliance, facili-
tate the submission of information requests, and provide an essential PAIA public aware-
ness tool. However, compliance with these sections remains lacking after 13 years of PAIA
implementation.

SECTION 14 PAIA MANUALS

The number of Section 14 manuals available remains remarkably low.79 Although a significant
number of public bodies attempted to comply with this obligation in the first four years, in
2007 only 54% of national, provincial, and local institutions surveyed by the PSC had Section 14
manuals.80 Six years later the PAIA Civil Society Network (PCSN) discovered that only 27 (60%)
of national public institutions had a manual available on their website.81 Further only 8 (18%) of
these institutions had a PAIA manual available in three languages as prescribed by law.82 This
poor compliance is ongoing although there are numerous options available to help create
these manuals; in particular, all the requirements are stated on the SAHRC’s website. The com-
pliance rates for the 2010/2011 reporting year are provided below.83
    Manuals are often not easy to locate on the institutional websites, and in many cases are
outdated, requiring further research to identify the appropriate DIO.84 The SAHRC has also
noted in the consolidated compliance audit that many manuals were not very user friendly and
often used bureaucratic language, thereby defeating the purpose of the PAIA manual. The
majority of institutions did not have manuals readily available in the areas frequently visited by
the public.85 Reliance on internet technology and the failure to provide manuals to frontline
438                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      FIGURE 1. 2010/2011 Section 14 Manual Compliance




      office staff constitute a severe impediment to disadvantaged and illiterate groups in the com-
      munity who do not have access to such technology.86

      SECTION 15 REPORTS

      Multiple sources also confirm poor compliance with the proactive disclosure requirements
      under Section 15 of PAIA across all tiers of government.87 In 2007, the PSC found very low
      compliance with this requirement.88 Only 27% of the surveyed public institutions had submit-
      ted their reports to the Minister annually as required. SAHRC’s consolidated audit found this
      number had only increased to 38%. In 2013, the PCNS’s investigation reported that out of the
      40 national departments checked, 80% of the bodies surveyed had failed to comply with this
      requirement at all.89 Recent attempts to access annual reports of provincial departments led
      to the discovery that 58% of the ANC-led provincial departments failed to make these publicly
      available on their website.90
          Reasons for the low implementation and compliance levels is attributable to a lack of
      awareness, inadequate resources and the lack of buy-in from the executive management
      of public institutions to ensure that PAIA is being implemented in accordance with require-
      ments.91 However, one government official also highlighted the bureaucratic obstacles of the
      procedures for compliance.92 Publication in the Gazette is expensive and having to send the
      information to the DOJCD slows down the process and makes updating the information very
      cumbersome.93

      OTHER ONLINE INFORMATION

      Sixty percent of the public institutions audited by SAHRC had submitted information to the
      GCIS in compliance with Section 16 of PAIA.94 However, a review of this information on the
      GCIS website for this case study shows that much of the information is outdated or missing.
      ODAC has also reported that the GCIS website fails to provide working links to the details of
      information officers.95
          Most government institutions have a website that contains information on the institution’s
      mission and duties, senior staff contact information, tender proposals, and publications and
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                        439




assessments. Annual and strategic reports, including institution-wide budgetary information,
are also proactively available.
    The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) provides a large amount of information
proactively on its website. Civil society advocates have hypothesized that much of this proac-
tive information is required under different environmental regulations, particularly through the
South Africa National Environmental Management Act (NEMA).96 However, it also serves as an
indication that officials tend to implement laws better when they are subject to a core piece of
legislation with clear responsibilities that they know well.97

SECTION 32 REPORTS

In the 13 years since the passage of the PAIA, the number of public bodies submitting sec-
tion 32 reports remains low;98 public institutions are not complying with all requirements
and, despite training, inaccurate reports are submitted. A summary of compliance rates is
provided below.99
    In 2007, the PSC survey found that half of respondents had not complied and submitted
these reports to the SAHRC.100 By the 2012/13 reporting year, only 65% of national depart-
ments had complied.101 The SAHRC also noted with concern that a number of departments
that had submitted reports in the 2011/2012 cycle did not resubmit the following year.102
Most seriously, over 90% of municipalities have consistently failed to submit these reports to
SAHRC.103 The Public Protector has also not submitted information regarding the number of
PAIA complaints lodged and the nature and outcome of the complaints in recent years.104
    In addition, based on reports received, SAHRC has concluded that there is an increasing
trend by public bodies not to comply with all of the specific reporting requirements including
cases where the specific provisions used to justify a refusal are not reported.105
    Public institutions are also submitting inaccurate information.106 This may be due in part to
poor records management, but SAHRC has also reported confusion over the specific reporting
dates that should be included. Misinterpretation of the requirement to report the number of
requests refused in full or granted partially is also common.107

          Unfortunately, the lack of SAHRC enforcement power also hinders its ability to demand
      compliance by public bodies, as noncompliance is not an official PAIA violation. It has also
      resulted in SAHRC focusing its attention on securing higher submission rates as opposed to
      dedicating resources for substantive evaluation of report content.108



      4. Ministry Level Implementation
      4.1. DEPUTY INFORMATION OFFICERS
      Public officials’ knowledge and understanding of PAIA is at the core of proper and efficient
      implementation of PAIA.109 DIOs, frontline and other officials with PAIA responsibilities “play
      critical roles on a day to day basis in determining how RTI is translated into a tangible right for
      citizens.”110 As the key officials responsible for this day to day role, DIOs are the foundation for
      the successful implementation of PAIA.111
           Unfortunately, after 10+ years since PAIA’s passage, SAHRC and PSC found there were still
      institutions that had not appointed DIOs. In fact, over 60% of the 43 institutions included in
      SAHRC’s consolidated audit had not formally designated their DIOs as required under PAIA.112
           While most staff could identify the Information and Deputy Information Officer at their
      respective institutions, the majority (87%) of frontline officers—receptionists, access control
      personnel, etc.—could not.113 In only a little over a quarter of these institutions were other
      officials aware of the PAIA procedures. The respondents also indicated that there were inad-
      equate guidelines for frontline officials on how to assist requesters.114 This lack of awareness
      makes it highly unlikely that the public will be directed to the appropriate official responsible
      for handling information requests.
           SAHRC’s consolidated audit found that, while most DIOs had post graduate degrees and
      had been appointed for more than two years, some openly demonstrated a purely formalistic
      approach to interpretation and application of the legislation, focusing largely on compliance
      as a technicality. The Commission expressed deep “concern that all of the personnel consulted
      indicated that PAIA was an added function to their existing functions.”115
           This attitude significantly impacts implementation, as a meaningful understanding of PAIA
      is needed to justify the appropriate allocation of resources for implementation.116 As a result,
      PAIA is dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The 2007 PSC investigation of PAIA concluded “the most
      important change that needs to occur is at a conceptual level—where access to information
      is seen not only to actively promote good governance but also to realize the socio-economic
      rights of citizens.”117
           A poor commitment from institutional senior executives has resulted in systemic implemen-
      tation issues.118 SAHRC has found through its audits that 90% of executive management con-
      sulted were not aware of PAIA, have not made any financial commitments to the administration
      of PAIA within their departments or included PAIA in their strategic plans and budgets.119

      4.2. STAFFING
      Another consequence of this lack of DIO support is that departments in general are not invest-
      ing in human capital for the administration of PAIA. SAHRC has stated the absence of person-
      nel to administer PAIA is “one of the greatest impediments to efficient delivery of the right to
      access information.”120
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                            441




    SAHRC’s consolidated audit has concluded that the three primary factors contributing to
the lack of personnel within public institutions are: (i) a lack of awareness of PAIA, (ii) a lack of
commitment from senior management, and (iii) increasing staff turnover. A lack of awareness
of the obligations faced under PAIA removes the motivation to hire the appropriate number
of staff for PAIA administration. It also reinforces the lack of executive management commit-
ment to PAIA and delivery on the mandate to provide access to information. Increasing staff
turnover often results in a lack of continuity and in most instances “abandonment of the PAIA
portfolio.”121
    This lack of awareness and commitment, in turn, further reinforces the lack of motivation to
prioritize adequate PAIA resources or ensure personnel are equipped with the necessary skills
and expertise to handle requests for information. In such instances, departments often appoint
junior personnel as DIOs who are often unable to interpret and apply the Act or exercise dis-
cretion when making a decision on a request for information.122
    A report authored by the Center for Environmental Rights, Unlock the Doors: How Greater
Transparency by Public and Private Bodies Can Improve the Realization of Environment Rights
(Unlock the Doors), confirmed this lack of knowledge. When assessing the results of requests
regarding access to environmental information, they concluded that officials administering
requests were unfamiliar with PAIA and that its provisions are poorly used and understood. In
fact, the results of their study found that “obtaining information about requests for information
was in itself a monumental task.”123
    ODAC has also highlighted that accessing information varied within the same department,
depending on the official one came into contact with.124 In response, ODAC has created a
simplified PAIA manual for frontline staff in order to assist government departments in training
those who act as the direct interface with the public.

4.3. PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEMS
The inclusion of PAIA in operational and strategic plans illustrates that a public institution
recognizes the right to access information and its role in good governance and accountabil-
ity.125 However, PAIA stakeholders have repeatedly documented the lack of dedicated monitor-
ing and evaluation of departmental PAIA performance and compliance.126 PAIA compliance
is also not reported in most institutions’ annual reports.127 Nor has it been incorporated into
local government information sharing platforms including Integrated Development Plans
(IDPs) or Imbizos (community meetings).128 IDPs provide an overview of how basic services are
going to be provided to communities and provide an important public participation oppor-
tunity. Overall however, it is clear there is a tendency to see PAIA as irrelevant to the existing
participatory governance framework.129 By not providing community members a method for
collecting information, these public participation forums risk becoming “rubber stamping”
exercises.130

4.4. RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
Many of the implementation investigations conducted by PAIA stakeholders involve the sub-
mission and tracking of information requests to various government and private bodes and
then an evaluation of the responses received. Unfortunately, they provide a comprehensive,
consistent pattern of chronically low compliance and poor PAIA implementation that places
the use of PAIA well beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. In fact, the SAHRC reported in its
442                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      latest PAIA annual report, an “increasing trend by public bodies not to comply with the provi-
      sion of the PAIA in dealing with information requests.”131

      Internal Procedures

      Poor tracking systems do not support monitoring request progress, especially the adherence
      to timelines, responding to requestors, and reporting to the SAHRC.132 In fact, the index com-
      piled by ODAC and used as the basis for awarding the Golden Key Awards has consistently
      shown that the institutions best implementing PAIA are the institutions that have established
      internal systems and structures specifically designed to support compliance and guide
      implementation.133
           However, the SAHRC consolidated audit found that only a third of the audited institutions
      had established internal protocols for dealing with requests for information. In 2011, PSC found
      that an average of 62% of departments had procedures in place for access to information.134
           Most SAHRC audit respondents indicated that (i) request and appeal forms were not avail-
      able at their entry points, (ii) the forms had not been translated into other languages and were
      only available in English, and (iii) information requests were received, tracked and processed
      manually. Many were of the opinion that the manual system of monitoring was adequate and
      did not need to be addressed because of the low volume of requests processed.135 SAHRC’s
      2012/13 audit noted, however, an increase in the number of institutions that have created a
      specific PAIA email address.

      Time Frame

      Despite the limited number of institutions with internal procedures for responding to requests,
      consolidated audit respondents believed that there were effective internal procedures for pro-
      cessing requests within the 30-day period as required by law. In cases where the timeline was
      not met, the respondents mentioned the following factors:
       • Incomplete forms,
       • Late payments,
       • Complex applications,
       • Inadequate resources,
       • Delays in responses from third parties,
       • The nature of requests being overly broad or ambiguous,
       • The time it took to source the correct information, and
       • Slow interdepartmental responses.

          However, despite claims from the consolidated audit that compliance with time limits was
      not an issue, both civil society and the Section 32 reports have documented an increase in the
      use of timeline extensions.136
          The 2013 Shadow Report, produced by the PAIA Civil Society Network (PCSN), reported
      that only 22% of the 258 requests submitted by civil society members and 7% of internal
      appeals were responded to within the statutory time frame. Having submitted and tracked
      information requests through the network since 2009, they believe there has been a “notable
      increase in the utilization of the extension of time for responding to requests by public
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                       443

bodies.”137 As a PCSN member, ODAC reported that, in 2011, the utilization of extension of
time for responding to requests had increased eightfold from the previous reporting year,
partially explaining the increase in compliance with timelines from 2010.138
    Unlock the Doors found that the likelihood of a PAIA request being acknowledged and
processed within the legislated 30-day time frame depends wholly on the individual process-
ing the requests. While there are highly competent officials who process requests rapidly
and respond to correspondence, there are also officials who simply fail to respond in a timely
manner or even at all.139 One former head of the PAIA unit believes that PAIA administrators
view PAIA as burdensome, confusing and complex, and often defer decisions to grant access
to their legally qualified peers or senior management, thereby running afoul of the 30-day
time frame.140

Response Rates

Because of the inaccurate data collected in Section 32 reports, as well as the limited number of
public bodies actually submitting reports, statistical data on request totals and response out-
comes is rarely aggregated for PAIA implementation analysis. Nevertheless, a brief overview
of the number of requests submitted and response outcomes highlights the low use of the law
and poor response efforts of public institutions.
    In 2012/13, 25,342 requests were submitted to national, provincial, and local governmental
institutions. The total number of requests received throughout the history of PAIA is summa-
rized below.
    As figure 4 illustrates, the vast majority of information requests are submitted to national
public institutions. In 2012/13 SAHRC reported in its PAIA annual report that national public
institutions received a total of 23,380 information requests, down from 24,857 requests in the
previous reporting cycle. However, the vast majority of these national requests are submitted
444                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      FIGURE 4. Number of Requests Received




      FIGURE 5. Difference in Total Number of Requests without SAPS




      to the South African Police Service (SAPS), who typically grant access to information. For
      example, in the 2012/2013 reporting year, 89% of the requests received went to SAPS.141
          Without the requests from SAPS, it becomes clear that a low percentage of information
      requests submitted to national public bodies are granted in full.
          In addition, the SAHRC reported that further research conducted for the 2012/13 GKA,
      including a ghost information request exercise, revealed that the response rate for national
      and provincial institutions was significantly lower than the 2011/12 results.142 The SAHRC also
      reported that a number of institutions that were compliant with PAIA statutory obligations
      could not grant access to records that are listed as automatically available. Further, a GKA
      follow-up study revealed that most of the recommendations provided by SAHRC to assessed
      departments have not been implemented to date.143
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                           445




FIGURE 6. Percentage of Requests Granted in Full with and without SAPS




    Statistics collected by the PCSN also paint a poor PAIA response picture. In their 2013
Shadow Report summarizing the response to 236 information requests submitted from
July 2012 to August 2013, they found that public bodies granted only 16% of information
requested in full. Further, public institutions refused 65% of the requests when they actually
responded. In these cases, public institutions failed 40% of the time to provide adequate infor-
mation about why access was being refused and how the grounds for refusal related to the
particular record requested.144
    The failure to respond to requests at all is a significant issue and represents a complete fail-
ure to communicate.145 The SAHRC and other RTI practitioners have suggested the apartheid
legacy and culture of secrecy is one of the major contributions to the reluctance of officials
within the public sector to invest resources in PAIA and to share information with the public.146
They have hypothesized:

   “The fear of being vulnerable to litigation and being held accountable for delivery or
   non-delivery on promises made is often the reason why officials prefer to withhold infor-
   mation from members of the public. It may also be motivated by the comfort that the
   resulting appeal will remove them from the decision making process and escalate it to a
   higher level official.”147

    Whatever the reason, deemed refusals create real frustration for civil society. In Unlock
the Doors, CER concluded that “the approach encountered to giving civil society access to
information required for the exercise of their environmental rights can only be described as
suspicious and apprehensive.” They believe that while there are some unexpected exceptions,
“most public and private bodies that hold environmental information not only fail to facilitate,
but actively avoid or delay giving civil society access to information.”148

4.5. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
An important part of promoting transparency must be the collection and storage of properly
maintained information. However, the apartheid regime left South Africa with a legacy of lost
and destroyed records. This legacy has had a profound political and social impact on access
446                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      to information in South Africa.149 As one interviewee said, “Rights of access to information is
      predicated on the assumption that records exist!”150
           Poor records management is a significant problem at all levels of government and has
      impacted the capacity of government officials to locate and produce requested information.151
      Civil society advocates believe that the large percentage of refusals for information requests
      submitted is directly related to poor records management.152 In fact, in the 2013 Shadow
      Report, the most common ground for refusal cited in 44% of responses was that the records
      requested do not exist or cannot be found.153
           This is also illustrated by the fact that a high number of public institutions are not com-
      plying with the Section 14 PAIA manual requirements of the law and are therefore failing to
      provide a list of the records held, available on request, and proactively available.154 Clearly,
      if records were properly kept and thus readily available, there would be fewer problems with
      compiling this information.155 Previous SAHRC institutional assessments have shown that
      direct financial investment in records management in particular, tends to result in better
      PAIA performance.156
           Records management is regulated primarily under the National Archives and Records
      Service of South Africa Act, 1996.157 It covers the prescribed records classification, disposal, and
      archival preservation systems to be used, and determines the conditions to which electronic
      records systems should be managed. It provides the National Archives and Records Service
      with the authority to inspect public records to ensure compliance with the Act and provides
      training to records managers and senior administrative officials. However, the Act and the
      implementing institution, the National Archives and Records Service, play a very minor role
      in PAIA implementation.158 Civil society advocates interviewed believe that while most public
      bodies understand their obligations around both the National Archives directive and informa-
      tion security, there is no PAIA training for records management and insufficient records man-
      agement training for PAIA compliance officers.159
           The SAHRC found through their audits that, in general, poor records management
      mechanisms can be attributed to a lack of knowledge of officials, little advocacy or support
      from senior management in ensuring proper practices, and very little or dedicated budget for
      records management programs.160 Most institutions have appointed a records manager, have
      a file plan in place and a system for storage and organization of records but it is usually not
      centralized and typically based on manual filing.161 The SAHRC has also reported that there is
      resistance from staff to comply with the proposed use of these systems, so most institutions
      are not clear on where and if such systems are used to actually generate records.162 A 2010
      PSC report also recommended the need to improve the internal coordination between records
      management and information officers, and between departments which hold the same infor-
      mation.163 The report stated, “Records managers should be highly aware of what the depart-
      ment has communicated to the public through its PAIA manual and embrace the responsibility
      of assisting information officers to comply with the Act.”164
           Electronic filing systems are used by many institutions including the City of Johannesburg
      (COJ) and the Gauteng Department of Agriculture Conservation and Environment (GDACE).165
      The DEA also has incorporated PAIA into their electronic filing system, the Electronic Docu-
      ment Management System (EDMS), and uses it to track information requests.166 Ironically,
      electronic record management remains a problem at SAHRC. Not only has a records manager
      only recently been appointed but most of the filing is still conducted manually. 167 Consistent
      allocation of reference numbers or saving electronic correspondence is not the norm.168 There
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                          447




have also been instances where complaint files for specific human rights violation cases simply
cannot be found.169


4.6. BUDGET
In general, the lack of financial resources hinders PAIA implementation. PAIA stakeholders
all agree that limited financial resources are impacting records management, staffing, train-
ing, strategic planning and communications, and other key components of effective PAIA
compliance.170 Over 87% of the institutions surveyed in the consolidated audit indicated no
specific budget for PAIA implementation or compliance. In the institutions with a PAIA budget,
allocations reported varied from 0 to R200,000 primarily based on manual printing costs. Most
departments audited did not see the need to create a PAIA budget, citing the low number of
requests received.
     However, resource constraints are not necessarily a justification for disregarding PAIA
requirements. Many institutions such as the COJ, GDACE, the Officer of the Premier, Limpopo
and the Limpopo Department of Health and Social Development have all been cited as best
practice institutions that developed effective implementation mechanisms with minimal costs
and have ensured that the department processes requests effectively.171
     While having a PAIA budgetary line item may make PAIA expenditures easier to track, it
does not appear to be a requirement for better PAIA implementation. For example, the COJ,
GDACE, and DEA, all public institutions with a strong PAIA compliance record, do not have a
specific budget line item.172


4.7. TRAINING AND PUBLIC OUTREACH
Training

Numerous access-to-information practitioners and advocates have highlighted how inade-
quate training has had a major impact on PAIA implementation and poor compliance.173 This is
especially true for DIOs, as their decisions significantly affect the manner and ability with which
citizens are able to access information and participate in government processes, especially in
cases where access to information is denied.
     Historically, SAHRC training has focused on DIOs in order to improve the poor response
levels of government departments to information requests as well as to enhance the imple-
mentation of PAIA.174 The DOJ Justice College also provides PAIA training for public institu-
tions. In 2013, SAHRC conducted 33 workshops and reached out to 1065 DIOs, at least 21 PAIA
public institutions, and multiple local communities through trainings and other forums.175
     There is also an expectation that DIOs will conduct internal staff training on PAIA regard-
ing the role they can play in assisting requesters. As a result, all DIOs are expected to not only
receive training upon appointment; they also should receive regular and continuous refresher
training. However the 2012/13 PAIA audit revealed that a very small percentage of institutions
conduct continued training on PAIA.176
     In the past, departments have indicated the reasons for not providing training to DIOs
included the fact that (i) DIOs had only been appointed recently, (ii) trained DIOs often left
departments, (iii) changes in departmental structures impacted appointment decisions, (iv)
opportunities for training were limited, and (v) officials not working with the PAIA were often
wrongfully nominated for training.177
448                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Given the numerous developments on access to information in the last year including
      the passage of POPIA and the impending creation of the Information Regulator, it is criti-
      cal that DIOs keep abreast of developments and effectively incorporate any new duties that
      will arise.178
           The SAHRC consolidated audit discovered that participants who had not been trained
      indicated that they relied on an interpretation of the Act itself and that application was done
      largely through trial and error. The majority of institutions had not developed specific PAIA
      training manuals for their staff. For respondents that had received training, positive outcomes
      listed included the significant enhancement of processing and a decrease in response rates of
      more than 30 days. Some also indicated that records management training had been factored
      into the PAIA training offered and that this was their sole training on records management.

      Public Awareness

      Overall, public institutions engage in very little public outreach on PAIA outside the published
      Section 14 manuals. In 2012, the SAHRC shifted its emphasis away from the training of govern-
      ment officials and began to focus more on supporting the public’s right to access information.
      This shift was in recognition of the need for the public to hold government to account in the
      delivery of various social services. SAHRC has also developed a new project, the PAIA Law
      Clinics in association with the Law Clinic of the University of Witwatersrand. In this program,
      14 final year law students join the PAIA Unit. The students work with staff to complete informa-
      tion requests submitted on behalf of community members.179

      4.8. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
      Given the department’s responsibility for ensuring compliance with PAIA, RTI advocates
      interviewed have been particularly disappointed with PAIA implementation at the DOJCD.
      The prevailing view within the community of users is that the DOJCD has not fully asserted its
      authority in encouraging proper compliance with the Act.180 In 2011/12, DOJCD only achieved
      61% PAIA compliance on a total of 1,107 requests.181 The explanation provided by DOJ was
      that a significant number of the requests were from inmates in correctional facilities appeal-
      ing their sentences.182 In these cases, information could not reach them in prison as they were
      released, deceased, or were not allowed to receive any documentation. The delay in the
      completion of transcripts by transcribers also impacted compliance.183 However, civil society
      experiences with DOJCD reinforce a pattern of noncompliance.184 In a 2013 report based on
      submitted information requests, civil society stated that of the 7 information requests sub-
      mitted, 4 requests remained pending by the end of the reporting time while 3 were never
      responded to (deemed refusal).185
          Between 2002 and 2012, the department has been sued for information more than any other
      public institution and in a number of cases they have had to settle out of court.186 Interviewees
      believe that the department seems to be staffed by a lack of specialists.187 Other assessments
      have also documented a lack of responsiveness and overall poor engagement of leadership.188

      4.9. BEST PRACTICE
      However, it should be noted that, despite such a bleak overview, a number of best practice
      government institutions can be found. The COJ, the Gauteng Office of the Premier, the
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                         449




Department of Agriculture, the national Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Department of Defense, Limpopo Department of Health and Social Development, and the
Western Cape Department of Human Settlements have all been singled out in the SAHRC
consolidated audit for their outstanding commitment and dedication to PAIA.
     The DEA also provides an example of effective PAIA implementation at a public institution.
Their DIOs and frontline staff have a strong knowledge and capacity to implement PAIA.189
They also provide a clear and accurate outline of staff with PAIA obligations and have devel-
oped a standardized, well publicized internal workflow system.190 While there is no separate
PAIA unit, the Chief Director’s office assistant receives and processes all requests. The officers
from the corporate legal support and litigation office, trained lawyers familiar with PAIA legal
requirements, are responsible for reviewing all information requests and ensuring that they
are transferred to the correct department or branch within DEA. All Deputy Director Gener-
als within the Department have been designated as DIOs. By keeping the PAIA work flow at a
fairly high level, DEA staff are held accountable for ensuring requests are answered.191 Specific
internal templates have been created. When internal deadlines are not met, officials have the
authority to escalate the matter to a higher level. By incorporating PAIA compliance into the
Key Performance Areas used for staff performance reviews, officials are motivated to spend
money for training, travel and other PAIA activities to ensure proper implementation. PAIA
compliance is included as a strategic objective and published in DEA’s annual report.192 In
essence, because access to information is an important priority for the Ministry, disclosure has
become part of the DEA’s mandate.
     Civil society advocates have also reported that the DEA is the highest performing institu-
tion when responding to information requests when compared to the other public institutions
governing environmental information.193 They have also noted better communication and a
higher quality of knowledgeable officials, which is a reflection of their PAIA investment. This
makes a big difference in interactions between the community and the institution.194



5. Appeals and the Courts
5.1. INTERNAL APPEALS
The low number of internal appeals submitted and responses received highlights how the
process for reviewing original decisions is not working. In the 2012/13 reporting year, only
80 internal appeals were lodged with national government institutions.195
    Consolidated audit respondents indicated that most requesters were advised of their right
to appeal, although 20% reported the institutions did not have internal appeal mechanisms in
place. Respondents indicated that appeal forms were rarely available at the frontline office and
were not translated into any other language but English.
    In the 2007 PSC survey, the majority of departments (61%) indicated that they never had to
deal with any appeals as none were submitted. Of greater concern is the fact that they used
this as a reason not to inform the public about this entitlement. The PSC concluded:

   “This is an unfortunate perspective because it ignores the fact that the public should be
   informed of their rights as a matter of course, and that departments should therefore not
   wait to be approached with an appeal before they can make the public aware of these

      FIGURE 7. Number of Successful National Internal Appeals




         rights. The right to appeal needs to be communicated to citizens especially when access
         to information is denied. Without this right being communicated, fewer citizens would
         appeal and the majority might actually accept the response of the department as final
         and thus not take any further steps received.”196

          While the 2013 Shadow Report indicated that the internal appeal mechanism appears to
      be working slightly better than it has in the past, the number of appeals to which requesters
      simply never receive a response remains high; in fact, over 50% of the internal appeals submit-
      ted by PAIA network members were dismissed. Section 32 reports also point to a high number
      of deemed refusals for internal appeals.197

      5.2. COURTS
      Virtually all PAIA stakeholders interviewed are hopeful that the newly created Information
      Regulator will be an effective resolution for dealing with the slow, complex and potentially
      expensive appeals mechanism provided for in PAIA. However, as mentioned above, the law
      was only signed into law in November 2013. The office of the Information Regulator has yet
      to be set up and only time will tell whether it will be adequately resourced and staffed with
      officials sufficiently skilled to carry out its mandate. Thus, until POPIA is fully implemented, the
      ultimate enforcement power in South Africa remains the Court System.
           Court applications under PAIA are considered civil proceedings. The burden of proof rests
      with the public or private body, which must establish that the decision that brought the case to
      court complies with PAIA provisions.
           Originally, a requester was required to lodge a complaint in the High Court. This greatly
      restricted access for the average citizen.198 However, In October 2009, rules of procedure were
      promulgated by which PAIA requests could be enforced in the Magistrates Court. These courts
      are far more accessible to the majority of the population than the High Court.199 However, to
      date PAIA training for Magistrate judges has not been completed.200 It is also important to
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                            451




note that taking a PAIA case to a lower court does not prevent the case from being appealed
to a higher court. Ultimately, Magistrate Court rulings could delay the final judgment.201
      Originally, court applications had to be filed within 30 days. However this requirement was
considered by the Constitutional Court in Brummer v Minister for Social Development. In that
case it was held that the 30-day period did not provide requesters with an adequate and fair
opportunity to seek judicial redress and was not a reasonable and justifiable limitation on the
right as provided for in section 36 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Court ordered that the
time period for applying to court was invalid. The 30-day period was extended to 180 days.
      This decision was made in August 2009. The declaration of invalidity was suspended for
18 months to allow Parliament to enact legislation to correct the invalidity. However, it is only
with the implementation of POPIA four years later that PAIA’s time period for applying to court
will be officially changed.
      In determining a PAIA application, the court has the power to confirm, amend or set aside
the decision. It can require the relevant official to take or refrain from taking action as the court
considers necessary within a specified period, and can grant special relief for compensation.
      PAIA makes no specific mention of court costs. However, In Claase v Information Officer of
South African Airways, as part of the court’s determination that South African Airways should
be treated as a private body, it held that the pre-litigation costs had been unnecessary and
exorbitant. The court imposed punitive costs on South African Airways. The judgment of the
court also noted “one of the objects of the legislation is to avoid litigation rather than propa-
gate it.”202
      The issue of costs was also considered in Biowatch v Genetic Resources. In that case, the
Constitutional Court considered what should constitute the standard principles for award-
ing costs in constitutional litigation. It found that in litigation between the government and
a private party, if the government loses it should pay the costs of the private party. If the
government wins, each party should bear its own costs. The court further found that “power-
ful reasons” for departing from these general principles must exist where matters of genuine
constitutional import arise.203
      Courts are empowered with the ability to examine any record of a public or private body
to which the Act applies. Often described as a “judicial peek,” this power allows a court to
review a document that a public or private body is claiming is exempt from access under
PAIA in order to determine whether the ground for refusal has been appropriately applied.204
Judicial peek was at the center of a landmark case, the President of the Republic of South
Africa and Others v Mail & Guardian (M&G) Media Ltd. In this case, M&G had submitted
a PAIA request for the Khampepe-Moseneke Report on the legality and reported violence
during the 2002 Zimbabwe elections, commissioned by the then President, Thabo Mbeki.
The request was denied and the case was brought to the High Court, the Supreme Court
of Appeal, and ultimately the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court claimed that
although judicial peek should be used sparingly, discretion should be utilized in cases where
it is in the interests of justice to do so. Ultimately the Court referred the case back to the
High Court to start de novo (again) using the judicial peek disclosure. Substantively, the M&G
case provided clarity on when public bodies can rely on PAIA exemptions to deny access
to information. It should be noted, however, that to date, M&G has still not received the
information requested.205
452                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          In addition to these important procedures cases, the courts have played a central role in
      shaping PAIA’s enforcement as well as elaborating PAIA’s content.206 Case law, for example has
      informed:
       • The relationship between the Constitution and PAIA,
       • Records entitled to under PAIA and records that do not apply,
       • The process when refusing access and procedures for when a record cannot be found or
         does not exist,
       • Grounds for refusal based on exclusions, and
       • Application of the public interest override.207

           Case law has also played a major role in private sector compliance with PAIA. Major legal
      decisions, for example, have determined the definition of a private body, the fact that a record
      will be required to exercise or protect a right, when a record is required, as well as the defini-
      tion of “required.”208

      Obstacles to the Use of the Courts

      Overall, most stakeholders believe the court system is “both functional and mainly honest.”209
      In almost all instances where PAIA matters have proceeded to court, the court has ordered the
      release of information.210
           However, using the courts creates a formidable barrier for the majority of people in the
      country.211 The system is complex, expensive and time consuming. The challenge has been
      further compounded by the general resistance to litigation characteristic of most South
      Africans.212
           Stakeholders believe the threshold for accessing information from private institutions is
      “cumbersome and rather difficult to achieve” and thus discourages the public from using
      PAIA.213 It also can be argued that this difficulty is contrary to the objectives laid out in PAIA.214
           Because of these obstacles, very few cases are brought to court. When they are, they are
      usually brought by civil society or other high profile institutions such as the newspaper, Mail
      and Guardian. These applicants help reinforce the perception that information rights are elitist
      or luxury rights of no real value to ordinary people. However, it should be noted that because
      the government fails to collect accurate statistics, it is difficult to determine exactly who is
      really using the law and with what frequency.215 At present, however, the number of instances
      where litigation is embarked on for strategic purposes far out-numbers instances of ordinary
      litigation.216



      6. Capacity and Influence of Civil Society
      6.1. CITIZEN DEMAND FOR RTI
      Despite efforts by various organizations to promote PAIA, in reality, the awareness of PAIA and
      its value as a tool for access to information is simply not reaching all South Africans. In a survey
      conducted for the Open Society Foundation for South Africa, in 2011, 86% of the respondents
      had never heard of PAIA.217 In another survey conducted by ODAC, one in ten people surveyed
      felt that they did not have the right to ask the government for information.218 Of those who did
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                          453




think they had a right to ask for information and who were aware of PAIA, they are most likely
to: be white and male, speak English or Afrikaans, and be better educated and in the higher
income bracket.219
    Multiple explanations exist for this low awareness. Clearly the bureaucratic barriers within
PAIA have prevented many citizens from using the law. These include the requirement to use
a form to submit a request, the use of English as the primary language of government, and
the difficulty in obtaining easily understandable information about how and where to submit
information requests.
    However, because the apartheid system was by nature, authoritative and repressive, a
culture of fear of authority as well as apprehension with interacting with government directly
was established.220 Many community members focused on the day-to-day challenges of living
in poverty do not receive the adequate public services they require from the government such
as clean water, adequate sanitation, housing, or educational opportunities. They simply do not
have the time nor do they see PAIA as a meaningful tool for addressing these concerns.
    In addition, intrinsic tensions exist between some aspects of African traditional customary
law and practices and conventional government engagement.221 For example, the use of PAIA
may undermine traditional leadership structures in various rural communities.222 These cultural
traditions also shape the way information is recorded and accessed within a community.223
Together with the challenges created by multiple languages, multiple writing scripts, very low
level of literacy, and historical high levels of mortality, typical western based models of records
management and procedures for access to information are not a logical fit with many popula-
tions within South Africa.224 Thus, the education and training provided by civil society to sup-
port local communities has special significance in South Africa well beyond the simple use of
PAIA. It directly helps improve the lack of awareness and cultural barriers that have historically
excluded rural, low income and marginalized sectors of the community.

6.2. CIVIL SOCIETY
Civil society has played a fundamental role in promoting access to information in South Africa.
With deep roots in campaigns against apartheid, many civil society groups clearly understand
the link between access to information and a truly accountable and participatory government.
Civil society has remained an active and forceful participant, engaging academics, interna-
tional advocates, the media, government institutions, and other South African social justice
CSOs in a broad range of activities to help strengthen the use and implementation of PAIA.
Further, they have reached out to local communities in an attempt to illustrate how PAIA and
access to information can be used as an essential tool in their fight for better government
service delivery and broader human rights.

Legislative Development of PAIA

Civil society was instrumental in the development of PAIA. After an attempt to create the Open
Democracy Advisory Forum by the Freedom of Expression Institute faltered, a broad range
of organizations formed the Open Democracy Campaign Group (ODCG).225 This coalition
focused on developing a unified, coordinated voice whose range of expertise made it a key
resource to member organizations, the media, and members of Parliament.226 Throughout the
five-year campaign that led to the creation of PAIA, ODCG utilized international experts and
resources to investigate best practices as well as studied effective grassroots citizen campaigns
454                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      (such as efforts of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan or Association for the Empowerment
      of Workers and Peasants) to inform the South African process.227 They offered draft language
      and constructive policy alternatives, and submitted strategically coordinated comments to the
      multiple parliamentary committees working on the bill.228 The coalition also engaged with the
      media and developed personal relationships with many MPs.229
           The key strengths of ODCG’s advocacy and engagement strategies have been highlighted
      by other RTI practitioners and are recognized as important contributors to South Africa’s law
      development.230 These include the creation of a diverse, well-funded coalition.231 The coali-
      tion developed an effective strategy to work respectfully and constructively with government
      officials by not just offering criticisms but viable solutions. The consistency of engagement over
      the long term allowed the coalition to build trust internally between coalition members as well
      as between members and other stakeholders and ensure a voice in the process.232
           Civil society has never stopped advocating for the inclusion of an independent Information
      Commissioner in South Africa. The success of POPIA’s passage is a testament to their tenacity
      and activism. The present day advocacy on behalf of PAIA, including the active, ongoing use of
      the law by many CSOs, is also a legacy of this early, successful involvement.

      Ongoing Parliamentary Advocacy

      As part of their broader mission to promote an open and transparent government, most CSOs
      engage in a wide range of right-to-know activities that move beyond access to information.
      This work ranges from parliamentary advocacy, engagement with government institutions,
      regional and international advocacy, and grassroots campaigning. It includes issues such as
      strengthening whistleblower protection, promoting open data, securing access to historical
      documents related to the struggle against the apartheid era, promoting environmental justice,
      and fighting the perceived growing culture of corruption.
           The Right2Know Campaign (R2K) provides an illustrative example of civil society working in
      coalition on these broader social justice issues. R2K was launched in 2010 in response to gov-
      ernment attempts to update the Protection of State Information Act of 1982. Although unable
      to prevent South Africa from passing a new controversial law that regulates the classification,
      protection, and dissemination of state information, R2K’s mobilization and advocacy success-
      fully expanded the debate around the legislation to a more comprehensive focus on their
      perception of a growing culture of secrecy and the need for meaningful access to information
      for all.
           R2K has a diverse membership that includes both traditional NGOs and a large number of
      community based organizations. It has a small staff spread out in four South African provinces.
      The grassroots issue focus has included:
       • Stopping the Protection of State Information Bill and other national security bills and acts,
       • Supporting communities and groups in the coalition to access information,
       • Media freedom, diversity, and the right to communicate, and
       • Justice for whistleblowers.233

         In addition to monitoring and responding to legislative developments, the group focuses
      on public education and political protest. They have developed a strong internet presence and
      engage closely with the media. R2K was named “2012 News Maker of the Year” by the Johan-
      nesburg press club for example.234 In this broader context, access to information is used as an
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                           455




important tool to inform this work. A PAIA application was submitted, for example, to obtain
the National Key Points list. This list, which is kept secret from the public, includes any building
deemed important to national security and in need of extra security. As a former apartheid-
era national security law, R2K activists believe the expansion of this list is being used to deny
public access to information and suppress peoples’ rights to protest.
    Civil society also works to advocate for access to information in the region and interna-
tionally. ODAC has taken the lead in engaging in the Open Government Partnership (OGP)
process, for example. In addition to monitoring progress, they have coordinated the inputs
of key transparency stakeholders and submitted information on the core transparency issues
relevant to the OGP commitments made by the South African government. They have also
attempted to engage government representatives to ensure civil society is properly consulted
and involved in the implementation of their OGP commitments. They have advocated for the
inclusion of stronger commitments that include a proper implementation plan with specific
responsibilities and deliverables for government officials. Further, they have launched a sepa-
rate OGP Monitoring website at a centralized location for OGP related monitoring, analysis
and advocacy.


Using PAIA for Research and Implementation Monitoring

CSOs have not only focused on supporting government research and monitoring of PAIA, they
are also active participants in the development of new information. Submitting information
requests and monitoring results has proven to be a useful method of providing statistical and
anecdotal evidence of poor PAIA compliance.
    The South African History Archive (SAHA) has developed the PAIA Request Tracker, an
online information management tool designed to track and manage requests made under
PAIA. Both SAHA and other members of the PAIA Civil Society Network (PCSN) are able to use
the PAIA Request Tracker to create and send information requests to both private and public
bodies. The system also includes the ability to track PAIA requests and all related communica-
tion against the prescribed timelines as well as send automated faxes /emails. The goal of the
PAIA tracker is to expand the capacity of other CSOs to use PAIA. It also hopes the increas-
ing the number of requests submitted to public institutions will increase the motivation of
these institution to effectively implement PAIA.235 ODAC is also developing an online public
hub that will allow all citizens to submit PAIA requests. The site, askAFRICA, will also act as a
data repository.
    The most well-known source of civil society generated information is the Shadow Report.
Regularly cited by government, other transparency advocates, and academic stakehold-
ers, it is authored by the PCSN. Sponsored by SAHA and using PAIA Tracker data, the PCSN
focuses specifically on effective implementation and usage of PAIA. Given the commonly cited
concerns over the inaccuracy of PAIA section 32 reports, the Shadow Report provides another
source of information for SAHRC and other PAIA stakeholders to use when monitoring the
implementation of PAIA.
    ODAC has developed a strong working relationship with SAHRC’s PAIA unit. They co-host
the NIOF and Golden Key Awards, with ODAC providing the funding, organizational support
and research to support these events. In addition to allocation of the awards, ODAC uses the
collated statistics to support stronger PAIA implementation and advocacy efforts. Golden Key
survey results are regularly cited in ODAC and SAHRC reports, newsletters, and other materials
456                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      as evidence of the poor state of compliance and implementation, and as justification for the
      demand for more resources and political support from parliament, other monitoring ministries,
      and public institutions.
          ODAC also uses this research to inform their other open democracy work. For example, in
      a submission to the National Anti-Corruption Forum, a coalition of business, civil society and
      government sectors working on corruption issues, ODAC highlighted the 2011 GKA results as
      part of the advocacy paper highlighting the importance of access to information in the fight
      against corruption.236
          The Centre for Environmental Rights (CER) is an environmental justice CSO that operates
      a transparency in environmental governance project; it uses information requests to evaluate
      the extent to which civil society can access environmental information held by regulators and
      private entities. In Unlock the Doors, CER submitted 98 requests and 42 formal requests to
      52 public and private institutions. The report highlighted the lack of awareness, training and
      incentives, as well as inadequate structures, to achieve PAIA compliance. The report con-
      cludes, “The culture of avoidance, delay, and non-compliance with PAIA is fundamentally and
      significantly hampering the realization of environmental rights as guaranteed in S.24 of the
      Constitution.”237 In recognition of this work, the CER won the Best User of PAIA in the 2012/13
      Golden Key Awards.238

      Strategic Litigation

      The limitations of PAIA’s court based enforcement mechanism, in conjunction with the general
      lack of political will to improve PAIA implementation through traditional governmental prac-
      tices, have made strategic litigation a key civil society strategy for dealing with poor compli-
      ance and implementation.239
          SAHA’s Freedom of Information Programme (FOIP) has been tasked with, among other
      things, “pushing the boundaries” of PAIA by utilizing the court system. It regularly provides
      amicus curiae briefs for important PAIA cases. Until recently, ODAC’s litigation unit used to
      operate a law clinic. Its strategic litigation was primarily aimed at the elaboration of PAIA pro-
      cedures. It also took on important test cases where requests were denied by either public or
      private bodies. In these cases, pro bono services were offered to individuals and community-
      based clients who could not afford the expense of litigation.
          CER also makes legal services available to communities and CSOs to support the assertion
      of environmental rights in prioritized cases. This includes providing negotiation and dispute
      resolution support through its monthly Environmental Rights Clinic. It also initiates legal pro-
      ceedings on behalf of clients, as public interest litigants and a friend of the court. CER has also
      directly engaged in legal proceedings to compel production of environmental records.

      Training and Public Awareness and Supporting Local Communities

      CSOs have also played an important role in raising public awareness and education on PAIA.
      To that end, a number of guides have been created by civil society to help ordinary citizens,
      lawyers, and information officers navigate PAIA and submit information requests. CER, ODAC,
      and SAHA all offer training and workshops on PAIA. Historically, ODAC specifically offered
      training for holders and requesters of information, as well as workshops on how to compile the
      manuals required under PAIA. Currently ODAC offers PAIA and open data online training for
      journalists.
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                          457




    In addition, SAHA’s FOIP offers training and capacity building to organizations and indi-
viduals. It has developed strategic sector based training programs which focus on vulnerable
and disadvantaged communities, including gender based violence and transitional justice
and more recently lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) communities, and
environmental justice. SAHA won the 2012 best promoter GKA for its continued training with
communities.240

6.3. MEDIA
In many countries, the media are active users of RTI laws. Given the vibrant and generally free
press in South Africa, it would be logical to expect this to be the case in South Africa. However,
in practice, journalists are not heavy users of PAIA.241 The long time needed to gain access as
well as the bureaucratic hurdles, overuse of exemptions, and lack of awareness of government
officials ensure PAIA obtained information is not a viable source for reporters often working on
short deadlines and/or needing current information.242
     In a notable exception, investigative journalists have used PAIA to collect important infor-
mation on government corruption and abuses of national security claims.243 In one recent case,
multiple organizations, including media houses, submitted a successful PAIA request to obtain
the Manase report.244 This report outlined the maladministration in the eThekwini Municipality.
The report was commissioned in response to widespread allegations of corruption in the city,
including the use of emergency regulations to grant R500 million housing tenders during the
2009/10 fiscal year.245
     The Mail and Guardian (M&G) paper has repeatedly used PAIA. Brummer, in the important
time limit PAIA case Brummer v Minister for Social Development, was M&G investigative jour-
nalist, Stefaans Brümmer. In addition, the M&G houses and helps fund the independent, non-
profit, M&G Centre for Investigative Journalism. The Centre, known as amaBhungane, Zulu for
the Dung Beetle, was founded to develop investigative public interest journalism. The Centre
produces investigative stories and engages in advocacy efforts to “secure the information
rights investigative journalists need to do their work.” It is an active participant in the larger
R2K Campaign and offers support to investigative journalists using PAIA to collect information.
     amaBhungane regularly uses PAIA and has taken cases to court to not only secure informa-
tion but advance the scope of PAIA. It is currently attempting to obtain complete information
about the costs of President Zuma’s Nkandla residence.246 amaBhungane submitted a PAIA
request related to the use of state funds to upgrade the President’s private estate in July
2012. It was denied by the Department of Public Works, claiming secrecy under the National
Key Point Act. After submitting an internal appeal (which was ignored), and then receiving
incomplete information, the case went to court. Ultimately over 12,000 pages of evidence
were released. The Centre believes more high level records involving the interactions of senior
officials, the president, the minister and his deputy have still been withheld.247 In any case, the
records received document how the costs for this renovation have grown from R27.8 million in
2009 to R270 million in October 2012.248

6.4. PRIVATE BODIES
Despite the unique inclusion of private entities, PAIA has not proven to be a useful tool for
access to private body information. The overall lack of public awareness surrounding PAIA and
hesitation by the general population to utilize the law have only been compounded by the
458                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      delaying of Section 51 manual requirements.249 While the delay was initially justified based on the
      impact on small businesses and the lack of SAHRC resources, this delay has limited the informa-
      tion on the records available and the procedures for accessing private information.250 The SAHRC
      has readily admitted it still does not have the resources to receive the manuals nor the infra-
      structure to house and review them.251 Adding to these barriers is the lack of an internal appeal
      mechanism for private requests, leaving requesters little option outside of court as recourse.
          Civil society has admitted to a limited exploration of this aspect of PAIA and has submit-
      ted very few information requests to private bodies when compared to government institu-
      tions.252 However, in the few cases where requests were submitted, most private bodies did
      not provide information.253 In one case where the CER submitted 11 environmental information
      requests, private companies failed to respond 60% of the time.254 In these cases, private bodies
      often referred CER back to the relevant public body. In two cases, private bodies responded
      to requests from civil society by threatening legal action. In 2011, in collaboration with ODAC,
      CER sent formal requests to 30 of the largest mining companies asking them to voluntarily
      release environmental licenses.255 Of the companies, only two agreed to do so, and only one
      followed through on the request. CER concluded that private bodies with more administrative
      capacity tend to use PAIA to resist disclosure, indicating a belief that “greater transparency
      poses an unacceptable risk to these bodies and their shareholders.”256 Further, the lack of
      requirements to proactively disclose information gives them little incentive to do so.257



      7. Broader Political Environment
      Virtually all PAIA stakeholders agree that the lack of political will is a significant factor impeding
      the proper implementation of PAIA. Not only is the lack of commitment of senior executives
      inhibiting the appropriate motivation and internal readiness at public institutions, but a limited
      broader political commitment to PAIA is also evident.

      7.1. POLITICAL WILL
      With the passage of POPIA, Parliament has addressed one specific structural weakness of
      PAIA. However, the issue of weak political oversight remains. The Asmal report concluded
      that Parliamentary oversight of the work of the SAHRC and engagement with its reports
      is inadequate.
           This has been reinforced by SAHRC commissioners, who have concluded that there is
      reluctance from government for political reasons to make PAIA more effective and believe a
      “champion in Cabinet to fight in our corner” would be helpful.258 It is also worth emphasizing
      that, despite the fact that SAHRC’s Annual Reports, Strategic Plans, and PAIA annual reports
      have all directly and consistently reported to Parliament how their human capital and resource
      constraints have impacted their ability to meet their PAIA obligations, little action has been
      taken by Parliament to intercede.
           Not a single Minister of Justice of the Mbeki administration has publicly expressed support
      for PAIA, despite the fact that President Mbeki had sponsored the enactment of the legislation
      as deputy president during the Mandela administration.259 In fact, one of these Ministers has
      been quoted as saying that the minimal desire to push a reform agenda in cabinet is because
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                         459




“when the cabinet looks out of the window, what it sees is the law being used by its political
enemies to embarrass it.”260
    However, in 2013, as a speaker at the NIOF, Deputy Minister John Jeffery publicly spoke
about the importance of access to information and acknowledged the poor implementation in
general and the need for better Parliamentary oversight.261 He also spoke about the Informa-
tion Regulator and the newly formed Office on Institutions Supporting Democracy (OSID),
which is part of the Speaker’s Office of National Assembly. Based in part on the recommenda-
tions made in the Asmal report, the purpose of this office is to facilitate and co-ordinate all
engagements between Parliament and Chapter 9 Institutions. However, it has not yet begun its
work, nor formally committed to addressing PAIA implementation issues. Deputy Minister Jef-
fery also did not address the significant PAIA compliance issues at his own department.262
    The best way of demonstrating political will for making an RTI law succeed is clearly by
allocating resources to the proper implementation of the law.263 The long list of implementa-
tion issues outlined in this case study clearly illustrates this lack of Parliamentary commitment.
    Further, Parliamentary members have not responded to repeated notifications of poor
compliance. Almost since its inception, the SAHRC and PSC have been documenting the poor
implementation of PAIA. The SAHRC has repeatedly referred to PAIA compliance as “dismal”
and highlighted the bureaucratic resistance to implementation in PAIA annual reports and
other documents to the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development.264 It
has written that “Parliament and Government needs to demonstrate the necessary political will
to give effect to the Constitutional right to information for all.”265 And that “Having submitted
these [PAIA annual] reports, the SAHRC hopes that Parliament will take steps to ensure that the
status of implementation changes and that the constitutional principles of an open democracy
are upheld. This expectation has not been met, and until such time that corrective measures
are put in place, compliance with the PAIA and its implementation will continue to dwindle.”266
Despite the passage of POPIA and the creation of the OSID, to date Parliament has taken little
action to directly address PAIA implementation.

7.2. BROADER GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT
South Africa was the first African country to adopt an RTI law. PAIA was used as a reference
point for civil society and public officials alike throughout Africa in drafting their own bills
or ideas on implementation.267 Since that time, there has been a wave of activity in Africa in
respect to the right to information. Many other African countries have passed RTI laws or regu-
lations including Angola, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tunisia, Uganda
and Zimbabwe.268
     South Africa was one of the Open Government Partnership’s (OGP’s) founding countries
when President Zuma launched the initiative along with other heads of state and ministers in
New York. Its OGP plan focuses on eight commitments aimed at enhancing service delivery,
fighting corruption, and encouraging civil participation including four commitments directly
addressing access to information values.269 In the 2012 Open Budget Index (OBI) assessment
of whether a government makes eight key budget documents publicly available in a compre-
hensive, timely, and useful fashion, South Africa scored 90 out of 100, placing it among the top
performers, (although it represents a slight decrease in score from 92 on the 2010 OBI).270 The
Constitutional Court’s independence is also internationally well regarded.271
460                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           However, 20 years after South Africa transformed itself into a modern democratic state,
      it continues to struggle with unemployment, poverty, service delivery protests, corruption,
      and significant income inequality. In an attempt to measure South Africa’s progress toward
      creating an open society, the Open Society Monitoring Index (OSMI)272 concluded that South
      Africa’s threats to openness are not the result of poorly constructed laws and institutions, but
      instead from the lack of political commitment to making these legal instruments and processes
      work.273 At the same time, the OSMI index confirmed that the low level of citizen engagement
      with formal rules and institutions remains a significant issue.274 In a sense, low demand and
      poor PAIA compliance are only one of many human rights’ values finding implementation a
      challenging problem.

      7.3. CORRUPTION
      Corruption appears to be a significant concern for most South Africans. Transparency
      International found that 54% of the population surveyed felt that corruption had increased
      a lot in the country.275 Over 70% of the respondents felt that the political parties, parliament,
      the police, and public officials and civil servants were corrupt.276 With a score of 42 out of 100
      (with 100 being a perfectly clean government), South Africa ranked 72 out of 177 countries on
      Transparency International’s perception of corruption index.277
          Current events help to confirm this perception. Accusations of corruption scandals are a
      regular occurrence in the media to the point where some journalists have created a new South
      Africa syndrome: scandal fatigue.278 Based on PSC data, financial misconduct in the public
      service cost taxpayers R346 million in 2009/2010, 87% of which was never recovered. The
      reporting year 2011/2012 brought even worse news, with that number rising to R930 million.279
      Freedom House has reported that between 2006 and 2009, President Zuma was charged three
      times with corruption and cleared of those charges on procedural grounds.280
          These ongoing allegations of corruption and the lack of action by government leaders
      have greatly impacted the country’s ability to address public service delivery and have fostered
      poor public trust. In theory, a well implemented PAIA should provide one avenue for alleviat-
      ing corruption as transparency supports the creation of an open and accountable government
      where corruption is difficult to sustain. In a country where corruption is such a significant issue,
      having an effective tool such as PAIA becomes even more critical for ensuring an open and
      accountable government.

      7.4. PROTECTION OF STATE SECRETS BILL
      The Protection of State Information Bill has generated considerable controversy both in South
      Africa and internationally. Some stakeholders have suggested it is part of a global tendency to
      use the emergence of terrorism as a justification to limit access to information in the name of
      national security.281
           The bill establishes review procedures for requests for access as well as procedures to pre-
      vent the abuse of the classification system including oversight by a Classification Review Panel.
      It also outlines penalties for violations. The South African National Assembly adopted a revised
      Protection of State Information Bill on Nov. 12, 2013. It will now go back to President Zuma for
      his signature.
           Despite a number of revisions, many open government stakeholders, including the R2K
      Campaign, continue to raise a number of concerns including the lack of a “full public interest
A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA                                                                             461




defense” clause, lack of protection for the population at large to ensure they are not crimi-
nalized for unknowingly seeking secret information, draconian sentences of up to 25 years in
jail for intentional violations, and expanded powers of the Minister of State Security to give
classification powers to other state bodies and junior officials.282 It is likely the government will
take the bill to the Constitutional Court for review. If not, R2K has said they are committed to
challenging it before the Court directly.283
      The original draft indicated that the bill would take precedence over PAIA. However, this
was changed in the revised version. The signed bill now specifically indicates that the right of
access to information (and other rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights) will inform its implemen-
tation. While this commitment is welcomed by civil society stakeholders, most are still con-
cerned that the other provisions will negatively impact access to information by creating a new
set of justifications for refusing information requests.284 They are also concerned it will support
a culture that discourages the release of information.285
      While the outcome of this legislation has not been finalized, its promulgation in conjunc-
tion with the allegations of political corruption is fuelling public frustration with the current
leadership. Transparency stakeholders consider this part of a disturbing trend to limit the
freedoms protected under the Constitution.286



8. Conclusions
There has been a fundamental paradigm shift in the understanding and application of the RTI
around the world. Access to information is now recognized as a fundamental human right with
its own set of attributes and intrinsic worth (Article 19 UN). RTI has become a well-regarded
tool for strengthening social and economic rights. In its evolution to democracy, South Africa
entrenched these principles in its Constitution and created a strong legislative foundation for
their execution. It is important to acknowledge the gains that have been made.
     Yet, 13 years after the passage of PAIA, overall implementation at the national, provincial,
and local level remains “dismal.”287 The SAHRC has consistently reported noncompliance and
cited a lack of both political will and prioritization of PAIA within public institutions. This funda-
mental impediment has created a ripple effect of issues including:
 • A lack of awareness within public institutions of both the law and the procedures for pro-
   cessing requests for information;
 • The inability to assist requesters by not making request procedure information readily avail-
   able and not adequately educating frontline staff;
 • A limited number of staff, who have PAIA responsibilities added on over and above their
   dedicated portfolios;
 • Poor, ad hoc protocols for answering information requests including the overuse of exemp-
   tions, deemed refusals, and time extensions;
 • The lack of adequate resources and disorganization of records management;
 • The poor integration of PAIA activities into broader information sharing and public partici-
   pation activities and strategic planning;
 • The lack of a sufficient budget to properly address the PAIA workload; and
 • Minimal internal training on PAIA’s goals, objectives, and procedures.
462                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Of course, all of these implementation problems are compounded by the existing weak
      enforcement and compliance mechanism. The costly, time consuming, and bureaucratic pro-
      cess of taking information requests to court has limited the number of applications. It has also
      resulted in the process being used more for strategic litigation. Hopefully, the creation of an
      Information Regulator will not just structurally correct this significant weakness in PAIA, but pro-
      vide a meaningful tool for both strengthening PAIA compliance and providing a more effective
      and efficient path for resolving PAIA request conflicts.
           Despite regional RTI trends, including the Model AU Law on Access to Information, and
      the Declaration of Principles of Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, the
      political commitment to address these implementation issues is lacking. South Africans have
      also not found a way to overcome the institutional and cultural barriers to take full advantage
      of its law as they struggle to address serious service delivery and other broad socio-economic
      problems in their communities.
           Improvements in South Africa’s access to information will be rooted in a political commit-
      ment to embrace PAIA objectives and ensure that institutions do the same. Until then, poor
      implementation will continue to thwart not only access to information, but also the account-
      able and transparent government envisioned in the South African Constitution.

Annex 1. Methodology

The purpose of this case study is to examine how South Africa’s PAIA law has worked in prac-
tice. It specifically provides a brief overview of the RTI legislation as well as a discussion of the
strength of the implementing environment, the responsible institution’s capacity to carry out its
PAIA promotion, monitoring, oversight, enforcement and compliance mechanisms as well as
the broader political environment and RTI accountability.
     The study is based on extensive desk research of primary and secondary resources includ-
ing a variety of ministry and other national government reports, newspaper articles, academic
journals, and civil society and media assessments. Interviews with a variety of stakeholders and
government officials were conducted to augment the desk research.
     Prior to the research, case study indicators were developed to organize and analyze the
information collected. The indicators were used to monitor and evaluate the different variables
impacting RTI implementation and performance. These indicators were adapted from the
indicator categories developed for the Public Accountability Mechanisms (PAM) created by the
World Bank. New indicators were developed to address the existing gaps in RTI implementa-
tion monitoring and evaluation and to develop a better understanding of the capacities, incen-
tives, and other factors that enable effective implementation including the role of civil society
and the broader governance environment. Specifically the RTI-related responsibilities for the
following agencies or RTI stakeholders were investigated:
 • The Ministry or Department in charge of RTI Oversight and Monitoring
 • The Ministry or Department in charge of the Environment
 • The Ministry or Department in charge of Agriculture
 • The Institution responsible for Appeals, Mediation, and/or Sanctions
 • The Court System: Any specific court responsible for RTI oversight and enforcement
 • Civil Society Organizations engaged in RTI activities
 • Major Media Outlets

      restore state credibility, promote the protection of human rights, and re-establish respect for rule of
      law. It set about creating a set of independent institutions whose task would be to strengthen
      constitutional democracy. Drawn from models from around the world, the “State Institutions
      Supporting Constitutional Democracy”, consist of the Public Protector, the Auditor-General, the
      Electoral Commission, the South African Human Rights Commission, the Commission for Gender
      Equality, and lastly, the Commission for Protection of the Rights, Cultural, Religious and Linguistic
      Communities. Known as Chapter 9 Institutions based on the placement in the South African
      Constitution, they are subject only to the Constitution and the law, are supposed to be independent
      of government and report annually to Parliament.

                     Implementing Right to Information
                 A Case Study of Thailand

1. Findings
Drivers of Success

 • The public’s call for transparency in official information in 1992 was the prime driver of
   Thailand’s Official Information Act (OIA) in 1997. Shortly after its promulgation, the Act
   received a warm welcome from citizens, civil society organizations (CSOs) and the media.
   However, the enthusiasm has now subsided.
 • The OIA, related laws and regulations, an oversight agency, and appeal mechanisms are
   in place.

Drivers of Failure

 • The OIA is not clear and does not provide specific guidelines on what information can or
   cannot be disclosed. This is left to the judgment of officials.
 • The OIA does not provide protection for the officials who disclose information. But it poses
   a sanction (fine or imprisonment or both) on the officials who disclose information under
   exemption. The officials, for fear of penalty, often choose not to disclose the information.
 • The OIA does not impose any penalty on the state agencies that fail to disclose informa-
   tion after receiving a request. Nor does it prescribe any penalty for the agencies that
   respond to the request later than prescribed by law.
 • The use of the OIA is on the decline because it takes a long time to get a response from
   the relevant agency. Often the requester has to appeal to the Information Disclosure
   Tribunal (through the Official Information Commission), which will take a few more months.
   If not satisfied with the result, they have to appeal to the Administrative Court.
 • The oversight agency, the Office of the Official Information Commission (OOIC), is under
   the Office of the Permanent Secretary. As such, it lacks independence from political power.
 • The OOIC does not have sufficient funds or personnel.
 • Right to information (RTI) is not a priority of implementing agencies.

482                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




       • There is a lack of political will to support RTI because the OIA is deemed to be a tool for
         investigating corruption in the government.
       • A culture of secrecy and a patronage system underline the above problems and result in
         unequal access to information among different sectors and actors.

      Current/Future Developments That Will Impact Implementation of the Law

      At present, Thailand is facing a large-scale, nationwide confrontation between two political
      factions. One faction is calling for political reform. One of the proposed reform areas is elimi-
      nation of corruption. If this reform materializes, it may have significant and desirable impacts
      on the OIA.



      2. History and Context: Passage of the Law
      and Its Importance
      Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the UN General
      Assembly on December 10, 1948, states:

          Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the right includes the right
          to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive and impart information and
          ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

           The advent of the RTI law in Thailand might not have been influenced by Article 19 cited
      above. But its origin surely echoed that of the UDHR. Whereas the UDHR arose directly from
      the experience of the Second World War, the RTI law in Thailand stemmed from an episode of
      political turmoil.
           In the early 1990s, Thailand was once again under the rule of a military Premier. Given that
      Thailand had been a constitutional monarchy since 1932 and witnessed its first general election
      in 1933, Thai citizens were irritated to see the return of a military ruler after almost thirty years
      of ‘electoral democracy’. The uprising of the urban middle class in Bangkok against General
      Suchinda Kraprayoon in May 1992, generally coined as the ‘mobile-phone mob,’ was met with
      a news embargo and the imposition of a curfew. Unsurprisingly, this political climate and infor-
      mation distortion resulted in public anger against the authorities and the first true demand for
      the right to know and for transparency within the government.1
           The ensuing Interim Government, headed by a former Thai Ambassador to the UN, H.E.
      Anand Panyarachun, was responsive to this demand. A committee was formed to prepare a
      White Paper on an Official Information Act, drawing law professors from several universities,
      including Chulalongkorn, Thammasart and Ramkamhaeng.2
           Although the draft Bill was completed in 1992, it was under General Chavalit Yongjaiyuth’s
      Government that the Bill was tabled before the Parliament and was passed on July 23, 1997.
      The Official Information Act B.E. 2540 (1997) (henceforth referred to as the OIA) was published
      in the Royal Gazette on September 10 and came into force on December 9, 1997.3
           For the first two years after the promulgation of the OIA, the general public was not aware
      of the law. However, public enthusiasm for the OIA increased considerably after a few scan-
      dals had come to light through implementation of the law. This was especially the case after
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                          483




Mrs. Sumalee Limpa-ovart cited the law to request information from Kasetsart Demonstrative
School. She wanted to know why her daughter’s admission to the school’s first-grade class was
denied. She uncovered that the school admitted children of privileged families and donors.
However, it took two and a half years of struggle before her case was resolved.4
    A notorious scandal within the Ministry of Public Health, which involved medical procure-
ment worth 1.4 billion Baht in 1999, was another case that captured public interest. NGOs and
a rural doctors network provided information to the National Anti-Corruption Commission
(NACC), enabling the Commission to rule that the procurement involved corrupt practices. The
case led to the resignation of the Minister and two officials and the imprisonment of the Min-
ister. The media and OIA advocates implemented the OIA law to request information about
this case from the NACC. After several appeals, advocacy groups and journalists successfully
obtained the records of the NACC investigation with the names of eyewitnesses blackened to
protect their identities.5
    However, the hype surrounding Thailand’s OIA did not last very long. A study in 2011 by
the Center of Philanthropy and Civil Society, National Institute of Development Administration,
divided the development of OIA into three phases.6
 • The initial phase: 1997–2000
 • The implementation phase: 2001–2005
 • The amendment phase: 2006–2010

     During the initial phase, the media sought to promote the new Act and raise public
awareness of the law. Many of the media reports on the law during this phase, however, were
related to state agencies’ lack of compliance with the Law, particularly the independent public
agencies such as the NACC, the Office of the Auditor General and the Office of the Election
Commission, who viewed themselves as independent from the OIA. The media also referred to
a culture of secrecy and patronage as key impediments to the law’s implementation.
     The implementation phase covered the period when there were several reports on Thai-
land’s RTI. Several newspapers reported on the higher usage of the OIA among state employ-
ees, journalists and citizens. Political interference was also reported—when two members of
the Official Information Commission (OIC) were removed from their posts. Several problems
started to emerge during this period, including events relating to conflicts between different
rulings such as those relating to the OIC and the Constitutional Court, and the OIC and the
authority of the NACC.
     From 2006, the OIA entered the amendment phase. The OIC attempted to request
amendments both to the Law and its structure. Reports at this time focused on stories relating
to non-disclosure of information by state agencies. This phase saw a reduction in the usage of
the OIA.


3. Key Provisions of the Law: A Snapshot
of the RTI Law
Scope of Coverage: information, documents

 • The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E. 2550 (2007) Section 56 and 57
 • The Official Information Act B.E. 2540 (1997)
484                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




       • Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance B.E. 2546 (2003)
       • Rules on Maintenance of Official Secrets B.E. 2544 (2001)

      Exemptions: harm test, public interest test

      Exemptions are applied to the following:
       • Information that may jeopardize the Royal Institution (OIA, Section 14).
       • Information that would affect national security, international relations, national economic
         or financial security, where disclosure would endanger the life or safety of a person, where
         it would harm law enforcement, or where disclosure would unreasonably encroach on the
         right of privacy (OIA, Section 15).

      Procedures for Access: deadlines, fees, and requesters

       • According to the OIA, a state agency has to (i) publish in the Government Gazette its struc-
         ture and organization (Section 7); (ii) make available for public inspection official informa-
         tion such as decisions, policies, work plans and contracts (Section 9); and (iii) be prepared
         to provide information that may be requested by an individual (Section 11).
       • The OIA does not provide clear and precise time limits for responding to requests. It only
         states that upon receiving a request for information, a state agency must reply “within
         a reasonable period of time” (Section 11). However, the Royal Decree on Criteria and
         Procedures for Good Governance of B.E. 2546 (2003) indicates that the state agencies are
         required to respond to requesters within 15 days (Section 38).
       • The associated cost for a disclosure request is fixed according to the “OIC Announcement
         on the fee rate for document duplication or certification for official information,” dated
         May 7, 1999.
       • Only Thai citizens can request official information.

      Appeals/Courts/Sanctions

       • When the government agency fails to comply with the law as set out in the OIA, the public
         has the right to file an appeal to the Information Disclosure Tribunal (IDT) through the OIC
         (OIA, Sections 13, 18, 25 and 33).
       • The requester can submit a petition to the Administrative Court if dissatisfied with the
         IDT’s decision (The Establishment and Consideration of the Administrative Court Act,
         B.E. 2542 (1999)).
       • Sanctions can be imposed under Sections 40 and 41 of the OIA.

      Oversight Agency

       • The Official Information Commission (OIC) was established by the OIA as the oversight
         Committee.
       • The Office of the Official Information Commission (OOIC) serves as the secretariat for the
         OIC, also established by the OIA.

Proactive Disclosure

 • Information under Sections 7 and 9 of the OIA has to be proactively disclosed and posted on
   the websites of state agencies that have websites (The Cabinet Resolution of April 20, 2011).



4. The Legal Environment and Compliance
This chapter discusses the strength of the legal environment and the extent to which ministries
and agencies have complied with the law.

4.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
Strengths

 • There are several laws guaranteeing citizens RTI.
 • State agencies are required to have information centers, and these are proactive in provid-
   ing information to the public.
 • OIA covers a wide range of state agencies: central administration, provincial administra-
   tion, local administration, state enterprises, government agency attached to the National
   Assembly, courts (only in respect of court affairs not associated with the trial and adjudica-
   tion of cases), professional supervisory organizations, independent agencies of the state,
   and such other agencies as prescribed in the Ministerial Order.

Weaknesses

 • It is left to officials’ discretion whether information can be disclosed.
 • There is no protection for officials who disclose information.
 • Penalties (fines and imprisonment) may be applied to officials who disclose information
   under exemption.
 • The OIA does not provide the RTI to non-citizens.
 • The OIA does not require agencies to have a specific budget for promoting RTI or RTI
   training.

RTI-related Laws

In Thailand, the right to information is guaranteed by laws at several levels, from the
Constitution to specific legislation and Royal Decrees. These laws are:
 • The Constitution of the Royal Kingdom of Thailand B.E. 2540 (1997) and B.E. 2550 (2007)
 • Prime Minister’s Office Regulations on Good Governance (1999)
 • The Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance, B.E. 2546 (2003)
 • Specific legislation: The Planning Act B.E. 2518 (1975); the Enhancement and Conservation
   of National Environment Quality Act, B.E. 2535 (NEQA 1992)
 • Official Information Act B.E. 2540 (1997)
486                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E. 2540 (1997) (in effect between
      11 October 1997 and 19 September 2006) included a number of provisions protecting the
      public right to official information. Its Section 58 stated that “A person shall have the right
      to get access to public information in possession of a State agency, State enterprise or local
      government organization, unless the disclosure of such information shall affect the security of
      the State, public safety or interests of other persons which shall be protected as provided by
      the law.”
          The provision of this right continues in the currently effective Constitution of the King-
      dom of Thailand B.E. 2550 (2007), which is intended to improve the quality of governance
      and aims to balance legislative, executive and judicial powers. It also seeks to give rights,
      duties and fair political participation to Thai citizens.7
          Section 56 of the 2007 Constitution maintains the same right to public information with an
      elaboration on people’s ‘right to know’ and an exception regarding personal information. The
      text states:

         “A person shall have the right to know and have access to public data or information in
         possession of a Government agency, a State agency, a State enterprise or a local govern-
         ment organization, unless the disclosure of such data or information affects the security of
         the State, public safety or interests of other persons which shall be protected, or unless it
         is personal information, as provided by law (Section 56).” [Emphases added]

          The Constitution also gives a person the right to (i) receive data, explanations and reasons
      from the government prior to the approval or the operation of any activity that will impact
      them or their communities, and (ii) express his/her opinions to the concerned agencies.
          Section 57 of the 2007 Constitution states:

         “A person shall have the right to receive data, explanations and reasons from a Government
         agency, a State agency, a State enterprise or a local government organization prior to
         the approval or the operation of any project or activity which may affect the quality of the
         environment, health and sanitary conditions, the quality of life or any other material interest
         concerning such person or a local community and shall have the right to express his or
         her opinions to agencies concerned, for assisting further consideration of such matters.”

          Thailand’s bubble economy in the late 1980s–1990s eventually reached its peak, resulting
      in a landmark economic crisis in 1997. Given the economic globalization, the crisis caused
      a domino effect on neighboring economies. International financial institutions explained
      this so-called ‘Tomyum Kung Crisis’ by pointing their fingers at the lack of good governance
      among Thailand’s financial institutions. In effect, it has raised the Thai public’s attention to
      the concept of ‘good governance’ and the lack thereof, not only amongst state and com-
      mercial banks but also within state administration, among the bureaucrats and those holding
      political office.
          Thailand’s economic growth since the 1980s was a result of development projects and
      economic activities involving industrialization, the excessive exploitation of natural resources
      and forest encroachment. The number of disputes related to natural resources and the envi-
      ronment began to rise nationwide. Environmental NGOs started to attribute the cause of the
      disputes to the lack of participation of local communities impacted by such activities in the
      decision-making processes. Hence, the call for people’s participation in natural resources plan-
      ning and management and in the state’s policies and plans was mounting.

     Amidst this backdrop, the Prime Minister’s Office announced the Prime Minister’s Office
Regulations on Good Governance in 1999, aimed at providing guidance for state agencies
to conduct their public services.
     Four years later, the Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance,
B.E. 2546 (2003) was promulgated to guide the conduct of state agencies and officials.
     This royal decree has 9 parts that cover the Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance—
“Part I: good public administration; Part II: responsive public administration; Part III: result-
based management; Part IV: effectiveness and value for money administration; Part V: lessen-
ing unnecessary steps of work; Part VI: mission review; Part VII: convenient and favorable public
services; Part VIII: performance evaluation, and Part IX: miscellaneous.” In particular, Part VII:
convenient and favorable public services, refers to the right of access to information (e.g.,
Sections 38–41).8
     In addition to the above laws, which apply generally to all state agencies and sectors, there
is also legislation that is specific to certain issues and enforced by particular ministries that
guarantee the right to information, although the degree of clarity for implementation of the
legislation varies. These laws include the Planning Act, B.E. 2518 (1975) and Enhancement and
Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, B.E. 2535 (NEQA 1992).
     This report focuses on two implementing agencies: the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MoNRE) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC), and so only
the NEQA 1992 will be discussed.
     Section 6 (1) of the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environment Quality
Act, B.E. 2535 (NEQA 1992) provides the right of a person “to be informed and obtain
information and data from the government service in matters concerning the enhancement
and conservation of environmental quality, except the information or data that are officially
classified as secret intelligence pertaining to national security, or secrets pertaining to the
right to privacy, property rights, or the rights in trade or business of any person which are duly
protected by law.“
     It should be noted that while this Act was ahead of its time in granting people the right
to information, i.e., preceding the 1997 Constitution and the 1997 Official Information Act, it
does not spell out how this Section should be implemented. In practice, it was left to officials’
interpretation and judgment.
     Thailand’s RTI law is known as the Official Information Act, B.E. 2540 (1997) (henceforth
referred to as the OIA) and was promulgated in 1997. The OIA trumps all other laws in the
country on the provision and restriction of access to information (Section 3). The drafting of this
Act was done in parallel with that of the 1997 Constitution. Thus, the OIA does not make any
reference to the Constitution and it would not be possible to do so.
     The OIA provides a legal framework that recognizes the fundamental right of access to
information, but it fails to express categorically the fundamental right of people to access
information. In other words, it does not have a statement which says “people have the right
to…” as in the Constitution. Instead, the OIA provides instructions as to how the state agen-
cies are to respond to people’s requests for information in their possession.
     The OIA consists of seven chapters as follows:9
   Chapter 1: Information Disclosure
   Chapter 2: Information not Subject to Disclosure
   Chapter 3: Personal Information
   Chapter 4: Historical Information
488                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         Chapter 5: Official Information Committee
         Chapter 6: Information Disclosure Tribunals
         Chapter 7: Penalties

           The OIA guarantees people’s rights to access government information, ranging from
      the right to inspect, to request a copy, to get advice, to make complaints and appeal, and
      to ask the state to correct or change personal information. Such rights are bestowed on
      an individual whether or not s/he has any involvement or relationship with the cause and
      effect of the information s/he is requesting. If a state agency denies disclosure of the
      requested information, citizens have the right to appeal to the IDT through the OIC to recon-
      sider the case.
           The OIA covers two important domains. First, the law guarantees to all citizens the free-
      dom of access to public sector information. Second, it obliges all state agencies to provide
      protection for personal information or privacy in all public sector information (Chapter 3).
           The OIA covers information which is in the possession of state agencies, whether that
      information is about government agencies or the private sector. ‘State agencies’ are defined to
      cover: central administration, provincial administration, local administration, state enterprises,10
      government agency attached to the National Assembly, courts (only in respect of court affairs
      not associated with the trial and adjudication of cases), professional supervisory organizations,
      independent agencies of the state, and such other agencies as prescribed in the Ministerial
      Order (Section 4).
           Section 11 stipulates that a state agency has to be prepared to provide information that
      may be requested by an individual (Section 11). In addition, it is required to publish in the Gov-
      ernment Gazette its structure and organization, and all information affecting the general public
      (Section 7); and make available for public inspection official information such as decisions, poli-
      cies, work plans and contracts (Section 9).
           Whilst every citizen has the right to request the disclosure of any government information,
      whether or not the request will be granted is at the discretion of the authorities. In the event of
      refusal, the authorities have to give a reason and mostly it is because of “national security” rea-
      sons or potential “negative impact on the public”. However, citizens have the right to appeal
      against refusals.
           State officials have to advise the citizens with regard to their request (Section 12). When
      the decision is for non-disclosure, the State agency has to make sure that the reason for the
      decision and the requester’s right to make an appeal (within a certain time frame) are clearly
      explained to the requester (Section 15).
           It must be noted, however, that non-citizens do not enjoy these rights to the same extent
      as Thai citizens. Section 9 stipulates that the rights of non-citizens to inspect or obtain a copy
      or a certified copy of the information shall be provided by a Ministerial Order. Since there has
      been no Ministerial Order to date, the government agency that receives the request has to
      make the decision.
           The impacts of this restriction on non-citizens should not be overlooked. Given the fact
      that Thailand’s income is higher than its neighboring economies, a substantive number of
      migrant workers from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have been working in several economic
      sectors in Thailand. These non-Thai-citizen workers who are not yet residents of Thailand
      have practically no right to access official information. These migrant workers are highly
      likely to catch communicable diseases because their living quarters are often congested and
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                              489




unhygienic. Without adequate and timely access to information, especially the possible health
risk imposed on them by their work environment, their health will remain vulnerable and even-
tually the general public can also be at risk.11
     Additionally, in the light of the forthcoming ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the
more frequent and intense communication among the citizens of ASEAN member countries,
an increasing number of non-Thai citizens in Thailand are likely to seek information possessed
by various state agencies. An ASEAN system of regional exchange of information could be set
up to facilitate their access to information and ensure that no country will have an unfair advan-
tage over the others.12 Such a mechanism can be viable only after the OIA is amended.
     It should be noted that the OIA does not enable government agencies to obtain informa-
tion from each other. Obtaining information from another government agency follows the
government administrative system, not the OIA.

4.2. USE/ABUSE OF EXEMPTIONS, HARM TEST AND PUBLIC INTEREST TEST
Strengths

 • Complaint and appeal mechanisms and timelines are in place.
 • The OOIC has complaint and appeal procedures, how-to guidelines, and downloadable
   forms available on their website.

Weaknesses

 • The public interest test is sometimes used to deny requesters access to information.
 • The Law relies on officials’ discretion; but officials are reluctant to disclose information for
   fear of a penalty.
 • There is no protection for officials who disclose information or for whistle-blowers.

    Although the OOIC hails the following motto “Disclosure is the norm; closure is the excep-
tion” and has it posted on the agency’s website and printed on its paper publications, the OIA
allows certain categories of information to be exempted from disclosure.
    As a rule, before disclosing information, designated officials at the agency receiving a
request will check whether the requested documentation is subject to non-disclosure, as
outlined in sections 14 and 15 of the OIA. Information that may not be disclosed under these
sections is:

Section 14. Official information that may jeopardize the Royal Institution.

Section 15. A state agency or state official may issue an order prohibiting the disclosure of
official information falling under any of the following descriptions, with due consideration to
the implementation of the agency’s duty under the law, public interests and the interests of the
related private individuals combined:

(1) The disclosure thereof will jeopardize the national security, international relations, or
    national economic or financial security;

(2) The disclosure thereof will result in the decline in the efficiency of law enforcement or fail-
    ure to achieve its objectives, whether or not it is related to litigation, prevention, suppres-
    sion, testing, inspection, or knowledge of the source of the information;
490                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      (3) An opinion or advice given within the State agency for the handling of a matter, excluding
          a technical report, fact report or information supporting the internal provision of opinions
          or recommendations;

      (4) The disclosure thereof will endanger the life or safety of any person;

      (5) A medical report or personal information the disclosure of which will unreasonably
          encroach upon the right of privacy;

      (6) Official information protected by law against disclosure or information given by a person
          who does not wish the authorities to disclose it to others;

      (7) Other cases as prescribed in a Royal Decree.”

          The exemptions outlined above have unfortunately turned out to be barriers to the disclo-
      sure of information. The Director of the OOIC said:

         “The description in Section 15 is rather broad and as such officials are bound to apply their
         own judgment. In practice, officials are often reluctant to apply their judgment to disclose
         the information in question even if there are precedent cases. They are more willing to
         disclose information only when they receive a formal order to do so. This is because they
         feel insecure and fear a penalty.”13

           Exemptions in the RTI law are not unique to Thailand’s OIA, as a study on environmental
      governance in Asia found exemptions common to many other Asian countries and made the
      following observation:

         “These kinds of restrictions also put pressure on government workers not to reveal
         information to the public, for fear of prosecution. In the absence of legal mechanisms to
         protect whistle-blowers, institutional culture within state institutions can constrain govern-
         ment workers to reveal information for fear of retribution within their agencies, even in
         cases in which the information is not sensitive. Without clear guidelines and recognition
         of the right to reveal state information that is in the public interest, state agencies can
         be expected to continue to be reluctant to disclose information at the risk of exposing
         themselves to public criticism.”14




      4.3. APPEALS COURTS AND SANCTIONS
      Strengths

       • Administrative Courts exist in Thailand.
       • There are two levels of appeal for non-government complainants, first to the Information
         Disclosure Tribunal; and if not satisfied with the IDT’s decision, the complainants can
         appeal to the Administrative Courts.
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                              491




Weaknesses

 • Implementing agencies do not have an internal appeal system specifically for RTI.
 • People do not understand the OIA, the responsibilities and powers of the related state
   agencies or the procedures. Hence they cannot benefit fully from the existing law and
   mechanisms.


Appeals

According to the OIA, there are two mechanisms of grievance redress for information request-
ers: complaints and appeals. Complaints are made when a state agency does not proactively
disclose information which is supposed to be made publicly available or when a requester
does not receive responses from an agency after his/her request was made. Complaints are
to be sent to the OIC. Appeals are filed when a person receives state agency’s (1) refusal of
his/her request for information disclosure, (2) refusal to make corrections to his/her personal
information, or (3) non-disclosure of his/her personal information. Appeals are made to the
Information Disclosure Tribunal (IDT), via the OIC.
     State agencies do not have internal appeal mechanisms. However, some agencies have a
complaint-receiving mechanism, such as the Civil Servant Development Bureau. This mecha-
nism is for any complaints, not necessarily about RTI. In addition, citizens can make complaints
to the official’s superior authority, according to Administrative Procedural Act, 1996. Again, this
is not necessary about RTI but can include RTI as well.
     Officials are required to inform requesters of the reasons for not disclosing the requested
information. The requesters can appeal to the IDT through the OIC within 15 days after receiv-
ing the notification of non-disclosure (Section 18, OIA). The implementing agencies do not
have any in-built internal appeal system. The complainant has to follow the required proce-
dures and timeline when making an appeal.
     In case an agency’s official considers that disclosing the requested information may impact
the interest of a particular individual, s/he will have to inform the requester accordingly and
advise him/her of the right to file a complaint against the agency for non-disclosure within a
certain period of time, as determined by the agency, but not less than 15 days (Section 17).
Should the agency reject the non-disclosure complaint, the individual can then appeal to the
IDT through the OIC within 15 days after receiving the notification (Section 18).
    The appeal procedure, guidance on how to appeal, downloadable appeal forms, appeal
examples and the time required for each step of the process (totaling 46 days) are provided
online on the OOIC website.15
     When receiving an appeal, the OIC will firstly consider if the case falls into either of the
following categories:
 • the state agency refuses to disclose the information as requested; and
 • the state agency refuses to pay attention to a person’s objection to the disclosure of
   information about which the person has a stake and that s/he has already submitted an
   objection to the agency
492                                                 RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




            If the case does fall into one of these categories, the OIC will then proceed with the
      appeal. The OIC will forward the appeal to one of the five IDTs most relevant to the case. The
      five Tribunals are: Foreign Affairs and National Security; National Economy and Finance; Social
      Affairs, Public Administration and Law Enforcement; Medicine and Public Health; and Science,
      Technology, Industry and Agriculture.
            There is no fee and no lawyer required for making an appeal. When a complaint or appeal
      is lodged with the OIC because access to the requested information is denied, the Com-
      mission will have to complete its consideration within 60 days from the date it receives the
      complaint or appeal.
            When the Tribunal decides that the state agency has to disclose the requested informa-
      tion to the requester, this decision is deemed final to that state agency, i.e., the agency has to
      disclose the information.
            However, when the Tribunal’s decision is in accord with the state agency—i.e., not to disclose
      the requested information, the requester can appeal to an Administrative Court within 90 days
      after being notified of the Tribunal’s decision. The Court can revoke the Tribunal’s decision; and
      its ruling is considered final. The requester cannot appeal to the Court without first making an
      appeal to the IDT. However, the Court can only examine whether the Tribunal’s decision is lawful,
      i.e., the Tribunal has considered the appeal in good faith and in accordance with the intention of
      the law. If the Court finds the Tribunal’s decision to be unlawful, the Tribunal’s decision will then
      be revoked. Agencies will comply with the Court’s ruling. The Court does not have the authority

to consider the interests of the stakeholders; only the agency officials and the Tribunal have the
authority to consider the stakeholders’ interests in making their judgments.16
    The OOIC’s website17 provides clear instructions on how to file a complaint and an appeal,
as well as the procedures, the downloadable forms and the timeline.

Number of Requests, Complaints and Appeals

The bar chart in figure 3 depicts the number of complaints and appeals made against state
agencies nationwide and submitted to the OIC from 1998 to 2012. It clearly shows that both
numbers are on the rise and peaked at 647 complaints and 253 appeals in 2012.
    Among all the complaints made against state agencies and submitted to the OIC during
fiscal years 2010–2012, complaints about information regarding procurement numbered higher
than any other categories (25 percent). Next to procurement was investigation on the use of
agency’s authority (22 percent). This was also true to each of the three years.
    The OIC received 453, 567 and 619 complaints on state agencies’ non-compliance with
the Official Information Act in fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Most of the
complaints were against central state agencies, constituting 61.81 percent, 67.84 percent and
67.37 percent, respectively, for the three years, followed by the local and regional agencies.

*Fiscal years


    Thailand’s administration is divided into three levels: central, regional (provinces) and local
(municipalities and tambon, or district, administrative organizations).
    Interestingly, each year at least half of all the complaints were submitted to the OIC by
government officials, followed by general citizens, and then companies/legal entities. In 2012,
for example, 56.78 percent of all the petitions were filed by state officials, 25 percent by the
general public and 5.08 percent by companies or legal entities.18

Administrative Court

The Administrative Court is an independent body resulting from the Constitution and is
regarded as a state agency by the OIA.
    Once the IDT has made its decision and the private complainant is not satisfied with the
result, the latter can then submit an appeal to an Administrative Court. In such a case, the
complainant has to file the appeal within 90 days, as stipulated in Section 49 of the Estab-
lishment and Consideration of the Administrative Court Act, B.E. 2542 (1999). The Court will
dismiss the appeal if filed after 90 days.
    The Court will send its rulings to both parties in dispute, i.e., the private individual(s) and
the state agency, and post the rulings on a website without identifying the names of the com-
plainants. The Court has the authority to rule that the state agencies comply with the OIA, i.e.,
release the requested information. State agencies will normally comply with the Court’s rulings.
In the case that any state agency fails to do so, it will be deemed as a violation of the Court
under the civil law. The penalty includes either fine or imprisonment, or both. The Court can
also report the case to the Prime Minister, the Cabinet or the respective Minister so that execu-
tive or disciplinary measures can be applied against the agency/person.
    No fee is required to file a lawsuit with the Administrative Court. Only when a plaintiff asks
for compensation from the defendant is a fee required. No lawyer is needed for Administra-
tive Court lawsuits because the judge will investigate the case and obtain documentation from
the state agencies or the defendant (Section 24 (5) and Section 55 of the Establishment and
Consideration of Administrative Court Act, 1999).
    The complainant will get his/her expenses back only when s/he wins the case and pay-
ment of damages is requested in the lawsuit. However, the Court will not allow repayment of
legal fees, if there are any, as the Administrative Court does not require a lawyer (Section 72,
final clause).
    The Court’s rulings constitute the final decision of cases and are published in the Court’s
annual report. The Court also publishes a manual including selected appeal cases, revealing

      only the names of the organizations involved but not the names of individuals who made the
      appeals. This is to educate the people.
          An interview with a Chief Judge of the Chamber of the Central Administrative Court found
      the following issues with RTI-related appeals submitted to the Administrative Court.19
       • Requesters who were denied access to information and wish to appeal will have to
         go through the appeals process at the IDT before they can submit an appeal to the
         Administrative Court.
       • In some cases, those who appeal are not able to differentiate between the various catego-
         ries of information, e.g. they confuse ‘rules and regulations’ with ‘office procedures’ or do
         not understand the differences between ‘personal information’ and ‘general information.’
         Only the latter is accessible to the public. The judge will dismiss such cases.
       • There is a lack of understanding among the public about (i) the powers and responsibilities
         of the OIC, OOIC, and IDTs; and (ii) the procedures, as required by the OIA.

      Application (or Absence) of Sanctions

      In some countries such as Romania, failing to provide information to the requester can result
      in a fine for the head of the institution and RTI officers. These fines are a percentage of their
      salaries and accrue daily.20 This kind of sanction is believed to assure the accountability of the
      state officials in charge of the agencies and drive the responsible officials to disclose informa-
      tion to the requesters.
           Unfortunately, Thailand’s OIA does not provide such a sanction. When an IDT decides that
      an agency should disclose the information to the requester, the agency is supposed to comply
      with the decision and disclose the information. However, in case the agency fails to do so,
      there is no sanction against it. The OIA bestows on the IDT the authority to make a decision,
      but does not impose any sanction on the state agencies that do not abide by the decision.
      The refusal to disclose information may be subject to sanctions under either the criminal law, if
      deemed to be done in bad faith to damage the complainant, or the civil law for not complying
      with the IDT’s decision.21
           In practice, when a complaint is received because of a state agency’s non-disclosure of
      information, the OOIC will advise the complainant to file a complaint with the higher agency
      that oversees the agency in question. For example, if a complaint concerns a refusal by the
      Board of Investment (BoI) to give access to information, the OOIC will advise the complainant
      to file a petition with the Ministry of Industry, which oversees the BoI.22
           Nor does the OIA impose any sanctions for non-compliance with the Administrative Court’s
      ruling. However, in the case of the Administrative Court, the state agencies that do not com-
      ply with the Court’s ruling will be regarded as violating the Court under the civil law mutatis
      mutandis. The Court will exercise its authority to sanction the violating agencies with a fine
      and/or imprisonment. Secondly, the Court can report the violation to the superior of the violat-
      ing agencies (Prime Minister or the Cabinet or Minister) so that an administrative or disciplinary
      measure can be applied.23
           The OIA has a provision to sanction officials who disclose information under Section 15
      (exemption) without an official order for disclosure, with a penalty of imprisonment for a term
      not exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding twenty thousand Baht, or both (Section 41).
      And any person who fails to comply with the order of the OIC issued under Section 32 of the
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                              497




OIA, which authorizes the OIC to summon a person to testify or present any documentation
or other evidence to the Commission, will be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
three months or a fine not exceeding five thousand Baht, or both (Section 40).
    Moreover, the OIA does not provide any protection for whistle-blowers, i.e., officials who
disclose information about any corruption or wrongdoing in the state agencies.
    The above sanctions (or lack thereof) in Thailand’s RTI law apply penalties for disclosure
and no penalties for non-disclosure. This begs a question about the real intention motivating
this law, i.e., whether the law is meant to promote or indeed inhibit the citizens’ right to infor-
mation and officials’ disclosure of information in the possession of the state agencies.

4.4. IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY OF THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY24
Strengths

 • There is a specialized agency to promote the implementation of OIA.
 • The OOIC is well structured with clearly divided sections; specific staff are assigned to
   each section.
 • The OOIC publishes capacity building information online to facilitate people’s use
   of RTI.
 • The state’s implementation of the OIA is directly under the Prime Minister’s Office. If the
   Prime Minister has a strong will to promote RTI, this will provide a good opportunity for
   RTI to flourish.

Weaknesses

 • The OOIC is directly under the Office of the Permanent Secretary of the Prime Minister’s
   Office and hence its independence is questionable.
 • The OIC is chaired by a Minister and can be directly influenced by the government.
 • There is a conflict of interest. The OIA relates to information in the possession of the state
   agencies. Thus, while the disclosure of this information may be in the interest of the citi-
   zens, it may not be in the interest of the government. Given this lack of independence from
   the government, the progress of RTI in Thailand can be at risk as it is highly dependent on
   the ruling political party.

    The OOIC is the specialized agency for the oversight and promotion of the implementa-
tion of the Official Information Act, 1997. It was established within the first year after the OIA
was promulgated and is under the Office of the Permanent Secretary of the Prime Minister’s
Office, in accordance with Section 6 of the Act.25 The OOIC performs secretariat functions for
both the OIC and the IDT. The OIA’s Section 6 mandates the OOIC with the following tasks:
 • Performing technical and secretarial work for the OIC and IDT;
 • Coordinating with other state agencies; and
 • Providing advice to the private sector (meaning non-state sectors) on how to comply with
   the OIC.

   In practice, the OOIC also works to promote other state agencies’ implementation of the
OIA, including by providing them with training and technical advice. The OOIC also monitors
498                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      these agencies’ implementation of the OIA through, for instance, annual reporting and visits to
      their offices.
           The OOIC is not independent from the government as it is under the Office of the Perma-
      nent Secretary of the Prime Minister’s Office. Besides, the OIC, for which the OOIC serves as a
      secretariat office, is headed by a Minister directly appointed by the Prime Minister. In reality, it
      is therefore unlikely that the OIC and OOIC will operate independently from the Minister and
      the Prime Minister. Section 28 of the OIA stipulates that the authority and duties of the OIC
      are to:

      1. Supervise and give advice with regard to the performance of the duties of State officials
         and State agencies for the implementation of this Act;

      2. Give advice to State officials or State agencies with regard to the implementation of this
         Act as requested;

      3. Give recommendations on the enactment of the Royal Decrees and the issuance of the
         Ministerial Regulations or the Rules of the Cabinet under this Act;

      4. Consider and give opinions on the complaints under Section 13;

      5. Submit a report on the implementation of this Act to the Council of Ministers from time to
         time as appropriate but at least once a year;

      6. Perform other duties provided in this Act;

      7. Carry out other acts as entrusted by the Cabinet or the Prime Minister.

      Human Resources

      At its inception in 1998, the OOIC started with only 19 officials and this number later increased
      to 30. Since 2011, 10 more positions have been added, totaling 40 positions.
          At present, however, the Office’s actual staff amounts to only 38 persons. The OOIC
      comprises the following 6 sections: Policy and analysis (5 staff); appeals (8 staff); handling of
      complaints and issuing advice (9 staff); promotion and dissemination of RTI (5 staff); informa-
      tion technology development (6 staff); general administration (4 staff) and the director (1 staff).
          Given the small staff, the OOIC recognizes the need for implementing agencies to have
      the capacity to handle OIA-related matters in order to lessen the OOIC’s burden. To achieve
      this, a few campaigns and activities were launched. The state agencies’ performance on infor-
      mation disclosure was integrated into officials’ key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide
      them with incentives. In addition, an operations manual on RTI promotion and protection was
      published in 2010.26
          Other RTI-promotional activities conducted by OOIC include:
       • Conducting training and a seminar on the implementation of the OIA and the promotion
         of RTI for state officials;
       • Starting a project in 2011 that entailed visiting information centers at other state agencies
         to provide guidance on how to disclose official information and to develop a good practice
         information center model in each province nationwide;
       • Updating OOIC’s policies and plan annually, by integrating inputs from the annual reports
         on RTI implementation submitted to OOIC by state agencies throughout the country;27
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                              499

 • Providing an example of an electronic information center online so that implementing
   agencies can take advantage of: http://www.oic.go.th/infocenter/001/default.asp.

    Each year, the OOIC organizes an OIA test for state officials. In fiscal year 2011, there
was a three-day test for 225 officials. Only 93 of these officials achieved the 60 percent pass
mark, constituting less than half (41.33 percent) of all the officials who took the test. They were
awarded a certificate by the Chairman of the OIC, who is the Minister of the Prime Minister’s
Office, at an OOIC Annual Seminar.
    The OOIC has a website for knowledge management, http://www.demooic.com/km/index
.html, to implement the Knowledge Management Strategy of the Office of the Permanent Sec-
retary (OPS), which it is under. The strategy aims to promote offices under the OPS to become
learning organizations. There also are annual plans and indicators to implement the strategy.

Leadership

Direction of the OOIC is provided by the OOIC’s director and the Minister of the Prime
Minister’s Office, who is the OIC chair. Recruitment and removal of the OOIC director is in
accordance with the regulations of the Civil Servants Bureau. After the selection process is
completed by a recruitment committee, the chosen candidate is appointed by the Permanent
Secretary, to whom the OOIC’s director reports. No term limit applies to the director or any of
the OOIC’s officials.
     The OOIC has a strategic plan with a work plan and indicators, and the staff participates
in the planning process. The OOIC’s mandate, which is to implement and promote the OIA, is
given top priority by the director.
500                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      Responses to Requests

      Whilst the OOIC is an oversight agency, it must comply with the OIA and Royal Decree on
      Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance, B.E. 2546 (2003), like all other government
      agencies. As such, it needs to provide information to the public both proactively and when
      requested, and has to have a one-stop-service center to facilitate visitors, including providing
      them with information.
           As the OOIC is under the OPS of the Prime Minister’s Office, the Information Center is
      a part of the OPS’ One-Stop-Service Center. The Information Center has an official to assist
      visitors and respond to their queries. S/he also collects related fees. The OPS assigns specific
      officials to coordinate with other state agencies on information-related matters.
           Requests for official information from the OOIC can be done either formally or informally.
      The OOIC website explains citizens’ right to request information and provides instructions on
      how to request information, the request form and an example of a request. This information is
      applicable not only to OOIC. Citizens who wish to request information from other government
      agencies can follow this instruction and use the request form.
           Although the OIA requires that a request be made, it does not require that the request be
      made in writing. However, making requests in writing benefits the requesters themselves. They
      will have proof of their request and, as such, can refer to it for a follow-up in case they do not
      hear from the OOIC within 15 days.
           According to the Director of the OOIC,28 the request should be written comprehensively,
      covering both details of the requester and details of the information one wishes to request.
      For example, if one wishes to obtain information about a contract of a tambon administra-
      tive organization (TAO), s/he should specify the title and the date of the contract. If the
      requested information is about the minutes of a TAO meeting, the subject and date of the
      meeting and the exact title of the committee which had the meeting should be written in
      the request.
           In the request form, s/he needs to put down if s/he wishes only to see the document, or
      to have a copy of the document or also to have the copy certified. S/he should also write the
      purpose of his/her request although it is not required by law. The provision of the purpose
      will assist the IDT in considering the request and weighing the public’s, stakeholders’ and
      requester’s interests.
           The request is to be submitted to the General Administration Section of the Office of the
      Permanent Secretary, who will pass the request to the OOIC. The OOIC can respond directly
      to the requester.
           There are five channels through which citizens can request information from the
      OOIC: visit the OPS One-Stop Service Center, postal mail, fax, electronic mail, and website
      www.opm.go.th.
           The OOIC website says it responds to each query posted on its interactive web-board
      within 2 days. Interested persons can request OOIC publications for free, provided they pay
      the postal cost.

      Records Management

      The OOIC does not manage records by itself. This responsibility is the task of the
      Documentation Section of the OPS Information Center and overseen by the Legal Office.
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                            501




Documents are managed by category and subject in two formats: paper and the website,
www.opm.go.th/imageopm/nps/nps6100.doc. Both of them are accessible to the public.
   The OOIC has just launched a new website to facilitate the visitor’s search. http://
www.demooic.com/innovation/about.htm.

Budget

The OOIC’s mandate is to promote and implement the OIA, and its entire budget is for this
purpose. The OIC gave policy recommendations for OOIC’s strategic plan for 2012–2015 and
proposed them to the Cabinet for approval. Once approved, the OOIC prepared projects,
work plans and a budget for each strategy.
   The OOIC’s budget allocations for the following strategies are as follows:

1. Strategy to promote right to know and people’s access to information—10.20 million Baht

2. Strategy to manage state agencies’ information—222.66 million Baht

3. Strategy to promote transparency and fair use of state power—116.45 million Baht.

4. Strategy for integrative restructuring—27.82 million Baht

    For fiscal year (FY) 2011, the OOIC received a budget of 23.34 million Baht. About half of
the amount went to cover personnel costs (11.21 million Baht), 7.13 million was spent on its
operations (office expenses, meetings, outreach and training) and 5 million for other activities,
which in 2011 was mainly for a project to increase the government’s credentials on trans-
parency. The OOIC’s annual operational budgets during FYs 2007–2011 remained roughly
unchanged. For FY 2012, this budget was reduced due to critical floods in the country and the
government re-allocated budgets from several agencies to restore the post-flood economy.
The OOIC observed that it might be difficult to regain the budget in following years to pursue
the proactive strategy and that the RTI work could be impeded.
    “The government has not paid much attention to the RTI. The budget and personnel are
not sufficient for proactive activities nationwide. In the past, the OOIC has not utilized elec-
tronic technology much. We are developing that area right now…We received a budget for
upgrading our website and will try to keep our record electronically.…begin to use tablets for
our internal meetings to reduce the use of paper and also to have our staff become familiar
with technology. We also use ‘Line’ (social media) for our work. Some senior officials feel this
could be side-stepping the proper procedures. Older people are not adaptive to changes,”
said Pol.Lt.Col.Tienrat Vichiensan, the OOIC’s Director.


4.5. COMPLIANCE WITH PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
Strengths

 • Law and regulations are in place to promote proactive disclosure.
 • Agencies comply with the law and proactively disclose the required information.

Weakness

 • The degree of implementation varies among agencies.
502                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      Disclosure Requirements

      State agencies and officials perform their tasks following the laws and regulations that govern
      their agencies. In Thailand, the OIA and the Cabinet Resolution of December 28, 2004 require
      state agencies to provide certain categories of information proactively to the public.
          Sections 7 and 9 of the OIA identify information which is required to be disclosed to the
      public proactively. Section 7 requires state agencies to publish certain information in the Gov-
      ernment Gazette. This information includes:

      (1) The agency’s structure and operational organization;

      (2) A summary of its key responsibilities and modus operandi;

      (3) A contact address whereby the people can request information or advice on how to con-
          tact the agency;

      (4) Rules, Cabinet resolutions, orders, commands, regulations, plans, policies or interpreta-
          tions affecting the public; and

      (5) Any other information as determined by the OIC.

          According to Section 9, “State agencies shall make available at least the following official
      information for public inspection in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed by
      the OIC:

      “(1) Resolutions or decisions which have direct impact on the non-state individuals including
           dissenting opinion and orders relating thereto;

      (2)   Policies or interpretations which do not fall within the scope of the requirement of publi-
            cation in the Government Gazette under section 7 (4);

      (3)   Work plans, projects and annual expenditure estimates of the year of their preparation;

      (4)   Manuals or orders relating to the work procedures of state officials which affect the rights
            and duties of private individuals;

      (5)   Published materials to which a reference is made under Section 7, paragraph two;

      (6)   Concession contracts, agreements of a monopolistic nature or joint venture agreements
            with private individuals for the provision of public services;

      (7)   Cabinet’s resolutions or resolutions of the committees which were appointed by a law or
            by a Cabinet; the list of technical reports, fact reports or any other information used for
            their consideration shall also be provided;

      (8)   Other information as determined by the Official Information Commission.”

          Given the limited implementation of the OIA by state agencies in the early 2000s, the
      Cabinet made a Resolution on December 28, 2004, urging agencies to comply with the OIA. In
      particular, the Resolution required agencies that had a website to post the following informa-
      tion on their websites: bidding, tendering, decisions on procurement and all the information
      under Section 9 of the OIA.
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                             503




     Almost six years later, a group of CSOs29 successfully encouraged the OIC to issue an OIC
Announcement dated June 7, 2010 requiring that certain environmental and health information
be proactively disclosed in accordance with Section 9(8) of the OIA.
     Being the oversight agency does not make the OOIC immune from the OIA, the Cabinet’s
Resolution or the OIC Announcement. In fact, the OOIC provides information on Sections 7
and 9 of the OIA at the OPS’s Information Center. It also proactively provides information in
several other forms, including a quarterly newsletter, flyers, posters and postings on public
relations boards at its own office building.
     However, although the OOIC provides a wealth of information on its website,30 it is not
easy to locate the information one seeks. This is due to the way the information and data is
managed and presented. It lacks a good classification system, either by subject or year. How-
ever, at the time of writing, the OOIC has just started a new website, hopefully with a better
classification system.31
     All implementing agencies are subject to the same aforementioned law and regulations,
i.e., the OIA, the Cabinet’s Resolution and the OIC’s Announcement. Governed by the same
rules, their activities regarding information disclosure are similar to those described above, but
their priorities tend to vary.


Two Examples: The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment
and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) publishes information under OIA
Section 7 in the Royal Gazette and posts the documents required to be made available for
public access under Sections 7 and 9 on the first page of its website.32
    Each Department under MoNRE has its own website as well. For instance, the Office
of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP) posts the information
required to be disclosed proactively on its website, http://www.onep.go.th/information. It also
provides other information via social media, Facebook.com/onep.go.th, Twitter.com/oneptwitt,
and a free mobile application “ThaiEnvi4Future.”
    Likewise, the Pollution Control Department (PCD) publishes information under OIA Sec-
tion 7 in the Royal Gazette, places information under Sections 7 and 9 in its Information Office
and also posts them on its website, www.pcd.go.th. PCD also reports water quality at 76 sta-
tions covering 25 water sources nationwide on website www.wqmonline.com and air quality
on http://air4thai.pcd.go.th/web/. In addition, the Department’s mobile application, Air4Thai,
enables both iOS and Android users to access air quality information from monitoring stations
nationwide free of charge.
    Although water and air quality data is not among the information listed under Section 7 or
Section 9 as being required to be disclosed to the public proactively, it is the information that
the general public has requested from MoNRE the most.33 Thus, MoNRE proactively provides
the information because it is of public interest.
    In accordance with the OIA, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC) has
assigned its Agricultural Information Division to serve as the Official Information Center and
kept a space in the Ministry’s library to provide the information that state agencies are required
to make available for people’s inspection (Sections 7 and 9 of the OIA).
504                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          MoAC also provides information on the agricultural database, agricultural information
      technology, plant and animal diseases, events, etc. on its website, www.moac.go.th. MoAC’s
      Service Center, required by the Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Gover-
      nance, B.E. 2546 (2003), is online, http://service.moac.go.th/main.php?filename=index. People
      can also reach MoAC at its call center.
          Apparently, websites have become one of the most essential means for government
      agencies to provide information proactively. The information disclosed is not limited to that
      required by law but also covers other information that the agencies consider interesting to
      the public.


      4.6. ROLE OF CASE LAW
      Strength

       • The rulings of the Administrative Court have set a precedent.

      Weakness

       • Agency officials are still reluctant to disclose information and often apply judgment,
         granted by law, to refuse to disclose information, even when the requested information is
         not under either Sections 13 or 14 and there are prior similar cases with decisions that they
         can follow. This reluctance is to avoid any possible adverse impacts on them.

          Although there have often been similar appeals, state officials have not made use of any
      appeal decision as a precedent. This is because they are fearful of possible prosecution.34
      The OOIC has compiled decisions of IDTs on both disclosure and non-disclosure cases for
      dissemination.
          The situation is different at the Administrative Court, however. The following are some of
      the rulings which have set norms for ensuing considerations:35
       • The Court has interpreted certain government documentation to be the agency’s opera-
         tional guidelines, and not rules. As such, they are not required to be published in the Royal
         Gazette (ref. the ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court of 530/2554).
       • The Court ruled that when a state agency or official applies its judgment not to disclose
         information, s/he has to check against some criteria, such as the conduct of state agencies
         according to law combined with public interest and the interest of the private individual,
         and that the information has to be in accordance with Section 15, clauses (1)-(7) only (ref.

       • The Court has interpreted what information is considered to be ‘personal’ and that state
         agencies shall not disclose (ref. the ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court of
          46/2554).
       • The Court ruled that the entity authorized to consider appeals regarding information non-
         disclosure is the IDT, not the OIC (ref. the ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court of

5. Agency-Level Practices: Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment and Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives
This section covers two Ministries: Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE)
and Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC).
    MoNRE was founded on October 2, 2002, although the management of natural resources
and the environment in Thailand began much earlier. In fact, the National Environmental
Quality Act, which governs the operations of MoNRE, was passed in 1992, the very same year
that the UN hosted the UN Conference on Environment and Development. The founding of
MoNRE in 2002 only marked a reorganization of this Ministry.
    MoNRE’s responsibilities include the protection of the nation’s natural resources: water,
oceans, minerals, and forests and the protection and restoration of the environment. For its
organizational structure, see Annex 2.
    MoAC is one of the oldest Ministries in the Thai government. It is responsible for the
administration of agricultural policies, forestry, water resources provision, irrigation, and the
promotion and development of farmers and cooperative systems, including manufacturing
processes and agricultural products.
    MoAC has under it 2 administrative offices, 13 departments, 5 enterprises and 3 state
enterprises.36
    Each Ministry has an Office of the Permanent Secretary (OPS), which is responsible for the
Information Center, and an Information Committee. Each Ministry also has under it several
departments, agencies, state enterprises, and public companies. Some of these agencies have
their own Information Centers and Information Committees.



5.1. LEADERSHIP
Strength

 • MoNRE demonstrates leadership in promoting OIA implementation.

Weakness

 • RTI is not given similar attention by other implementing agencies, e.g. MoAC.

    The organizational structure for implementing RTI in MoNRE and MoAC is similar to that
of the OOIC. Their Information Offices, which oversee the disclosure of official information,
are under the OPS of their respective Ministry. And like any other civil servants, the OPS Heads
have no term.
    MoNRE has demonstrated its leadership in promoting RTI. On September 24, 2012,
MoNRE signed an MoU with the OOIC to become a prototype model as a Ministerial Informa-
tion Center under OIA implementation. For fiscal year 2014, MoNRE has included in its action
506                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      plans (i) the improvement of its Information Center to meet the OOIC’s standards, (ii) the hold-
      ing of capacity building workshops for MoNRE’s management, division heads and information
      officials both in Bangkok and in the provinces, and (iii) the establishment of an information
      office within each department, state enterprise, company and public company under the
      Ministry in order to create a wide understanding of OIA and RTI among both officials and the
      general public.
           At MoAC, however, RTI seems to be regarded as a task required by law and a set of regula-
      tions that the Ministry has to duly comply with, but it is not given high priority. This may have to
      do with the lack of understanding of RTI and OIA within MoAC.37


      5.2. INFORMATION CENTER AND HUMAN RESOURCES
      Strength

       • Each agency has officials assigned to the OIA-related tasks. These officials have been
         trained on the OIA by the OOIC.

      Weaknesses

       • The understanding of RTI among officials might be mainly limited to only Sections 7 and 9
         of the OIA, which require proactive disclosure of certain information.
       • Some agencies have a very limited number of qualified RTI officials.

           The Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance, B.E. 2546 (2003),
      requires all government agencies to set up a one-stop service center to facilitate people’s
      contact with the agencies.
           Section 30 states, “The Permanent Secretary of each Ministry, with support of all depart-
      ments in the Ministry which provide public service, shall establish a one-stop service center
      (OSSC) so as to facilitate people in complying with laws or other rules. The people shall ask
      for information, permission or approval in a matter under power and duty of all departments
      under the same Ministry by contacting officials at the OSSC.”
           Section 31 requires the public body to appoint information officers for the gathering and
      processing of the requests.

         “The OSSC under Section 30 shall have a coordinating officer for gathering the requests
         of people and then sending those requests to official of the government agency related
         therewith for further implementation. The OSSC shall provide people any form, informa-
         tion and documents related to authority and duty of all departments in the Ministry.
             There shall be duty of related departments to provide, in writing, details of documents
         and evidences required in applying permission or approval in any matter to the coordinat-
         ing officer of the OSSC. The coordinating officer shall inform people who come to the
         OSSC, at the first contact, to know about the requirements and follow up whether the
         requirements have been met, and shall also inform people about the consideration period.
              The request applied to the OSSC under section 30 shall be deemed to be applied
         to related government agency as prescribed by law or rule.”
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                           507




    As a consequence, the MoNRE established a Service Link Center (SLC) to function as its
one-stop service center on September 22, 2006. The Ministry has also appointed an Official
Information Committee to consider if any information can be disclosed or not under the OIA.

MoNRE’s SLC carries out the following functions:
 • Performs a public service by providing an SLC that integrates the various services of all the
   agencies under the Ministry
 • Discloses information as determined by the OIA 1997
 • Classifies documents to facilitate searching and provides information services to ministry
   officers and the general public
 • Takes responsibility for books and documents in the library of the Permanent Secretary
 • Performs other tasks as assigned

The operational requirements of the SLC include:
 • Establishing a center for public service
 • Developing an information service system and a complaints system
 • Developing a tracking system for information requests and complaints

The Structure of the Center is composed of:
 • Administration Office
   • General administration
   • Supplies
   • Planning and budget
 • Technical Office
   • Information service
   • Approval and permission service
   • Complaints handling
   • News and environmental warning center
 • Operations Office
   • Customer service
   • Operator
   • Coordination
   • Operational support

    MoNRE has 9 officials handling the SLC. Capacity building for the staff is held regularly,
and all of them have been trained on OIA implementation.
    Likewise, MoAC has assigned its Agricultural Information Division to serve as the Official
Information Center and provide a space in the Ministry’s library to provide the information that
state agencies are required to provide for people’s inspection proactively (Sections 7 and 9 of
the OIA). Only one librarian is assigned to be the Information Official and has received OIA
training from the OOIC.
508                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          One legal official at the Legal Division is responsible for coordinating with other agencies
      under MoAC to obtain information requested by citizens or other state agencies. Both the
      Agricultural Information Division and Legal Division are under the OPS.
          Other departments and agencies under MoAC have to set up their own information office
      or space to implement the OIA.38
          Both Ministries need more OIA training for their staff. They feel that their officials’ knowl-
      edge and understanding on the OIA should be strengthened and that training should be
      provided regularly. MoNRE also sees an insufficient number of personnel as a barrier to their
      effective OIA implementation.39


      5.3. PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEMS
      State agencies report their RTI performance or their OIA implementation to the OOIC annu-
      ally, using the OOIC-prepared template. The OOIC uses the information in these reports to
      adjust its strategy for the ensuing years.
           The OOIC reports to the OIC and the OPS on the performance of each subcommittee
      under the OIC. OOIC staff themselves are evaluated twice a year.
           In addition, the OOIC also reports its own performance to the Cabinet at least once a year.
      The Cabinet will consider the report and may have it disseminated to the wider public.40
           All government officials, including staff of MoNRE and MoAC, are evaluated by key perfor-
      mance indicators (KPIs) prepared by the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission
      (OPDC). During 2009–2011, OPDC included RTI in the KPI indicators. However, thereafter such
      indicators were removed as it was deemed that RTI indicators were already included in the
      good governance indicators of the KPI.41


      5.4. RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
      MoNRE’s procedure for handling information requests is shown in the self-explanatory
      diagram on the following page (figure 6).
           Information can be requested from MoNRE in one of the three following ways: by visiting
      the Information Center (located in the library), phoning or writing. In 2013, there were 351 visi-
      tors to the Information Center and 2,417 requests via phone calls. No request was made
      for information under OIA Section 11 (information other than that required to be disclosed
      proactively under Sections 7 and 9). During the year, MoNRE refused two requests for infor-
      mation under Section 15 (exemption), which allows officials to use their judgment to disclose
      information.42
           Some people approach specific departments directly, instead of going to the Ministry’s
      Information Center, to obtain the information they want. The Department of Environmental
      Quality Promotion (DEQP) also has an Information Center located in its library. In 2012, this
      Information Center received 8 requests from visitors and 293 requests by telephone.43 The
      DEQP Secretary, who also is a member of DEQP Information Committee, said: “It is a man-
      date of the Department to disseminate information about the environment. Thus we readily
      provide information when asked.” She added that “the Department’s Information Committee
      has not held any meetings during the past two years as there was no dilemma about providing
      information.”44
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                             509




FIGURE 6. MoNRE’s Official Information Request Procedure




Source: Translated from http://slc.mnre.go.th/main.php?filename=data_service




     The Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP), another
agency under MoNRE, also provides three similar ways to DEQP for people to request
information. During FY 2011, ONEP Information Center received 2,771 requests from visitors,
172 requests via phone calls and 9 requests in writing.45
     Among the complaints MoNRE received during FYs 2010-2013, very few were about ‘giving
information/asking for information’. Specifically, only 4 out of a total of 581 complaints in 2010
were about this, 6 out of 1,060 in 2011, 7 out of 1,153 in 2012 and 11 out of 672 in 2013. That is
an average of only 0.8 percent.
     This could be interpreted to indicate that citizens are more or less satisfied with MoNRE’s
performance as regards providing information. However, one needs to realize that these statis-
tics are based on electronic petitions only. Thai people do not have equal access to electronic
communication. Urbanites have easier access than rural communities.
     MoAC presents a different picture. An individual can make a request to MoAC’s Informa-
tion Center, which in return will help the requester by coordinating with the department from
which the information is being requested. The Ministry has a request form for a requester to fill
in, but it is not downloadable from the website.
     Based on the 2013 Annual Report on OIA Implementation, which MoAC submitted to the
OOIC, MoAC’s Information Center provided information services to 92 visitors and received
50 requests for information under OIA Section 11 (information other than that required to be
disclosed proactively under Sections 7 and 9). It also provided information to approximately
510                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      800 requesters via phone calls and 1,000 requesters via email. There were also roughly 64,000
      visitors to its website, www.moac.go.th.46
           However, based on an interview with the Head of Strategic Planning and Public Relations
      at the Agricultural Information Division,47 serving also as MoAC’s Information Center, there
      has been no request pertaining to information under the OIA since the establishment of its
      Information Center in 2004 and the request form has never been used. “Information under
      the OIA” was understood to be information under Section 9 of the Act, which is required by
      law to be made available for the public’s inspection. Among the information in this category
      is information about procurement, bidding and tendering. MoAC posts this information on its
      website for open access.48

      5.5. RECORDS MANAGEMENT49
      Strengths

       • There is a law on records management for all state agencies to follow.
       • A Cabinet Resolution requires each agency to submit its record of OIA implementation to
         the oversight agency at least once a year.
       • Some agencies are beginning to keep digital records of their data.

      Weakness

       • In reality, agencies often have problems locating or retrieving the information.

           When asked about records management, officials replied that all the documentation is
      managed according to the Permanent Secretary’s Office Regulation on Administrative Work,
      B.E. 2526 (1983).
           As regards information that is under OIA Section 7 (information required to be published
      in the Royal Gazette) and Section 9 (information to be made available for public inspection),
      all agencies under each Ministry send this information to the respective Ministry’s Information
      Center to compile and make available to the public. At the same time, the information is also
      available at the respective departments; people can and often do request information directly
      from the departments which possess the information.
           At the MoAC’s Information Center located in the Ministry’s library, the information under
      Sections 7 and 9 of the OIA are classified by the Section that the information falls under and by
      the clause of that Section, e.g. Section 7 (1), Section 7 (2), etc.50
           The OPSs and each department under MoNRE and MoAC keep a record of their OIA
      implementation, i.e., the number of requests received, the means by which requests were
      made, the information requested, etc., by filling in the report template that the OOIC has
      prepared for them, and individually submit the data annually to the OPS of the Prime Minister’s
      Office. This annual submission is required by the Cabinet’s Resolution dated January 21, 2003.
      Neither Ministry collects the reports prepared by departments. It is the OOIC which collects
      all these reports, but the OOIC does not analyze or reorganize the information to provide
      useful statistics.
           MoNRE, however, submits its OIA implementation reports to the OPS of the Prime Minis-
      ter’s Office, which the OOIC is under, on a quarterly basis.51 Likewise, ONEP keeps a quarterly
      record of its OIA implementation.52
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                             511




5.6. BUDGET
Strength

 • Although there is no budget line for RTI, MoNRE provides training on the OIA to officials
   and the general public.

Weakness

 • Neither MoNRE nor MoAC has a budget line for RTI activities.

     Although MoNRE’s and MoAC’s RTI performances are rather different, they do have one
thing in common. Neither of them has a budget line for RTI or OIA implementation.
     According to Dr. Wijarn Simachaya, a Deputy Permanent Secretary of MoNRE, the Min-
istry has no budget line for implementing OIA or promoting RTI. But there is a budget for
training officials to improve their capacity. This includes training for the staff working on OIA
implementation.53
     The money actually spent on RTI promotion is very small, as training is the only RTI activity
that the Ministry undertakes. MoNRE’s overall budget for FY 2013 totaled 33.3 billion Baht,
while the OPS’s budget was 1.3 billion Baht. The 2013 training on OIA for MoNRE’s personnel
cost the Ministry only 46,050 baht or 0.0034 percent of the OPS’s budget.54
     Indeed, MoNRE did cite the lack of budget as a barrier to implementation of the OIA in an
annual report it submitted to the OOIC.55
     MoAC’s 4-year Operational Plan for FYs 2012–2015 allocates the Ministry’s budget as fol-
lows: 191.60 million Baht for personnel development, 112.80 million Baht for dissemination and
agricultural public relations and 160 million Baht for information technology and communica-
tion development.56


5.7. TRAINING AND PUBLIC OUTREACH
Strengths

 • The OOIC provides regular training for state agency officials.
 • All of MoNRE’s SLC staff have undergone the OIA training.
 • In MoAC, the staff assigned to handle OIA-related matters has also received the
   OIA-training.
 • The OOIC also provides training and speakers for public seminars on the OIA.
 • All the agencies covered in this study disseminate their materials to the general public
   both online and in paper form.

Weaknesses

 • The disseminated materials are about natural resources and the environment (in the case
   of MoNRE) and agriculture and related matters such as the water situation (in the case of
   MoAC), but not about people’s RTI.
 • MoAC has only one staff member assigned to handle OIA-related matters.
512                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           To date, RTI capacity building in government agencies in Thailand is undertaken in two
      forms—providing training and producing manuals.
           The Cabinet Resolution of January 24, 2012 orders all Ministries, departments, provinces
      and local administrations to prepare training curricula on the OIA or to integrate the OIA-
      related issues into the existing training curricula on a continuous basis.
           In reality, the OOIC, the oversight agency, takes responsibility for providing RTI or OIA
      training to government officials, and to a lesser extent, to the general public. The OOIC
      conducts four training sessions for state agency officials each year. Information Officials at all
      agencies are supposed to receive training from the OOIC.
           Some agencies, e.g. MoNRE, also conduct training on OIA for their staff and the gen-
      eral public. MoNRE invited OOIC officials to speak to the 62 trainees at its workshop held in
      July 2013.57 The Ministry also hosted training for interested people in February 2013.58
           During FY 2012, ONEP held a workshop on “The implementation of OIA 1997” to increase
      the capacity of its officials and staff, with 88 participants. ONEP also held a session on “Dis-
      semination of public information pertaining to the environment and health” within each of its
      four meetings on “Environmental Impact Assessment: Information for the People.” The events
      were attended by a total of 552 persons.59
           With regard to manuals, in 2005, the OOIC published a Manual for Officials’ Implementa-
      tion of the OIA, both in printed and digital forms, and this is downloadable from the OOIC
      website. (http://www.oic.go.th/handbook_officer.pdf). MoNRE has also produced an opera-
      tions manual for officials of the Service Link Center, which can be downloaded from the Cen-
      ter’s website. (http://slc.mnre.go.th/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=60&filename=data_service)
           Naturally, one is eager to learn of the outcome of these capacity building efforts or even
      the quality of the training courses and manuals. Unfortunately, no record of an assessment or
      evaluation of these activities exists. This is one of the improvements that the OOIC, MoNRE,
      ONEP and any other agencies conducting capacity building activities should pursue.




      6. Capacity and Influence of Civil Society
      6.1. INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT/DEMAND FOR RTI
      Strength

       • Most people are aware that the OIA exists and that they can request official information.

      Weakness

       • Not many citizens have exercised their RTI.

          A survey conducted by the OOIC in 2010 yielded hopeful results. Five thousand copies
      of the questionnaires were circulated to state agencies nationwide for the general public to
      answer. The OOIC received back 2,627 copies, constituting a good response of 52.54 percent.
      While 68.4 percent of all the respondents replied that they had never requested official infor-
      mation, 64.5 percent were aware of the Official Information Act. A high percentage (82.8%) said
      they would exercise their right to request information.

6.2. CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS
Strengths

 • Capable CSOs are a main driver for promoting RTI and empowering local communities.
 • Cooperation between CSOs and state actors has led to the development of a successful
   model.

Weakness

 • Some advocacy CSOs rely on funding support from outside Thailand.

     Each of the three CSOs interviewed for this study has the capacity to implement the OIA.
Although OIA is not their target area of work, they use the OIA to obtain official information
for their litigation. All of them provide training to local communities on environmental issues
and civic rights, including access to information, participation and access to justice, etc. They
partner with other CSOs to build a powerful network to advocate for certain causes and have
influenced implementation of the OIA.
     This study interviewed the heads of three CSOs, ENLAWThai Foundation (ENLAW), Stop-
Global Warming Association Thailand (ThaiSGWA) and the Sustainable Development Founda-
tion (SDF).
     Both ENLAW and ThaiSGWA provide pro bono legal assistance to local communities and
the marginalized sector, particularly on disputes related to natural resources and the environ-
ment. They defend the impacted people and file lawsuits on behalf of the villagers against com-
panies whose activities damage the environment and/or the communities. Several of their cases
have involved bringing state agencies to the Administrative Court. In 2012, ThaiSGWA was
named the Human Rights Organization of 2012 by the National Commission on Human Rights
for the over 3,000 legal cases it had undertaken to defend the rights of local communities.
     While their work involves making requests for official information, their primary focus is
neither on RTI nor on corruption. Indeed, they are beneficiaries of the OIA and their requests
have increased transparency in the issues that they investigate. Their objectives are to bring
justice to the impacted communities. In the process of seeking justice, they seek information
from state agencies by implementing either the OIA or the Constitution (Section 57).
514                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




            Because they are often opponents of government agencies in court, neither EnLaw nor
      ThaiSGWA takes financial support from the state so as to remain independent and avoid a con-
      flict of interest. EnLaw is supported by international donors and direct donations via its website,
      while ThaiSGWA does not receive any support from donors. ThaiSGWA receives a small amount
      of money offered to them by the villagers for whom they provide legal assistance as a token of
      appreciation. They are supported by other sources of income, e.g., payments for research.
            The SDF is a little different. It does not conduct litigation, but is a development and
      natural resources and environment (NRE)-focused CSO. It is a partner of the Access Initiative60
      coalition in Thailand, which advocates democratic environmental governance. It works with
      grassroots communities to strengthen and empower them on issues ranging from livelihood
      improvement to the impacts of government policies on the local communities. Although RTI
      is not its focus, the SDF supports access principles to empower the communities. The SDF
      receives funds mainly from international donors, especially the EU and UNDP. It also receives
      funds indirectly from the government as an NGO member of the Environmental NGO Assem-
      bly, to which MoNRE’s DEQP provides development funds. In an interview, the SDF’s Executive
      Director made it clear that the Foundation’s decisions are independent from their donors.
            The SDF, EnLaw and ThaiSGWA provide training to communities, but do not necessarily
      focus only on RTI. The training is often on the environment, legal rights, environmental gover-
      nance and certain techniques such as environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmen-
      tal and health impact assessment (EHIA). In fact, the training they provide is geared towards
      responding to the communities’ needs in certain contexts.
            Each of the three CSOs networks with other organizations in Thailand, such as with the
      Thailand Council of Lawyers, academics, other CSOs, community-based organizations, wom-
      en’s groups and local communities. The SDF and ENLAW also cooperate with CSOs in other
      countries. For example, ENLAW partners with Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW)
      to seek technical information on the impacts of lead contamination and how to clean up the
      contaminated Klity Creek area, severely impacted by lead mining.61
            SDF and ENLAW were among the 36 organizations collaborating with the Thailand Envi-
      ronment Institute in 2008 in their efforts to implement Article 9(8) of the OIA, making NRE
      and health-related information ‘public information’. They prepared a list indicating the types
      of environmental and health information that government agencies should proactively make
      available to people and submitted a letter to the OIC, with a recommended list attached. Two
      years later, the OIC announced on June 7, 2010, that information on the environment and
      health must be available for people to inspect as stipulated in Section 9(8) of Thailand’s Official
      Information Act B.E. 2540 (1997).
            The CSOs have clearly played a key role in influencing implementation of the OIA. It is
      worth noting that this success was based on strong cooperation between the CSOs and the
      state sector. Had it not been for the advice and cooperation of the Official Information Com-
      missioner and the OOIC, this particular success might have not been achieved.

      6.3. MEDIA
      Strength

       • To a certain extent, the OIA enables the media to have access to official information and
         investigate corruption and wrongdoing within the state apparatus.
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                            515




Weaknesses

 • It takes a long time (months) to receive any response after a request is made.
 • In most cases, the requesters have to appeal.
 • The appeal process takes a long time and does not necessarily yield the expected result,
   i.e., the requester may still not get all the information requested.
 • The reporters do not think it is worth spending more time appealing to the Administrative
   Court. This is because a news report has to be timely.

     Three years after the promulgation of the OIA in 1997, Mr. Kavi Chongkittavorn, a senior
reporter of the Nation newspaper, wrote about the public’s and the media’s enthusiasm
for this law. He commented that the Act enabled reporters find out information and write
investigative stories.62
     However, in recent years, Thailand has seen the proliferation of new media—cable and
satellite television, internet-based television, digital radio and online newspapers, as they are
cheaper to operate and freer to present alternative views than the traditional media. They
have been able to increasingly draw audiences away from the traditional media, especially
from a handful of terrestrial television stations known in Thailand as ‘free TV’, and as such
attract more and more commercials. This makes it difficult for the traditional media to remain
in business unless they adapt to the new challenging and competitive environment. Most of
them chose to cut their costs, with the result that they can afford fewer qualified journalists
than in the past.63
     Most media in Thailand are privately owned. There is no monopoly of media ownership,
but the government has a strong voice among terrestrial television stations, the survival of
which depends on commercials. The National Broadcasting Service of Thailand (NBT), in par-
ticular, echoes the government’s voice.
     This study interviewed two media advocates of RTI: Mr. Prasong Leartratanavisut, Execu-
tive Director of ISRA Institute Thai Press Development Foundation (ISRA Foundation), and
Mr. Bunnaroth Buakli, senior reporter of ASTV Manager Newspaper. Mr. Prasong has been a
long-time champion of RTI, well before he took up his present position at the ISRA Founda-
tion. ASTV Manager Newspaper, manager.co.th, is the most popular non-tabloid news portal
(as of 28 March 2010).64 The two men are among the few widely known reporters who continue
to implement the OIA today.
     The ISRA Foundation cited the OIA when making a request to the Budget Bureau for the
names of the companies which were commissioned for the 154 projects under the 120 billion
Baht Integrated Flood Redress, Rehabilitation and Prevention Project,65 because such infor-
mation was not available on the Bureau’s website. The information should be made available
to the public proactively according to Section 7 of the OIA. About one month later, the ISRA
Foundation received a reply from the Director of the Budget Bureau that this project was
making use of the central budget and that the agencies and state enterprises requesting the
budget were responsible for selecting the companies. As such, the ISRA Foundation should
request the information from these agencies, not from the Budget Bureau.66
     One of Mr. Prasong’s most recent uses of the OIA is the government’s controversial rice
pledging scheme. He did not receive all the information requested. This case is discussed in
Annex 3.
516                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          In September 2012, the Chairman of the House of Representatives, who also is the Parlia-
      ment’s Chairman, took a few reporters to the UK for a field trip and to watch a football match.
      This trip became the talk of the town, and Mr. Bunnaroth used the OIA to request information
      about the trip from the Parliament. By January, he had not yet received any response.
      Mr. Bunnaroth then appealed to the OIC and, consequently, in April, he received a part of the
      information he had requested. Mr. Bunnaroth made another appeal to the OIC and is still wait-
      ing to hear the result. The not-yet-completed process has taken more than a year now.67
          The media use the OIA to unveil corruption and wrongdoing within the government. By
      reporting to people the information that they uncover, they have taken up the role of a ‘watch-
      dog’ and provided a check and balance mechanism. In a nutshell, the reporters use the OIA to
      report their stories so as to empower the people. This is clear in Mr. Bunnaroth’s own words:

         “…I see the importance of the Official Information Act, to be a tool for people to exercise
         their right. Not only is it democratic, international communities recognize this right [to
         information] as fundamental to a democratic society…Those who think about reforming
         Thailand want to reform only the upper structure – increasing politicians’ power, increasing
         the power of the wealthy, removing the monitoring power of independent organizations,
         destroying those who are not members of their own political network …You think Thailand
         will become a true democracy? No way. Because the heart of a democratic reform is to
         increase people’s power in the lower structure.”68

      6.4. PRIVATE SECTOR
      Strength

       • The private sector is aware of the OIA.

      Weaknesses

       • Private companies do not use the OIA to get information but to deny other companies
         access to their company’s information.
       • The private sector association does not give the OIA much weight.

           There are several business associations in Thailand. The three main associations, whose
      members sit on several state committees, are the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI), the Thai
      Chamber of Commerce (TCC) and the Thai Bankers’ Association (TBA). Spearheaded by the
      now deceased Dusit Nontanakorn, former President of the TCC, the private sector established
      the Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand (ACT) in 2011. The ACT, with around twenty part-
      ner organizations from various sectors, has launched a series of anti-graft campaigns.
           According to the Director of FTI’s Legal Affairs, Secretary-General of the TBA and Director
      of ACT, while the associations are aware of the OIA, they have never used the law and do not
      see it being directly related to their work.
           The FTI occasionally requests information, e.g., technical documentation and draft Ministe-
      rial regulations, etc., from state agencies, sometimes by using personal contacts and at other
      times by sending a formal letter. The FTI has received the information requested and therefore
      sees no need to use the OIA. The only exception is the Ministry of Finance, from which the FTI
      did not receive the draft Bill on tax management that it had requested. However, Mrs. Jongrak
      Chaisri, Director of FTI’s Legal Affairs, said she has not studied the OIA thoroughly to judge if
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                             517




the OIA could help her get the information. She added that the FTI encourages the state to
disseminate information widely, consult with several sectors and hold hearings before enforc-
ing any new laws.69
     In a similar fashion, Dr Twatchai Yongkittikul, Secretary-General of TBA, said the TBA has
never used the OIA and was skeptical if using the Act could help get any official information,
citing the government’s rice pledging scheme as an example.70 While ACT is an anti-graft
organization, Dr Mana Nimitmongkol, its Director, said the organization had never used
the OIA.71 The private sector has not lobbied for legislative changes that would impact the
public’s ability to obtain information through the OIA.72
     Private companies do not use the OIA to request official information either. But some
companies use the OIA to deny other parties access to their company’s information. The case
described below exemplifies this point.
     In September 2012, the Central Administrative Court ruled in favor of a grassroots group
in a historic move that could set a precedent for people’s access to business information. The
Court ruled that a power plant developer must disclose its electricity purchase agreement to
the group, which represents a community affected by one of the company’s plants.
     Gulf JP UT Co filed a complaint with the Central Administrative Court in 2009, asking the
Court to nullify the decision made by the OIC and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thai-
land (EGAT), ordering the company to reveal the contents of the power purchase agreement it
made with EGAT. The OIC and EGAT made their resolution after the People’s Network against
Power Plant Projects petitioned EGAT to reveal the power deal signed with the company,
which is a developer of a 1,600-megawatt natural gas-fuelled power plant in Bang Khla district
of Chachoengsao province in Central Thailand.
     In September 2012, the Central Administrative Court dismissed the company’s complaint,
saying the 1997 Official Information Act guarantees the people’s right of access to state
information unless such disclosures will cause explicit damages to parties. In this case, the
Court ruled that the disclosure of the power purchase agreement would not cause business
damage to the company. The Court said the residents’ request is due to their worries about
the project’s negative impacts on their livelihood and their wish to monitor state projects, and
is not motivated by business concerns. The OIC and EGAT’s resolution on the disclosure of
the power purchase agreement is in line with the official information law and does not violate
confidential business information law.73


7. Broader Political Environment
7.1. POLITICAL WILL
Every law has an intention behind it. For the RTI law, it is based on the recognition of the civic
right to know and to participate. As mentioned in Chapter 1, this recognition stemmed from
the political disarray in the early 1990s, when people saw that they were being deceived by
distorted information from the state and called for reform, leading to the eventual change in
political leadership in 1992. In the Remarks at the end of The Official Information Act, 1997, the
intention of having the Act was given:

   “The reason for promulgating this Act is that in a democratic system, to give people a
   wide opportunity to receive information pertaining to the state’s proceedings is essential.
518                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




         This is so that the people will be able to express their opinion and exercise their political
         right correctly and in accordance with truth, which in return will promote having a govern-
         ment by the people…”

           Indeed, the RTI law stands between the people and the state and manifests the state-
      people relationship. In Thailand, where civil servants are directly under the politicians, with no
      state workers union to help leverage the voice of officials, they are more or less at the mercy
      of the respective Ministers. The degree to which the OIA will be supported and implemented
      is therefore dependent on the willpower of those in the Cabinet, the Prime Minister and the
      ruling political party.
           The current government has not expressed support for the OIA. This is evidenced by
      the case of the government’s rice pledging scheme, when the Ministry of Commerce did not
      release information about it to the public even when the OIA was used and an appeal was
      made to the Information Disclosure Tribunal (see Section 3.3 Functioning of Appeals/Courts.)
      Indeed, a study on Thailand’s RTI cites the unwillingness of state agencies to provide informa-
      tion as a key barrier to the effectiveness of the Act.74

      7.2. OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP
      Whilst eligible to participate in the US-launched Open Government Partnership program, no
      Thai state agency participates in the program.
         The Thai government has, however, participated in a number of international declarations,
      conventions and treaties that promote access to information, procedural rights, social justice
      and human rights. During the past two years in office, the government has made the following
      commitments:
       • The International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced
         Disappearance, on January 9, 2012.
       • The UN’s “Every Woman Every Child” Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health
         on March 25, 2012.
       • Party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communi-
         cations procedure on September 25, 2012.
       • ASEAN Human Rights Declaration on November 18, 2012.

          Thailand is currently a party to 7 core treaties, namely: (1) International Covenant on Civil
      and Political Rights (ICCPR); (2) International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
      (ICESCR); (3) Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
      (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol; (4) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its two
      Optional Protocols on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and on
      the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict; (5) International Convention on the Elimination
      of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); (6) Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
      Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT); and (7) Convention on the Rights of
      Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Should Thailand ratify the Convention on the Protection of All
      Persons from Enforced Disappearance, this will be the eighth core international human rights
      treaty to which Thailand is a party. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
      of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (CMW) is the ninth and the only remain-
      ing instrument to which Thailand is not yet a signatory or party.
A CASE STUDY OF THAILAND                                                                                519




   Thailand is also a party to the UN Convention against Corruption.
   It must be noted that if these protocols have no sanctions or monitoring mechanisms, it
cannot be assumed that the signing of these documentations implies the government’s open-
ness or commitment to openness.



8. Conclusion and Recommendations
8.1. SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS/MESSAGES
One can conclude from this study that Thailand’s RTI law, i.e., the Official Information Act,
1997, is received differently by different sectors. State agencies are required to comply with
the OIA and other related regulations. Thus, they have appointed an Information Committee
and set up or assigned a space in their libraries to be the ‘Official Information Center.’ The
OIA does not give clear guidelines as to what information should be disclosed or withheld, but
leaves it to officials’ judgment. However, officials are reluctant to provide requested informa-
tion as the OIA does not have a provision to protect them.
    The private sector has not used the OIA to obtain information because companies have
no difficulty accessing the information they want. Their personal contact with the agencies
allows them to avoid the time-consuming formal request process. CSOs and the media are the
sectors which have made the best use of the Act. However, its use among the media has been
declining as it takes a long time to obtain information, while their reports often need to be
completed quickly. And in some cases, the requested information never arrived.
    The Royal Decree on Criteria and Procedures for Good Governance, B.E.2546 (2003) and
the Cabinet’s Resolution of January 24, 2012 require officials to either disclose the requested
information as soon as possible and within 15 days after receiving the request or inform the
requester within 15 days of the date they can have the requested information if it will take
more than 15 days. Despite these ‘laws’, it actually takes at least a month to get any response
from the officials after a request is made. In several cases, it took several months.

8.2. ISSUES GOING FORWARD
Some barriers to the effective implementation of this Act have to do with the law itself.
However, the previous attempts to amend the Act, even when initiated by Official Information
Commissioners, were less than successful. Another barrier has to do with the political will. This
depends on the true commitment of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to transparency and
accountability.
     Other factors involve Thailand’s political culture, in particular the state’s culture of secrecy
and the patronage system, i.e., the patron-client relationship that is deeply rooted in Thai cul-
ture, which makes the state reluctant to draft a Bill to support full openness of official informa-
tion. It also allows certain sectors of people to have easier access to information than others.
     A key question at the present time is whether desirable changes are likely to occur. Thai-
land is witnessing a large-scale confrontation between two political factions. One faction is
calling for national reforms. One of the proposed reform areas is the elimination of corruption.
If this reform were to materialize, it may have significant and desirable impacts on the OIA.

Annex 1. Methodology

This study undertook desk research, including a review of various legislation—the Constitution
of Thailand (1997, 2007), laws, Ministerial regulations, royal decrees, and regulations—as well
as websites and RTI-related studies. It also applied the World Bank PAM indicators and con-
ducted interviews.
     The interviews were conducted with a Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Natu-
ral Resources and Environment (MoNRE); the Official Information Commissioner; the Direc-
tor and an official of the Office of the Official Information Commission (OOIC); Chief officials
overseeing the Information Centers of MoNRE and the Ministry of Agriculture and Coopera-
tives and their Information Officials; 4 media representatives (ISRA Foundation, ASTV Manager
Newspaper and Thai PBS Television); 3 CSOs (EnLaw, Siam Stop Global Warming Associa-
tion, and Sustainable Development Foundation); executives from the three top private sector
associations in Thailand; two Senior Judges of the Administrative Courts; and the Executive
Director of the Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand.

Annex 3. The Government’s
Rice Pledging Scheme

Ironically, the harm test and public interest test may not necessarily be in the best interest of
the public. This is the case for the national rice pledging scheme that the Thai government has
been carrying out.
     After becoming Prime Minister in 2011, Ms. Yingluck Shinnawatra continued the scheme
that her brother, the self-exiled fugitive and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinnawatra, started
when he was in office. Under this scheme, farmers could pledge their rice with the government
at a price that was 30–50 percent higher than the market price. Not surprisingly, farmers readily
embraced the scheme. No farmers returned the money to the government to reclaim their
rice. The government de facto bought the rice from the farmers at an unreasonably high price,
thus bypassing the existing private trading system.
     Unsurprisingly, this scheme was highly criticized by all, including retired officials of the Min-
istry of Commerce, the agency overseeing international trade, rice economists, and the former
Minister of Finance. Their criticisms were along the same lines. The scheme was clearly going
to have serious business implications because it was not possible to sell rice at a price higher
than what the government had paid the farmers, which was much higher than market price.
According to the government, it would stockpile rice until its price in the world market rose,
and then it would sell the rice. This was how Thailand would make a profit.
     The counter-argument was that, similar to other produce, rice is a perishable commod-
ity. Stockpiling rice for a long time could only reduce its fragrance, cause the rice to become
rotten, and depreciate its value. Moreover, although Thailand was the world’s number one
exporter of rice, its market share was not so substantive that stockpiling instead of selling its
rice would impact the market price.
     Thai people were concerned that this populist scheme would eventually incur monumental
public debt and bring the nation’s rice economy into chaos. But the government assured the
public that they had successfully exported the rice, not through the normal trading channels,
but through innovative government-to-government (G-to-G) agreements.
     The case caught the public’s attention and the ISRA Institute Thai Press Development
Foundation found that the information released by government agencies to the public lacked
clarity. This caused confusion among the public, and the ISRA Foundation made use of the
OIA to submit a request to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce in 2012 for
information on the amount of rice stored in the government warehouses, the amount sold and
other rice export-related information during FY 2011/2012.
     Later, the ISRA Foundation received information from the Department of Foreign Trade on
the amount of rice sold domestically, but not the amount exported or the names of the ware-
houses and rice millers at which the pledged rice was stocked. The justification for withholding
the rest of the requested information was to protect the nation’s rice trading security and rela-
tions between Thailand and the trading partner countries.

          The ISRA Foundation submitted an appeal to an Information Disclosure Tribunal. The Tri-
      bunal ruled in support of the Department’s non-disclosure, citing the reasoning of the Depart-
      ment of Foreign Trade that the requested information was with another agency and that the
      Department had no authority to obtain the information from that agency.
          The ISRA Foundation did not bring the case to the Administrative Court as it would be
      time-consuming. However, on September 30, 2013, it submitted another request for informa-
      tion relating to the scheme. One month passed by without any response, and so the Founda-
      tion filed another complaint.75
          The fact that the information on the rice pledging scheme was not disclosed to the public
      when requested in 2011 has indeed gravely harmed the people and undermined Thailand’s
      public governance. As it turned out, by February 2014, Ms. Yingluck’s caretaker government
      could not pay the more than 100 billion Baht to the vast number of rice farmers who were
      participating in the scheme nationwide. By this time, eleven farmers had hanged themselves
      as they did not have the money to bail themselves out of their overwhelming debts due to
      the delayed payments. Angry farmers from several provinces have held rallies in Bangkok to
      demand that the government pay them the overdue money.76
          In the meantime, the National Anti-Corruption Commission investigated the scheme and
      could not find evidence of the existence of any of the six G-to-G rice trade contracts the gov-
      ernment had earlier announced. The Commission then charged the Minister of Commerce and
      a few officials with corrupt practices. On February 18, 2014, the NACC summoned Ms. Yingluck
      to appear before them regarding the charges against her for neglect of duty. Ms. Yingluck had
      presided over the National Rice Policy Committee and had earlier received warnings from the
      Commission that the rice scheme was fostering corruption and causing financial losses. But she
      ignored the warnings and failed to take any action to prevent or stop it.77

                                          A Case Study of
                                        the United States

1. Introduction and Findings
1.1. INTRODUCTION
The 4th of July in the United States is synonymous with freedom: freedom from taxation
without representation; freedom from British rule; and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
On July 4, 1966, the FOIA became the world’s third right to know law. Fittingly, the FOIA is an
example of the benefits and limitations of the new system of checks and balances built into
the form of government the US created: Congress imposed the law on the Executive branch—
while exempting itself from the law’s mandates—and it is left to the Judicial branch to enforce
the law. As a result, the FOIA has needed the help of the press, civil society and savvy politi-
cians to survive overwhelming agency opposition, reticent Presidents, and ongoing implemen-
tation challenges.
    This case study explores the battles for the FOIA’s passage and subsequent amendments
as well as the challenges for effective implementation of the Act. The case study is divided
into eight sections. Section 1 includes this introduction and the key findings of the study. The
findings briefly discuss the major drivers of success and challenges in federal agencies’ imple-
mentation of the FOIA. Section 2 examines the legislative history of the FOIA, from the over-
whelming Congressional support for its initial enactment to the creation of an oft-requested
FOIA Ombudsman in 2007. Section 3 explores the FOIA’s scope and discusses the content of
the Act including provisions regarding fees, deadlines and exemptions. It also introduces the
agencies charged with FOIA oversight: The Office of Information Policy (OIP) and The Office of
Government Oversight (OGIS).
    Section 4 examines compliance with the FOIA across the federal government. Agencies’
use of exemptions, response rates and application of the harm test are examined. Section 4
also describes both the legal requirements and agencies’ progress on guaranteeing access to
individuals who require accommodations in order to use the FOIA. It further examines the gov-
ernment’s proactive disclosure and open data policy. Finally, it reviews FOIA appeals, sanctions

      and litigation. These subsections discuss the protocol for filing and processing an appeal and
      the FOIA’s sanctions provision and its lack of use. The last subsection looks at FOIA litigation,
      one of the most important tools that requesters have to ensure compliance with the Act.
          Section 5 analyzes agency level practices and compliance with the FOIA. It begins by
      discussing leadership, specifically three non-legislative instruments that can have a significant
      effect on FOIA implementation: Executive Orders, Presidential Memoranda and Attorney
      General Guidelines. Section 5 continues by detailing government-wide FOIA staffing, pro-
      motion and public awareness efforts. Four agencies are examined to provide examples of
      these efforts: the Department of Justice (DOJ), National Archives and Records Administration
      (NARA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and United States Department of Agriculture
      (USDA). These agencies’ response rates are presented in chart form. Section 5 also delves into
      records management in the federal government and explains how outdated regulations and
      record keeping practices frustrate timely disclosure of records. It ends by describing agencies’
      budgeting process for the FOIA and the benefits and detriments to their approach.
          Section 6 explores the role politics plays in the FOIA, specifically how the FOIA has been
      both a tool for partisan efforts and a legislative topic where politics are set aside. This case
      study ends with Section 7’s analysis of certain stakeholders’ influence on FOIA implementation
      in the United States. This includes civil society organizations that do everything from auditing
      government performance to suggesting legislative language. The analysis also extends to the
      media. While they do not use the FOIA as often as many assume, the press are the original
      FOIA agitators and continually use the Act to inform their reporting and to explore or expose
      government actions. Three media organizations are briefly examined to illustrate the press’s
      role in strengthening the FOIA and the public’s right to information. While they are not part
      of civil society, the private sector’s use of FOIA is also examined. Section 8 features the case
      study’s conclusion.
          These eight sections ultimately reveal that the FOIA, and its subsequent amendments,
      are instrumental in realizing the right to information. The public recognizes this. In 2012, use
      of the FOIA hit an all-time high with agencies receiving 651,254 requests.1 Clearly, the public,
      businesses and the press are aware of their right to information under the FOIA. Government
      disclosure has improved over the nearly half century that the FOIA has been in effect. In par-
      ticular, proactive disclosure has markedly increased with the rise of the internet. Websites like
      Data.gov and USAspending.gov put some information right at the public’s fingertips. None-
      theless, the execution of the right to information is marred by implementation challenges
      including slow processing, overuse of exemptions, a relatively weak ombudsman, limited
      resources and an ingrained bureaucratic tendency toward secrecy.

      1.2. FINDINGS
      There are several key drivers of both success and challenges in federal agencies’ implementa-
      tion of the FOIA.

      Factors That Drive FOIA’s Success:

       • The FOIA is fairly comprehensive and broad in scope;
       • The FOIA is fairly easy to access and does not require individuals to justify their reasons for
         making a request;
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                     547




 • There are mechanisms in place to hold agencies accountable for failing to comply fully with
   the FOIA including tracking for individual requests and required Annual and Chief FOIA
   Officer reports;
 • Litigation has clarified the FOIA’s provisions and provided requesters with including disclo-
   sure of records and awards of attorneys’ fees;
 • Civil society organizations, the media and Congress persistently advocate for better
   agency implementation of the FOIA and an improved FOIA;
 • Agencies use social media, blogs and websites in public awareness campaigns; and
 • The FOIA is used quite frequently.

Factors That Drive Challenges with Implementing the FOIA:

 • Agency processing of FOIA requests is marred by delays;
 • Agencies overuse exemptions, particularly exemptions three and five;
 • OGIS is a relatively weak ombudsman;
 • FOIA is not considered a high priority in comparison to other legislation;
 • Resources for FOIA are limited;
 • An ingrained bureaucratic tendency toward protecting agency information persists;
 • The current contentious political climate frustrates efforts to improve the FOIA;
 • The DOJ has competing roles regarding the FOIA because it serves as the FOIA oversight
   institution as well as a FOIA litigator and a FOIA processor;
 • Agencies face serious records management challenges;
 • Sanctions are rarely applied;
 • Litigation is costly and discourages requesters from enforcing their rights under the
   FOIA; and
 • No independent agency is in charge of overseeing FOIA implementation.




2. Passage of ATI Legislation
The United States’ Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) had an inauspicious beginning. In 1955,
Representative John Moss created a committee to advocate for the creation of right to infor-
mation legislation.2 In this pursuit, Moss brought together politicians, journalists, attorneys and
civil society organizations (CSOs). It took more than a decade of inquiries, testimony, hearings
and bargaining to pass the bill. Early FOIA supporters included the American Bar Association,
the United States Chamber of Commerce, various committees composed of journalists, editors
and broadcasters.3 The fruit of their labor was 1966’s FOIA. FOIA described what information
government agencies are required to make available to the public, namely: rules, opinions and
policy statements. It listed various exemptions to disclosure including: matters required to be
secret by Executive Order due to national defense or foreign policy concerns, internal person-
nel rules and practices, and trade secrets.4
548                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          The FOIA faced strong opposition from the Johnson administration and Executive branch
      agencies including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States’ legal and law
      enforcement department. FOIA opponents objected that the FOIA would unconstitutionally
      violate separation of powers, encroach on Executive power and eliminate agency discretion
      regarding document disclosure. However, bipartisan support of the bill was strong and these
      protestations did not impede the act’s adoption into law.
          The media and long suffering politicians who championed FOIA celebrated its passage.
      However, every federal agency opposed it.5 Indeed, so severe was then President Lyndon
      Johnson’s aversion to the FOIA, that he “had to be dragged kicking and screaming” to sign it.6
      This is significant because Johnson was a man who usually reveled in the pomp and circum-
      stance of the Office. For example, he enjoyed holding sentimental bill signing ceremonies.
      When Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, he did so sitting next to
      his childhood schoolteacher outside of his former elementary school in Johnson City, Texas.7
      By contrast, Johnson held no such celebration when he signed the FOIA, going so far as to
      scrawl “no ceremony” at the bottom of a memo that advocated for one.8
          Johnson also chose to attach a signing statement to the bill. A signing statement is a tool
      at Presidents’ disposal, which allows them to comment on, or even object to, the legislation
      they are signing. While Johnson did not explicitly object to the FOIA, his language diminished
      the legislation’s purpose. His emphasis on caution over disclosure was evident from the signing
      statement’s first substantive lines:

         “This legislation springs from one of our most essential principles: A democracy works
         best when the people have all the information that the security of the Nation permits. No
         one should be able to pull curtains of secrecy around decisions which can be revealed
         without injury to the public interest.” (emphasis added)9

          Johnson ended the signing statement on a more amiable note expressing profound pride
      that the United States was “an open society in which the people's right to know is cherished
      and guarded.”10
          At the heart of Johnson’s signing statement was an uneasy juxtaposition: a citizen’s right to
      information held by the government and the “necessary” restrictions on that right. This tension
      has endured through the FOIA’s many amendments and its shaping via numerous Executive
      Orders, Attorney General (AG) Guidelines and judicial decisions.
          The FOIA has been amended multiple times since its inception. Each alteration has
      reflected the societal and political climate at the time. This was especially evident the first time
      the Act was amended. In 1974, the United States was still reeling from the Watergate scandal,
      an event steeped in secrecy, obstruction and deception. Watergate began with a break-in of
      Democratic National Committee headquarters, transitioned into a massive cover-up and cul-
      minated in President Richard Nixon’s resignation. When Nixon’s Vice President, Gerald Ford,
      was sworn in as President on August 9, 1974, he promised honesty, openness and candor; he
      assured Americans that the national nightmare of Watergate, with its disturbing implications,
      was over.11
          Approximately one month into office, Ford promptly pardoned Nixon, granting him full
      and unconditional immunity from any illegal acts he may have committed during his presi-
      dency. Ford’s pardon of Nixon damaged his reputation and decimated his public approval
      rating.12 Congressional reactions were generally divided along political lines: most Republicans
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                     549




supported Ford’s decision and most Democrats derided it.13 In the midst of this anger, wariness
and partisanship, legislators worked on amending the FOIA.
     Beyond the scandal and the strained atmosphere, there was another problem: the FOIA
simply was not working. By 1974, even the DOJ admitted that agency compliance with FOIA
was lackluster.14 Top agency officials did not prioritize the FOIA.15 There were substantial delays
in processing requests and appeals.16 Moreover, the FOIA was costly for requesters: agen-
cies used fees as an “effective bureaucratic tool” to deny requesters information; one witness
described an $85,000 Department of Agriculture FOIA bill.17 Appeals could cost thousands
of dollars in legal fees.18 Congress hoped that addressing these deterrents would encourage
more members of the news media to use FOIA.19 While they were major supporters of the
concept, media use of the law was low.20
     Consequently, the amendments sought to strengthen the FOIA by clarifying certain provi-
sions. These provisions were reworked to improve administration and compliance, strengthen
the public’s remedies against agencies and officials who violate the FOIA, increase Congressio-
nal oversight and expedite handling of requests.21 For the first time, agencies were subjected
to administrative processing deadlines—10 days for requests and 20 for appeals.22 The bill
also established the award of attorneys’ fees for requesters who prevailed in Court, in camera
(private) inspection by judges of documents covered by certain exemptions and de novo (new)
judicial review of an agency’s decision to withhold information.23
     In many respects, the opposition to amending the FOIA was identical to the opposition
during its creation. The DOJ and President Ford were especially critical of the bill. The DOJ
objected to nearly every provision, calling the amendments “too inflexible” and denouncing
parts of the bill as raising “serious questions of constitutionality.”24
     Ford, a former attorney himself, was more precise in his objections. He expressed concern
for federal employees’ personal liability and the competence of the judiciary to review classi-
fied documents in camera; he indicated that the amendments would weaken the safeguarding
of military secrets, individual privacy and crime fighting.25 Despite these concerns, President
Ford promised to meet Congress “more than halfway” to reach a compromise so that the
amendments could move forward.26 Although Congress altered several provisions to placate
Ford before they passed the legislation, the President insisted that “significant problems”
remained unresolved.27 Ford vetoed the bill, acting on the urging of many federal agency
heads and advisors including former FOIA advocate Donald Rumsfeld, future Vice President
Dick Cheney and future Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.28
     After his veto, President Ford was excoriated in the Press. The Philadelphia Inquirer called
Ford’s concerns about constitutionality and national security logistically flimsy and “offensive
in their insensitivity to public dismay.”29 Ford’s veto of the amendments forced the bill back
to the legislature, where overriding the veto required two-thirds of both the House and the
Senate to vote in favor of the amendments. They did so and the FOIA was amended for the
first time. Public use of the FOIA increased markedly following these amendments, vindicating
its supporters.30
     Just two years later, the FOIA was amended again through the Government in Sunshine
Act. These amendments faced less opposition than their predecessors. The Government in
Sunshine Act made federal agency meetings open to the public, with a few exceptions. When
the Act passed, President Ford was happy to sign the legislation, remarking that the public had
the right to know what government does, why they do it and what processes they use.31

           The FOIA was not amended again until Ronald Reagan’s presidency and his infamous War
      on Drugs. This time, the FOIA changes were proposed via the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.
      On the surface, including the FOIA in a drug bill was an unusual way to make changes to the
      Act. The logic behind the move was law enforcement’s and Congress’s fears that organized
      crime syndicates and drug traffickers would use the FOIA to learn the identities of investigation
      targets and confidential informants.32 As a result, the 1986 amendments focused primarily on
      the law enforcement exemption (Exemption 7).
           The exemption was extended to permit law enforcement agencies, like the Federal Bureau
      of Investigation (FBI), to deny the existence of records related to “an ongoing and undisclosed
      criminal investigation; informant records maintained under an informant’s name or personal
      identifier; or classified records of the FBI pertaining to foreign intelligence, counterintelligence
      or international terrorism investigations, in response to a FOIA request.”33 These provisions are
      known as exclusions.
           In addition to expanding the law enforcement exemptions, legislators revised the FOIA’s
      fee provisions. Under the bill, every agency was required to create regulations specifying
      fee schedules and to establish guidelines for determining reduced and waived fees.34 These
      requirements were intended to encourage the liberal grant of waivers and to challenge the
      DOJ’s “unduly restrictive” waiver policy.35 In order to make it easier for noncommercial request-
      ers to obtain documents under FOIA, agencies were also directed to not charge requesters
      for the first two hours of search time and for the first 100 copies of a request.36 The Anti-Drug
      Abuse Act of 1986, including the changes to the FOIA, passed in both houses and was signed
      into law by President Reagan.
           A decade later, the rise of electronic media and resources was the impetus for the Elec-
      tronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (“E-FOIA”). Congress hoped that
      keeping abreast of technology would make the FOIA more efficient, accessible and uniform.37
      Delays were another target for this round of FOIA alterations. Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy
      dismissed the 10-day processing deadline as a “joke”; he argued that the routine failure to
      comply with the time limits bred public contempt and poor agency morale.38 This time, the
      Administration agreed that the FOIA needed work. Both President Bill Clinton and DOJ Attor-
      ney General Janet Reno acknowledged that the FOIA had delay problems and encouraged
      agencies to reduce them.39
           The E-FOIA explicitly required that records subject to the FOIA be available in electronic
      form when they are maintained electronically.40 It afforded requestors the flexibility to choose
      their records’ format, either paper or electronic media, and directed agencies to make a
      “reasonable effort” to comply with format requests.41 The bill also introduced a multi-track
      processing system, which allowed agencies to create processes to quickly handle small or
      compelling requests.42 As the 10-day processing deadline was clearly insufficient for agencies,
      it was extended to 20 days.43 Additionally, the Act required agencies to release frequently
      requested records.44 The E-FOIA passed with much less resistance than previous amendments
      and received a hearty endorsement in President Clinton’s signing statement. 45
           The FOIA’s next comprehensive modification was accomplished via the Openness Pro-
      motes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007 (OPEN Government Act of 2007).
      The OPEN Government Act followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (“9/11”)
      and the political reactions to the tragedy, which included an increased emphasis on national
      security. Senator Leahy took the helm once again and lambasted the Bush administration for
      “lax FOIA enforcement and a near obsession with Government secrecy” which combined to
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    551




weaken the FOIA and undercut the public’s right to information.46 In addition to over-classi-
fying documents as “secret,” many agencies were slow to implement the changes from the
E-FOIA.47 Lack of enforcement was another major challenge.48 No agency, government official
or government entity was responsible for ensuring that agencies and their employees com-
plied with the FOIA.
    The OPEN Government Act of 2007 emphasized the presumption of openness standard.49
Many parts of the Act sought to clarify and reinforce provisions already in place like those
addressing fee waivers, attorneys’ fees, disciplinary action for federal employees who arbitrarily
or capriciously denied requests, proactive public disclosure, deadlines for processing applica-
tions, and agency reporting requirements.50 The OPEN Government Act also introduced an
Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) within the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA), which would serve as the FOIA ombudsman.51
    In a meticulous fashion, the DOJ objected to almost every section of the bill, dismiss-
ing many of the provisions as redundant or unnecessary.52 Despite these objections, the bill
was approved in the House and the Senate. In one of his final acts as President of the United
States, George W. Bush signed the bill into law on December 31, 2007.
    While the OPEN Government Act of 2007 was the last comprehensive amendment of the
FOIA, the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 addressed a discrete but important issue. Exemption (b)(3)
of the FOIA covers all information withheld under other statutes. The OPEN FOIA Act requires
proposed legislation to specifically state that it will create a (b)(3) exemption.53 (B)(3) exemp-
tions are discussed further in Section 3.




3. Key Provisions of the Law
3.1. SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The FOIA’s twelve sections cover what entities within the government are subject to the law,
who can make requests, what may be discretionarily released, what must be mandatorily with-
held, timelines for disclosure, and exemptions. The FOIA also details requirements for agen-
cies and government officials including the drafting of regulations and annual reports.
     Anyone may file a FOIA request. Judicial and legislative interpretation of “person” includes
American citizens, residents, foreign nationals, minors, prisoners, corporations, the media, uni-
versities and other organizations. A FOIA requester need not give a reason or justification for
his or her records request, although these may become relevant for future litigation. In order
to file a request, a person must follow the proper filing procedure and reasonably describe
the information they are seeking. However, an agency is not required to create documents or
records in order to fulfill a FOIA request.54
     Requesters have access to records held by most, but not all, of the Federal Government.
Executive and military departments, Government corporations and Government controlled
corporations, other executive branch establishments, some parts of the Executive Office of
the President, and independent agencies are all subject to the FOIA.55 However, several key
actors are not subject to the FOIA, including: Congress and its support offices and agencies,
such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Government Printing Office and the
Library of Congress, the federal courts, and the parts of the Executive Office of the President
that function only to advise and assist the President. A few interviewees found this troubling
552                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      and expressed a desire to make Congress, the Courts and all of the Executive Office of the
      President subject to the FOIA.56
           The FOIA is not limited to records in an agency’s possession; if another entity is housing
      an agency’s records, they are still subject to the FOIA. Records held or maintained by a private
      company on behalf of a covered government entity are also subject to the FOIA.
           Private citizens and corporations (save those referenced above) are also exempt from
      the FOIA even if they are the recipients of large government contracts and perform quasi-
      governmental functions. Perhaps the most apt example of this is the private prison industry.
      Since 2007, the U.S. government has paid private prison companies billions of dollars to house
      more than 100,000 state and federal inmates, including immigrant and juvenile detainees.57
      Nonetheless, these corporations are not subject to the FOIA. Allegations of inmate mistreat-
      ment, abuse and deaths have spurred a movement to close this loophole.58 In response, the
      private prison industry has pumped millions of dollars into successful lobbying efforts that have
      prevented any legislation that would subject their records to disclosure.59
           For entities that are subject to the FOIA, the first section, (a), describes exactly which
      records they must make available for disclosure. This can be accomplished in several ways. The
      first is by listing the information in the Federal Register, which publicizes federal government
      rules, proposed rules and notices. According to the FOIA, the following must be published in
      the Federal Register:
       • Descriptions of the agency’s central and field organization;
       • Descriptions of the places, employees, members and methods an agency may use to
         obtain information, submit requests or obtain decisions;
       • Statements about the “general course and method” of how an agency handles its
         functions including the nature and requirements of all available informal and formal
         procedures;
       • Rules of procedure;
       • Descriptions of the forms available or the places where forms can be obtained;
       • Instructions regarding the scope and content of all papers, reports or examinations; sub-
         stantive rules of general applicability adopted/authorized by law;
       • Statements of general policies or interpretations of general applicability formulated or
         adopted by the agency; and
       • Any amendment, revision or repealing of the aforementioned.60

         Federal Register aside, agencies must make these records available for inspection and
      copying by the public:
       • Final opinions and orders made in adjudications, including concurring and dissenting
         opinions;
       • Policy statements and interpretations that have been adopted by the agency but are not
         published in the Federal Register;
       • Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect members of the public;
       • Copies of all previously released records that may become or are likely to become the
         subject of subsequent requests because of their subject matter; and
       • A general index of previously released records.61
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                     553




     Although the language in this provision is relatively straightforward, exemptions and
litigation have had a significant impact on what can be released under (a) and are discussed in
subsequent sections.

3.2. PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
The majority of agencies have several means of accepting requests including post, email, web-
site form and fax. After a person sends his or her request, the agency should send a receipt
notice with a tracking number if processing the request will take more than 10 days.62 This
number can then be used to obtain an update on the request’s status, either via the agency’s
website or phone.63 Status updates should include the date the agency received the request
and an estimated date of completion.64
    Requesters can specify their desired format. Agencies are supposed to dispense the
information in the format requested as either paper or electronic copies (a CD-ROM or email
attachment), if the record is “readily producible” in that format.65 However, requesters report
that agencies do not always fulfill their format requests; they also criticize agencies for wasting
money by sending large paper documents when a CD-ROM would be less expensive and an
email virtually free.66
    Advocates want a simplified procedure. They would prefer to have a central location where
they can make and track requests to any agency and receive responses. Such a portal does
not yet exist for all agencies. FOIAonline accepts requests for the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), Department of Commerce (save the US Patent and Trademark Office), National
Archives and Records Administration’s Office of General Counsel, Merit Systems Protection
Board, and Federal Labor Relations Authority.67
    Civil society organizations have designed their own initiatives to make FOIA requests
easier for members of the public. The Center for Investigative Reporting raised more than
$53,000 from 2,071 contributors to launch its FOIA Machine initiative.68 The FOIA Machine is
free to use and compiles FOIA procedure, rules, exemptions and best practices in one place.69
The platform also lets users track requests via dashboard, receive alerts, share “request blue-
prints” and obtain support and expert advice from the FOIA Machine’s community.70 Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press runs iFOIA.71 IFOIA uses a Request-generator Wizard to
produce customized FOIA requests that can be tracked.72 It also permits users to add attach-
ments, keep an archive of sent and received documents and set reminders and follow-ups for
submitted requests.

3.3. EXEMPTIONS
The use of exemptions has always been a point of contention between the requester commu-
nity, agencies and the Executive branch. FOIA has nine exemptions. Exemptions are identified
by their location in the FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1)-(9). They concern matters:

(1) kept secret via specific authorization of an Executive Order in the interest of national secu-
    rity or foreign policy that are properly classified pursuant to an Executive Order;

(2) related solely to an agency’s internal personnel rules and practices;

(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute; statutes enacted after the OPEN FOIA
    Act of 2009 must cite paragraph three in order to be included amongst these statutes;
554                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      (4) Trade secrets and privileged or confidential commercial or financial information;

      (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would be unavailable, under law, to
          a party in litigation with the agency;

      (6) Personnel, medical files and similar files, which if disclosed, would constitute a “clearly
          unwarranted invasion of personal privacy”;

      (7) records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, specifically that could “rea-
          sonably be expected to” or would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) deprive
          a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted
          invasion of personal privacy (D) disclose a confidential source’s identity (E) disclose tech-
          niques, procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if dis-
          closure “could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law”, or (F) endanger
          any individual’s life or physical safety;

      (8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on
          behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of finan-
          cial institutions; or

      (9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, about wells.73

          Agencies can elect to release information even when a certain exemption applies. How-
      ever, agencies are constrained in exercising discretion in regard to exemption 1 and 3, and
      limited in regard to exemptions 4, 6 and 7(C).74
          While agencies may invoke exemptions, they must provider requesters with segregable
      portions of the record indicating where the exempt portions have been removed and the
      exemptions invoked.75 Any denial, in whole or in part, obligates the agency to make reason-
      able efforts to provide the requester with information about the quantity of denied records
      unless doing so is protected by the invoked exemption.76

      Public Interest Balancing Test

      Exemption 6 has been interpreted to include a public interest balancing test: once it has been
      established that information meets the threshold requirement of Exemption 6, the focus of the
      inquiry turns to whether disclosure of the records at issue “would constitute a clearly unwar-
      ranted invasion of personal privacy.” This requires a balancing of the public’s right to disclosure
      against the individual’s right to privacy.77 Exemption 7(C) has a very attenuated public interest
      balancing test: when a requester asserts government misconduct as the public interest in dis-
      closure, that requester must make a “meaningful evidentiary showing” that the public interest
      in disclosure is sufficiently compelling to, on balance, outweigh legitimate privacy interests.78

      Harms Test

      Under exemption 4, a harms test is applied: a commercial or financial matter is “confidential”
      if it meets any one of a three-part test: (1) impairs the Government’s ability to obtain necessary
      information in the future; or (2) causes substantial harm to the competitive position of the per-
      son from whom the information was obtained (actual competition need not be demonstrated;
      only evidence of competition and the likelihood of substantial competitive injury is all that
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                   555




needs to be shown); or (3) whether disclosure of the information will harm an “identifiable”
private or governmental interest which the Congress sought to protect.79
      Exemption 7(A) also contains a harms test: it requires a two-step analysis focusing on
(1) whether a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective, and (2) whether release
of information about it could reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm. Further,
it is well established that in order to satisfy the “pending/prospective” requirement, an agency
must be able to point to a specific pending or contemplated law enforcement proceeding.80


3.4. FEES
All fees collected for processing a FOIA request must be based on “reasonable standard
charges.” 81 Fees should never include the costs associated with resolving policy or legal issues
that might arise while processing the request.82 However, the extent of what agencies may
charge depends on who is requesting the documents. Agencies may always collect fees for
photocopying, after a specified number of free pages. This is the only charge they can levy
against educational requesters, non-commercial scientific institutions and representatives from
the news media who will use the information for scholarly purposes.83 Other non-commercial
requesters can be charged for document search and duplication.84 No non-commercial
applicants should be charged for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of
duplication.85 Commercial requesters may be charged for duplication, search time and review.86
     Agencies are encouraged to not charge fees or to lower their fees in several circumstances.
They should release documents at a reduced charge or no charge if disclosure is not primar-
ily in the requester’s commercial interest but rather, in the public interest, and “likely” to
contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of governmental operations and activi-
ties.87 Agencies cannot assess fees if they fail to comply with the time limits set for process-
ing requests unless “unusual or exceptional circumstances” apply.88 If an agency has unusual
or exceptional circumstances, the deadline to process the request is extended by 10 days.
Currently, agencies that claim such circumstances charge fees, even if they fail to meet the
extended deadline. Advocates consider this practice contrary to congressional intent.
     In litigation, fee disputes are reviewed de novo (anew) by the appropriate district court.
FOIA fees only cover a fraction of the cost for administering the program. In 2012, agencies
spent approximately $430 million on the FOIA and collected approximately $4.7 million in
fees.89 Fees charged by agencies go into the general Treasury, not into the agencies’ coffers.
     Interviewees believe that some agencies use the threat of large fees to discourage
requests and that they fail to grant fee waivers as often as they should.90 In one case, Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement (ICE), denied a fee waiver request and levied a $10,000 fee
against a chapter of one of the United States’ most prominent nonprofits: the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU).91 Citing a “growing trend of fee waiver denials to public interest advo-
cacy organizations for FOIA requests on important topics,” the ACLU of Southern California
subsequently sued.92
     CSOs and media advocates have several suggestions for avoiding litigation over fee waiv-
ers. One is to encourage agencies to keep a list of individuals and organizations that have
already been granted fee waivers in the past, so that they are readily granted waivers when
they file new FOIA requests. Another is to grant fee waivers for all organizations with Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) 501(c)(3) status.93 This status, which exempts certain organizations from
556                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      some federal taxes, requires an application process. Eligible organizations include those that
      are religious, educational, scientific, literary and charitable.

      3.5. TIMELINES
      The FOIA establishes deadlines by which agencies must process requests and appeals.
      Agencies have 20 business days to determine if they are going to comply with a request,
      notify the requester of this determination and the reasons why, gather and review the relevant
      records, and alert the requester of their right to appeal an adverse decision to the head of the
      agency.94 After receipt of an appeal, agencies again have 20 days to make a decision regarding
      the appeal; if denial of the records is upheld in whole or in part, the agency must also alert the
      requester of their right to judicial review.95
          The 20-day period begins as soon as the request is received by the appropriate com-
      ponent but no later than 10 days from receipt by any agency component.96 This 10-day limit
      can be paused or “tolled”: 1) when the agency makes a single “reasonable” inquiry to the
      requester for information, tolling the 20 days while waiting for the information; 2) to clarify a
      fee assessment with a requester; and 3) when the agency needs to consult with another agency
      or components that have a substantial interest in the information.97 To aid with this process,
      every agency must have a FOIA liaison to assist customers in any disputes with the agency.98
          The 20-day time limit can be extended in unusual circumstances, but only for a maximum
      of 10 days unless the agency has notified the requester that the request cannot be processed
      within the time limit and has given the requester an opportunity to limit the request’s scope.99
      Unusual circumstances include the need to:
       • search for and collect the requested records from facilities located separately from the
         office processing the request;
       • search for, collect and examine “voluminous amounts” of separate and distinct records
         stemming from a single request; and
       • consult with another agency with “substantial interest” in determining the request or
         two of more of the agency’s own components that have a subject matter interest in the
         request.100

           Expedition of requests is available for those who submit a certified statement describing a
      “compelling need.” A compelling need is one involving an imminent threat to an individual’s
      life or safety or urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged federal activities.101 The
      agency must alert the requester of the decision regarding expedition within 10 days.102
           It behooves requesters to tailor their requests if an agency encourages them to do so. A
      requester’s refusal to “reasonably modify” a request or to arrange for an alternative time frame
      will be a factor in determining the existence of exceptional circumstances.103 This, in turn, may
      affect future litigation. Exceptional circumstances, however, do not include delays that result
      from “predictable workload” unless the agency can demonstrate that it has made reasonable
      progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.104

      3.6. DESIGNATING AND SUSTAINING OVERSIGHT
      Many federal agencies have the power to enforce legislation through fines, criminal charges,
      detention or other sanctions. They do not depend wholly, or even primarily, on the judiciary
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    557




to enforce the legislation. As advocates observe, this has not historically been the case for the
FOIA. During a Senate Hearing for the 2007 OPEN Government Act, one advocate observed
that for the FOIA, “there is no Federal, State, or local agency that enforces it. It depends on
the public to make it work with the tools provided by Congress and an independent judiciary
that is willing to remind agencies of their obligations.”105
    FOIA oversight generally has several layers. On the intra-agency level, the Chief FOIA
Officer (CFO) is responsible for agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. The CFO must hold
a senior position at the agency and is mandated to monitor FOIA implementation, designate
FOIA liaisons, keep the head of agency and the Attorney General of the U.S. informed of
agency performance, and make recommendations to the agency head about adjustments to
agency practices, policies, personnel and funding.106
    A second layer at the agency level is the FOIA liaisons. Liaisons serve as officials with whom
requesters can raise concerns. They are responsible for making the FOIA more efficient by
assisting in delay reduction, increasing transparency and assisting in dispute resolution.107
    Above the intra-agency level, Congress has designated two offices with responsibility for
guiding agency compliance with the FOIA: OIP (under the DOJ) and NARA’s Office of Govern-
ment Information Services (OGIS). Their oversight capacities will be discussed in section four.




4. Legal Environment and Compliance
4.1. USE OF EXEMPTIONS
Nearly all of the interviewees identified overuse of exemptions as one of the biggest impedi-
ments to successful FOIA implementation.108 Exemption 5 (deliberative process) and those
created through other statutes, known as (b)(3)s, are generally cited as the most problematic.109
Exemption (b)(3) incorporates into the FOIA provisions other laws that restrict the availability
of information to the public. FOIA requesters and civil society advocates express concern
over the (b)(3) exemption statutes because their proliferation, broad scope and enthusiastic
use create “an insurmountable barrier” to disclosure.110 The use of this exemption is often
obfuscated: while the DOJ publishes a list of all the (b)(3)s used by agencies in any one year,
the list includes only those and is not comprehensive. Additionally, these provisions appear
in bills on issues not directly related to the FOIA and, thus, are not generally referred to the
committees that oversee the FOIA and have the expertise on public access concerns. For
FOIA advocates, the legislative process surrounding these provisions can be difficult to be
involved in and to follow, and advocates often learn about new legislation far too late to mount
effective opposition.111
    Exemption 5 has become one of the “biggest roadblocks” for civil society groups in litiga-
tion.112 This exemption is perceived as keeping information from the public that is especially
relevant for understanding or exposing government policies and practices.113
    In order to remedy the obstacles caused by exemptions, especially 3 and 5, advocates
have suggested incorporating sunsets and balancing tests.114 Adding a sunset provision to
FOIA provisions would force Congress to reexamine and reauthorize the provision, or it would
expire. In the case of (b)(3)s, the hundreds of statutes used to withhold documents would
have to be individually reauthorized. Balancing tests would require the agency to consider the
558                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      public interest in disclosure over the interests in withholding the records. In the case of litiga-
      tion, a balancing test would permit a judge to compare the public interest with the agency
      interest to determine which takes precedence. Currently, there is no counterbalance to the
      government interest assertion under Exemption 5. Permitting evidence of public interest as a
      foil might require more time in litigation, but would also likely increase disclosure of important
      intra- and interagency documents.115

      4.2. RESPONSE RATES
      Delays are a major challenge.116 One interviewee labeled them the “single most frustrating
      [FOIA] issue.”117 Agencies struggle to disclose records within the 20-day deadline. According
      to the Office of Information Policy’s (OIP) 2012 Summary of Agencies’ Annual FOIA Reports,
      processing averages were 22.66 days for simple requests, 40.2 days for expedited requests
      and 82.35 for complex requests.118 Complex requests are those that involve either voluminous
      amounts of materials or will be time consuming to process.119 The OIP report also revealed that
      the ten oldest FOIA requests in the federal system were filed between 2001 and 2003; 2012
      marked the first year without unprocessed requests from the 1990s.120
          While requesters are understandably disturbed by the time it takes to process FOIA
      requests, advocates agree that there will always be delays due to lack of resources and the
      FOIA’s relatively low priority when compared to other issues.121 As one interviewee stated,
      “FOIA is never going to have the resources it needs to do away with delay. We’re going to
      have to live with it.”122

      4.3. ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS REQUIRING ACCOMMODATIONS
      Of course, these procedures for access do not accommodate everyone. People with disabili-
      ties and Limited English Proficiency (LEP) may require additional assistance in order to fully
      access information using the FOIA.
           Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires federal agencies to make their
      electronic technology accessible to those with disabilities.123 This includes software, operat-
      ing systems, web-based information and applications, telecommunications products, videos,
      multimedia and self-contained closed products.124 Compliance with Section 508 is mixed. A
      DOJ Survey revealed that approximately 70 percent of components surveyed had established
      formal, written accessibility policies.125 More than 80 percent reported either complying with
      Section 508’s requirements for the web, web forms and web-based applications or not comply-
      ing because the requirements were not applicable.126
           As websites are required to be accessible to persons with disabilities, some FOIA advo-
      cates worry that agencies may use this to justify their slow development of efficient FOIA
      websites and portals. Currently, both FOIAonline127 and FOIA.Gov128 contend that they are
      Section 508 compliant. FOIA.Gov is a website maintained by the Department of Justice to
      display FOIA data and educate the public on FOIA. FOIAonline allows individuals to submit
      FOIA requests to participating agencies and track those requests.
           Protection for individuals with LEP is not as concrete or widespread. Agencies are not
      strictly required by law to maintain FOIA websites in another language, though some do.
      Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Executive Order 13166 cover language access. Title VI bars
      discrimination against people based on their national origin. Executive Order 13166 requires
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    559




agencies to comply with Title VI by creating systems that limited English proficiency individuals
can use to “meaningfully access” agencies’ services.129 Like Section 508, compliance with lan-
guage accommodations is mixed. A GAO report revealed that agencies themselves are tasked
with determining if they require an LEP plan and recipient guidance for those who provide
services to LEP populations.130 There is no DOJ oversight. As a result, the number of agencies
that still must complete their guidance and plans cannot be determined.131
     A significant portion of the United States population, approximately 25 million individuals,
has limited English proficiency.132 Of these, more than 60 percent are Spanish speaking.133 The
government recognizes the need for Spanish websites and many agencies maintain a more
limited Spanish website in addition to the original English website. The same is not true for
agencies’ FOIA websites. FOIA.Gov has a FOIA en Español section that explains the FOIA and
answers frequently asked questions (FAQ) on the Act. The FAQs explain what the FOIA is, how
to file a request, exemptions, how to file an appeal and other basic information.134 However,
the button “explore datos de la FOIA” (explore FOIA data) leads to the English data site.
FOIAonline is not available in Spanish.
     Agencies that interact more frequently with Spanish speakers fare better. Many immigrants
use the FOIA and the Privacy Act to access their immigration files from United States Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Privacy Act allows individuals to seek their personal
records from agencies. USCIS has published a Spanish FOIA guide.135 It also provides a form
for FOIA and Privacy Act Requests. While individuals can access information about the form in
Spanish, the form itself is only available in English.
     Finally, the rise of technology has led to challenges for another group of potential request-
ers: those without access to computers. While these individuals can still mail or fax in their
FOIA requests, the process can be more time consuming for them. They also do not have
access to data that is immediately available, at no cost, on agency websites.


4.4. PROACTIVE DISCLOSURE AND OPEN DATA
In January of 2009, President Obama issued a Memorandum that urged agencies not to
wait for specific requests before disclosing information, and encouraged them to use mod-
ern technology to facilitate timely disclosures; he ordered the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to update guidance to “increase and improve information dissemination to the
public.”136 Attorney General Holder’s FOIA Guidelines echoed the President’s memorandum,
noting that proactive disclosure could benefit agencies by decreasing the need for individual
requests and reducing backlogs.137 Civil society tends to agree. The internationally minded
Carter Center maintains that proactive disclosure can foster confidence in the system.138
     The primacy of proactive disclosure in any open government plan is underscored by its
location in OMB’s 2009 Open Government Directive.139 The Directive’s first goal is simple: pub-
lish government information online. OMB believes that this method of disclosure will increase
accountability, promote informed public participation and create economic opportunity.140 The
Directive encourages agencies to publish the information in an open format. Open format
means that the information is independent of platforms, machine-readable and without restric-
tions that would impede its re-use.141 To jumpstart agencies’ release of information online, the
Directive required them to identify and publish three “high value” datasets, in an open format,
on Data.gov within forty-five days.142
560                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Data.gov was launched in May 2009 as an integral part of President Obama’s Open Gov-
      ernment Initiative. The goal of the site is to improve transparency by giving the public better
      access to datasets that are created and held by the federal government. The government also
      hopes that use of Data.gov will foster innovative ideas via creative use of the data. At the time
      of this case study, Data.gov featured more than 87,000 datasets, 349 citizen developed apps
      and eight galleries.143
           Another website, FOIA.gov (not to be confused with FOIAonline) was launched by the
      DOJ approximately a year later during Sunshine Week 2010. FOIA.gov hosts FOIA data and
      resources, including links to agency FOIA request sites. It is an interactive site. Users can
      search, sort and use data to compare agencies and time periods.144
           Data.gov and FOIA.gov are helpful tools for releasing a certain type of data. However, their
      presence does not extinguish agencies’ proactive disclosure obligations under the FOIA. The
      FOIA’s frequently-requested records provision obliges agencies to release records that have
      already been requested and released and that they have a reason to believe will be requested
      again.145 This has been interpreted to encompass a “rule of three” under which agencies
      should post a released record if they anticipate that it, or an essentially similar record, will be
      requested three times.146 FOIA advocates do not think this goes far enough. Many propose a
      “release to one, release to all” policy. FOIA advocates also want agencies to disclose informa-
      tion of likely interest before it is requested.147 They urge the administration to make proactive
      disclosure the default and to establish a list of the types of information that, at a minimum,
      should be disclosed.148
           Proactive release of records requires a location where they can be placed and accessed.
      After the E-FOIA required agencies to make records electronically available, many created
      FOIA electronic reading rooms and FOIA libraries. Perhaps the most famous is “The Vault”,
      the FBI’s electronic reading room. The Vault features records sorted into intriguing categories
      like civil rights, unexplained phenomena and gangster era. Recent releases include documents
      about Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi, Los Angeles Police brutality victim Rodney King and
      Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye.149
           Agencies’ compliance with proactive disclosure is discussed in their Annual Reports and
      CFO reports. Proactive disclosure is described by OIP as “taking affirmative steps to identify
      records likely to be of interest to the public and then proactively posting those records online
      in advance of a formal FOIA request.”150 In assessing if agencies have taken steps to increase
      proactive disclosure, OIP uses the following indicators: adding materials to the website,
      enhanced usability of the website and other efforts to increase proactive disclosures.151 The
      USDA, DOJ, EPA and NARA all met this milestone in 2012. In fact, most agencies did. Every
      agency, save one, reported an increase in the amount of materials it posted online.152
           The USDA, DOJ, EPA and NARA have all employed tactics to increase or improve their
      proactive disclosure. Both NARA and the DOJ release materials via their social media pages.
      The USDA has launched “Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food,” which allows users to search
      for and map federally supported local food projects, farmers markets, meat processors and
      more.153 The EPA and NARA worked together to launch FOIAonline.154 The EPA has also
      launched MyPropertyInfo, which has been met by accolades from the real estate community.155
      MyPropertyInfo combines multiple EPA databases and allows direct access to site-specific
      information regarding a property’s environmental history. The results are identical to the ones
      customers would receive by filing a FOIA request.156
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    561




4.5. IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY OF OVERSIGHT AGENCIES
Office of Information Policy (OIP)

In 1982, the DOJ merged its Office of Information Law and Policy and the Office of Privacy
and Information Appeals to create OIP.157 OIP became, and remains, responsible for provid-
ing guidance to agencies concerning compliance with the FOIA. It has also been tasked
with ensuring that every agency subject to the FOIA implements the President’s FOIA
Memorandum and the AG’s FOIA Guidelines.
    OIP’s oversight mechanisms include publishing reports, conducting trainings, answering
inquiries from agencies and the requesting public, and issuing guidance. Agencies send their
Annual FOIA and Chief FOIA Officer reports to OIP for review. OIP then releases an annual
summary of these reports, which includes an evaluation of agencies’ compliance efforts. OIP
also publishes and regularly updates the DOJ’s Guide to the Freedom of Information Act.158
The guide describes, in great detail, all of the FOIA’s provisions and explains how judicial deci-
sions, Executive Orders and other memoranda influence each provision.
    In addition to being responsible for evaluating agencies’ compliance with the FOIA, OIP
handles the DOJ’s obligations under the FOIA. It adjudicates administrative appeals, pro-
cesses initial records requests for several Attorney General offices, conducts the litigation
defense of “certain FOIA matters” and provides staff to the Office’s Department of Review
Committee, which reviews classified DOJ documents.159
    Consequently, the office tasked with encouraging agency compliance with the FOIA also
handles requests, appeals and some litigation for its parent department. This means that OIP’s
contact with requesters is somewhat incongruous. In its quest to improve FOIA compliance via
outreach, the Office conducts town hall meetings, trainings and roundtables with the requester
community. However, the Office’s relationship with requesters is often more contentious during
appeals or litigation.
    FOIA advocates question OIP’s ability and willingness to honestly evaluate agency imple-
mentation of the FOIA. The Office is perceived as soft-pedaling its evaluations in order to
maintain a good relationship with other agencies.160 Advocates point to OIP’s language in
reports, which they believe downplays agencies’ deficiencies. As one civil society coalition
remarked, “OIP acts more like a cheerleader celebrating every time an agency does something
right than as the schoolmarm making sure all of the agencies did their homework.”161
    FOIA advocates’ unease also extends to the Department of Justice as a whole. For them,
the DOJ’s competing roles of FOIA oversight institution, FOIA litigator and FOIA processor are
not ideal.162 These concerns are heightened by the belief that the DOJ has failed to provide a
good example for other agencies regarding compliance with the FOIA, Presidential Memo and
AG Guidelines.
    The DOJ has not updated its regulations to reflect the Obama Administration’s open gov-
ernment agenda. It has been drafting regulations but has not yet completed them. This has
been problematic not only for FOIA advocates, but also for members of Congress. In February
2013, the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a
letter to OIP expressing concern on a number of issues, including agencies’ outdated regula-
tions. The Committee formally requested that OIP answer 23 questions including why the DOJ
had failed to update its own regulations.163
562                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          In response, OIP held a briefing for Committee staff but did not send a written response to
      the questions. The Committee sent another letter in June of 2013 stating that the staff brief-
      ing had failed to answer the letter’s substantive questions and calling OIP’s failure to respond
      in writing “extremely disappointing” in light of its “primary mission” of FOIA oversight.164
      The letter again requested a response to the 23 questions and an explanation for the delay.
      Less than a week later, OIP responded to the 23 questions. Although they did not address the
      four-month delay, OIP noted that the resources and time required to “promulgate regulations”
      indicated that they were not intended to be modified frequently.165 However, the Office wrote
      that “passage of time” necessitated a revision to the DOJ’s guidelines and stated that they
      expected to publish them “later this year.”166
          The requester community’s grievances with the DOJ do not begin or end with its decade
      old regulations. In 2012, the National Security Archive at the George Washington University
      “awarded” the DOJ its Rosemary Award for Worst Government Performance. The “honor” was
      repeated in 2013. The Archive based its decision on several observations of DOJ behavior it
      deemed unacceptable, including:
       • Insisting that the Department of Justice does not “embrace” the principle of narrowly
         construing exemptions during Supreme Court oral arguments;
       • Developing regulations that would permit the DOJ to lie to requesters about the existence
         of records. This provision was ultimately withdrawn due to public outcry;
       • Developing regulations that would inhibit the ability of elementary students and secondary
         school students, bloggers and new media to obtain fee waivers;
       • Failing to alter its litigation policy to support openness. The DOJ has not attempted to
         review its litigation so that the President and AG’s guidelines could be applied;
       • Failing to order agencies to upgrade their FOIA regulations; and
       • Publishing “misleading” statistics about FOIA responsiveness for three years.167

          According to the National Security Archive’s FOIA Coordinator, Nate Jones, “The Depart-
      ment of Justice—which is responsible for enforcing the FOIA government-wide—was sup-
      posed to be the change agent and role model for President Obama’s FOIA reforms. But,
      despite the President’s clear instructions, the DOJ has embraced a ‘FOIA-as-usual mindset’
      that has failed to transform the decades-old FOIA policies within its department, much less
      throughout the government.”168

      Office of Government Information Services—The FOIA Ombudsman (OGIS)

      Frustration with OIP’s performance and lack of oversight were part of the reason why civil soci-
      ety pushed for the creation of a FOIA ombudsman. The fruit of this labor, OGIS, was incorpo-
      rated into the statute in 2007. Under the FOIA, OGIS is responsible for:
       • Reviewing agencies’ policies, procedures and compliance;
       • Recommending policy changes to Congress and the President;
       • Offering mediation services for dispute resolution for requesters and agencies; and
       • Issuing advisory opinions, at the discretion of the office, if mediation does not settle the
         dispute.169
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                     563




     Like the FOIA itself, OGIS had an inauspicious beginning. After the OPEN Government
Act passed in 2007, President George W. Bush attempted to move OGIS’s functions from
NARA to the DOJ by burying a provision in the Budget.170 The move was brought to Con-
gress’s attention by Senator Leahy who reminded his colleagues, “When Senator Cornyn and
I drafted the OPEN Government Act, we intentionally placed this critical office in the National
Archives, so that OGIS would be free from the influence of the Federal agency that litigates
FOIA disputes—the Department of Justice.”171 President Bush’s attempt to move (and accord-
ing to some FOIA advocates, eliminate) OGIS was thwarted and the office was launched
within NARA.
     FOIA advocates’ conception of the ombudsman is borrowed from the original Swedish
model. In 1809, the Swedish constitution granted the Riksdag (Parliament) power to appoint a
fully independent government official to ensure that public authorities complied with Swedish
law.172 The Swedish word “ombudsman” loosely translates into “representative” with “ombud”
literally meaning “agent.” The world’s first ombudsman had prosecutorial powers to conduct
inquiries, release critical observations and indict or launch disciplinary proceedings against an
offender.173 FOIA advocates hoped that OGIS would both hold agencies accountable for their
failures under the FOIA and mediate disputes between requesters and agencies in order to
avoid litigation.
     It was clear before OGIS began operating that it would not be an ombudsman in the
traditional Swedish sense. In a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, OGIS’s founding
Director clarified that while some had been referring to OGIS as the FOIA ombudsman, they
viewed themselves as a pre-litigation mediator and a source of information.174 The Office has
no prosecutorial powers. It cannot compel either agencies or requesters to enter into media-
tion, which must be voluntary for all parties. In addition, OGIS cannot compel an agency to
comply with its mediation recommendations and these recommendations do not receive any
type of formal judicial notice.
     Despite these limitations, OGIS has been busy. In its first three years, the Office has
assisted almost 2,000 requesters with 1,125 cases and 875 “quick hits,” inquiries that are
quickly answered.175 Requesters warmly welcome OGIS but some agencies regarded them as
the “FOIA police” and were reluctant to share information with them or to work with them to
settle disputes.176
     The Office itself has struggled with how to best fulfill its role. OGIS’s Director has repeat-
edly expressed her awareness of the “inherent tension” between OGIS’s “two fairly different
statutory missions.”177 The Office does not feel it has the resources to perform both its media-
tion and review functions.178 OGIS believes that two separate staffs, one for each function,
would minimize any tension resulting from publicly criticizing an agency with whom it may
also mediate.179
     To date, OGIS has focused on providing mediation services, conducting trainings and issu-
ing best practice guides. It has not published a single advisory opinion and does not conduct
comprehensive reviews of agencies’ compliance with the FOIA. OGIS’s focus on mediation has
led some to assert that they are failing to fulfill their mandate. A 2013 Government Account-
ability Report put it succinctly, “Until OGIS establishes a methodology and time frame for
proactively reviewing agencies’ FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance, the Office will not
be positioned to effectively execute its responsibilities as required by the act.”180
564                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           For their part, CSOs are disappointed in OGIS’s reticence to “name and shame” agencies.
      Advocates recognize the tension in OGIS’s mandate. They agree the agency should have more
      resources and many praise OGIS’s mediation efforts. Moreover, the Office Director regularly
      connects with advocates; the two sides meet to discuss OGIS’s difficulties, progress and future.
      Nonetheless, advocates consistently implore the office to do more.
           The majority of interviewees want OGIS to leverage the power they currently have and
      write advisory opinions.181 They also acknowledge that OGIS may require some restructuring
      and have made other suggestions for strengthening the office including: granting OGIS the
      power to sue on behalf of requesters, lobbying Congress to give the office more resources,
      giving advisory opinions precedential value and making mediation mandatory for agencies but
      optional for requesters.182 One interviewee recognized the formation of OGIS as one of civil
      society’s major accomplishments; she also observed that, as civil society rarely speaks with one
      voice, OGIS should be given time to grow into its role.183
           Finally, OIP and OGIS have a somewhat shared mandate. This has strained the offices’
      relationship in the past. In its first-year report, OGIS frankly noted the issue, admitting that the
      two offices have “an intersection of duties” that can enhance services for both offices “but
      that has created tension.”184 Civil society and Congress are cognizant of this tension and seek
      to minimize it when possible by calling attention to behavior that may muddle the respective
      offices’ mandates. For instance, in 2008, the DOJ proposed modifications to its FOIA and Pri-
      vacy Act records’ systems in which the Department suggested that OIP serve as an “ombuds-
      man” in disputes between requesters and agencies.185 In response, Senators Leahy and Cornyn
      penned a letter to Attorney General Holder arguing that this type of change would create
      unnecessary confusion for agencies and requesters because OGIS was designated as the FOIA
      ombudsman.186 Civil society quickly followed with a letter of their own cautioning OIP to “limit
      any assistance to resolving disputes within DOJ involving DOJ components, and leave all other
      agencies and disputes to OGIS.”187 The DOJ promised to change the language of the pro-
      posed modifications.188
           This incident underscores interviewees’ contention that the DOJ is not sufficiently support-
      ive of OGIS.189 They point to the power discrepancy as particularly harmful to the FOIA. OIP
      has the power and resources of the government’s FOIA litigator: the DOJ.190 OGIS does not.
      Despite this, OGIS and OIP have managed to work together on a number of initiatives includ-
      ing conducting FOIA requester roundtables and presenting at training sessions.191

      4.6. FILING AN APPEAL
      There are a number of reasons why a requester may be dissatisfied with the FOIA process.
      Denial of records, agency failure to process the request within the time limits, denial of a fee
      waiver, denial of expedited processing, and inadequacy of search are common grounds for
      appeal. When this occurs the requester can file an administrative appeal, in writing, with the
      agency component that processed the request.

      Agencies’ Appeals Processing

      After the agency has received the appeal, the FOIA allots 20 days for processing it.192 The
      20-day period begins on the date that the request is initially received by the appropriate
      agency component and no later than 10 days after it is initially received by any of the agency’s
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    565




components.193 An agency can only pause the 20-day requirement in two cases. First, the
20 days may be tolled (paused or delayed) when the agency needs more information from the
requester; it may then make a single request for information from the requester.194 Second, an
agency may also toll the 20 days if it must clarify a fee assessment issue.195 In both cases, the
20 days is paused while the agency waits for this information or clarification. As soon as the
agency is provided with what it requires, the tolling stops.196
     The 20-day time limit can be extended under three “unusual circumstances”: 1) the need
to search and collect the requested records from facilities separate from the request office;
2) the need to search for, collect and examine “a voluminous amount of separate and distinct
records” demanded in a single request; and 3) the need to consult with two or more compo-
nents in the same agency or with another agency.197 Under these unusual circumstances, the
agency is kept to a 10-day extension. Additional time is permissible if the agency notifies the
requester that the request cannot be processed within the 20-day time limit and gives the
requester an opportunity to narrow his or her search or agree to an alternative time frame.198
As in the case of initial FOIA requests, the requester’s refusal on appeal to “reasonably modify
the request or arrange an alternative time frame” will be considered a factor in determining if
unusual circumstances exist.199


4.7. SANCTIONS
The FOIA’s sanctions provision has been the subject of debate since its proposed incorpo-
ration into the Act. Congress hoped that the possibility of imposing sanctions for failure to
comply with FOIA would “make it crystal clear that this law be strictly adhered to by all Federal
agency personnel.”200 After the sanctions provision was incorporated into the 1974 amend-
ments, some in the legal community questioned its suitability. In an article about the FOIA,
then University of Chicago Law Professor (now Supreme Court Justice) Antonin Scalia, quipped
that it was rare for a federal official to “be subjected to a disciplinary investigation even for
malicious baby-snatching under color of law, much less mere negligence. But if he should hap-
pen to trifle with an FOIA request, stand back!”201
     The FOIA’s sanctions clause, 4(F)(i), discusses potential disciplinary and civil consequences
for individual federal employees who wrongfully withhold documents under the FOIA. Several
things must occur for this to happen: the agency’s withholding is judged improper, fees are
assessed against the agency and the Court issues a finding stating that the circumstances of
the withholding have raised questions concerning whether personnel acted arbitrarily and
capriciously. The FOIA then directs a Special Counsel to investigate, consider the evidence
and submit conclusions and recommendations to the agency’s administrative authorities.
These authorities should follow the Special Counsel’s advice on corrective action.
     In addition to the clause in FOIA, the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) also authorizes
sanctions.202 Under section (a)(3), the Office of Special Counsel may investigate any allegation
of arbitrary and capricious withholding under FOIA. The Special Counsel may take corrective
or disciplinary action as provided by the statute. Corrective action includes placing the harmed
individual in the position they would have been had the prohibited withholding not occurred,
reimbursing attorneys’ fees, other “reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages” and
compensatory damages.203 Disciplinary action includes removal, demotion, a five-year bar from
federal employment, suspension, reprimand, or civil penalty of less than $1,000.204
566                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




           Justice Scalia’s colorful fears about the use of FOIA sanctions have been misplaced. In the
      37 years since the sanctions provision was established, no sanctions have been imposed on
      a federal employee for arbitrarily and capriciously withholding a document in violation of the
      FOIA.205 In fact, referrals to the Special Counsel or agencies’ disciplinary boards have been
      extremely rare. The first case involving the sanctions clause occurred shortly after the amend-
      ment was passed. In Holly v. Acree, the District of Columbia (DC) Court found that an agency
      employee had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in withholding records and awarded the plain-
      tiff attorneys’ fees. 206
           Nearly a quarter century later, in 2000, the DC District Court referred an Assistant United
      States Attorney to the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility. This attorney had destroyed
      the majority of the files at issue in a FOIA litigation based on his stated belief that they could
      be destroyed after the plaintiff’s criminal appeals had finished.207 In ordering his conduct be
      reviewed by the Office of Professional Responsibility, the Court stated, “At the very least, [his]
      actions demonstrate a dangerous and reckless disregard for his agency’s statutory duty under
      the Freedom of Information Act. At worst, [he] may have perjured himself.”208
            The DOJ’s mistakes did not end there. As a result of the files’ destruction, the plaintiff and
      defendant agreed to a schedule for the reconstruction of the files. The Court found that the
      Attorney in Charge of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys’ FOIA and Privacy Act
      made only a “cursory” attempt to reconstruct the files due to her concern over the cost of the
      extra copies. The Court held, “not only do Defendant’s actions constitute bad faith sufficient
      to justify sanctions in this case, but they are sufficiently flagrant to compel imposition of sanc-
      tions.”209 It then fined the DOJ $10,000 to be paid to the DC Bar Foundation for distribution of
      non-profit legal services.210
           As noted in the DOJ’s FOIA Guide, agencies’ “bad faith” actions generally do not trig-
      ger a referral to a special counsel or disciplinary board. Instead they are often included in the
      evaluation as to whether a plaintiff will be granted attorneys’ fees.211 The government’s failure
      hold individual employees accountable for flagrantly violating the law has led FOIA advocates
      to denounce the sanctions provision as “toothless.”212 They do not blame the Office of the
      Special Counsel, but rather the federal courts that refuse to refer cases to the Office.213
            However, one interviewee contended that imposing sanctions might not be necessary to
      create change. He pointed out that even the threat of sanctions could make a difference; he
      recalled that the sanctions provision was the “driving force” of the DOJ’s increased training
      following the 1974 amendment.214 Advocates have suggested that one solution to bolster
      sanctions may be to involve OGIS in the sanctions process. They propose that the ombudsman
      be empowered to receive and screen sanctions applications without a court finding.215


      4.8. LITIGATION
      In 1974, while debating the necessity of sanctions, Senator Edward Kennedy remarked that,
      “The only mechanism for enforcing the mandates of the Freedom of Information Act has been
      for individuals to go to court for an injunction on a case-by-case basis, with great cost and
      delay. This is an expensive and not always effective approach.”216 However, many FOIA advo-
      cates argue that it is an extremely effective, if inefficient, approach. As one interviewee bluntly
      stated, “without Courts, the Freedom of Information Act would be worthless.”217
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                           567




     In order to file in federal court, a complainant must have exhausted administrative rem-
edies, usually by filing an appeal with the agency. Administrative remedies are also exhausted
when an agency fails to comply with time limits and there are no exceptional circumstances or
exercises of due diligence on the agency’s part.218 The FOIA grants jurisdiction to the District
Court where the complainant resides or has his/her principle place of business, the location
of the agency records, or the District of Columbia.219 The agency has 30 days from receipt of
service to answer unless the court determines there was good cause for a delay.220
     Generally in a FOIA suit, both sides file for summary judgment. Summary judgment is a
device used in civil litigation to avoid trial. It is appropriate when there is no dispute over the
material facts and one party is entitled to win as a matter of law. The matter is reviewed de
novo and the court has an opportunity to examine the documents in camera (privately) to
determine if withholding was appropriate.221
     The Court can assess reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs when a complain-
ant has “substantially prevailed.”222 For claims that are “not insubstantial,” a complainant will
have prevailed upon the execution of a judicial order, enforceable written agreement, consent
degree or voluntary unilateral change in an agency’s position.223 Before the “voluntary uni-
lateral change” language was added in the 2007 amendment to the FOIA, agencies would
routinely release information just before a judgment, depriving the complainant of his or her
ability to collect attorneys’ fees.
     An individual who is representing himself or herself cannot collect attorneys’ fees. How-
ever, many people elect to represent themselves because hiring a FOIA attorney can be cost
prohibitive. FOIA litigation is also notoriously time consuming. Consequently, fee awards can
be massive. Recently, the FBI was ordered to pay a journalist $470,459.75 in attorneys’ fees
after he substantially prevailed in two long-running FOIA suits.224
     While FOIA fees (for search and duplication) feed into the General Fund of the Treasury,
each agency is individually responsible for paying litigants’ attorneys’ fees. This is in addition
to reimbursing plaintiffs for general litigation costs. It costs $400 for a plaintiff to file a FOIA suit
in the District of Columbia, the court system that handles the lion’s share of FOIA litigation.225
     In terms of agencies, the DOJ shoulders the largest litigation burden by far. In FY2012, its
litigation costs were 55% of all litigation costs. This is not simply because the DOJ handles all
of the litigation for federal agencies. In their Annual Reports, the majority of agencies report
litigation related costs. The DOJ also receives a large proportion of FOIA appeals; almost 30%
of appeals filed with the government in 2012 were lodged with the DOJ.226
     If the agency or requester is not satisfied with the lawsuit’s outcome, s/he may appeal to
the regional Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court may decline to
take the case. If so, the decision of the lower court stands.
     Litigation remains a popular and costly means of solving FOIA conflicts. Nonetheless, four
decades of FOIA litigation has provided much needed clarity for many of the statute’s ambi-
guities. Litigation has established that agencies must disclose segregable information.227 It has
mandated that agencies include a detailed index, now known as the Vaughn Index, describing
what records they have withheld and the reason for those withholdings.228 Litigation clarified
that corporations do not have “personal privacy” under exemption 7(C).229 It has enabled the
government to employ the Glomar response, which allows agencies to refuse to confirm or
deny the existence of a record.230

      FIGURE 1. FY 2012 Litigation Costs




          Litigation can make a noticeable difference in agency practice. For example, the 2011
      Milner case held that Exemption 2 was limited only to records relating to employee relations
      and human resources.231 The Navy attempted to use Exemption 2 to withhold information
      about the handling and treatment of explosives. The Supreme Court ruled that this was not the
      same as matters concerning personnel and employees. As a result of Milner, use of Exemp-
      tion 2 declined drastically, decreasing 62% from FY2010 to FY2011.232 For more information on
      key FOIA case law, please see Annex 3.
          As FOIA litigation is such a large part of implementing the legislation, at least one orga-
      nization has created a tool to help the public keep track of FOIA cases. The Transactional
      Records Access Clearinghouse’s (TRAC) FOIA Project allows users to create a chart of agen-
      cies’ and components’ FOIA litigation by filings, closing or pending lawsuits. 233 Users can
      also map cases and search cases by plaintiff, agency sued, judge’s name, district, docket and
      attorneys’ names.
          The government also keeps careful track of litigation outcomes. The DOJ’s Guide to
      the Freedom of Information Act is exceptionally comprehensive. The Guide contains nearly
      1000 pages of discussion on how litigation, OIP and DOJ Guidance, Executive Orders and
      Presidential Memoranda affect the way agencies should interpret and implement the FOIA.
          According to FOIA advocates, the litigation system is ripe for reform. Several prob-
      lems stem from the fact that the DOJ defends most of the agencies in their FOIA litigation.
      Following President Obama’s and AG Holder’s memoranda, there is no evidence available
      to suggest that the DOJ has, to date, declined to represent an agency in FOIA litigation.
      Interviewees criticize DOJ attorneys’ overreliance on the sued agency for information and
      their lack of familiarity with the request.234 Interviewees are also concerned about the lack of
      independent review and DOJ attorneys’ tendency to delay the litigation process.235 Ultimately,
      they point to a stark contrast between the DOJ’s repeated statements about commitment to
      open government and their actual actions in FOIA litigations.
          The DOJ currently represents the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a dispute with the
      National Security Archive over the CIA’s withholding of a 30-year old draft history of the 1961
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                     569




Bay of Pigs.236 One part of the five-part history was disclosed as part of the Kennedy Assas-
sination Records Act in 1998. The CIA gave the National Security Archive three parts after the
inception of litigation. It continues to withhold the part of the report that scrutinizes the CIA’s
actions during the Bay of Pigs.
     Some believe this is in direct contravention of the DOJ’s insistence that “[A]gencies must
keep in mind the President’s directive that records cannot be withheld merely to protect public
officials from embarrassment, or ‘because errors and failures might be revealed, or because
of speculative or abstract fears.’ Rather, agencies should only withhold records, or portions of
records, when they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by
one of the exemptions or when disclosure is prohibited by law.”237
     To fix the system, interviewees suggest a systematic litigation review. One prominent
litigator remarked that her organization is repeatedly litigating and winning the same issues; a
systematic litigation review could reveal these trends.238 On a macro level, she believes it would
also demonstrate that top DOJ Officials care about the current openness agenda.
     Such a review was last conducted under AG Reno. She required the DOJ to examine its
pending FOIA cases based on her new foreseeable harm standard. Under Reno’s standard, the
DOJ would only defend the use of an exemption in cases where the agency could reasonably
foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by the exemption. According to the
DOJ itself, the review resulted in greater disclosure and a “narrowing of the scope of records
and issues contested in the case.”239

4.9. EXECUTIVE ORDERS, PRESIDENTIAL AND ATTORNEY GENERAL
MEMORANDA
Executive Orders

Executive Orders (E.O.s) are directives from the President, often addressed to agencies, which
have the full force of the law when issued under valid legislative or constitutional authority and
properly published.240 E.O.s can be on a variety of topics from discrimination to national secu-
rity. Several Presidents have employed E.O.s to shape FOIA and to limit or expand the Act’s
influence on topics including business practices and national security.
      A newer Executive Order can supersede or amend an older one. National security classifi-
cation is an excellent example of this. Over a 21-year period, beginning in 1982, national secu-
rity classification has been addressed in four Executive Orders. President Ronald Reagan wrote
E.O. 12356, the first E.O. for national security classification, during the reawakened Cold War.241
The Clinton Administration’s E.O. 12958 revoked E.O. 12356.242 Then, E.O. 12958 was amended
by the George W. Bush Administration’s E.O. 13292.243 Finally, the Obama Administration’s E.O.
13526 revoked both E.O. 12598 and 13292.244
     Executive Orders are not without their challenges. Interviewees cited their unenforce-
ability as a major challenge.245 However, E.O.s can be exceptionally effective, especially when
narrowly tailored. Executive Order 12600 has been described as “the most significant amend-
ment to exemption 4.”246 E.O. 12600 requires agencies to alert submitters when a requester
has asked for records containing documents that the submitter has identified as confidential
business information.247
570                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      Presidential and Attorney General Memoranda

      In addition to issuing Executive Orders, the president may also release Presidential
      Memoranda. The two types of presidential instruments are very closely related in that they
      enjoy the full force of law if certain conditions are fulfilled; both are used to compel agency
      action.248 Cabinet officials may also release instruments with the power to establish new
      standards in the execution and implementation of legislation. In the case of the FOIA, several
      United States Attorneys General have issued memoranda and guidelines.
          The AG serves as both the head of the Department of Justice and the country’s chief law
      enforcement officer. The AG’s position at the DOJ is especially relevant for FOIA because of
      the DOJ’s paradoxical FOIA tasks. The DOJ’s Civil Division defends agencies against request-
      ers in FOIA litigation while OIP is charged with issuing guidance on agency compliance with
      the Act. In order to effectuate a larger policy change, AG Memoranda may accompany Presi-
      dential Memoranda. This trend was evident with President Clinton and AG Janet Reno, who
      simultaneously released FOIA memoranda on October 4, 1993.
          President Clinton called for a new commitment to the FOIA and its underlying principles
      of openness in his Memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies.249 He stressed
      that this commitment to openness could not be limited to simply responding to requests but
      should also include proactive disclosure.250 For her part, AG Reno’s memorandum immediately
      insisted on ensuring that a presumption of openness be applied in every disclosure deci-
      sion.251 More drastically, her memorandum repealed the litigation standard established in the
      DOJ’s 1981 Guidelines for FOIA litigation. Reno eliminated the DOJ practice of defending an
      agency’s withholding if there was “substantial legal basis” to do so.252 Instead, the presumption
      of disclosure would be applied in deciding whether or not to defend a decision.253 The new
      DOJ policy would only defend the use of an exemption if the agency “reasonably foresees that
      disclosure would be harmful.”254 Her memorandum also strongly encouraged FOIA officers to
      make discretionary disclosures.255
          The Clinton/Reno strategy was duplicated by President Obama and his AG, Eric Holder.
      President Obama wasted no time and he issued two memoranda on his first day in office: one
      on the FOIA and another on transparency and open government. The FOIA memorandum
      instructed, “in the face of doubt, openness prevails.”256 Information could not be kept from
      the public simply because of its potential to embarrass public officials, “speculative or abstract
      fears” or protection of the personal interests of Government officials.257 He then directed the
      AG to release new guidelines governing the FOIA. President Obama’s second instrument, the
      transparency and open government memorandum, discussed what government “should be”:
      transparent, participatory and collaborative.258 CSOs warmly welcomed these memoranda as
      signaling “a serious commitment to transparency and accountability in government.”259
          Three months later, AG Holder released the new FOIA guidelines via memorandum.
      The memo opened with the presumption of openness, cautioning that an agency should
      not withhold information just because it can do so legally and that agencies must consider
      partial disclosures when full disclosures are not possible.260 He reinstated the Reno standard of
      defending a withholding only if the “foreseeable harm” standard could be met or if disclosure
      was prohibited by law; he advised that DOJ attorneys take this standard into account regard-
      ing pending cases.261 However, he did not call for a systematic review of the DOJ’s practices in
      defending agencies’ decisions to withhold information, as AG Reno had done.
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                  571




    AG Holder also stated that the FOIA was everyone’s responsibility, not simply that of FOIA
staff. “Unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles,” wrote Holder, “have no place in ‘the new era of
open government’ that the President has proclaimed.”262 Finally the memorandum addressed
delays, encouraged proactive disclosure and reminded agencies of their obligation to use
tracking numbers as required by the OPEN Government Act of 2007.263

Agency Compliance with Executive and AG Memoranda

The history of Presidential directives and Attorney General Guidelines clearly demonstrates
inconsistencies in FOIA implementation and policy. With policies changing, sometimes drasti-
cally with each new administration, the effectiveness of these documents varies. A memoran-
dum written by AG John Ashcroft illustrates this problem perfectly. Shortly after the September
11th terrorist attacks, George W. Bush’s AG, John Ashcroft, issued a FOIA memorandum that
repealed several standards established in AG Reno’s memorandum. Ashcroft encouraged
agencies to release documents under FOIA only after they had thoroughly reviewed the
request in light of various exemptions; he assured agencies that the DOJ would defend them
in their refusals to disclose in the majority of cases.264 Response to the memorandum was fast
and furious with one journalist writing, “…without fanfare the attorney general simply quashed
the FOIA.”265
     Following the issuance of the Ashcroft Memorandum, the National Security Archive at the
George Washington University conducted an audit of 33 departments and agencies.266 Their
audit revealed that only 15% (five departments or agencies) widely disseminated the Ashcroft
memorandum and had “significant changes in regulations, guidance or training materials.”267
Eight (24%) carried out some implementation activities including disseminating the memo and
incorporating it into FOIA procedures and regulations.268 On the other hand, more than half
(52%) stated they were aware of and had disseminated the report but had made little change
in regulations, guidance or training materials to reflect the new policy.269 Three agencies (9%)
stated there was little to no dissemination of the memo and they had not implemented any
changes.270 Although concerns over this memo were not misplaced, agency inaction saved the
Act from being “quashed.”
     More than a decade later, agencies have demonstrated a similar reticence or inability to
adopt a different Executive policy. Many agencies have not changed their regulations to reflect
President Obama’s and AG Holder’s memoranda.271
     Federal regulations detail how the agency will execute the law. Under the FOIA, agencies
must create regulations concerning fees, the aggregation of certain records, multi-track pro-
cessing and expedited processing of records.272 The agency should notify the public and solicit
public comments before publishing the regulations.273 Failure to update regulations results in
agencies charging improper fees and then being sued over the discrepancy.274 While the DOJ
is supposed guide agencies’ compliance with the FOIA, including updating of regulations, it
also represents them during litigation. FOIA advocates regularly have noted this fundamental
tension in the DOJ’s roles in relation to the Act.
     The failure of a large number of agencies to incorporate the Obama-Holder principles in
their regulations may explain why agencies’ release rates have remained relatively flat since
2009; agencies have fully or partially released approximately 93%–94% of records processed
for exemptions.275 When the average requests processed percentages of the different
572                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      administrations are compared, Obama (94.7%) has a higher release average than both George
      W. Bush (93.2%) and Clinton (88.9%).276 However, a much larger portion of Obama’s average is
      partial releases, 50.3% compared to 30.4% for Bush and 16.5% for Clinton.277 Partial releases
      are a double-edged sword. While it is true the entire record has not been withheld, partial
      releases are sometimes employed to provide information that is not helpful to requestors but
      that increases overall disclosure numbers.278
            Nonetheless, OIP has noted several accomplishments in its summaries of the agency’s
      Chief FOIA Officer Reports. While only 52 agencies out of 94 reported having a system in place
      for discretionary disclosure in their 2010 report, that number increased to 97 out of 99 by the
      2012 report.279 Also, while the release rate of records screened for exemptions has changed
      little since 2009, that rate was only 60% in 2008.280
            Progress under the Obama Administration has been piecemeal. Government-wide
      improvements across agencies have been scarce due to inconsistent enforcement, staff turn-
      over, congressional inaction and uncertain funding.281 Slow FOIA progress under the Obama
      initiatives also bolsters interviewees’ contention that “there’s a bureaucratic imperative towards
      secrecy.”282 On the flip side, they argue that there is no firmly imbedded culture of openness.283
      Many interviewees also believe that the Obama administration has not followed up sufficiently
      on its transparency mandate because no one has “ownership” for the agenda.284 They sug-
      gest that a DOJ or White House official be designated to oversee the implementation of the
      administration’s open government efforts.285



      5. Agency Level Practices
      Relying on the public and the judiciary to enforce the FOIA has led to incomplete and uneven
      execution of the law. Some agencies carry out their duties under the FOIA better than oth-
      ers. In order to illustrate this point, this section of the case study will present information on
      the federal system overall and four departments and agencies within that system: the United
      States Department of Agriculture (USDA), DOJ, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
      National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

      5.1. LEADERSHIP
      The OPEN Government Act of 2007 required each agency to designate as Chief FOIA Officer
      (CFO) a senior official of the agency (at the Assistant Secretary or equivalent level). The CFO
      has agency-wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA and is
      tasked to: monitor implementation of the FOIA throughout the agency; keep the head of the
      agency, the chief legal officer of the agency, and the Attorney General appropriately informed
      of the agency’s performance in implementing FOIA in the agency; recommend to the head
      of the agency such adjustments to agency practices, policies, personnel, and funding as may
      be necessary to improve its implementation of this section. The CFOs are required to submit
      annual reports to the Attorney General.286

      5.2. HUMAN RESOURCES AND PERSONNEL
      During Fiscal Year (FY) 2012, the federal government employed 4,065 “full-time” FOIA staff
      government-wide.287 In this context, “full-time” refers to both full-time employees and the
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                       573




cumulative percentage of the time other staff spend on FOIA as part of their duties.288 This was
a marked decrease from FY2011, when the government employed 4,396 full time FOIA staff,289
breaking a steady growth trend, from FY2008 (3,691) to FY2011 (4,396).290 Much of the 2012
discrepancy is due to staff reductions at the Department of Defense (DOD), from 1035 to 719
in FY2012.291
    Despite the increase in staff between 2008 and 2011, a survey of FOIA professionals,
conducted by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), revealed that 54%
labeled lack of staffing as a “serious” or “very serious” problem.292 As one frustrated responder
wrote, “We don’t need to be told how and when to apply exemptions; we don’t need anyone
to explain the presumption of openness that has always existed under the FOIA. We need
staffing and funding.”293
    Most FOIA advocates believe that FOIA professionals have good intentions and do not act
with malice when they process requests. They see the problem as one of motivation and culture.
There is very little incentive to disclose documents that may be embarrassing, revealing or con-
troversial. As two interviewees noted, there is less potential for trouble if an employee withholds
and no reward if she or he discloses.294 The media is another consideration. As one interviewee
pointed out, while the press story of “they didn’t disclose this” has a limited shelf life, the “look
what we found out!” story can linger.295 Moreover, some interviewees believe there is a natural
government imperative toward secrecy and against transparency.296 They contend that no matter
what administration is in charge, the impulse to deny, rather than disclose, is ever present.
    There are several ways to foster a cultural change toward greater openness. One is for
top-level officials to adopt proper implementation of the FOIA as a priority. This includes
White House officials and agency CFOs and Directors. Interviewees believe that “buy-in” from
higher-ups can stimulate a shift in a department or agency.297 Two additional solutions that will
be explored below are (i) increasing public awareness so that requesters can hold agencies
accountable, and (ii) increasing agency FOIA staff training so that employees are applying the
presumption of openness.

5.3. TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS BUILDING ACTIVITIES
The public awareness and staff training activities of the USDA, DOJ, EPA and NARA are dis-
cussed briefly below. Regarding public awareness, all four of these entities have FOIA pages
where requesters can find information about filing a request. For training, all four were given
a green light for meeting the staff-training milestone in OIP’s latest assessment of the CFO’s
Annual Reports. Once again, their achievements echo a system-wide trend: 88 of 99 agencies
scored green on staff training.298

DOJ

The DOJ uses Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages to reach the public.299 Some of its social
media is targeted at FOIA requesters. For example, its YouTube page features a section called
“All About the Freedom of Information Act” which contains seventeen FOIA videos covering
everything from “What is the FOIA?” to “What is a consultation?”300 In addition, OIP operates
FOIAPost as a blog and on Twitter.301 The Office’s tweets include links to training details, blog
posts, the travel schedule of OIP’s Director and summaries of Court decisions.
     The DOJ is cognizant of the fact that, as the parent agency of OIP, it has a special responsi-
bility to the FOIA. Over a three-year period, OIP has conducted hundreds of training sessions,
574                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      conferences and seminars attended by thousands of federal employees and members of the
      public. It offers video-conference training for those unable to attend.302 Training descriptions,
      dates, locations and materials are available online.303 In 2012, OIP launched its Director’s Lec-
      ture Series and held three specialized sessions: “Focusing on FOIA Fundamentals,” “Achiev-
      ing FOIA Goals,” and “Tracking Agency Progress to Implement the FOIA Guidelines.”304
          The DOJ, through OIP, has sought out and maintained a fruitful relationship with the
      American Society of Access Professionals (ASAP). Founded in 1980, ASAP is a non-profit NGO
      that serves as a forum to bring FOIA and Privacy Act personnel together with the requester
      community.305 ASAP provides various training and educational programs for FOIA profession-
      als and the public. OIP’s training efforts earned it ASAP’s Director’s Award for Superior Public
      Service in December 2012.306
          OIP has also worked with OGIS to hold FOIA Roundtables on: Providing Records in
      Electronic Formats, Maximizing the Administrative Appeal Process, and FOIA Fees and Fee
      Waivers among other topics. FOIA Roundtables are open to the public and are publicized on
      both offices’ websites.

      NARA

      Like the DOJ, NARA uses social media to inform the public about its FOIA-related services.
      The agency operates Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages as well as a blog—NARAtions,
      the blog of the United States National Archives.307 NARA’s YouTube site features videos for its
      Media Access to Government Information Conference (MAGIC).308 Beyond the general NARA
      sites, OGIS’s website provides resources for requesters and agencies including best practices,
      FOIA guides and links to FOIA focused civil society websites.309 OGIS also operates a blog
      that includes numerous entries on subjects that are highly relevant to the requester community
      and agencies.310
          OGIS’s trainings tend to focus on dispute resolution. In its first year, OGIS gave 43 presen-
      tations, 41 of which were attended by agencies, NGOs, academic groups, state organizations
      and international organizations.311 OGIS’s reports indicate that the Office has learned from its
      previous experiences. Noticing that agencies were more likely to work with OGIS via informal
      mediation, it focused its trainings less on mediation and more on techniques to improve cus-
      tomer service/communication.312 In 2011, OGIS began offering agency-specific dispute resolu-
      tion training.313 That year, the Office partnered with civil society and the media to conduct
      trainings and seminars including at a National Public Radio (NPR) staff training, the American
      Bar Association (ABA) Annual Meeting and Sunshine Week activities.314
          OGIS also enjoys a close relationship with ASAP. Its first year, the ombudsman worked
      with ASAP to hold orientation sessions to familiarize FOIA liaisons with OGIS.315 In 2013,
      OGIS’s Director was awarded ASAP’s highest honor: the President’s Award for Distinguished
      Public Service.316

      EPA

      Unlike the DOJ, OIP, NARA and OGIS, the EPA does not have much information about the
      FOIA on its Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.317 A search for FOIA-related discussions on
      the EPA’s Blog, Greenversations, revealed a post on MyPropertyInfo, which will be discussed in
      the subsequent section on proactive disclosure.318
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                  575




    The EPA has lauded its “robust” training program for employees whose primary duties
are to handle FOIA requests or who require general FOIA training.319 In its most recent CFO
report, the EPA describes a plethora of trainings and meetings including: attendance at
DOJ, NARA and ASAP trainings; conducting a fall training for FOIA coordinators and Offi-
cers attended by 450 staff from twelve departments and agencies; holding monthly meetings
between FOIA Officers and FOIA Coordinators to provide guidance and give updates; and
holding monthly meetings between the Office of General Counsel, regional FOIA counterparts
and EPA professionals.320
    Beyond training, the EPA has demonstrated a willingness to disseminate and execute the
President’s and AG’s Guidelines. In 2010, Regional FOIA officers and FOIA Coordinators met
on a monthly basis to discuss new FOIA Guidelines. 321 In 2012, the EPA convened a Freedom
of Information Act Workgroup to examine the EPA’s administration of FOIA. The Workgroup
was challenged to determine what the agency could do to “increase openness, transparency
and accountability.322 The Workgroup revealed that some EPA employees lacked even a basic
understanding of the FOIA; it recommended that the agency institute mandatory annual FOIA
training for all of its employees.323

USDA

The USDA’s use of social media to connect with FOIA requesters is similar to that of
the EPA. Like all of the aforementioned agencies, the USDA has Facebook, Twitter and
YouTube pages.324 It also has a blog.325 The USDA has used this blog to publicize proactive
disclosure activities.326
    In its CFO Report, the USDA notes that its employees have consistently attended DOJ
trainings; they have also conducted various FOIA trainings for their own staff.327 In 2011, USDA
employees participated in an eclectic mix of seminars including: “Freedom of Information Act
for Attorneys and Access Professionals,” “Overview of the Privacy Act,” “FOIA Fee Summit
and FOIA Exemption 2 Briefing after the Supreme Court’s Ruling in Milner v. Department of
the Navy.”328 Employees also attended a brown bag session with OGIS.329
    The USDA has looked inward to examine its own challenges in implementing the FOIA. On
January 6, 2012, USDA created a USDA-wide internal FOIA Council to provide a “centralized
forum” for the USDA’s FOIA community. Its goals include streamlining inter and intra agency
FOIA operations, strengthening the USDA’s FOIA regulations, policies and procedures, provid-
ing internal FOIA training and announcing DOJ, OGIS and other external training opportuni-
ties.330 The Council meets monthly, while its subcommittees meet every week or fortnight.331


5.4. RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
DOJ

The DOJ’s Annual Report for FY 2012 states that the agency’s processing times average
18.93 days for simple requests, 100.21 days for complex requests and 189.79 days for expe-
dited requests.332 The DOJ’s processing time for simple requests falls just under the 20-day
limit imposed by FOIA.
    The DOJ released information and records, either partially or fully, in response to approxi-
mately 57% of the requests it received. It did not rely heavily on exemptions, invoking them in
576                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      FIGURE 2. Disposition of Processed Requests (DOJ)




      response to only 3% of requests. The DOJ denied a large portion of requests because it could
      not locate responsive records. The disposition of all processed requests is shown in figures 2
      and 3.333

      NARA

      NARA’s Annual Report for FY 2012 states that the agency’s processing times average 57.5 days
      for simple requests, 917 days for complex requests and 10 days for expedited requests.334
      NARA’s average processing time for simple requests exceeds FOIA’s 20-day deadline by more
      than 30 days. NARA’s processing times are extreme: its 917 day average for processing com-
      plex requests is exceptionally high while its 10-day average for processing expedited requests
      is quite low.
           Of the four agencies and departments discussed in this case study, NARA has the low-
      est release rate: it discloses information in response to approximately 15% of the requests
      it receives. However, it should be noted that in the overwhelming majority of cases, NARA
      denied the request because it could not locate responsive records. The agency rarely relies
      on exemptions and invokes them less; it does so in response to less than 1% of requests. The
      disposition of all processed requests is shown in figures 4 and 5.335

      EPA

      The EPA’s Annual Report for FY 2012 states that the agency’s processing times average
      16.93 days for simple requests, 45.91 days for complex requests and 111.8 days for expedited
      requests.336 The EPA met the FOIA standard for processing simple requests in less than 20 days.
           The EPA released records, either partially or fully, in response to approximately 58% of the
      requests it received. It invoked exemptions for 7 percent of the requests, just shy of its percent-
      age for partial release of records. A large portion of requests were denied because no records
      could be located that fulfilled the request. The disposition of all processed requests is shown
      in figures 6 and 7.337

      USDA

      The USDA’s Annual Report for fiscal year 2012 states that the agency’s processing times
      average 31.9 days for simple requests, 83.33 days for complex requests and 24.89 days for
      expedited requests.338 The USDA exceeds the FOIA’s 20-day processing limit by more than
      10 working days.
          Of the agencies and departments featured in this case study, the USDA has the highest
      release rate. The agency released records, either partially or fully, in response to approximately
      86% of the requests it received. It also relied on exemptions sparingly compared to the other
      agencies discussed in this section. The disposition of all processed requests is shown in
      figures 8 and 9.339

Administrative Appeals are a substantial part of the FOIA process for agencies:

           Depending on the agency, appeals can be dispatched to agencies in a number of ways.
      Many agencies can receive appeals via post, fax, email and/or online portals. Agency staff
      reviews appeals. They decide whether to fully or partially uphold, or reverse the agency’s initial
      determination. The background of the staff engaged in appeals reviews varies. For example,
      at the DOJ, only OIP attorneys process FOIA appeals. 341 This is unique. Most agencies do not
      require staff to have a legal background to process appeals.
           It is advisable for requesters to check with the agency to determine the deadline and the
      appeals process, as time limits for filing the appeal vary, with many deadlines falling between
      30 and 60 days. Most agencies have resources to assist requesters in filing their appeals. Some
      agencies’ guides advise requesters on the administrative appeals process and the best way to
      file an appeal. Many, including the USDA, DOJ, EPA and NARA, publish an online FOIA Refer-
      ence Guide.342
       • USDA—Requesters have 45 days from the date of the initial denial letter to file an appeal.
         The Department’s Reference Guide does not advise requesters on how to file an appeal.
       • DOJ—OIP adjudicates the administrative appeals for most of the DOJ’s components. The
         DOJ has the longest appeals deadline. OIP must receive the appeal within 60 days of the
         initial determination letter. Requesters should state their grounds for appeal; they do not
         need to explain the reasons why they are appealing but the Guide mentions that such
         information may aid the adjudicator.343 There is no need to send any disclosed documents
         to OIP unless the appeal is related to the documents. Requesters can submit their appeals
         via a portal on OIP’s website.344 In its guide, the DOJ recommends that requesters using
         the post write “Freedom of Information Appeal” on both their letter and the envelope.
         They further counsel all requesters to identify the component, include a request number (if
         given) and state the date of component action.
       • EPA—The EPA’s deadline is amongst the shortest. The agency must receive the appeal
         within 30 days of the denial letter’s date. The EPA advises the requester to include the
         original request’s tracking number, copies of the initial letter and the agency’s response
         and the reasons for the appeal. The agency also recommends that requesters engage
         in a little self-help. As an example, they suggest that if the reason for the appeal is that
         the requester believes there are additional records that the agency has not located, the
         requester should state why they think the records exist and where they believe the records
         may be located.
       • NARA—NARA requires appeals to be received within 35 days of the date on their denial
         letter. Like OIP, they advise the requester to mark “FOIA Appeal” on both the letter and
         the envelope. The FOIA Guide recommends that the requester explain why NARA should
         reverse their initial decision, why the requester believes the search was inadequate and/or
         why the requester believes that the records are subject to FOIA. The requester can include
         copies of any documents that were released in order to aid NARA in their decision.

 • Non-Governmental Entities—Various nonprofits and organizations also publish guides
   on how to submit FOIA appeals. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, who
   publish a comprehensive Federal FOIA Appeals Guide for journalists and other requesters,
   recommends that requesters take the following steps in their appeals:
   • Clearly state that this is a formal appeal to a denial pursuant to FOIA;
   • Summarize the request and the response received;
   • Attach all relevant correspondence from the initial request letter to the final adverse
     decision;
   • Provide current contact information;
   • Express a willingness to resolve the dispute; and
   • State that a response is expected within 20 days as required by the FOIA.345

   To aid requesters, the Reporters Committee provides an appeal letter template on their
website including sample letters based on the exemptions cited in the initial denial.346

Disposition of Appeals

Agencies tend to take much longer than the 20 days afforded by the statute to process their
administrative appeals as shown in figure 10.
    The USDA’s high average is due in part to the Food and Safety Inspection Service, which
took an average of 705 days to process administrative appeals.347
    Agencies tend to affirm their initial decision or close the appeal more often than they
partially or completely reverse.348 See figures 11 through 14.

    While NARA had the largest proportion of affirmed appeals compared to the other agen-
cies in this section, it should be noted that NARA also had the fewest number of appeals to
process. In addition, they did not close a single case for “other reasons.”

Reasons Given for Denials on Appeal

Exemptions, “no records,” “request withdrawn” and “other” were among the most commonly
cited reasons for partially or fully denied appeals. “Other” referred to a number of reasons
including that the agency had already performed an adequate search and untimely appeal.
    Agencies rely heavily on exemptions during the administrative appeals process. The
exemptions most often invoked by the DOJ were: Exemptions 6 (personal privacy), 7(C) (law
enforcement – personal privacy) and 7(E) (law enforcement technique and procedures).350
The USDA relied on Exemptions 3 (prohibited by other legislation), 6 and 7(B) (law enforce-
ment – right to a fair trial).351 The EPA used 4 (trade secrets), 5 (privileged agency information)
and 6 most often.352 NARA often withheld documents on appeal using Exemptions 1 (national
security), 5 and 6.353
    The way that agencies use exemptions in the Appeals process has been criticized. Some
requesters complain that the administrative appeals process is potentially misleading. They
point out that the initial denial and subsequent appeal often use a form letter that lists several
exemptions, which “may” apply to the request. This means that during the appeals process,
584                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      the requester is left somewhat in the dark as to the specific reasons for the withholding.
      This also becomes relevant in litigation. If the request for records is partially or fully denied
      in the appeal, the agency must alert the requester of the right to judicial review. Many of
      the exemptions cited in the form letters or listed in first denials are subsequently dropped
      upon litigation.
           In addition, simply citing an exemption is not necessarily helpful to requesters as they
      prepare their appeals. One interviewee wants agencies to explain their rationale when
      they redact a document as opposed to merely placing the exemption where the redac-
      tion occurred, “Such transparency would make it easier to understand why the records were
      redacted, force FOIA officers to have to defend their decisions, and help requesters to better
      file administrative appeals.”354
           Advocates believe there may be a better system for processing appeals that will reduce the
      need for litigation. They point to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP)
      as a model for moving the review of FOIA Appeals outside the involved agency, without litiga-
      tion (at least initially). ISCAP was established by E.O. 12958 in 1995; the Panel’s functions were
      amended slightly in 2009’s E.O. 13526. ISCAP was set up to:
       • decide on appeals by persons who have filed classification challenges;
       • approve, deny, or amend agency exemptions from automatic declassification;
       • decide on appeals by persons or entities who have filed requests for mandatory classifica-
         tion review; and
       • appropriately inform senior agency officials and the public of final Panel decisions on
         appeals.355

           Agencies must abide by the ISCAP’s decisions. FOIA advocates are impressed with the
      Panel’s record: ISCAP has partially or fully overturned more than 65% of federal classification
      decisions. It has then released these records on its website.356 Advocates believe that a FOIA
      panel, based on the ISCAP model, would help address core FOIA issues without tying up Dis-
      trict Courts’ time and resources.357


      5.6. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
      The collection, retention and preservation of federal records are not regulated by the FOIA.
      Instead, the Federal Records Act (FRA), a law nearly two decades older than the FOIA, governs
      records.358 Records are defined as:

         “all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary
         materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency
         of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction
         of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its
         legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, proce-
         dures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational
         value of data in them.”359

          The FRA instructs agency heads to create and preserve records that adequately document
      the “organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the
      agency.”360
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                   585




     Part of the challenge of records management is the “records” themselves. A Congres-
sional Research Service report explains that a record can be “a sheet of paper, several linear
feet of paper, a map, a digital document, a vast database, or a VHS videocassette”; each
requiring specific archival protocols.361 Adding to the difficulty, most federal records are now
“born digital” and use many types of technology and platforms.362 Increased use of electronic
records requires agencies to take additional steps to ensure that the records they produce are
authentic, trustworthy, accurate, usable, stored properly and protected from corruption and/or
destruction.363 As a result, federal agencies have struggled to fully comply with the FRA.
     Under the FRA, agencies and departments must cooperate with the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) and NARA to apply “standards, procedures, and techniques” designed to
improve records management, promote the maintenance and security of appropriate records,
and facilitate the segregation and disposal of records with temporary value.364
     NARA provides oversight and guidance for records management. Every agency’s records
schedules must be approved by NARA. These schedules identify records as temporary or
permanent and describe instructions for the disposition of records when the agency no longer
requires them. Disposition refers to the action taken for records that are not currently needed;
it encompasses both the transfer of permanent records to the National Archives for preser-
vation and a schedule for destruction of temporary records . No records may be destroyed
without the authorization of the Archivist of the United States.
     The Archives also issues the General Records Schedules (GRS), which authorize the dis-
posal of common temporary administrative records, without further approval. Regrettably, until
very recently, NARA had instructed agencies that they could treat email under a GRS, which
has resulted in 20 years of chaos and in lost email records that should have been permanently
preserved. Based on the agency self-assessments (discussed below) that revealed high risk in
agencies of improper destruction of electronic records, NARA issued in September 2013 Bulle-
tin 2013-03, Guidance for agency employees on the management of Federal records, including
email accounts, and the protection of Federal records from unauthorized removal.365 The Bul-
letin reaffirmed that emails can be federal records. It also clarified employees’ record-keeping
responsibility when using personal email or more than one federal email address.
     The current Archivist, David Ferreiro, was aware that many agencies have had incomplete
(at best) compliance with the FRA and with NARA guidance, particularly regarding electronic
records. Thus, in 2009, NARA dispensed its first mandatory records management self-assessment
to 242 agencies and their components with the goal of compiling data to determine agencies’
compliance with records management statutory and regulatory requirements.366 On a scale from
0 to 100, NARA categorized agencies as having a low (90–100), moderate (60–89) or high level
(59 and below) risk of improper disposition of records.367


                                % Low Risk      % Moderate Risk       % High Risk
             2009                   21                 43                 36
             2010                    5                 NA                 NA
             2011                   10                 45                 45


     The evaluation was based on five categories: program management, records disposition,
vital records, electronic records and email records. The first four of these would be included in
all subsequent reports, with additional categories varying by year.

           In 2010, NARA attributed the difference in the percentage of low risk agencies between
      2009 and 2010 as a reflection of “changes in the nature and number of the questions” as 2010
      included a larger number of questions and more multiple-choice questions.368 However, while
      the percentage of low risk agencies doubled from 2010 to 2011, the percentage of moderate
      and high-risk agencies has remained relatively steady.
           Moreover, several problems were mentioned in more than one report, namely the lack
      of records management resources, a policy of printing out and filing emails as a means of
      preserving them, a belief that compliance monitoring was the IT staff’s responsibility, lack of
      an established performance metrics (a way of reporting on a program’s process), and lack of
      senior level training.
           Compliance with the FRA is mixed for the agencies we have highlighted for this case study.
      In its 2011 report, the last time that NARA included aggregate scores in their evaluation, the
      risk averages were DOJ: 56, EPA: 75, NARA: 46 and USDA: 52.369 The agencies’ and depart-
      ments’ poor performances were reflective of the entire federal system; that year not a single
      agency’s or department’s averages placed them in the low risk category.
           The most recent report only includes the averages for the EPA: 93 and NARA: 70.370 The
      manually tabulated averages for the DOJ and USDA were 80.75 and 87.25 respectively. While
      only the EPA is considered “low” risk, each agency markedly improved their averages.

      Records Management, Open Government and the FOIA

      In his November 28, 2011 Presidential Memorandum on managing government records,
      President Obama noted that improving records management has several benefits: improved
      performance, promotion of openness and accountability, preservation of records for the enjoy-
      ment of future generations, cost minimization and more efficient operations. 371 Properly man-
      aged records, he wrote, are “the backbone of open Government.”372
           In accordance with the FRA and the President’s Managing Government Records memoran-
      dum, OMB and NARA issued a Records Management Directive in 2011 to assist agencies with
      their records management. The Directive set two goals: to require electronic records-keeping
      to ensure transparency, efficiency and accountability; and to demonstrate compliance with
      federal records management statutes and regulations.
           In order to realize the first goal, agencies were instructed to meet two targets: 1) manage
      all permanent electronic records in an electronic format by 2019; and 2) manage both perma-
      nent and temporary emails in an accessible electronic format by 2016.373 Beginning one year
      after the date of the directive, agencies were required to report their progress to NARA and
      OMB on an annual basis.374
           In order to accomplish the second goal, agencies were required to designate a Senior
      Agency Official (SAO) whose responsibility it is to oversee a review of the agency’s records
      management system.375 OMB, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and NARA also
      set benchmarks for themselves to assist agencies including an overhaul of the GRS by
      December 31, 2017. 376
           Records management problems are at the core of some of the requester community’s
      greatest criticism of agencies’ FOIA implementation. One issue is preservation of records that
      might be responsive to a FOIA request when the records have been legally scheduled for
      destruction. In July 2013, OIP and OGIS sponsored a FOIA Roundtable on Electronic Records.
      The directors of both offices attended along with agency employees, frequent requesters and
      private industry. Frequent requesters protested the agency practice of destroying documents
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                   587




before a FOIA request could be filed. They described filing timely requests for records and
explicitly stating the time sensitive nature of the records, only to have those records destroyed
before the request could be acted upon due to backlog issues.377
     NARA and OIP officials responded that: agencies should be conducting a cursory review
when they receive a request to determine if there are time-associated materials relevant to
the request;378 and the FOIA analyst should communicate with the records employees. Several
agencies’ protocols for these types of requests were shared: the Department of Transporta-
tion’s (DOT) Office of the Secretary of Transportation sends an immediate request to the
location where they believe the records may be located so that the record can be flagged
and pulled;379 and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), some of whose records have
a very short shelf life, has knowledgeable analysts who attempt to get the records as soon
as possible.380
     While not necessarily indicative of general agency practice, the DOT Office of the Sec-
retary of Transportation and FAA’s protocols for time sensitive records are good practice.
They reflect good communication. FOIA advocates contend that this is not the case for many
agencies where FOIA personnel have little to no contact with records management personnel.
This means that agencies are not especially aware of their ability to locate electronic messages
like emails.
     For the requester community, the preservation of emails is a particular concern. In an
August 2013 bulletin, NARA introduced an approach known as “Capstone,” an email manage-
ment system (but not a particular technology or software program), which permits agencies
to automatically capture records from top officials’ accounts that should be preserved.381 The
approach allows agencies to designate the email accounts of other employees who are likely
to create or receive email records that should be permanently preserved. With Capstone,
users would no longer have to print out and file emails, which remains a popular, if ineffective,
way of creating an official email record. According to NARA, Capstone provides some other
advantages: optimizing access to federal records responsive for discovery of FOIA requests;
preserving permanent email records that are to be transferred to NARA; and reducing the risk
of unauthorized destruction of email.382, 383
     NARA is clear that there also are risks associated with Capstone, however. Agencies must
choose the appropriate Capstone accounts and should be aware that personal and non-record
email may be collected and will have to be dealt with. This raises questions as to whether end
users will be permitted to delete certain personal emails or non-records from their account
and, if so, how that will be appropriately accomplished.384
     For the most part, civil society has applauded NARA’s recent records management efforts,
due in large part to the new Archivist. Advocates are especially optimistic about Capstone.385
While agencies are not required to use Capstone, FOIA advocates hope they will do so.386

5.7. BUDGET
There is no specific line item for the FOIA in agencies’ budgets. Instead, the FOIA is funded
from agencies’ administrative budgets. FOIA advocates are split on whether this is a benefit or
a detriment.
    Advocates who believe that FOIA funding should remain undefined fear that a line item
would make the FOIA more vulnerable to budget cuts. As one interviewee mused, “I can
just see members of Congress saying ‘Of course public information is important but is it as
important as health care? Or veterans’ benefits? Or food stamps?’ And the answer for all of the
588                                           RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      constituencies of those various programs is: No, it’s not. To the academic, abstract question,
      ‘Do you believe in transparency and FOIA?’ everybody says yes. ‘Do you think it should take
      funds away from my program?’ The answer is no.”387
          Others argue that the reality is that the FOIA is a government-wide statutory requirement
      on agencies that they cannot refuse to fund or to fulfill. So, a line item might provide clarity
      on how an agency prioritizes meeting this obligation. Some advocates believe that agen-
      cies should request a specific amount of money for the FOIA in order to create a baseline for
      appropriations.388 This way, the FOIA would not need to compete with other administrative
      activities for funds from a general pot.
          The cost to administer the FOIA depends on the agency. Regardless of the expenditures,
      agencies cannot depend on FOIA fees to offset costs. The quantity of fees collected is always
      dwarfed by processing and litigation costs. In any case, as previously mentioned, agencies do
      not keep their FOIA fees.
          For the agencies and departments we have focused on in this case study, FOIA administra-
      tion costs and fees vary a great deal:

                            DOJ389       USDA390           NARA391         EPA392        All Agencies393

         Although there is no consensus on how to handle the budgeting issue, FOIA advocates and
      agency employees cite limited resources as a serious obstacle to effective FOIA implementation.394



      6. Capacity and Influence of Civil Society
      In the United States, politicians solicit and receive guidance from a variety of sources.
      Advocates, corporations and constituents lobby representatives; some even provide sug-
      gested legislative language. Congress often calls FOIA experts to testify in hearings in order
      to illustrate why reforms are (or are not) necessary and to participate in meetings. Civil soci-
      ety engagement in the creation, implementation and strengthening of the FOIA primarily
      has involved organizations representing the news media and a wide range of organizations
      focused on good government and government accountability. These organizations frequently
      work together both to promote improvements to the FOIA and to block legislation that would
      expand the types of information agencies are allowed to withhold from the public.
           To date, CSOs have achieved many successes in their bid to strengthen the FOIA. As noted
      in the previous section, advocates blocked the DOJ’s attempt to include misrepresentation
      in its regulations. They have also heavily influenced the content of several pieces of legisla-
      tion, including the creation of OGIS in the most recent comprehensive FOIA amendments.
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                      589




Moreover, CSOs continuously endeavor to raise public and Congressional awareness of trans-
parency issues and build support for the FOIA. For example, each year, groups sponsor events
and release reports during Sunshine Week, a national initiative coordinated by Reporters Com-
mittee for Freedom of the Press and the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE).

6.1. CIVIL SOCIETY AND CONGRESS
Representatives of CSOs were heavily involved in the FOIA’s last comprehensive amendment,
the OPEN Government Act of 2007. Advocates who collaborated with Congress persisted
in expressing their desire for a FOIA Ombudsman, which had become a distinct possibil-
ity and had interest from the key congressional offices. Tom Curley, President and CEO of
the Associated Press represented the Sunshine in Government Initiative when he testified
in support of the early version of the bill authored by Senators Leahy and Cornyn. He noted
the FOIA’s weak enforcement, long processing times and the agency practice of releasing
documents just before a judgment (which, as noted previously, served to deny the award of
attorneys’ fees to requesters). Curley asserted that a strong FOIA ombudsman was a legislative
priority for the entities he represented.395 Following the bill’s passage and OGIS’s creation, civil
society was successful in lobbying to keep OGIS funded under NARA.


6.2. CIVIL SOCIETY AS A WATCHDOG
Beyond lending support to the Act’s inception and amendments, civil society has acted as a
FOIA watchdog. Advocates are alert to actions that may affect the scope and usefulness of the
Act. In 2011, the DOJ attempted to include the right to mislead requesters about the pres-
ence of a record in its regulations. The ACLU, CREW and OpentheGovernment.Org wrote an
eleven-page letter to OIP. These groups urged the DOJ to abandon the proposed section,
“because the new rule is antithetical to the transparency goals of FOIA, because it authorizes
actual false public statements by the government, and because [it] will distort the judicial
review process.”396
    The provision in the DOJ’s regulations also outraged Members of Congress. In his letter
to AG Holder, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley noted that he
shared concerns of these “institutional FOIA requesters” and stated that the proposed section
“stands in stark contrast to both the President’s and your prior statements about FOIA, trans-
parency, and open government.”397 These efforts influenced the DOJ’s decision to reconsider
the controversial provision. In their response to Senator Grassley, the DOJ remarked that they
had received a “number of comments” on their proposed regulations and that the section
in question fell short of the Department’s transparency goals; they stated that this provision
would not be included when the Department issues their final regulations.398
    Legislators depend on civil society to sound the alarm when a bill has already been passed
but implementation has been poor or stalled. The George Washington University’s National
Security Archives conducts numerous audits of FOIA implementation. Legislators, the AG and
other FOIA advocates have cited their studies. The Archive’s work has also directly influenced
agency behavior. For example, a metric they created to solicit the “ten oldest requests” from
agencies has been subsequently adopted by agencies to help identify their backlogs.399 Sena-
tor Patrick Leahy cited one of the Archive’s recent audits when he pressed for improved FOIA
implementation: “The audit released today by the National Security Archive makes clear that
the overwhelming majority of federal agencies are neither fulfilling the President’s promise of
590                                          RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      an open and transparent government for the American people, nor complying with the vital
      reforms to the FOIA process that Congress demanded by enacting the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN
      Government Act.”400
          Senator Leahy, Senator Cornyn and their staffs are strong proponents of the FOIA. As a
      result, CSOs have enjoyed a long and productive relationship with these offices. The groups
      work together on legislation; they highlight problems and stimulate discussions. One inter-
      viewee described the process of working with politicians for whom the FOIA is a top priority.401
      First, there is a mutual cultivation of the relationship; FOIA advocates and legislators’ staffs
      seek one another out and establish a rapport. Then, when a bill is proposed, the deal making
      begins. Advocates send the legislative staff a wish list and may draft provisions to reflect their
      aspirations. The legislative staff work with the Member on a draft a bill, which often includes
      part of civil society’s wish list. The legislator presenting the bill will get a response, and fre-
      quently pushback, from the administration and agencies on the proposed legislation. At that
      point, the staff will reach out to civil society for a response. According to the interviewee, this
      collaborative process is simply common sense because, “the FOIA was written to serve the
      interests of the people so it’s natural to hear from the public.”402

      6.3. SUNSHINE WEEK
      In 2002, the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors (FSNE) launched Sunshine Sunday in
      response to Florida legislators’ attempt to add new exemptions to the State’s information
      law.403 The FSNE held three Sunshine Sundays, during which they increased legislative and
      public awareness of the proposed exemptions. They estimated that at least 300 exemptions
      were defeated as a result.
          After several States started their own Sunshine activities, the ASNE launched the national
      Sunshine Week in 2005. Sunshine Week is a non-profit and non-partisan event held in mid-
      March every year to coincide with President James Madison’s birthday. Madison famously
      opined, “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it,
      is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern
      ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the
      power which knowledge gives.”404
          The goal of Sunshine Week is to realize the spirit of Madison’s words by increasing public
      awareness and encouraging individuals to become actively involved with the government.405
      Over this week, media, politicians, non-profits, libraries, universities and others interested in
      open government participate in various events. Participants can attend conferences, tutori-
      als and panel discussions. CSOs seize the opportunity to release reports, write editorials and
      appear on the news to discuss pressing transparency and FOIA issues.

      6.4. LEVERAGING FOIA
      In addition to shaping the content and implementation of the FOIA, CSOs also use the Act to
      reveal government and private misdeeds. A few examples include:
       • CREW used the FOIA to gather tax returns of “dark money groups” that spend hundreds
         of millions of dollars in elections without disclosing donor identities.406
       • The ACLU utilized the FOIA to expose the FBI’s practice of targeting certain communities
         for investigation based on their race, religion and nationality.407
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                   591




 • ProPublica uncovered records via the FOIA that revealed a glaring disparity in Presidential
   Pardons. The documents showed that, even when the crimes were comparable, whites
   were four times more likely than minorities to receive a Presidential pardon.408
 • The Center for Public Integrity’s iWatch News and National Public Radio used the FOIA
   to publish the EPA’s internal Clean Air Act watch list of “serious and chronic violators of
   the Act.”409

    In fact, much of the litigation that CSOs engage in is over disputes for records, like these,
that they hope will reveal information of interest to the public.


6.5. MEDIA
It is impossible to discuss civil society’s influence on the FOIA without examining the media’s
relationship role in establishing, supporting and utilizing the Act. As mentioned previously,
the media heavily advocated for the FOIA. One of the FOIA’s architects was a journalist turned
attorney. Dr. Harold L. Cross was serving as legal counsel to the ASNE when he penned “The
People’s Right to Know: Legal Access to Public Records and Proceedings.”410 This 1953 book
is widely viewed as the blueprint for the FOIA. Congress gave Dr. Cross credit for “provid-
ing broad outlines for legislative action to guarantee public access to government informa-
tion.”411 Even after Cross provided a plan for the FOIA and Congress approved it, the press
was needed to convince President Johnson to sign the Act. Only last minute calls from several
newspaper editors convinced Johnson to sign the FOIA.412
      Like other FOIA advocates, the media is often galvanized to push for legislative action.
When President Ford vetoed the 1974 amendments, a maelstrom of editorials and articles
followed. Members of Congress read some of these editorials into the Congressional
Record, in order to build support for overriding the veto. The editors’ and journalists’ lively
words contributed to the debate and reflected some of the public’s disappointment in
President Ford:
 • Detroit Free Press. October 26, 1974 “Ford Lapses on Promise to Open Up Government”:
   “The president said he would submit proposals of his own to Congress. We hope he will
   do so, and soon, for there are good reasons otherwise why Congress should try to override
   this veto. While it is true that newsmen and newswomen are among those who have been
   pressing for passage of the amendments, all of the public has a stake in them.”413
 • Charlotte Observer, October 28, 1974 “Keep it Secret—This Veto Does Just That”: “Take
   away Linus’s blanket and this unusually mild mannered inhabitant of the Peanuts Comic
   Strip becomes a tiger. Bureaucrats sometimes react similarly when someone threatens to
   take away their precious ‘top secret’ classification stamps. In their effort to keep informa-
   tion from the people, they now have received a boost from President Ford.”414

    While many automatically associate the media with the FOIA (and vice versa), the last
available non-governmental audit reveals that only about 6% of requesters are representatives
of the media.415 Federal agencies do not have readily available statistics on who makes FOIA
requests. One could potentially determine the proportion of media requests by examining fee
waiver statistics. However, as these data are not required by Congress or the DOJ, many agen-
cies do not compile them. Instead, those who are curious about this information may review
the FOIA logs of individual agency components.416
592                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




          Despite this 6% figure, the media’s relationship with the FOIA attracts a great deal of atten-
      tion. Interviewees cited fear of media exposure as one of the contributing factors to persistent
      bureaucratic secrecy.417 The public associates the FOIA with unearthing and dispensing infor-
      mation about the government. Journalists also use their trade to discuss the pitfalls of FOIA
      implementation. Three standouts in both regards are the Associated Press, National Public
      Radio and ProPublica.

      The Associated Press

      For the Associated Press (“AP”), FOIA is a means of ensuring that the public has access to the
      information it has a right to know.418 The AP identifies itself as an aggressive advocate of gov-
      ernment transparency and accountability. Their reporters, editors and counsel take three key
      actions as they utilize and defend the FOIA:

      1. Assert relevant rights under federal and state constitutions and Freedom of Information
         laws to obtain access to news—going to court, if necessary, to enforce those rights;

      2. Monitor compliance by government agencies and officials with FOI laws and report infrac-
         tions and shortcomings; and

      3. Defend the statutory and constitutional rights of journalists to do their work free of govern-
         ment interference or intrusion.419

          The AP conducts both internal and external FOIA training; they have advocated for
      strengthening the FOIA and have engaged OGIS for certain appeals denied by agencies. Of
      course, the AP has also broken several key stories using the FOIA:
       • By examining and analyzing more than 5,600 data elements, the AP concluded that the
         Obama Administration had markedly increased its use of the national security exemption
         to withhold documents.420
       • Several months after Hurricane Katrina, the AP wrote about an Army Corps of Engineers
         list, which revealed that 122 levees were in jeopardy of failing.421
       • Another of the AP’s FOIA requests uncovered videotaped briefings on Hurricane Katrina
         from August 28, 2006. In one of the briefings, the head of the National Hurricane Center
         informed the President that New Orleans’s levees were “a very, very grave concern.”422
         Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2006, decimating the levees. More than
         1,800 people lost their lives in the storm and subsequent flooding.
       • The DOD released 2,300 pages of testimony to the AP regarding the death of former
         professional football player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman. Tillman’s death was originally
         attributed to enemy fire but was later revealed to be the result of friendly fire.423


      National Public Radio

      National Public Radio’s (NPR) On The Media program is broadcast on more than 300 public
      radio stations.424 The program has won various awards for its investigative and feature report-

      and more than one Edward R. Murrow Award for outstanding contributions to public radio.425

ProPublica

Compared to the AP and NPR, ProPublica is a relatively new kid on the block. Established in
2007, the newsroom is a non-profit that focuses on investigative journalism, particularly those
stories in the public interest. The organization is funded via foundation and private donations.
ProPublica partners with traditional news organizations to publish its stories, free of charge.431
The newsroom won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting and the 2010 Pulitzer Prize
for Investigative Reporting.432 Both were the first time the prizes were awarded for non-print
(electronic) publications. In 2013, ProPublica’s partnership with NPR’s This American Life culmi-
nated in a Peabody Award.433
     In addition to its reporting, ProPublica has designed a (b)(3) statute tracking tool by com-
piling data from the Sunshine in Government Initiative.434 The tool tracks the use of (b)(3)s by
agencies; users can elect to narrow the list by agency or statute.435 The newsroom has pub-
lished stories about the FOIA and has used the Act in its investigative journalism:
 • Talking with the Former FOIA Czar: A conversation with former OIP Director
   Dan Metcalf.436
 • FOIA Eyes Only: How Buried Statutes Are Keeping Information Secret—a discussion of the
   b(3) exemption.437
 • Agencies Move to Restrict FOIA Access in Last Minute Regs. This story detailed various
   agencies’ efforts to make it more difficult to access records as the George W. Bush admin-
   istration wound down.438
 • Revealed: America’s Arms Sales to Bahrain Amid Bloody Crackdown. The DOD released
   records to ProPublica, following a FOIA request, on arms sales to Bahrain between
   February 2011 and February 2012.439
 • By the Numbers: A Revealing Look at the Mortgage Mod Meltdown. This series used
   previously unreleased records from the Treasury Department obtained via a FOIA request.
   It exposed how actions by the government, mortgage industry and the Home Affordable
   Modification Program led to precarious financial situations for homeowners.440

          Clearly the media’s relationship with the FOIA is not all sunshine. Journalists have very pre-
      dictable criticisms of the Act’s implementation. Slow processing times, overuse of exemptions
      and uneven application of fee waivers and expedition requests make it difficult for investiga-
      tive journalists to produce in-depth, timely pieces.441


      6.6. PRIVATE SECTOR
      The United States government arguably has the capacity to collect and report data on who is
      making FOIA requests. Agencies are not required, however, to report this information in any
      of their annual reports. Moreover, there is no standardized procedure for recording the “type”
      of requester. What one agency tags as a non-profit organization, another agency may tag
      as “other.”
          In order to get a general picture of who is making FOIA requests, an interested party
      would have to locate (or, in some cases, formally request), examine and analyze FOIA logs
      and other data from various agencies. To date, no individual or organization has compiled
      and examined the FOIA logs for every entity subject to the FOIA. Nonetheless, less detailed
      reviews have revealed that private industry’s use of the FOIA trumps that of the media, NGOs
      and individuals.
          The Coalition of Journalists for Open Government (CJOG) released one of the most
      comprehensive reviews of who is using FOIA. While the study was released some time ago, in
      2006, it provides valuable insight into who is likely using the FOIA. CJOG analyzed 6,439 FOIA
      requests to eleven cabinet agencies and six large agencies.442 The review revealed that more
      than 60% of requests came from those with commercial interests; of those, 25% were filed by
      professional data brokers working on behalf of clients.443 Approximately a third were filed by
      “other,” which CJOG interpreted as being composed primarily of private citizens.444 The final
      6% were media requests.445
          A recent study conducted by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) backs up CJOG’s conclusions.
      In 2013, the Wall Street Journal reviewed 100,000 FOIA requests filed over the past five years.
      Their review revealed that investors use FOIA to “troll for all kinds of information” that may aid
      them in making investment decisions.446 Hedge funds and third party organizations “increas-
      ingly” use FOIA in order to obtain important investment information.447 The paper noted that
      the EPA, Department of Energy and Securities and Exchange Commissions were all popular
      targets for investor requesters.448
          Some of these third party organizations are hired to obfuscate requesters’ identities. FOIA
      logs will often list the requester’s full name. One company, FOI Services Inc., made 10% of
      the 50,000 requests submitted to the Federal Drug Administration during the five-year period
      examined by the WSJ.449 The company’s Senior Vice admitted requesters often use their firm to
      “blind” their requests.
          Of course, private industry does not simply use the FOIA in order to increase profits. One
      interviewee remarked that corporations also use the FOIA to “learn how to obey the law
      better, how to keep government accountable for equal enforcement and to ensure that deci-
      sions that are made are based on a factual foundation.”450 He further explained that FOIA is
      good for business, remarking that, “Disclosure is good for competition. There is no question
      about that.”451
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                   595




7. Broader Political Environment
7.1. POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
In his long fight to establish the FOIA, Representative John Moss denounced efforts to frame
the issues in “the gaudy colors of partisan politics… Government information problems are
political problems—bipartisan or nonpartisan, public problems, political problems, but not
partisan problems.”452 The Democrat from California began to lobby for a right to know law
under the Eisenhower administration (Republican) and finally achieved success under the
Johnson administration (Democratic). For Moss, ensuring the public’s right to know was decid-
edly nonpartisan. For other politicians, this has not been the case. One interviewee observed
that while Moss was “evenhanded,” the FOIA is “often used by the opposition party to beat
the administration over the head.”453 Indeed, some politicians who support the FOIA while
another party occupies the White House then become less enamored of the law when a mem-
ber of their own party holds the Presidency.


Partisan Politics and the FOIA

Darrell Issa, a California Republican and Chair of the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform, is an example of how politicians can become zealous advocates for
transparency when a different party holds the White House. It is important to note that
Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat with a long history of support for trans-
parency and accountability, was also an ardent advocate in his role as Chair when George W.
Bush was president.
    Some form of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has existed
since 1816. In its role as the House of Representatives investigatory body, the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee has subpoena power and can compel the administration
to produce documents or employees for testimony. The Committee’s primary responsibility
is oversight “of virtually everything the government does.”454 The Committee’s jurisdiction
also includes legislative responsibility for the FOIA. Issa was appointed to the Commit-
tee in 2008 and became Chair in 2010, when Republicans gained a majority in the House of
Representatives.
     As the Chair, Issa is somewhat of a Chief Inquisitor who has enthusiastically taken the
Obama administration to task over a number of issues from the its response to the attacks on
the United States embassy in Benghazi to governmental transparency. Issa, in cooperation
with the Ranking Member of the Committee Elijah Cummings, demanded that OIP provide
the Committee with answers regarding FOIA implementation shortcomings. He has requested
FOIA logs and other data from 180 agencies in order to evaluate potential political interfer-
ence with the Act. He has ordered the testimony of various government employees related to
compliance with the FOIA.
    By nature, Issa’s position is arguably “political.” Some advocates believe his support of the
FOIA is political as well. Left-leaning news blog DailyKos has accused Issa of using the FOIA as
a “gambit to embarrass President Obama” and discussed Issa’s alleged silence when “Presi-
dent Bush made freedom of information the exception to the rule.” 455 ThinkProgress.Org, also
596                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      left-leaning, pointed to Issa’s support of a blanket expansion of the Department of Homeland
      Security’s (DHS) ability to withhold information under the FOIA.456 Nonetheless, some mem-
      bers of civil society have praised Issa for some of his work on transparency. Nate Jones of the
      National Security Archive welcomed Issa’s data investigation and was hopeful it would spark a
      bipartisan effort to improve FOIA implementation.457 The Project On Government Oversight
      (POGO) honored Issa with its Good Governance Award in 2010 for his “instrumental” role in
      “promoting government transparency and accountability.” 458

      Senators Leahy and Cornyn: A Bi-Partisan FOIA Partnership

      In addition to politicians like Issa, there are those who have been steadfast in their support
      of the FOIA, regardless of the administration in power. In the United States Senate, the FOIA
      is championed by the dynamic bipartisan duo of Patrick Leahy and John Cornyn. Leahy, a
      Democrat from Vermont and Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, have worked together on FOIA
      issues since 2005. They have written and sponsored several bills together including the OPEN
      Government Act of 2007.
           Both men serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senate Committees are bodies,
      organized by topic, that investigate, fact-find, build consensus and make recommendations.459
      The Judiciary Committee is one of the oldest and most prominent. It was founded in 1816 and
      is responsible for a plethora of tasks, including conducting pre-vote hearings on the nomina-
      tion of federal judges and DOJ oversight. Chairs share party affiliation with the Senate majority
      and are either the senior most member of the Committee (if a Democrat) or elected by secret
      ballot (if Republican).460 Leahy has served as its Chair on three separate occasions (2001,
      2001–2003 and 2007–Present). Through their Committee work both men have made speeches,
      solicited testimony from civil society advocates and sitting State Attorneys General, introduced
      legislation and kept the FOIA in the legislative spotlight.
           Senator Leahy has been committed to the FOIA since his election to the Senate nearly four
      decades ago in 1974. He has worked to curtail efforts to weaken the FOIA even when those
      efforts involve another committee or piece of legislation. Recently, Senator Leahy led an effort
      to stop an amendment to the Farm Bill that would have barred the disclosure of basic informa-
      tion about owners of livestock and agriculture operations.461
           It is relatively common for agencies and business interests to attempt to exempt certain
      information from public disclosure via another piece of legislation. Generally, these provi-
      sions do not directly modify the FOIA. Rather, they state “notwithstanding any other provision
      of law,” which has the effect of creating an exemption. Since they do not directly modify the
      FOIA, they are not sent to the Judiciary Committee in the Senate (or the House Commit-
      tee on Oversight and Government Reform) for review. As a result, FOIA advocates in civil
      society and the Congress must be especially attentive to language like the above or any
      reference to 5 USC 552 (the US Code citation for FOIA) in all bills, not simply those with a
      transparency agenda.
           The amendment eventually failed, as did the Farm Bill (for other reasons). Civil society
      groups praised Leahy for his attention to the matter, “Senator Leahy has repeatedly shown
      his commitment to defending FOIA on nitty-gritty issues, and we appreciate his commitment
      to government transparency and his staff’s hard work and responsiveness in defending the
      public’s right to know what its government is doing.” 462 Senator Leahy and his staff continue to
      lead the effort to stop the efforts to limit public access.
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    597




      Leahy’s partner in the FOIA, John Cornyn, was elected to the Senate in 2002. In the years
preceding his election, Cornyn served as Texas’s Attorney General. In that role, he was respon-
sible for enforcing the state’s Freedom of Information Act. Among the States’ FOIAs, Texas’s
is one of the country’s most robust. During his tenure as Texas’s AG, Cornyn was credited with
the Office’s “unprecedented” number of rulings, decreased processing times and establish-
ment of a statewide, toll-free, open-government hotline.463 Cornyn included FOIA in his plat-
form when he campaigned for Senate saying the law needed “teeth” to improve compliance
and that it should be extended to cover the legislative branch; he also openly disagreed with a
blanket exemption for the DHS proposed by the administration of his friend, President George
W. Bush.464 When Cornyn was elected to the Senate, he continued to advocate for greater
transparency, asserting, “I have long been looking forward to bringing a little of our Texas
sunshine to Washington.”465
      Both Senators have received individual honors and awards for their work with the FOIA.
They have also been recognized for their partnership. In 2005, POGO presented them with the
organization’s first Bi-Partisan Leadership Award. The Award is given to members of Con-
gress “who work together across the aisle to promote a more open, honest and accountable
government.” Leahy and Cornyn persistently work to frame the FOIA as a bi-partisan issue. As
they wrote in a joint Sunshine Week Op-ed, “As the recent legislative success with the OPEN
Government Act shows us, open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue.
It is an American value and a virtue that all Americans can embrace.”466 Civil society advocates
agree. They work often and eagerly with both Senators’ staffs. Nonetheless, the contentious
political climate in Washington DC during President Obama’s second term worries FOIA
advocates. They fear the environment has become so partisan that even a long established
bi-partisan partnership like Leahy and Cornyn’s may not be enough to pass legislation to
strengthen the FOIA.
      However, some look to turn the partisan environment to their advantage. For them,
partisan support for the FOIA is better than no support at all. One interviewee who worked
extensively with politicians on Capitol Hill remarked, “One of the things you learn when you’re
working on the Hill is you never ask questions of anyone who supports you. Because you can
use all of the help you can get for whatever reason.”467
      Legislation may not be enough to improve implementation without buy-in from the
administration in power. This, according to one interviewee is not “partisan politics” but rather,
bureaucracy.468 Professor David Vladeck supports this contention. Vladeck believes that a par-
ticular problem plagues all right to information laws, not just the FOIA. These laws are always
“subject to political manipulation by administrations that want to limit public access to govern-
ment held information.”469 Even administrations that vocally support the FOIA and increased
transparency have a difficult time keeping their promises. One interviewee remarked that she
had high hopes for the Obama administration, but she believes that the administration has
been unable to live up to the standards it has set because it ultimately realized that “transpar-
ency does not have a lot of rewards.”470

7.2. OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is an international effort to make governments more
transparent and collaborative. It grew out of a 2010 speech made by President Obama to the
United Nations General Assembly. OGP was launched in 2011 and has grown from 8 countries
598                                         RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      to 62 participating countries. In order to participate in OGP, governments must exhibit a dem-
      onstrated commitment to open government in four key areas including having an access to
      information law.

      National Action Plan

      The OGP initiative requires the delivery of a country action plan developed with public
      consultation. The first US National Action Plan (NAP) addressed three broad challenges
      (Increase Public Integrity, Manage Public Resources Effectively, and Improve Public Services)
      and included 26 concrete commitments to help achieve 17 larger goals. Those related to the
      U.S. FOIA were very modest: create a job series for FOIA professionals; and expand the use of
      technology for FOIA. They were modestly implemented.
          The Obama Administration has been much more ambitious in the second NAP. In terms of
      FOIA implementation, they have committed to steps they previously resisted, including to:
       • Improve the Customer Experience through a Consolidated Online FOIA Service. The
         Administration will launch a consolidated request portal that allows the public to submit
         a request to any Federal agency from a single website and includes additional tools to
         improve the customer experience. The U.S. Government will establish a FOIA task force
         that will review current practices, seek public input, and determine the best way to imple-
         ment this consolidated FOIA service.
       • Develop Common FOIA Regulations and Practices for Federal Agencies. Certain steps
         in the FOIA process are generally shared across Federal agencies. The Administration
         will initiate an interagency process to determine the feasibility and the potential content
         of a core FOIA regulation that is both applicable to all agencies and retains flexibility for
         agency-specific requirements.
       • Improve Internal Agency FOIA Processes. Over the past few years, several agencies have
         analyzed existing FOIA practices and used this information to make dramatic improve-
         ments in their backlogs and processing times, as well as to increase the proactive release
         of information in the public interest. The U.S. Government will scale these targeted efforts
         to improve the efficiency of agencies with the biggest backlogs, and to share lessons
         learned to further improve internal agency FOIA processes.
       • Establish a FOIA Modernization Advisory Committee. The United States will establish
         a formal FOIA Advisory Committee, comprised of government and non-governmental
         members of the FOIA community, to foster dialog between the Administration and the
         requester community, solicit public comments, and develop consensus recommendations
         for improving FOIA administration and proactive disclosures.

            If fully and appropriately implemented, these commitments could greatly improve the pub-
      lic’s experience with FOIA. They will not, however, directly address many of the problems with
      FOIA experienced by requesters. Some of these, such as the overuse of certain exemptions or
      the vagaries in the imposition of fees, may be addressed by the Advisory Committee.

8. Conclusion
The Freedom of Information Act is so imbedded in the collective American psyche that it is dif-
ficult to imagine the United States without the law. Indeed, a substantial part of the population
(those born after 1967) has never lived in a FOIA-free United States. Civil society and the media
deserve a great deal of credit for their persistent promotion, protection and use of the Act.
These efforts, combined with those of FOIA advocates in the United States Congress, have
strengthened the FOIA, which remains a powerful tool for promoting transparency.
    As one of the oldest right to information laws, the United States’ FOIA has served as a
model for other nations’ right to know legislation. Though an international survey placed it
near the middle of the pack when compared to newer laws, advocates do not believe that
the straight text of the Act is the most pressing issue for the FOIA. Rather, advocates pinpoint
implementation as the biggest challenge facing the FOIA, especially:
 • Lack of a universal FOIA portal;
 • Overuse of exemptions, particularly Exemptions 3 and 5;
 • Use of fees to discourage requests and reluctance to grant fee waivers to established non-
   profit and media organizations;
 • Processing delays;
 • Uneven application of President Obama’s Memorandum and the Attorney General’s
   Guidelines;
 • Lack of meaningful oversight;
 • An underfunded and understaffed Ombudsman;
 • Outdated FOIA regulations;
 • Poor records management;
 • Lack of sanctions for agencies and employees that wrongfully withhold records; and
 • Overreliance on litigation as a means of enforcing compliance with the FOIA.

     Unfortunately, perhaps the most difficult obstacle is the most abstract: culture. Many
interviewees believe that it will take a profound cultural change to significantly improve FOIA
implementation. Top-level officials, including the President, must lead the charge to change
the culture from one that defends secrecy to one that embraces transparency. Such promotion
would have to occur regardless of the potential embarrassment that might result from disclos-
ing information. The Obama Administration’s Open Government Initiative is a start, but more
is required for the FOIA to reach its full potential.

Annex 1. Methodology

This case study focuses on the right to information in the United States and is limited to the
implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. The Freedom of Information Act is the
United States’ most prominent and comprehensive right to know law. While another right to
information law—the Privacy Act—is mentioned briefly, it is limited in scope and not examined
in this case study.
    The study is based on extensive desk research of primary and secondary materials includ-
ing federal agency reports, Executive branch memoranda, newspaper articles, academic jour-
nals, non-governmental and media assessments and reports, and Congressional documents.
The study also draws on interviews with stakeholders and government officials.
     The study focuses on four institutions in order to illustrate agencies’ strengths and weak-
nesses in implementing the FOIA: the agency most closely aligned with oversight of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Office of Information Policy within the Department of Justice;
the ombudsman, the Office of Government Information Services within the National Archives
and Records Administration; the department responsible for agriculture oversight, The United
States Department of Agriculture; and the agency responsible for environmental oversight: the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Annex 3. Key FOIA Case Law

• EPA v. Mink (1973). Congresswoman Mink filed a FOIA request seeking information on
  scheduled underground nuclear tests. The EPA applied for summary judgment based on
  Exemptions 1 and 5. The Supreme Court held that agencies were required to disclose
  information that was severable and did not compromise the privacy of the other docu-
  ments. Mink provided the impetus for agencies’ separation and redaction of documents.
• Vaughn v. Rosen (1973). Professor Vaughn was conducting research on the Civil Service
  Commission. He filed a FOIA for evaluations of personnel management programs. The
  Director declined to disclose. The D.C. Court took note of a procedural problem with
  FOIA, namely the plaintiff’s lack of knowledge, which “seriously distorts the traditional
  adversary nature of our legal system’s form of dispute resolution. Ordinarily, the facts
  relevant to a dispute are more or less equally available to adverse parties.” The Court held
  that agencies must create an index that lists the withheld documents and explains why they
  are being withheld. This list is known as the Vaughn Index. Another case, Crooker v. Central
  Intelligence Agency, held that agencies are not required to create and furnish a Vaughn
  Index at the administrative level. The Vaughn Index remains a crucial element of FOIA
  litigation.
• Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC (1992). Critical Mass Energy Project requested reports
  held by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that were given to them by the Institute of
  Nuclear Power Operations with the caveat that they be treated as confidential. Reaffirming
  an earlier opinion, National Parks and Conservation Association v. Morton, the D.C. Court
  held that in order to be exempt, the information requested 1) “would customarily not
  be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained” and 2) Disclosure
  would harm a specific interest Congress sought to protect in enacting the exemption. The
  Court also concluded, “…when information is obtained under duress, the Government’s
  interest is in ensuring its continued reliability; when that information is volunteered, the
  Government’s interest is in ensuring its continued availability.” The Critical Mass test is still
  employed by Courts.
• National Labor Review Board v. Sears, Roebuck and Co. (1975). Department store Sears
  requested memoranda regarding unfair labor practices from the National Labor Review
  Board (“NLRB”). NLRB’s General Counsel maintained that the memos were not final and
  were interagency memos withheld under Exemption 5. The Supreme Court held that
  Exemption 5 applies to documents that normally would not be available to the adverse
  party during civil discovery. They recognized that the purpose of the exemption was to pre-
  vent injury to agency decisions. Thus, a distinction must be made between pre-decisional
  communications (privileged) and communications designed to explain the decision after
  it is made (not privileged). The Court additionally held that exemption 5 “can never”
  apply to final decisions but that it does apply to attorney prepared memoranda written
606                                       RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




        in anticipation of litigation that explains the attorney’s theory of the case and litigation
        strategy. Sears is also cited for the Court’s statement of what the FOIA requires, namely
        “The Act does not compel agencies to write opinions in cases in which they would not
        otherwise be required to do so. It only requires disclosure of certain documents which the
        law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has decided for its own reasons to
        create.” Sears continues to provide necessary guidance on one of FOIA’s most employed
        exemptions.
      • Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency (1976). In 1975, several media outlets reported that
        the United States government was conducting a secret operation that involved a large
        research vessel—the Hughes Glomar Explorer. Subsequently, reports also began to surface
        accusing the CIA of pressuring reporters not to write about the Explorer. Journalist Harriet
        Ann Phillippi filed a FOIA seeking documents concerning alleged CIA efforts to discourage
        reporting on a sunken Soviet submarine. The CIA denied her request on two grounds.
        First, they claimed any records involving the Explorer would be classified. Second, they
        argued that the existence or non-existence of the records “would relate to information
        pertaining to intelligence sources and methods which the Director of Central Intelligence
        has the responsibility to protect from unauthorized disclosure.” The case then became
        about whether it is permissible for agencies to refuse to deny or confirm the presence of
        records under the FOIA. The D.C. Court of Appeals held that they could. As a result of this
        case, the terms “glomarize” and “Glomar response” now refer to cases where an agency
        declines to deny or confirm the existence of records.
      • Department of the Air Force v. Rose (1976). Law review editors sought summaries of the
        United States Air Force Academy’s Honors and Ethics hearings. While the hearings were
        confidential, the summaries were posted on Air Force Academy bulletin boards and distrib-
        uted to Air Force Academy faculty and officials. For discretion cases and cases where the
        cadet was not guilty, names were withheld. For cases where the cadet was guilty, names
        were disclosed but only after he or she had left the Academy. The Air Force withheld the
        summaries by invoking Exemptions 2 and 6. The Supreme Court held that exemptions
        must be construed narrowly. They explained that Exemption 2 generally does not apply
        to matters involving an important or genuine public interest. In this case, the public has a
        “substantial concern” with the discipline and procedures that affect Air Force training. The
        Court also held that Exemption 6 does not create a blanket exemption for personnel files.
        In order to justify withholding, agencies must demonstrate that disclosure would constitute
        “a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” The concept of narrow interpretation
        of exemptions is the basis for Courts’ analysis of exemptions.
      • Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (1980). During his tenures as
        the President’s National Security Affairs Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s
        secretaries monitored and transcribed his phone conversations. The notes were moved
        from Kissinger’s office at the Department of State to a private estate before he donated
        them to the Library of Congress. The donation was subject to a restriction on public access
        to the notes for a specific period. A reporter filed a FOIA request when the notes were still
        at the State Department. The State Department declined the request on three grounds.
        First, some of the requested notes were made when Kissinger was serving as a Presidential
        assistant and were not subject to the FOIA. Second, the requested notes from his Secretary
        of State post were not agency records. Third, the notes’ location at the Library of Congress
A CASE STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES                                                                    607




   terminated the State Department’s custody and control. The Supreme Court held that the
   Executive Office of the President is not the same thing as the Office of the President. The
   immediate advisers within the Office of the President are not subject to the FOIA. The
   Court also held that an agency’s failure to sue a third party for records is not the same as
   withholding. This case was the first of many that clearly delineated who in the Presidential
   offices was subject to the FOIA.
 • United States Department of Justice v. Landano (1993). Landano filed a FOIA with the FBI
   seeking information related to his murder conviction. The FBI denied his request, stating
   the information was protected under exemption 7(D). The Supreme Court held that the
   government was not entitled to a presumption that all sources supplying information in a
   criminal investigation are confidential within the meaning of 7(D). A source is only confiden-
   tial if information is given with the understanding that the FBI will not divulge the source’s
   identity unless required for law enforcement purposes. Moreover, only a narrow set of cir-
   cumstances can be the basis for inferring confidentiality including the nature of the crime,
   the source’s relation to the crime and whether the source was paid. Landano remains highly
   relevant for suits involving the withholding of documents for law enforcement purposes.
 • Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T (2011). AT&T participated in a FCC program
   related to enhancing school access to telecommunications and information services. AT&T
   admitted that they might have overcharged the government for this program. The FCC
   investigated and the parties resolved the matter with a $500,000 settlement. CompTel, a
   trade association that represents some of AT&T’s competitors, filed a FOIA for “all plead-
   ings and correspondence” in the case. The FCC’s Investigation Bureau insisted that some
   of the documents were protected from disclosure under Exemptions 4 and 7(C) (for indi-
   viduals within AT&T but not the corporation itself). The Supreme Court held that corpora-
   tions do not have “personal privacy” for the purposes of Exemption 7(C). In another case,
   the Supreme Court held that a corporation was indeed a “person” for political contribution
   purposes. FCC v. AT&T prevented this holding from being applied to FOIA.
 • Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Federal Election Commission (FEC)
   (2013). CREW submitted a FOIA request to the FEC and, through conversations, agreed
   to exclude some categories of documents. Two months later, CREW had not received
   any documents or a more specific statement regarding what the FEC would produce or
   where it would claim exemptions. CREW filed suit in District Court alleging that the FEC
   failed to respond in a timely fashion to their requests and that the agency was wrongfully
   withholding records. A month later, the FEC gave CREW 835 pages. A letter accompanied
   the disclosures that stated the FEC was continuing to process their request and CREW
   would receive more records on a rolling basis. The letter also stated that this was not a final
   agency decision and was, therefore, not subject to appeal. The Court of Appeals held that
   for an agency to make a “determination” within the statutory timelines, thus triggering
   administrative exhaustion, they do not need to produce the documents. However, “the
   agency must at least indicate within the relevant time period the scope of the documents
   it will produce and the exemptions it will claim with respect to any withheld documents.”
   CREW v. FEC was the first case to detail exactly what an agency is required to do within the
   20-day limit provided in the FOIA.471
 • Milner v. Department of the Navy (2011). A Puget Sound resident submitted a FOIA
   request to the Navy for all Explosive Safety Quantity Distance information related to Indian
608                                    RIGHT TO INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT




      Island, a base in the Sound. The Navy refused to disclose data, invoking Exemption 2, and
      stating such a disclosure would “threaten the security of the base and surrounding commu-
      nity.” The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that, “Exemption 2, consistent with the plain
      meaning of the term ‘personnel rules and practices,’ encompasses only records relating
      to issues of employee relations and human resources.” As mentioned previously, agency
      invocation of Exemption 2 dropped significantly after Milner. 472
